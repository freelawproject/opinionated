On August 12, 1958, they entered into a written \u201cBuilder\u2019s Contract\u201d with Cizek under the terms of which Cizek agreed to construct thereon three stores with two apartments above them and to convert an existing beauty shop into two apartments \u201cas Per Plans and Specifications\u201d and to furnish all necessary labor and materials in connection therewith for the sum of $27,500 which plaintiffs agreed to pay. The above contract contained provisions governing alterations, additions and omissions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>requirement of the Bank which was financing the work, Cizek and United furnished a performance bond in the sum of $27,500. Plaintiffs thereupon obtained a $30,000 loan from the bank, $2,500 of which was paid to them forthwith, the balance thereof to be disbursed by the lender in specified progress payments. However neither the contract nor the bond was filed in the office of the county recorder (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1185.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Cizek began work about September 3, 1958, and abandoned the job about March 24, 1959. During these seven months plaintiffs requested many additions to the original plans and specifications and made arrangements with Cizek for deviations therefrom. Nevertheless the valuation of these changes and extra work was never agreed upon in writing by the parties as specified by the contract. (See footnote 2, <em>ante.) </em>By March 27, 1959, four progress payments of $5,500 each had been made to Cizek by the Bank. However Cizek owed substantial sums of money to his subcontractors and materialmen who during May and June 1959 filed claims of lien against plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On July 16, 1959, plaintiffs commenced the instant action against Cizek, United and a number of the above lien claimants, alleging the existence of a controversy among all the parties to the action as to their legal rights and duties under the contract and the bond. The core of the dispute as alleged in the complaint is this: Plaintiffs claimed that they owed Cizek $5,500; Cizek claimed that they owed him $19,857.14 of which $15,739.14 was for extras; plaintiffs claimed that the $19,857.14 was for work and materials called for by the contract ; United claimed it was not required by its bond to pay the lien claimants and complete the construction work; and plaintiffs claimed a credit for work not completed by Cizek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the amount thereof being in dispute. Plaintiffs further alleged that their property was threatened with the foreclosure of the various liens filed by the lien claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Cizek filed an answer admitting that he had executed the builder\u2019s contract but alleging that it had been abandoned by the parties as the result of the numerous alterations and deviations from the plans and specifications. In addition, he filed a cross-complaint seeking recovery of the above sum of $19,857.14 and the foreclosure of his contractor\u2019s lien theretofore filed for such amount. The theory of both the answer and the cross-complaint is that the written contract had been abandoned and therefore did not define the rights of the parties; that the total claims against the property amounted to $43,257.14 which included a reasonable overhead and profit for Cizek in the sum of $2,448.52; and that plaintiff having paid Cizek $23,400, the balance of $19,857.14 was due. As we point out <em>infra, </em>this concept of the reasonable value of the work and materials is echoed in the court\u2019s findings, despite the fact that the court found that the written contract was <em>not </em>abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">United filed a separate answer denying all liability to plaintiffs and asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the alteration and modification of the builder\u2019s contract by plaintiffs and Cizek without United\u2019s consent had released the surety from any obligations under the performance bond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The trial court made copious and detailed findings of fact. So far as is here pertinent the court found: that the \u201cBuilder\u2019s Contract\u201d was a valid contract under which the parties thereto intended that there would be changes and additions to work for which a reasonable amount would be paid in addition to the contract price; that after the commencement of the work, some changes, additions and alterations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>plans and specifications were made by plaintiffs and Cizek without the actual knowledge of United or the Bank but that they were not of such a nature as to be material or substantial, being in the nature of amendments to the original plans; that the plaintiffs and Cizek therefore had not abandoned the written contract and that United was liable on its performance bond; and that some of the work, labor and materials supplied and done by Cizek was not done in a substantially good and workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The court further found: that the unpaid bills of four of the defendant lien claimants amounted to $11,029.54; that the total cost of the work was $42,668.45<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ; that the reasonable cost of the work was $38,168.45<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ; and that plaintiffs \u201cshould be entitled to a credit or offset from the said total cost of construction in the sum of $4,500.00.\u201d The last \u201cfinding\u201d as well as several other related \u201cfindings\u201d on which we shall comment are actually conclusions of law. The court found that \u201cit would be inequitable\u201d for either Cizek or plaintiffs to pay the full amount of the $11,029.54 due lien claimants but that $1,359.40<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thereof should be paid by Cizek and the balance of $9,670.14 ($11,029.54 less $1,359.40) should be paid by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The court concluded<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that all of the defendant lien claimants were entitled to a judgment of foreclosure against plaintiffs\u2019 property and a money judgment against Cizek and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>United; that such lien claimants should enforce their judgments of foreclosure <em>first </em>against plaintiffs\u2019 property and <em>secondly </em>against Cizek and United if the foreclosure sale \"did not produce sufficient funds to pay the claims in the proportion as explained by us above; that if United were compelled to pay any sums on the proportion found to be the obligation of plaintiffs (namely $9,670.14), it \u201cshould have recourse\u201d for such amount against plaintiffs and Cizek; and that \u201c [pjlaintiffs herein should recover nothing from defendants [and] [d] efendant Frank Cizek should recover nothing from plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We are presented here with two basic questions: First, did the trial court make a proper determination of the rights and duties of plaintiffs and Cizek in the light of the written contract entered into by such parties <em>1 </em>Secondly, did the court make a proper determination of United's liability in the light of the contract bond furnished by it as surety ?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Before we reach the merits of the first question, some preliminary matters require our attention.  An action brought under section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure for declaratory relief is an equitable proceeding and the powers of a court thus invoked are as broad and as extensive as those exercised by such court in any ordinary suit in equity. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 352, 362 [101 P.2d 484] ; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 68, 81 [142 P.2d 289] ; <em>Rolapp </em>v. <em>Federal Building &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 337, 342 [53 P.2d 974] ; <em>Ho Gate Wah </em>v. <em>Fong Wan </em>(1953) 118 Cal.App.2d 159, 165 [257 P.2d 674].)  While the court in a declaratory relief action may properly determine questions as to rights and duties arising out of an existing contract <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Masters Pontiac Co. </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 481, 486 [322 P.2d 592]; see 15 Cal.Jur.2d, Declaratory Relief, \u00a7 71, pp. 225-230), it may not make a new contract for the parties or, in lieu of construing an existing contract, incorporate new obligations into it. <em>(Lyon </em>v. <em>Goss </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 659, 673-674 [123 P.2d 11].)  Its duty is to provide for a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of the purposes intended by the instrument, and not for a modification of its terms. <em>(Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam </em>(1942) 51 Cal.App.2d 696, 699 [125 P.2d 525]; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Flynn </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 91, 96 [229 P.2d 5] ; <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Taliaferro </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 419, 427 [270 P.2d 1036].) We cannot here embrace, as respondents urged upon us at oral argument, a philosophy which contemplates in this kind of proceeding a jural omnipotence unfettered by rules of law.  \u201c [E]quity is bound by rules of law; it is not above the law; it cannot controvert the law.\u201d <em>(Floyd </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1893) 98 Cal. 591, 601 [33 P. 746]; see also <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Fisk </em>(1895) 110 Cal. 107, 112 [42 P. 473].)  \u201cThe general rule is this: Where a contract has been voluntarily, understandingly, and fairly entered into, and is free from fraud, accident, mistake, or any other circumstance recognized as a ground for equitable relief, a court of equity must, when its jurisdiction is properly invoked, give full force and effect to such contract; it cannot ignore, disturb, or alter the rights created by it, or grant relief against their enforcement.  A court of equity cannot . . . make a contract for the parties, nor vary the terms of one made, nor substitute another one therefor, nor can it remedy a wrong by making in effect a contract between the parties with reference to the subject matter. \u2019 \u2019 (30 C.J.S., Equity, \u00a7 62, p. 411.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">With these principles in mind we turn to the findings. As stated above the court found that the builder\u2019s contract was valid and in effect. The contract therefore defined the rights and duties of the parties and among other things determined the amount to which Cizek was entitled for the construction work. The basic price was $27,500. Under the provisions of the contract (see footnote 2, <em>ante) </em>the amount of alterations, additions or omissions to or from the contract, plans or specifications \u201cshall be added to or deducted from the amount of the contract price aforesaid, as the case may be. bv a fair and reasonable valuation. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Our inquiry then narrows to whether or not the trial court determined plaintiffs\u2019 liability for the construction work in accordance with the terms of the contract. Prom our examination of the findings and conclusions, we are convinced that it did not. Essentially, the court based its determination of plaintiffs\u2019 liability on the <em>total cost </em>of the work ($42,668.45). It made a $4,500 adjustment of this figure,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>and thereupon determined the <em>reasonable total cost </em>of the work ($38,168.45). But <em>under the terms of the contract, </em>the amount due from plaintiffs to Oizek was not to be determined by the total cost or total reasonable cost of the work, that is, by totalling all moneys paid out and all unpaid bills (see footnote 4, <em>ante). </em>The amount due was to be determined by taking the basic price of $27,500 plus or minus the reasonable valuation of additions or omissions. In a word, the starting point was the agreed price, not the total cost.  It is almost unnecessary to point out that where a contract provides for a fixed price, the cost to the contractor is immaterial. He may have underbid the job and thus have completed it at a loss.  Thus in the ease before us the reasonable cost of the labor and materials is relevant only on the extras or other deviations.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The court made no finding as to the reasonable value of the extras or as to the reasonable value (net plus or minus) of all changes and deviations. This was a material issue raised by the pleadings<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and set forth by the pretrial conference order as remaining in dispute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead the court made a finding as to the reasonable value of the total cost of construction. This finding was immaterial and necessarily inadequate as a finding of the reasonable value of extras.  It is settled that \u201cfindings are required on all material issues raised by the pleadings and evidence, unless they are waived, and if the court renders judgment without making findings on all material issues, the ease must be reversed.\u201d <em>(James </em>v. <em>Haley </em>(1931) 212 Cal. 142, 147 [297 P. 920]; see also <em>De Burgh </em>v. <em>De Burgh </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 858, 873 [250 P.2d 598] ; <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Hitch </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 309, 312 [294 P.2d 3]; <em>Bertone </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1952) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>111 Cal.App.2d 579, 586 [245 P.2d 29]; <em>Keroff </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 429, 432 [25 Cal.Rptr. 234].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">United argues that the effect of the findings of the trial court is that plaintiffs \u201cwill wind up\u201d paying the contract price of $27,500 plus $15,168.45 for changes, additions and extras<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the findings considered as a whole cover all material issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The general tenor of this argument is that although the court made no <em>express </em>findings as to the reasonable value of the changes and deviations, the amount due from plaintiffs on the contract and the amounts due for changes and deviations, all of these facts can be reasonably <em>implied </em>from the findings which the court did make.  As the court said in <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 634, 640 [226 P.2d 593] : \u201c [W]hile full findings are required upon all material issues a judgment will not be set aside on appeal because of a failure to make an express finding upon an issue if a finding thereon, consistent with the judgment, results by necessary implication from the express findings which are made.\u201d (See also <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Hastie </em>(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 159, 173 [20 Cal.Rptr. 747].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">However the above rule set forth in <em>Richter, supra, </em>is not operative where the appealing party made a written request in the trial court for a specific finding on the issue in controversy. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 634; <em>City of National City </em>v. <em>California Water &amp; Telphone Co. </em>(1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 540, 545 [22 Cal.Rptr. 560]; <em>Ruppert </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 678, 682-683 [28 Cal.Rptr. 467].)  In the instant case, plaintiffs filed detailed objections to the findings of fact and conclusions of law prepared by counsel for Cizek<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>which among other things they asked the court to delete any finding as to the loss sustained by Cizek as being immaterial (findings 19 and 23); and to specify what the contract price was, what amount was due from them for extras and what amounts were allowable to them as credits for omitted or defective work (finding 20).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also objected to a number of findings as conclusions of law and to various conclusions of law themselves. It is obvious, from our examination of the objections, that plaintiffs sought to have the trial court determine their liability according to the terms of the contract, even though it would not have been incumbent upon the court to accept plaintiffs\u2019 figures on valuation. The trial court, however, denied plaintiffs\u2019 objections and requests. Under the mandate of Code of Civil Procedure section 634 we cannot now infer that the court found on the foregoing issues and conclude, as United would have it, that that was the <em>effect </em>of the findings which were made. <em>(Calloway </em>v. <em>Downie </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 348, 352-353 [15 Cal.Rptr. 747] ; <em>City of National City </em>v. <em>California Water &amp; Telephone Co., supra; Ruppert </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra.) </em> Even if we were not under the restraint of the above statute, we doubt that the inference indulged in by defendants could properly be drawn. The findings nowhere intimate that the court was determining the rights and liabilities of the parties according to the contract but rather on a basis which denied recognition of the contract. Under such circumstances the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We turn to examine the court\u2019s determination of United's liability under the contract bond. We will thereafter discuss the relationship of this issue to other issues before us and to our disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The bond is executed by Cizek as principal and United as surety in the sum of $27,500 and runs in favor of plaintiffs and the Bank. It refers to the builder\u2019s contract between plaintiffs and Cizek \u201ca copy of which is or may be hereto annexed\u201d and provides in substance that the condition of the bond is that Cizek shall faithfully perform the work contracted for and shall pay or cause to be paid in full, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>claims of all persons performing labor or furnishing materials in connection with the construction work. By its express terms, it was executed for the purpose of complying with Code of Civil Procedure section 1181 et seq. (liens of mechanics and others upon real property) and inures to the benefit of all persons performing labor and furnishing materials \u201cso as to give such persons a right of action to recover upon this bond in any suit brought to foreclose the liens provided for by the laws of the State of California, or in a separate suit brought on this bond. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The bond thus incorporated by reference the builder\u2019s contract \u201cand thereby all of the provisions of the contract became provisions of the bond as a performance bond. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(C.O. Sparks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Paving Co. </em>(1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 513, 517 [324 P.2d 293] ; <em>W. P. Fuller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Alturas School Dist. </em>(1915) 28 Cal.App. 609, 612-613 [153 P. 743] ; <em>Sunset Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1928) 91 Cal.App. 746, 751 [267 P. 738].)  \u201cA bond which is given for the faithful performance of a contract, to which it refers, binds the surety for labor performed and materials furnished thereunder as completely as though the surety were a party to the contract. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pacific States Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1930) 109 Cal.App. 691, 693-694 [293 P. 812]; <em>C.O. Sparks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Paving Co., supra.) </em> The court found that neither the contract nor the bond was filed in the office of the county recorder. Failure to file the contract did not render the contract wholly void but had the effect of making the owners\u2019 property liable to the lien claimants for the full reasonable value of the labor done or material furnished rather than limiting such liability to the amount due from the owners to the contractor. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1185.1; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>American Surety Co. </em>(1917) 175 Cal. 625, 629 [166 P. 1009], decided under former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1183. )<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\n                   Likewise, failure to so file the bond did not render the bond void or add to the burden of the surety.  The bond itself does not provide that filing with the recorder is a prerequisite to its validity, United does not here so contend, and in any event, the bond is valid as a common-law bond for the benefit of all persons named therein as beneficiaries. <em>(Hammond Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Willis </em>(1915) 171 Cal. 565, 568 [153 P. 947]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Maddox </em>(1925) 72 Cal.App. 705, 709 [238 P. 130], both decided under former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1183.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Prom the foregoing we reach the following conclusions : First, it was the obligation of Cizek and United to pay the lien claimants in full.  Secondly, upon not being paid, the lien claimants were entitled to two remedies: (a) to proceed against plaintiffs\u2019 property for the full amount of their liens (the contract and bond not having been filed) and (b) to proceed to obtain a separate personal judgment in such mechanics\u2019 lien action against Cizek and United as the persons personally liable for their respective debts notwithstanding the lien.  The right to foreclose the lien is not the exclusive remedy; the two remedies are cumulative and may be pursued simultaneously so long as any money collected on the personal judgment is credited on the amount of the lien. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1200; <em>Faucett </em>v. <em>Riveroll </em>(1928) 203 Cal. 438, 440 [264 P. 1098] ; <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Mattox, supra, </em>72 Cal.App. 705, 709; <em>Wm. J. Bettingen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Kerrin </em>(1929) 99 Cal.App. 686, 689-690 [279 P. 163]; <em>Withington </em>v. <em>Shay </em>(1941) 47 Cal.App.2d 68, 77 [117 P.2d 415, 119 P.2d 1]; <em>Adolph </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 198, 200 [5 Cal.Rptr. 212].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The trial court however, while rendering a personal judgment in favor of the lien claimants and against both Cizek and United for the full amount of the unpaid claims and also rendering a judgment of foreclosure against plaintiffs\u2019 property, further directed that the judgment in favor of the lien claimants be satisfied first from a foreclosure of plaintiffs\u2019 property and only if it were not thereby fully satisfied, then to proceed further against Cizek and United.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have concluded that the court erred in issuing the above directive. Since the remedies of the lien claimants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>cumulative and assertibie simultaneously (see authorities supra) the court lacked authority to prescribe additional regulations for their incidence, thereby making plaintiffs\u2019 property primarily liable and placing defendants in a considerably less exposed position of secondary liability.  Furthermore, we think that this error becomes more pronounced when considered in connection with that portion of the judgment which denied all recovery to Cizek. As noted above (see footnote 8, <em>ante) </em>and as discussed <em>infra, </em>the court found that Cizek was not at all times material to the ease a duly licensed contractor and concluded, despite the substantial amount of money due from plaintiffs for the construction work according to the court\u2019s findings, that Cizek should recover nothing from them. It thus appears that by fastening a primary liability on plaintiffs\u2019 property (see footnote 17, <em>ante) </em>the court was in effect permitting the unlicensed contractor to recover indirectly from plaintiffs an amount which the court concluded they \u201cshould equitably pay\u201d towards Cizek\u2019s obligations. In the light of all these circumstances we are of the view that the court did not make a proper determination of the liability of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">This brings us to defendant United\u2019s contention that plaintiffs have not been prejudiced by the errors on which they rely because the trial court committed error in finding: (1) that the alterations, additions and modifications of and to the written contract, plans and specifications were not material and substantial; (2) that the written contract had not been abandoned and United was liable on its contract bond; and (3) that Cizek was not at all times material to the case a duly licensed general contractor. It is to be noted that neither Cizek nor United has appealed from the judgment or any part thereof. Paying lip service to the general rule that a respondent who does not appeal cannot attack error, United nevertheless invokes section 956 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We find no merit in United\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>As to the first two findings mentioned above, the record discloses that they were made on substantially conflicting evidence and defendants are bound thereby. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183].) Suffice it to say that both oral and documentary evidence support these findings. The positions of the parties were in sharp conflict as to whether or not the contract was valid and in effect. Cizek asserted that the contract had been signed merely to obtain a bank loan, that it had been abandoned, and that the true contract was an oral arrangement on a time and materials basis. Throughout the trial defendants attempted to show that the numerous alterations and additions established that the parties had abandoned the contract. Plaintiffs on the other hand testified that they always proceeded according to the contract, that they never entered into a time and materials contract, and that they did not use the written contract merely as a device to obtain a bank loan. The contract itself provided for alterations, additions and omissions; defendant admitted that he and plaintiffs had never discussed abandoning the contract; defendant further testified in his deposition that the building had been built according to the plans. The trial court had before it not only the contract, plans and specifications but also heard extensive testimony descriptive of the work done. The court rejected defendant\u2019s contentions as to the arrangements between the parties and found that the contract was valid and in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As to the third finding complained of, the court found that Cizek was not duly licensed, that this was not known to any of the parties, except Cizek, until the commencement of the instant action, that the work done by Cizek was general contracting, thus requiring that he be duly licensed as a general contractor. It will be recalled that Cizek had filed his own lien against plaintiffs\u2019 property and by cross-complaint sought not only recovery of $19,857.1.4 from plaintiffs but also foreclosure of his lien. The court concluded that Cizek should recover nothing from plaintiffs and entered judgment accordingly. Neither Cizek nor TTnited appealed from the judgment. Thus the foregoing matters pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Cizek\u2019s license and the court\u2019s conclusion that he should recover nothing were finally adjudged. We therefore decline United\u2019s invitation to reexamine the pertinent finding since Cizek could have appealed from the judgment denying him recovery and on such appeal secured a review of the finding now complained of.  The provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 956 on which United relies do not authorize us to review any decision or order from which an appeal might have been taken. (See footnote 18, <em>ante.) </em>Furthermore, it does not appear, nor does United explain, how the above claim dealing with the third finding, <em>even </em>if found to be tenable, would necessarily result in an affirmance of the judgment notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. (See <em>Central Manufacturing Dist., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1960) 176 Cal.App.2d 850, 857 [1 Cal.Rptr. 733].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Finally United contends that if the judgment is reversed at all, it should be reversed in its entirety. While recognizing the rule that a judgment becomes final as against a nonappealing party despite its reversal on the appeal of other parties, United cites <em>Blache </em>v. <em>Blache </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 531, 538 [233 P.2d 547] for the proposition that \u201cthis rule is not applied where portions of a judgment adverse to a nonappealing party are so interwoven with the whole that appeal from a part affects the other parts; in such a situation the appellate court can reverse the entire judgment if it is necessary to do justice. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The applicable rules are fully set forth in the leading ease of <em>American Enterprise, Inc. </em>v. <em>Van Winkle </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 210, 216-217 [246 P.2d 935] : \u201cThe well recognized rule is that there may be an appeal from a part of a judgment only if that part is severable. [Citations.]  Where portions of a judgment are truly severable, the appellate court is without jurisdiction to consider the parts from which no appeal has been taken. [Citations.]  And the appellate court will consider the portion before it independently of the other parts- [Citations.]  Modification or reversal of the portion of the judgment from which the appeal has been taken has no effect upon the other portions. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u201cThe test of whether a portion of a judgment appealed from is so interwoven with its other provisions as to preclude an independent examination of the part challenged by the appellant is whether the matters or issues embraced therein are the same as, or interdependent upon, the matters or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>issues which have not been attacked. [Citations.]  ' [I]n order to be severable, and therefore appealable, any determination of the issues so settled by the judgment . . . must not affect the determination of the remaining issues whether such judgment on appeal is reversed or affirmed .... Perhaps another way of saying it would be that the judgment is severable when the original determination of those issues by the trial court and reflected in the judgment or any determination which could be made as the result of an appeal cannot affect the determination of the remaining issues of the suit....\u2019 [Citation.] \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We proceed to apply the above rules to the judgment in the instant case. Plaintiffs have appealed only \u201cfrom the provisions of sections numbered 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 of the Judgment . . . .\u201d Paragraph (i.e., section) 1 provides that plaintiffs recover nothing from Cizek. Paragraphs 7 through 13 deal with the foreclosure of the mechanics \u2019 liens, the directions that resort first be had to plaintiffs\u2019 property, the resort secondarily to Cizek and United, and the application of the proceeds of any foreclosure sale, all of which we have discussed <em>supra. </em>(See also footnote 17, <em>ante.) </em>Paragraph 15 provides for United\u2019s right of recovery against plaintiffs and Cizek.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>In toto </em>the foregoing provisions encompass the area of controversy discussed by us above.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The remaining portions of the judgment <em>not </em>appealed from are paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 14. Paragraph 2, already mentioned, provides that Cizek recover nothing from plaintiffs. Under normal circumstances, the provisions of paragraph 2 would appear to be closely interwoven with those of paragraph 1 (that plaintiffs recover nothing from Cizek) since whether either party may recover from the other depends upon a determination of their rights and liabilities according to the terms of the builder\u2019s contract entered into between them and found by the court to be valid and not abandoned. However paragraph 2 of the judgment as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the similar underlying conclusion of law is supported by the court\u2019s finding that Cizek was not a duly licensed contractor. As we have pointed out, Cizek did not appeal from the judgment and this matter has now been finally adjudged. Notably, too, it is United not Cizek which now attempts to elude such final determination.  Nevertheless, since Cizek was thus unlicensed, it is settled that he could not \u201cbring or maintain any action in any court of this State for the collection of compensation . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031 ; <em>Loving &amp; Evans </em>v. <em>Blick </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 603, 609 [204 P.2d 23]; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Weatherholt </em>(1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 34, 41-42 [266 P.2d 185]; <em>Bierman </em>v. <em>Hagstrom Construction Co. </em>(1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 771, 775-777 [1 Cal.Rptr. 826, 82 A.L.R.2d 1424]) including any action to foreclose a contractor\u2019s lien. <em>(Gore </em>v. <em>Witt </em>(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 681, 686 [308 P.2d 770].)  However, although Cizek was found not to hold the required contractor\u2019s license, the foregoing statute and rule of law do not prevent him from offsetting as a defense against sums due the plaintiffs any amounts that would otherwise be due Cizek under his contract. <em>(Marshall </em>v. <em>Von Zumwalt </em>(1953) 120 Cal.App.2d 807, 809-810 [262 P.2d 363]; <em>S &amp; Q Const. Co. </em>v. <em>Palma Ceia Development Organization </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 364, 367 [3 Cal.Rptr. 690] ; <em>Steinwinter </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 34, 38 [6 Cal.Rptr. 496].) The philosophy of these eases permits the unlicensed contractor to assert his counterdemands defensively as it were, to the end of reducing in whole or in part the claims against him but without authorizing an affirmative judgment in the contractor\u2019s favor for an excess. (See <em>Steinwinter </em>v. <em>Maxwell, supra.)</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This result is consistent with the position taken by the courts that despite possible injustice resulting between the parties, they will not \u201clend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>their assistance to a party who seeks compensation for an illegal act.\u201d <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 150 [308 P.2d 713].)  It is clear then that a determination of the issues embraced within those portions of the judgment appealed from would not affect paragraph 2 since for the reasons noted above in no event can Cizek obtain an affirmative judgment allowing him to recover against plaintiffs. <em>(American Enterprise, Inc. </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 210, 217; <em>Blum </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 639, 648 [19 Cal.Rptr. 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Paragraphs 3 through 6 of the judgment grant recovery to the various lien claimants against Cizek and United. Clearly these parts of the judgment are not so interwoven with the parts appealed from as to preclude an independent review of the latter. A redetermination of the obligations between plaintiffs and Cizek does not affect the obligations of Cizek and United to these third-party lien claimants. Indeed on this appeal the parties appear to agree that such latter obligation exists in the amount set forth in the judgment. (See also footnote 3, <em>ante.) </em> In the same way, paragraph 14 allowing United attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against Cizek is not affected by those parts of the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">We conclude therefore, contrary to United\u2019s contention, that we need not reverse the judgment in its entirety.  The judgment nevertheless must be reversed as to those portions appealed from because the findings of fact relating thereto are inadequate, because findings on material issues relating thereto have not been made, and because the court did not correctly determine the rights and obligations of the parties before us according to the contract and bond.  On remand, the trial court should determine, <em>inter alia, </em>the following: the amount, if any, due Cizek from plaintiffs based on the contract price of $27,500 and allowing for the addition and deduction, as the case may be, of any alterations or deviations in, additions to, or omissions from the contract, plans or specifications; and the amount, if any, due plaintiffs from Cizek for any unworkmanlike performance or other breach of contract on Cizek\u2019s part. As explained <em>supra, </em>the court should allow Cizek an equitable offset for the amount, if any, due him from plaintiffs against any amounts found to be due plaintiffs from him but only to the extent of such latter amounts and not in excess thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The court should also determine the amounts, if any, which plaintiffs have been compelled to pay lien claimants in order to relieve their property from liens filed thereon in connection with unpaid bills of Cizek. (See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Serimian </em>(1926) 198 Cal. 520, 523-524 [246 P. 45].)  Our attention has been called to the fact, not found in the instant record, that plaintiffs may have paid some lien claimants after judgment herein. Because in an action for declaratory relief it is the proper function of the court to make a full disposition of all questions before it (see <em>American Enterprise, Inc. </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, supra, 39 </em>Cal.2d 210, 219) and because we think it is in the interest of justice to all parties, we apprehend no valid reason why on remand the court should not by proper pleading or stipulation filed, receive evidence of any such payments made after judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">As we have explained, those portions of the judgment granting recovery to the lien claimants should permit them to pursue their remedies provided by law without any restrictions thereon. In the event of a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, such judgment in the light of the contract and bond must be given against both Cizek and United.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Except for the reception of evidence on the matter of liens paid after judgment, we find nothing in the record which impels us to order a new trial. The case was fully tried and, with the exception noted, there is no necessity to take further evidence. Under the circumstance it is appropriate to remand the cause -with directions to the trial court to make adequate findings on all issues involved, based on the evidence now before it, and in conformity with the views herein expressed; to draw proper conclusions of law therefrom; and to enter judgment accordingly. (4 Cal.Jur.2d, Appeal and Error, \u00a7 670, pp. 561-562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">It is ordered, therefore, that the judgment be reversed as to those portions thereof appealed from and that the cause be remanded with directions to the trial court to set aside such portions of the judgment and those findings of fact and conclusions of law pertinent thereto; to receive evidence, if any, on the limited issue of liens paid after judgment; and thereupon, having reexamined and redetermined all issues relating to the portions of the judgment appealed from in conformity with the views herein expressed (but without redetermining those issues relating to the portions of the judgment not appealed from), to make and file findings of fact thereon based upon the evidence now before it; to draw proper eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>elusions of law therefrom; and to enter judgment accordingly. Such findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment shall he prepared, signed, filed and entered in the manner provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The judgment is reversed as to those portions thereof appealed from and the cause is remanded to the trial court to proceed with the disposition thereof under the directions and in conformity with the views herein expressed.
