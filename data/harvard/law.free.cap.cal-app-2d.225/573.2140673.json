Shugg makes no claim that United has not fulfilled its obligations to him under its said policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Fidelity\u2019s policy does not describe any specific automobiles and its position is that its policy is limited to Davis Realty Co., Shugg\u2019s employer. Accordingly, it has defended said company throughout the litigation. After all other defendants in the personal injury action had settled out by way of covenants, plaintiffs therein proceded to trial against Davis Realty Co. alone. This resulted in a verdict in favor of Davis. The judgment entered thereon was reversed on appeal. <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co., </em>215 Cal.App.2d 266 [29 Cal.Rptr. 359].) That action is still pending and Fidelity announces that it will continue to defend Davis as its insured. The crucial issue therein is whether Shugg was acting within the course and scope of his employment by Davis Realty Co. at the time and place of the accident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The determinative issue in this action is whether Fidelity had any duty or obligation <em>to Shugg </em>as. an insured under the terms of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The Fidelity Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">The first page lists the \u201cDeclarations.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cItem 1\u201d declares that the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d is \u201cCharles Ringwalt, Esther R. Schwartz, R. P. Sshugg, Herman W. Ross, Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>by Seidkin Dba Davis Realty.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201cAddress\u201d is stated as <em>\u201c5000 </em>Geary Blvd., San Francisco, California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">On the next line below are the words \u201cThe named insured is,\u201d followed by four square spaces. Each of these squares has a separate designation, to wit \u2018 \u2018 Individual, \u201d \u201c Partnership, \u2019 \u2019 \u201cCorporation\u201d and \u201cOther (specify),\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The only square filled in is the one designated as \u201cPartnership.\u201d This one has typed \u201cX\u201d in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Item 1 \u2019 \u2019 concludes with \u2018 \u2018 Business of the named insured is Real Estate Agents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We have concluded as a matter of law that the <em>\u201cNamed </em>Insured\u201d under this policy is the partnership, Davis Realty Co. The question remains as to whether Shugg is nevertheless an \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Insured\u2019 \u2019 under said policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The \u201cInsuring Agreements\u201d are on page 2 of the policy. \u201cI. Coverage A - Bodily Injury Liability\u201d requires Fidelity \u201c [t] o pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury . . . sustained by any person. . . .\u201d This coverage had limits of $100,000 for injury to each person and $300,000 for each accident. The annual premium was $50.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Insuring Agreement II provides that \u201c [w]ith respect to such insurance as is afforded by this policy, the company shall: (a) defend any suit against the insured alleging such injury ... and seeking damages on account thereof....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Insuring Agreement III provides in part that \u201cif the named insured is a partnership, the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 also includes any partner therein but only with respect to his liability <em>as such, </em>...\u201d (Italics added). The plain meaning of this language precludes the appellants\u2019 contention that Shugg was covered as an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Here the liability of Shugg was not the vicarious liability of a partner for the negligence of another person but instead was his own personal primary liability as the driver of the automobile involved in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">An insurer may limit coverage to a partnership\u2019s lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>bility and exclude individual partners and their activities. <em>(National Auto.

Co., </em>172 F.2d 836, 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">By paragraph IY of the \u201cCalifornia Endorsement\u201d attached to the policy it is provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cPartnership as Named Insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201cIf a partnership is named in Item 1 of the Declarations, it is agreed that, As Respects Any Partner Not Named As An Individual In Item 1 Op The Declarations :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201c1. The policy does <em>not </em>apply ... to any automobile owned by or registered in the name of any such partner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201c2. [omitted by us]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">\u201c3. <em>(Except </em>with respect to the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of automobiles) the policy does apply to such partners only while acting within the scope of their duties as such.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">This paragraph is applicable to Shugg, insofar as his being a partner \u201cnot named <em>as an individual </em>in Item 1 of the Declarations.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">However, subparagraph 1 makes it clear that the policy does not apply herein because the automobile he was driving was owned by and registered in the names of himself and his wife.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Moreover, subparagraph <em>3 excludes </em>the \u201coperation or use of automobiles\u201d from the coverage afforded to partners not named as individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">We conclude that Shugg, as an individual, was not covered under the terms and provisions of the Fidelity policy; that Fidelity was not a coinsurer with United; that Fidelity is not required to contribute to the settlement made on behalf of Shugg or for the costs incurred in the defense of Shugg in the Gipson action; and that the complaint cannot be amended under the facts of this controversy to state a cause of action against Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">Shoemaker, P. J., and Taylor, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 13, 1964.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-12\">TJnderlining indicates printed words as distinguished from those that are typewritten.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\">The policy was issued as of February 7, 1957, at which time Davis Realty Co. was a partnership. It was incorporated shortly before the date of the accident but the policy was not changed. Fidelity does not make any contention that the change in entities had any effect upon its liability under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-18\">Appellants have asked us to take judicial notice of the record in the <em>Gipson </em>ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
