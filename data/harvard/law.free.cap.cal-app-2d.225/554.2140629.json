Code, \u00a7 11530), and was committed to the Youth Authority for the term prescribed by law. He appeals from the judgment. The single contention on appeal is that the evidence used to convict him was the product of an illegal search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The following evidence was presented: Police Officer Martin had received information that three girls and two men were engaged in narcotic activities at 133 Roseland, Montebello. On July 28, 1962, at approximately 2:45 a.m., Officer Martin, with two other officers, went to investigate. Officer Martin knocked on the door. A male voice (later identified as defendant) answered \u201cWho is it?\u201d The officer replied, \u201cThe manager.\u201d Defendant asked, \u201cCan\u2019t it wait?\u201d The officer said, \u201cNo, I\u2019d like to speak to you now.\u201d In a few moments, defendant opened the door. Officer Martin observed that there were three women in the room with defendant. He inquired as to the whereabouts of the \u201cother man.\u201d Defendant advised him that no other man was there. Martin then asked defendant, \u201cDo you mind if I take a look?\u201d Defendant said \u201cNo, come on in.\u201d The officer entered, looked around the apartment, but did not find the \u201cother man.\u201d He then asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>defendant and the three girls in the apartment for some identification. Defendant and two of the girls complied with this request. The third girl. Marguerite Chavez, told the officer that her identification was outside in the car. Martin noticed a purse near Miss Chavez. He asked if it belonged to her and if she had some identification in it. She said \u201cYes,\u201d and proceeded to examine the contents of the purse. She then said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not here.\u201d The officer asked \u201cWell, may I see?\u201d She replied \u201cYes.\u201d He then asked if she \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind dumping the contents of the purse on the table.\u201d As she did so, a folded newspaper, a brown manila bag and a handrolled cigarette fell from her purse. The hag, the newspaper and the handrolled cigarette all contained a green, leafy substance, which was determined according to later chemical analysis to be marijuana. Defendant and the three girls were arrested and transported to the police station. A later search of the apartment uncovered various fragments of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It was stipulated that, among the items found, an eye dropper, spoons and needles, upon analysis, disclosed residue of morphine and heroin. Whether these items would have justified a finding of knowledgeable possession of narcotics in the light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Aguilar, </em>223 Cal.App.2d 119 [35 Cal.Rptr. 516], need not be determined since it was also stipulated that a kitchen tablecloth, toothbrush holder, pipe, paper bindle and leather case contained fragments of marijuana. The latter visible particles of marijuana were sufficient quantitatively and qualitatively to warrant the charge of possession of marijuana. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguilar, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Defendant neither testified nor offered evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">A prima facie case was made out that the search and seizure were illegal when it was established that the search was made without a warrant. The prosecution then had the burden of showing proper justification. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haven, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 717 [31 Cal.Rptr. 47, 381 P.2d 927]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton, 60 </em>Cal.2d 740, 744 [36 Cal.Rptr. 433, 388 P.2d 665].)  When the officers went to defendant\u2019s residence it is clear they had no probable cause which would justify an arrest or search of the occupants or of the location. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 516, 520 [319 P.2d 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Our Supreme Court has recently held that \u201cThe right to seek interviews with suspects at their homes [citations] does not include the right to demand that a suspect open his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>door.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>60 Cal.2d 740, 746 [36 Cal.Rptr. 433, 388 P.2d 665].) In the <em>Shelton </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the court held that, since the door to defendant\u2019s apartment was opened by virtue of a wrongful assertion of authority by the police, they could not rely on what they then saw to justify a warrantless arrest and search. Quoting from <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>59 Cal.2d 65, 68 [27 Cal.Rptr. 889, 378 P.2d 113], the court in <em>Shelton </em>stated (at p. 747) : \u201c \u2018There are many reasons other than guilt of a felony why an occupant of an apartment may not wish himself or others present exposed to the immediate view of a stranger, even if the stranger is a police officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shelton, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 740, 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In the instant case Officer Martin did not order the door of the apartment opened as in <em>Shelton, </em>but, through the subterfuge of pretending to be the \u201cmanager\u201d of the apartment, tricked defendant into opening the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The Attorney General argues that \u201cwhile there was present a degree of subterfuge\u201d to get defendant to open the door, such action was thereafter vitiated by defendant\u2019s free consent to the officers\u2019 request \u201cto look for another man\u201d in the apartment; that, once having been lawfully admitted, the officers were entitled to request the identification of the persons with whom they were speaking. Further, that it was reasonable for the officers to request a \u201cdiligent search\u201d for such identification; and, when Miss Chavez, in looking for her identification, emptied the contents of her purse as requested by the officers, the evidence of a crime was reasonably disclosed in the form of the handrolled cigarette which fell from the purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">It is settled that \u201ca search or seizure made pursuant to a valid consent before any illegal police conduct occurs is obviously not a product of illegal conduct. A search and seizure made pursuant to consent secured immediately following an illegal entry or arrest, however, is inextricably bound up with the illegal conduct and cannot be segregated therefrom.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haven, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 719.)  And \u201c... where the right to conduct a search is obtained ostensibly for one purpose it may not be used in reality for another. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 378 [303 P.2d 721].)  Further, it is well established that \u201c... an entry obtained by trickery, stealth or subterfuge renders a search and seizure invalid. [Citations.] \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 378.)  The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>consent to search in the instant case was not only vitiated by the unlawful means employed to get the door to defendant\u2019s apartment open <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shelton, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 740, 746; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 378; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 719) ; but the consent clearly did not authorize the search thereafter conducted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 378.)  The prosecution did not carry its burden of proving that Miss Chavez voluntarily allowed the officers to observe the contents of her purse. We are of the view that the record indicates Miss Chavez emptied the contents of her purse in submission to the unlawful assertion of authority by the officer, not voluntarily. (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>45 Cal.2d 751, 754 [290 P.2d 852].)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Burke, P.
