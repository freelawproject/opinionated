Upon trial on appeal in the circuit court there was a finding of facts and conclusion of law as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>1. The plaintiff is a partnership composed of Thomas F. Huddleston, Charles R. Hubbard, ffm. A. Ragsdale and Ed. Y. Hauss, formed for the purpose of carrying- on business in the state of Ohio, and engaged in business in the city of Cincinnati; that the said firm has been engaged in business since a time prior to the year, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-4\">2. The defendant, John Hagerty, at the time of the bringing of this action, was the auditor of Hamilton county, Ohio, and the defendant, Leo Schott, was at the time the treasurer of Hamilton county, Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">3. The plaintiff made a return for taxation, for the year 1893, ox its personal property, upon a certain printed form, furnished by the county auditor, containing the various items for the return of all moneys, credits, investments, and personal property of every kind subject to taxation under the laws of Ohio, one of which items was known as No. 10, and provided for the average value of all goods and merchandise owned or held as a merchant during the year or part thereof, from the day preceding the second Monday of April, 1893. The plaintiff made a return of its moneys, credits, and property, but returned no property for taxation as a merchant under said item 10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">4. The plaintiff firm was cited to appear before the board of supervisors of the city of Cincinnati, sitting and acting as the city annual board of equalization, on the eleventh day of July, 1893, to show cause why an addition should not be made to the personal return of the plaintiff for the said year 1893. On said July 11, 1893, Mr. Charles R. Hubbard, one of the members of said firm, in response to the said citation, appeared before the said board, and was examined by the said board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u25a0with reference to the business of the said firm, and his testimony so given was the only evidence presented to the said board on the hearing of such citation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-4\">5. The evidence, and the only evidence, submitted to the board, was this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">The said firm of Huddleston, Hubbard &amp; Company was engaged in the live stock commission business in the city of Cincinnati, and had its place of business at the stock yards in said city. The business of the plaintiff was required to be transacted at or near the stockyards. The Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company is an incorporated company under the laws of Ohio, for the purpose of handling live stock and yarding the same. It is not engaged in the business of buying live stock and selling the same, either on its own account or on commission. Its business consists of feeding, yarding, and holding the stock for others, and it is near their yards where the business of the plaintiff is conducted. The owners of live stock within the states of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Tennessee, in certain cases, send their live stock to the city of Cincinnati to be sold for them. In some cases, the owners bring the live stock, while, in other cases, the owners do not do so, but consign the live stock, as hereinafter set forth. When the owners come with their stock and arrive with it, it is taken in charge by the employes of the Cincinnati Stock Yards Company, as aforesaid, and placed in their yards by the said employes. The owner then goes to the office of the plaintiff, and notifies the plaintiff of the arrival of the stock, and authorizes the plaintiff to sell the stock for him, and deduct a commission and all yardage expenses for feeding, watering and keeping the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>stock, and remitting the balance. The owner accompanies the stock in about sixty per cent, of the sales made by the plaintiff from the stock yards. In the remaining cases, being about forty per cent, of all the sales by the plaintiff from the stock yards, the stock was shipped by the owner, consigned to the Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company, care of Huddleston, Hubbard &amp; Company. When the stock was so consigned, the owner would notify the plaintiff by letter or telegram, advising\u2019 them of the shipping of the stock, and directing them to sell the same at a certain price, and informing them how to remit the proceeds of the sale. In such cases, after the arrival of the stock, the employes of the Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company take charge of the same, and place it in their yards, as hereinbefore set forth, and notify the plaintiff of the arrival of the same. Thereupon, the plaintiff having been notified of their said arrival, in accordance with the instructions of the owner, as hereinbefore set forth, would make the sales of the stock in the same manner as herein-before described. The plaintiff has access to the stock, at all times, by asking the employes of the stock yards company to unlock the gates, which are kept locked to prevent the escape of the stock. The said company is required to deliver the same number of head which it received, upon receiving an order to do so, as hereinafter set forth. When the plaintiff makes a sale of the stock, it orders the Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company to weigh the same, and deliver it to the purchaser, and the Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company comply with the said order of the plaintiff. The plaintiff collects from the purchaser the amount of the sale, and deducts the charges which are due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Cincinnati Stock Yards Company, for feeding, watering, and yarding the stock, and also its commission, and remits the balance to the owner. The .Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company claim a lien on all stock placed in their yards for their charges. Settlements are made by and between the Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company and the plaintiff daily, for the business of the preceding day. Generally, the sales made by the plaintiff of said stock are for cash, or the check of the purchaser. If, however, the plaintiff is entirely convinced of the solvency of the purchaser, credit for a short time is occasionally given. In all cases of sales, upon the direction of the plaintiff, the Cincinnati Union Stock Yards Company delivers the stock to the purchaser, without ascertaining whether plaintiff has collected the money, and, when so delivering the stock, releases any lien or claim it has thereon, and looks to the plaintiff for the same. The plaintiff, in such cases, makes its settlement as is customary on the day following, whether payment has been made or not. In all cases of sales, whenever the plaintiff orders the stockyards company to deliver stock to the purchaser, it is weighed and delivered, and the plaintiff held responsible by the company for the charges. About two-thirds of the business of the plaintiff consists of dealing with stock sent, as aforesaid, from other states other than the state of Ohio. In case the stock so consigned to the stock yards company, in care of the plaintiffs, or that brought to the stock yards company by the owners thereof, was not sold by them (the plaintiffs), the same would then be shipped by said stock yards company, or the owners of the stock, without any direction or control of the plaintiff, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>other markets indicated by the owner or consignor. The only duty conferred upon the plaintiff being to sell said property when consigned to the stock yards company in their care, or when brought by the owner, being to sell the same, if the price could be obtained, pay the charges and their commission, and remit balance of proceeds, as directed, and that, at no time, did plaintiff have any control of said stock while in the possession of the stock yards company. There was no evidence whatever before said board as to the average value of all goods and merchandise owned or held by plaintiff as merchants during the year, or part thereof, ending the day preceding the second Monday of April, 1893, or of the average value of goods, merchandise, or stock owned or held by them as merchants, or sold by them under the conditions hereinbefore stated, which had come to them- from any place within this state, or from any place out of this state, for the purpose of being sold at any place within this state, and no books or papers of said plaintiff were asked for or produced, showing the same, and no inquiry was made by the board of the plaintiffs, or either of them, as to such matters, and no evidence was heard in regard thereto by said board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">6.

But if said plaintiffs were not required to return the same, then said addition was excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">And the court further finds that no evidence was offered to said board on such hearing- as would justify the board in making said addition of $12,000, or any other particular sum, and that no evidence was offered in this court from which it could be determined what addition, if any, ought to have been made to such return by the said board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">As a conclusion of law, from the facts hereinbefore found, the court finds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">1. That section 2740 of the Revised Statutes is a constitutional and valid law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-10\">2.

Nothing herein contained, however, shall prejudice the right of the said board, if such right it has, or the auditor of Hamilton county, or of any other board or officer, on proper proceedings or evidence, to place upon the duplicate the average value of all goods or merchandise owned or held by the plaintiff as merchants during the year, or part thereof, ending the day preceding the second Monday of April, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">It is further ordered that the defendants pay the costs of this action.

It seems to us that counsel for plaintiff entirely overlooks the fact that where a taxing board makes an addition wholly without evidence to sustain it, and in the face of positive evidence to the contrary, that said board thereby commits a leg-al fraud, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>courts of equity will always enjoin the enforcement of the collection.of a tax so illegally imposed. We are not, however, willing to admit that a court of equity will not interfere to prevent the collection of a tax unjustly imposed, even where fraud does not enter into the consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-5\">Defendants in error are not merchants under section 2740. The testimony of all the witnesses for the defendant in error who were engaged in the live stock commission business, viz.: Charles R. Hubbard, R. H. West, Louis Rabbenstein, was, that neither the defendants in error, nor any of the firms engaged in a like business at the Union Stock Yards, had possession of the live stock sold by them, nor was such live stock subject to their control, but that, on the other hand, the same was in the exclusive possession and control of the Union Stock Yards Company of Cincinnati. They further testified that the live stock was not consigned to them for the purpose of being sold, but that the same was consigned to the Union Stock Yards Company, and upon arrival was taken possession of by the Union Stock Yards Company; that they in no manner had any interest in said live stock, but were simply enployed as brokers to sell in other word as auctioneers to sell said property, and were paid for their service a fixed rate of commission, whether the stock so sold was sold at a profit or loss to the owner thereof.

We submit that our Supreme Court has on several occasions had before it the identical question here submitted, and held in each case, that where the board acted without any evidence or knowledge of the' facts to support the addition, that it acted arbitrarily, and that a court of equity would enjoin the collection of a tax so imposed. <em>Fratz </em>v. Mueller, 35 Ohio St., 397; <em>Wagner </em>v. Loomis, 37 Ohio St., 571; <em>Musser, </em>Auditor, v. Adair, 55 Ohio St., 466.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-6\">In view of the fact that section 5848, Revised Statutes, provides a remedy by injunction, and in view of the fact that the Supreme Court of this state has several times passed upon this question, we would consider it an imposition upon the court to cite it to the numerous eases to be found in reports of other states supporting this proposition.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b183-7\">Burket, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIn\">Section 2740, Revised Statutes, was then as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201cEvery person who shall own or have in his possession or subject to his control any personal property within this state, with authority to sell the same, which shall have been purchased either in or out of this state, with a view to being sold at an advanced price or profit, or which shall have been consigned to him from any place out of this state for the purpose of being sold at any place within this state, shall be held tobe a merchant; and when he shall be by this chapter required to make out and deliver to the assessor a statement of his other personal property, he shall state the value of such property appertaining to his business a.s a merchant; and in estimating- the value thereof he shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>take as the criterion the average value of all such articles of personal property which he shall have had from time to time in his possession or under his control during the year next previous to the time of making such statement, if so long he shall have been engaged in business, and if not, then during such time as he shall have been so engaged; and the average shall be made up by taking the amount in value on hand, as nearly as may be, in each month of the next preceding year in which the person making such statement shall have been engaged in business, adding- together such amounts and dividing the aggregate amount thereof by the number of months that the person making the statement may have been in business during the preceding year; provided, that no consignee shall be required to list for taxation the value of any property, the product of this state, which shall have been consigned to him for sale or otherwise, from any place within the state, nor the value of any property consigned to him from any other place for the sole purpose of being stored or forwarded; provided, he shall, in either case, have no interest in such property, or any profit to be derived from its sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u2022 Defendants in error claim that their business as shown in the finding- of facts does not constitute them \u201cmerchants\u201d as that term is defined in said section 2740. The plaintiffs in error claim that defendants in error are merchants within the meaning of that section, and this is the principal controversy in this case. It is, however, claimed by plaintiffs in error, that as the record stands, this point cannot be determined by the courts, for the reason that as the board showed by its record that it added the $12,000 to the return of the do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>fendants in error upon statements made by said defendants in error, and by other evidence brought before the board, and that the board found that the said return was that much below the actual value of the property that should have been returned in said item 10, the said record is conclusive, and that the courts cannot go behind that record and determine whether said addition was made legally or illegally, and that, therefore, the defendants in error have no standing in court to have the question as to whether they were merchants or not judicially determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">That taxing officers and boards are not courts, and do not exercise judicial powers as courts, and that their actions are not judgments, seems so well settled since the case of <em>Musser, </em>Auditor, v. Adair, 55 Ohio St., 466, that nothing more need be said on that question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The valuation placed upon property by a taxing officer or board within the scope of authority conferred by law, when made in good faith, will be held and regarded by\u2019 courts as conclusive of the value, unless it should appear that there was some gross mistake to the prejudice of the taxpayer. But when the complaint is not as to the valuation, but goes. to the extent of claiming that under the statute the taxpayer is notliable to be taxed at all, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, that is that the tax is illegal, then the determination of the taxing officers and boards is only <em>prima </em>facie, and under section 5848, Revised Statutes, full jurisdiction is conferred upon the courts of common pleas and superior courts to enjoin such tax as illegal. All taxes and assessments in this state are levied and assessed by officers and boards subject to the test of legality by the courts, and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>found illegal they will be enjoined. The legal effect of this statute is to protect the rights of the citizens in every case, as completely as if the right of appeal should be given from the taxing officers to the courts direct. The right of the citizen to test the legality of a tax or assessment under section 5848, cannot be taken away by any record that can be made by a taxing officer or board. The right is given to all to have the final test as to the legality in the courts, no matter what record may have been made by the taxing officers and boards. When the power to tax in any'particular case is challenged, the citizen has the right to be heard in court as to the legality of the tax, but when the power to tax is conceded, and the complaint is only as to the valuation, a valuation made in good faith and according to the best judgment of the taxing officer, will not be disturbed by the courts in the absence of gross mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Again, in the case of <em>Gager v. Prout, </em>48 Ohio St., 89, this court held as follows: \u201cProceedings had before a board of equalization cannot be pleaded as an adjudication in bar of proceedings before a county auditor for the correction of returns under the provisions of sections 2781 and 2782, Revised Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">As the proceedings evidenced by the record of the board of equalization are not conclusive as against proceedings by the county auditor for the correction of returns as to the same property, they cannot f&gt;e conclusive as to proceedings in court for the correction of such returns by injunction under section 5848, Revised Statutes, because it is well settled in this state that the proceeding's of a county auditor are not final, but may be inquired into in an action for an injunction under said <em>lqc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tion 5848, and it would indeed be strange if the result of the proceedings of the board of equalization could be overhauled by the county auditor under sections 2781 and 2782, and then his proceedings could be overhauled by the courts under section 5848, but that the proceedings of the board of equalization when attempted to be inquired into by the courts under the same section, would be found to be conclusive. Such inconsistencies and contradictions cannot be tolerated. The proceedings and record of a board of equalization, and the proceedings and record of a county auditor under sections 2781' and 2782, stand upon the same footing, and neither is conclusive when challenged in a proceeding under section 5848. In such proceedings under section 5848 the record of the board of equalization is only <em>prima facie, </em>and upon the trial in court the burden is upon the plaintiff to show by evidence that the tax in question is illegal, and the defendants may show by their evidence that it is legal, and the issue thus made must be decided by the court upon the weight of the evidence as thus introduced by the parties, the record of the board being regarded as <em>prima facie, </em>but not in any sense conclusive. This results from a proper construction of our taxing and procedure statutes, and finds some support in the case of <em>Fratz </em>v. Mueller, 35 Ohio St., 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">It therefore follows that the record of the board in this case does not conclude the defendants in error, and this brings us to the question as to whether or not they were merchants within the meaning of said section 2740. It is clear that the defendants in error did not own the live stock, and that the same was not in their possession, because it was owned by the shippers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>was in the possession of the stock yards company.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Had the defendants in error such control of the live stock as to make them merchants under said section? We think not. When the owners accompanied the stock it went to the stock yards before defendants in error knew of its existence. When the owners did not accompany the stock, it was shipped and consigned by them to the stock yards company, care of defendants in error, and they were notified by letter or wire, and the stock upon arrival was taken in charge at once by the stock yards company without any order from, or control of, defendants in error. The stock being thus in the possession of the company in its yards, whether accompanied by the owners or shipped and consigned by them, the defendants in error had the naked power of sale for the owners as their agents, and to that end had \u201caccess to the stock at all times by asking the employes of the stock yards to unlock the gates which are kept locked to prevent the escape of the stock.\u201d This access was only for the purpose of making sales, and not for any general control. Purchasers would necessarily desire to see and inspect the stock before purchasing, and such access was a necessary part of the sale, and was not a control of the stock within the meaning of the statute; After a sale was made the defendants in error would give an order to the purchaser, and upon presentation of such order, the company would deliver the stock to such purchaser. The order was a part of the sale, and not a control of the stock, and was given only after a sale was made; and what the company did in honoring- the order was done for the purchaser, and not for the brokers. The payment of charges for feeding, watering and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u25a0yarding, and the retaining of commissions, were all after the stock had been sold and disposed of, and did not appertain to the control of the stock. In fact the court finds that \u201cat no time did plaintiffs have any control of said stock while in the possession of the stock yards company.\u2019'</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Again, to bring the defendants in error within the statutory definition of a merchant, it should appear either that they purchased the live stock, or that it was consigned to them. All concede that they did not purchase it, and the finding of facts shows that none of it was consigned to them. The consigmments were to the stock yards company, care of defendants in error. Such a consignment is to the stock yards company, and not to the brokers. The finding of facts shows that in due course of business under such a consignment, the live stock went direct to the company\u2019s yards independent of any order or control from defendants in error, and that such a consignment was regarded and treated by all as a consignment to the stock yards company alone, and we think that in legal effect such was its character.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">With these holdings it follows that the defendants in error were not merchants, and that they were not liable to be taxed as such, and that the tax as to the $12,000 addition to the returns, was illegal. Having arrived at this conclusion, the question as to the constitutionality of section 2740 is immaterial, and we therefore express no opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
