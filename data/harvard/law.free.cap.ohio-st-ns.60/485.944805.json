Upon the trial of the issues joined by the plea of not guilty the record of a civil proceeding under the bastardy act was, against the objection of defendant, admitted to establish his paternity of the child which was alleged to have been neglected by him. The sentence of the police court was affirmed by the court of common pleas and the circuit court, and this petition in error is for the reversal of .the judgments of the three courts for the admission of said evidence. \u201c .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ARu\"><em>T.

Upon the trial the prosecuting attorney offered in evidence the record in a proceeding under the bastardy act instituted upon the complaint of the mother, in which Slavens was adjudged to be the reputed father of the child. This record was excluded by the court on objection by the defendant's counsel, and the prosecuting attorney excepted. The cause is before us upon that exception.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-5\"><em>Henry Bannon, </em>for the exception.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>Noah J.

The judgments offered followed verdicts which might have been lawfully returned upon a mere preponderance of evidence. A \"higher degree of evidence was required to convict under the indictment and the information.
