The legal view is very different. The right to vote is not a natural right, nor is it an absolute or inherent right \u2014 a right that may be reserved in a bill of rights. In this country, the right to vote is derived from the political society\u2014 the government, and is conferred by state constitutions and statutes. It is a right conferred as a means for the perpetuation and for the betterment of the government, and is to be exercised for the public benefit, rather than for the benefit of the individual. The right to vote is not necessary for the protection of one\u2019s person or property, for fe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>males and infants are as much protected in their persons and property as are the electors of the Commonwealth. This right is regulated by the states, and by each state for itself; and the power of the states is perhaps unlimited, except by the fifteenth amendment to the national constitution, which forbids any distinction on account of \u201crace, color or previous condition of servitude.\u201d In some states, contributing to the support of the government, by the payment of taxes, is made a condition precedent to the right to vote; in some states, women are allowed to vote; and so the conditions vary in different states. And the people of the state, in a political sense \u2014 the body politic, are the voters \u2014 those who are entrusted with the political power. McCrary on Elections, 3; <em>State ex rel </em>v. Dillon, 32 Fla., 545; <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Ridgely, </em>41 Mo., 63; <em>Friezleben </em>v. <em>Shallcross, </em>9 Hous. 1, 59, <em>McKune </em>v. Weller, 11 Cal., 49; 16 Alb. Law Journal, 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">In Ohio, the right to vote is conferred by the constitution, upon a class of persons having certain qualifications of citizenship, age, sex and domicile and comprising about one-fifth of our population. (Article V, section 1.) The constitution does not undertake to regulate the exercise of this right, further than to provide that all elections shall be by ballot, that convicted criminals may be excluded from voting, that soldiers and sailors shall not be considered residents of the state where stationed, and that idiots and insane persons shall not vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">Here, now, is the solution of this whole matter. The conduct of elections belongs to the state, and the election officers are not county, township or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>precinct officers, but they are the agencies of the state, appointed and commissioned to conduct the state\u2019s business; and it is the right and duty of the state to adapt its agencies to the differing needs of different localities, just as it does in the valuation of property for taxation. And for convenience, the state provides its agencies in districts \u2014 sometimes adopting counties, or municipalities, or it might subdivide or combine any of these. The adaptation of agencies becomes a matter of locality. Only special laws can be so adapted. General laws could not be adapted to localities, and would not meet the requirements of the situation. In such case, the legislature is called upon to exercise its wisdom and discretion, and its action is not reviewable by the courts. Election laws, so far as they affect the right to vote, are of a general nature; but so far as they only regulate the exercise of that right, they relate to the machinery of government rather than to the protection of rights, and for that reason may be, and generally are, special laws. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Election </em>Comrs., 97 Mich., 188; <em>Comm. </em>v.

By reason, among others, of the tax rate within the corporation being larger than in the townships surrounding the cities, the adjacent territory is filled with factories, railroad shops, and industries of various kinds. Such are the means of - populating these localities, with inhabitants largely transitory and migratory, that by their density many localities are as to numbers and mode of life urban and not rural. Such localities present the same conditions and afford the same opportunities for perpetrating election frauds as exist in large cities, and the same necessity exists there for a stringent election system that exists within the corporate limits of such cities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">The facts above stated are historical facts of common knowledge, of which judicial notice will be taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">But if this were not so, a legal presumption would come into operation in support of the valid-y of the legislation in question, namely: If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>legislative act 'may or may not be valid according to circumstances, courts are bound by the plainest principles of exposition, as well as a just deference to the legislature, to presume the existence of those circumstances, which will support it and give it validity. <em>Willington et </em>al., v.

Such elections are certainly not such as may be secured by the indiscriminate exercise of the right of suffrage, without regard to qualifications or regulations necessary to establish and determine the rights of those who offer to vote. Nor can elections be considered free and equal when in a portion of the state they may be conducted under the law comparatively free from the influence of force and fraud, while in another portion, for the want of more suitable and effective regulations than are provided for the county districts and small cities and villages, the timid and weak are deterred by violence and tumult from attempting to vote, the illegal votes are cast and returned, and legal votes are not counted or not properly and honestly returned. Prom necessity, other and more effectual regulations are required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>in. cities and counties containing a dense and migratory population than are required elsewhere or the majority of the people of the state would probably be willing to adopt.

This section does not confer upon the municipalities described therein any corporate power. It creates a state agency for the conduct of elections therein, based upon peculiar conditions, which do not exist in the strictly rural districts of the state. If, under such circumstances, it is competent for the general assembly to create special election districts, then it is competent for the legislature to describe such districts. We have seen that this court has determined that special taxing districts may be created. So far as this section excepts from its operation \u201ccities of the fourth grade in the first class,\u2019\u2019 it is clearly unobjectionable. The object of providing grades in the different classes of cities, is to authorize legislation which may be necessary or appropriate for a particular grade or grades of a given class of cities which is not needed or appropriate for a different grade or grades of such class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">2. But if either of said exceptions is invalid, because the legislature had no power to make it, the exception alone will be treated as invalid, and the class sustained. <em>The State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Baker et al., </em>55 Ohio St., 1.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-8\">Burket, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APC\">Section 29265, as amended April 16, 1896, 92 O. L., 166, provides among other matters as follows: \u201cIn all such cities of the first and second class, except Mansfield and cities of the fourth grade in the first class, a \u2018 board of elections,\u2019to consist of four electors of such city, of well known intelligence and integrity, two of whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>shall belong to each of the two leading political parties, shall be appointed by the mayor.\u201d As this law excepts the city of Mansfield and the cities of the fourth grade in the first class from its operation, it is not of uniform operation throughout the state, and therefore is in conflict with section 26 of article 2 of the constitution, the subject of elections being one of a general nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It is urged, however, that if this exception makes the act unconstitutional, the exception should be disregarded, and the act held valid as operating uniformly throughout the state. The answer to this is that the court has no law-making power, and cannot extend a statute over territory from which it is excluded by the general assembly. A court can hold a whole act unconstitutional because it is not broad enough, that is, because it is not of uniform operation throughout the state; but it cannot extend an act which is too narrow, so as to take in territory which was left out by the general assembly. In the case of an exception, the general assembly never-enacted the statute in the excepted territory, and the court has no power to enact it therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There is a difference between an exception and a limitation. When a statute upon a subject of a general nature is made to extend to the whole state in one part thereof, and then in another part an attempt is made to limit its operation to territory less than the state, the limitation may be disregarded; because to-give it effect would render the whole statute unconstitutional; and such construction should be given when reasonable, as will uphold the statute rather than one which would defeat it. <em>Burt </em>v. Rattle, 31 Ohio St., 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">As this section, <em>2926b, </em>as passed April 16, 1896, is unconstitutional and inoperative, the repealing-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>section of the act is also inoperative. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. Heffner, 59 Ohio St., 368; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. Smith, 48 Ohio St., 211, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">This leaves section 29266 of the act of April 28, 1890, 87 O. L., 359, in full force. It is urged that that section is also unconstitutional, for the reason that in one sense it operates only in cities, and not in those parts of the state lying outside of such cities. As in shown in <em>Nelson </em>v. State, 52 Ohio St., 88, the act operates, in theory at least, all over the state, because wherever a city may be built up, there the act will be found to be in full force and applicable to such city.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The validity of the section can only be maintained on the doctrine of the classification of cities, and there are some difficulties in the way of so maintaining it. But in view of the condition of the election statutes, and the necessity of more stringent means to prevent fraud, and secure fair elections in cities, and the fact that for more than forty years elections in cities have been conducted differently from those in rural districts, the one employing members of the council, and the other township trustees, we are constrained to hold the act of 1890 with its classification applicable to cities, as a valid enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">But | while such classification when applied to cities may be thus upheld, there is no authority for the classification of counties as to elections. As to subjects of a general nature, laws must have uniform operation, and they cannot be made to operate in some counties and be .excluded from others. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bargus, </em>53 Ohio St., 94; <em>Hixson </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>54 Ohio St., 470; <em>Mott </em>v. Hubbard, 59 Ohio St., 199; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>State, </em>6 Ohio St., 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>It is urged, that as a board of education in a \u25a0city may exercise its powers and perform its duties in territory outside of the city which is attached to the city district for school purposes, the city board of elections should in like manner be permitted to exercise its powers in territory outside of the city. The two eases are not parallel. The limits of the city and of the school district are not necessarily the same, and in fact usually are different. But the board of education is always confined in the exercise of its powers and performance of its duties to the school district, and it does not go outside-of the district and assume jurisdiction in outside territory. The statute, 93 O. L., 367, which provides that the. outlying election precincts shall be held and deemed as election precincts of the city, does not have the effect of bringing such outlying precincts within the city limits, and cannot make them a part of the city; while in school matters, the annexed territory becomes a part of the school district, and^ is embraced within its limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It therefore follows that the holding of the circuit court was right, and that while the city boards of'election may exercise their powers and perform their duties within the city limits, they have no jurisdiction in the territory outside of the city; and that it is the duty of the state supervisor of elections to appoint deputy state supervisors under the statute, for such territory in each county of the state containing a city, to conduct all elections under the laws applicable to such deputy state supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The petition is against the defendants individually, and avers that under the claim that they constitute the board of elections of the city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Cleveland, they are usurping and intruding into the office of appointing registrars, judges, clerks, and other officers and agents of elections. But while the answer avers that boards of election have existed in the city of Cleveland since March, 1891, and that the predecessors of the defendants composed the board, it avers that said defendants, Edward Etzensperger and Edward C. Kinney, were appointed to their present term of office on the third day of June, 1896, and that the defendants, Hugh Bmckley and Charles P. Salen, were appointed to their present term of office on the sixth day of June, 1898. It thus appears that neither one of the defendants has been in his present office for the term of^three years, and that section 6789, Revised Statutes, can afford them no shield as against an action of <em>quo </em>warranto, unless one term of office can be tacked upon another, so that the line of different men holding a certain office under a statute, constitute but one officer for that office for the whole time. Such a proposition is not tenable, and is absurd upon its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">A person holds an office and is an officer under and by virtue of his election or appointment and the commission he holds, and the officer did not become such earlier than' his- induction into office under his present commission. The statute of limitations says that an action shall not be brought against an officer to oust him from his office, unless within the three years after the cause of such ouster or the right to hold office, arose. \u201cHis office\u201d means his present office under his present commission, and not an old expired term in the same office under a former election or appointment. He could not be ousted from such former term of office, because the term has expired and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>is not now in office under that term, and is not now an officer under that term. If it were otherwise the statute of limitations would run, not in favor of the officer, but in favor of the office, and after three years the constitutionality of the statute creating an office could not be questioned. The right of the people to protect themselves against unconstitutional laws.would thus become barred within three years after the passage of an act creating an office.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The statute of limitations in question applies expressly to the officer and not to the office, and when the office is in conflict with the constitution this statute does not prevent the court from so declaring.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">It is urged that while the members of the board have not been in office under their present terms for three years that the same board of elections has been in existence more than three years, and that therefore the board cannot be ousted. This is not sound, for the reason that the statute is by its express terms for the protection only of officers, and says nothing about the ouster of \u2019 the board of election or other boards. The board of elections is not an officer, but the men composing the board are the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The demurrer to the second defense was therefore properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
