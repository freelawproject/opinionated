The petition alleges a total loss of the property by fire while the policy was in force, due proof of the loss as required by the policy, and refusal of the defendant to pay. The answer sets up several defenses, only one of which is important as the case is here presented. That defense, in substance is, that the parties had not agreed on the amount of the loss, nor had it been ascertained .or determined by appraisers; and, that the plaintiff had not demanded an appraisement, but had refused a demand therefor by the defendant. The provisions of the policy on which that defense is based are, that if the parties differ as to the amount of the loss, it is to be determined by appraisers, each party to select one appraiser, \u201cand the two so chosen shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; the appraisers together shall then estimate and appraise the loss, stating separately sound value and damage, and, failing to agree, shall submit the differences to the umpire; and the award in writing of any two shall determine the amount.of such loss. The loss shall not become payable until sixty days after the notice, ascertainment, estimate and satisfactory proof of the loss herein required have been received by this company, including an award by appraisers, when appraisal has been required. No suit or action on this policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity, until after full compliance by the insured with all the foregoing requirements, nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">The reply to this defense admits that there was no agreement as to the amount of the loss, nor an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>appraisal thereof, and avers that \u201cthe reason therefor was and is, that the defendant, through its duly authorized agents, F. L. Parsons and May-berry &amp; McCrackin, informed the plaintiff that the defendant would pay no part of said loss for the reason that plaintiff had burned her own property; that said defendant never in any manner proposed that an appraisal be had, or in any manner required an appraisal, and at all times refused to pay said loss, specifying as the only reason for such refusal that she had set fire to said property.\u201d The reply further avers \u201cthat said defendant company never in any manner selected an appraiser, or informed plaintiff that it desired an appraisal; and waived all proofs of loss, conditions precedent and subsequent to be performed by plaintiff under said policy. And further replying the plaintiff denies each and every other allegation set forth in-said defense.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">The only evidence offered on the trial, which it. is claimed tended to prove a demand by the defendant for an appraisement of the loss, is contained in the two following written \u2018communications.

In fact, no one except the author thereof, and those previously informed of the buried meaning, would ever think of giving that portion of the communications the interpretation contended for by plaintiff m error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-5\">But when it makes the alleged demand for an appraisal- \u2014 that portion of the communication on which it intended to rest its defense \u2014 it surrounds that demand on all sides with denials of the representations made by insured in her proof of loss, with an expertness and a degree of care that is worthy of a better cause; and is absolutely silent as to a reference of any provision of the policy which might give the unsuspecting reader a clew to the translation. If they were really intended to contain a demand for an appraisal, it would have been just as easy \u2014and very much fairer \u2014 to ask for it in so many words, instead of enshrouding it in mystery. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Ins. </em>Co., 134 Pa.

St., 579.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b542-6\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arb\">The effect of the charge for which the .judgment of the trial court was reversed, obviously was to preclude a recovery by the plaintiff, if the jury should find that she had failed to make demand for an ascertainment of the loss by an award of appraisers, and select a competent person to act as an appraiser, unless the defendant waived that mode of ascertainment, in some other way than by its failure to request an appraisement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>And that purport of the charge is defended by counsel for the plaintiff in error, on the ground that the policy sued on makes such demand by the plaintiff a condition precedent to the right to bring and maintain the suit.' The stipulations of the .policy to which that operation is ascribed, are those contained in the statement of the case, and especially those which provide that \u201cthe loss shall not become payable until sixty days after notice, .ascertainment, estimate and satisfactory proof of loss herein required have been received by this company, including an award by appraisers when appraisal has been required;\u201d and that no suit on the policy for any claim shall be sustainable \u201cuntil after full compliance by the insured with all of the foregoing requirements.\u201d While the policy undoubtedly confers on either party the right to call for an ascertainment of the loss by appraisers, when the parties are unable to agree upon the amount, it does not itself constitute an arbitration bond, binding them unconditionally to a submission of the loss to the judgment of. appraisers. Whether that method of determining the loss shall be resorted to, is optional with the parties, either of whom may, by demand on the other, require that it be pursued; ancl when so required, no suit can be maintained until the award of the appraisers has been furnished. But the provisions of the policy in this respect do not execute themselves. The party who elects to invoke that mode of proceeding must notify the other, and request the selection of appraisers. Then, the agreement of submission follows. If neither party chooses to request the appraisement, the right of the other to pursue the ordinary legal remedies is unaffected. \u201cA eondi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tion in a policy of insurance providing for an arbitration in case the parties cannot agree as to the amount of loss, cannot operate to deprive the assured of his right of action, unless clearly made a condition precedent to the existence of such right. \u201d <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. Pulver, 126 Ill., 331; <em>Sergent </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Co., 155 N. Y., 349-355; <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Co., 137 N. Y., 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">It will be observed that this policy imposes no obligation on the assured to furnish an award of appraisers, except \u201cwhen appraisal has been required.\u201d That requirement certainly should be made within a reasonable time'after proof of loss; and if not so made before suit, is no obstacle to the maintenance of the action. In other words, a demand by the insurer for an appraisal within a reasonable time after proof of the loss has been furnished, is, under such a policy, a condition precedent to the right to require the insured to furnish an award of appraisers. This appears to be the construction placed upon such policies in numerous cases, and sustained by the great weight of authority. In <em>Lesure Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Co., 101 Iowa, 514, it was held that \u201cprovisions in a policy that an appraisal by arbitrators shall be made, if tliere is a disagreement as to the loss; that the loss shall not be payable until sixty days after notice and satisfactory proofs of loss have been given, including\u2019 an award by appraisers when the appraisal shall be required; and that no action on the policy can be maintained without \u2018a full compliance by the insured with all the foregoing requirements\u2019 \u2014 do not make an appraisal a condition precedent to the right to sue, where the company makes no demand therefor.\u201d The same construction was placed upon like pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ieies in the following, and other cases: <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>(Indiana), 42 N. E. Rep., 286); <em>Home etc. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>106 Mich., 236; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Assurance Co., </em>47 Pac. R., 436. In <em>Sun Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Crist, </em>(Ky.), 39 S. W. Rep., 837, the court held that: \u201cThe insured need not plead or prove performance of the provision for arbitration in a fire policy, it being the duty of the company to propose arbitration in case of disagreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The charge of the trial court was in conflict with the established construction of policies like that involved in this case, and was, we think, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">It is contended, however, that the error in the charge was not prejudicial to the plaintiff, because the notice of January 3, 1896,\" and letter of February 21,1896, set out in the statement of the ease, contain a demand by the defendant for an appraisal of the plaintiff\u2019s loss, substantially in accordance with the policy. It is not claimed that either of those documents contains such a demand in terms, but only that one may be inferred therefrom. To be of any avail the demand must be made in good faith, within a reasonable time after proof of the loss has been furnished, and in such direct and explicit terms that a person of ordinary intelligence would fairly understand and be informed that the insurer requests a submission to appraisers for the ascertainment of the loss; and, when it is claimed the demand was made in writing, the instrument, if ambiguous, will be construed most strongly against the insurer, for the reason that the companjT- has the opportunity of making its meaning clear and unequivocal. The onty language in either of the documents referred to which counsel claim to be equivalent to a demand for an appraisal, is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>contained in the first one, by which the insured is directed to. protect the property from further damage, and preserve all that remains, \u201cuntil the loss thereon has been determined in the manner stipulated for in said policy;\u201d and that of the other, in which she was informed that the company would not pay any amount claimed until \u201csixty days after the amount of the loss or damage has been determined in the manner stipulated in said policy, \u201d It seems evident that neither of these stat\u00e9ments amounts, by any proper construction, to a present demand for an appraisal of the plaintiff\u2019s loss; nor can such demand be fairly extracted from either or both .of the instruments as a whole. By the first one the adjuster simply gave directions to the insured for the care of the property, and for an inventory required preliminary to an adjustment; and the other is wholly made up of objections to the proof of loss furnished, coupled with the information that the loss would not be paid \u201cbefore the expiration of sixty days after it should be determined;\u201d but there is no request to have the loss determined by appraisers. We therefore concur in the holding of the circuit court that neither of the documents mentioned constituted a demand for an appraisal, and the error in the charge was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
