All parties in interest were made defendants and they answered, in which denial was made, that the said Act of 1925 was effective to repeal the Act of 1917. It was averred in the answer that Chapter 467 of the said Acts.of 1925 \u201cis obnoxious to that part of Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution which provides, 'No bill shall become law, which embraces more than one subject, that subject to be expressed in the caption,\u2019 Also this further provision. \u2018All acts which repeal, revive or amend former laws, shall recite in their caption or otherwise, the title or substance of the law repealed, revived or amended. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The defendants further say that the Act of 1925 is violative 'of Section 8, Article 11, of the Constitution of Tennessee. The contention is also made that the Private Acts of 1925 was repealed by Chapter 78 of the Private Acts of 1929, Extraordinary Session, and thus revived the Private Act of 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Chancellor sustained the contention of the defendants and entered a declaratory decree holding (1) that the Private Act of 1925 was unconstitutional in that \u2018 \u2018 the said Act, while purporting to be a repealing Act does not, neither in its caption or otherwise, recite the title nor substance of any law which the said Act undertakes to repeal,\u201d and that it is \u201ccontrary to and in conflict with the provisions of the general law, Code Section 2514\u201d; (2) \u201cthat Private Chapter 707, Acts of 1947, is valid and effective for the purposes set out in said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Act as an amendment to Private Chapter 153, Acts' of 1917.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The complainant appealed from- this decree and assigned it as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In 1917 the Legislature, by a Private Act, Chapter 153, page 476, created' a special school district in Gibson County, called the \u201cBradford' Special School District.\u201d The Act provided for a Board of Trustees, officers, and methods of elections; the boundaries of the district were established; it provides that all public school property within the district shall become property of the district; school funds shall he allocated to the district; it levies a' tax of thirty cents on each one hundred dollars of property and a poll tax of one dollar, also fixes a basis of tax assessment and for the disbursement of funds.'</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In 1925 the Legislature enacted Chapter 467, Private'Acts of 1925. At the same session the general school law, applicable, of course, to the entire State, was enacted. Pub. Acts 1925, ch. 115. We think the Chancellor was correct in holding that the above mentioned Private Act (1925)'was unconstitutional. While it purports to be a repealing Act and especially of Chapter 153, Private Acts of 1917, it did not repeal anything. The caption of said Act reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\u201cAn Act to abolish all Special School Districts in Gibson County, and to provide for payment of bonds where any have been issued; and to provide for the outstanding indebtedness against certain districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We agree with counsel for defendants that it is a repealing Act or nothing. It cannot-be considered as repealing another Act by implication. The word \u201c abolish \u2019 \u2019 means to \u201crepeal\u201d and no other construction can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>given to it. Tile said Act is in clear violation of' Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution in that it does not recite in its caption the title or substance of any law sought to be repealed, revived or amended.</p>\n<p id=\"AKh\">Moreover, the body of the Act is broader than its caption. Section 2 of the Act purports to repeal <em>\u201cparts of laws creating Special School Districts.\u201d </em>The caption does not name any of the said Acts, except so much of the law levying a tax for the payment of \u201coutstanding bonds and indebtedness,\u201d etc. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The same section provides for the retention of fifteen cents to pay outstanding indebtedness of \u201cKenton Special School District\u201d and ten cents is retained to pay indebtedness of \u201cMason Hall Special School District,\u201d and that the tax money shall be collected by the trustee and paid out by warrant of the Board of Education. The balance of this section relates to the other special school districts, providing for the collection of special taxes in different amounts by the trustee and paid out by the County Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We think the caption of the Act gives no notice that the body contained a legislative provision that any and all bonds of each and every special school district (eight, in number) were to be valid and binding obligations, and that there was a special scheme for the collection of special taxes in each of said districts for special purposes and the taxes from each district to be kept and allocated to each of them and paid out as provided therein. \u201cThe purpose of article 2, section 17, of the [State] Constitution, was to direct the attention of the Legislature to the existing law and the proposed change and thereby prevent improvident legislation.\u201d <em>Mattei </em>v. <em>Clark Hard</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>ware Co., 155 </em>Tenn. 184, 290 S. W. <em>977, 978; State v. Bradt, </em>103 Tenn. 584, 53 S. W. 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">We \u00bfave thus pointed'out several distinct subjects of legislation in the body of the\" Net which are far beyond the scope of the title. We further find that these several provisions of the Act are in conflict with the general school law of the State. Chapter 115, Public Acts of 1925, sec. 33. (Code secs. 2316-2521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><em> </em>In 1929 the Legislature, in extra session, enacted Chapter 78, a Private Act, which amended the Private Act of 1917, by authorizing the use of all special taxes in the \u201cBradford Special School District\u201d to erect a school gymnasium and to pay existing indebtedness after which the said taxes were to revert to and be used as provided in the Act of 1917. One section of this amen-datory Act repealed all laws in conflict with it, which, in our opinion, included the Private Act of 1925 here assailed. So that if the Act of 1917 was ever in any way modified by the Act of 1925 it was revived by the repealing statute of 1929. It seems clear to us that when the general school law was passed in 1925 this special Private Act (enacted at the same session) was thereafter treated as a nullity, as it should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The last assignment of error challenges the correctness of the Chancellor\u2019s decree in holding Chapter 707, Private Acts of 1947, as valid. This Act purports to amend the original Act of 1917 by authorizing the issuance of $50,000.00 in bonds for special school purposes. We find nothing in this Act that is violative of the Constitution. Counsel for appellant fails to suggest any reason for holding the Act unconstitutional and upon full consideration we can conceive of none. We are, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>fore; constrained to agree with the Chancellor that it is a valid Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">All assignments of error are overruled and the Chancellor\u2019s decree is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b728-6\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
