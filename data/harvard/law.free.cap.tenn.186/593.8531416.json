The appeal limits the' question to be determined' as to whether or not, under the terms of the will, the State Inheritance taxes and the Federal Estate taxes were charges against said lands. The Chancellor held that these taxes were charges against said lands, and this appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The will of Mrs. Lillie Jones is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\u201cI, Lillie Jones of Lake County, Tennessee, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do declare this to-be my last will and testament, hereby revoking and making void all other wills by me at any time heretofore made.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">\u201cItem I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\u2022\u25a0\u201cI direct my executor to pay all my just debts as soon as he can conveniently do so after my death.

This is also true as to Federal Estate taxes. By Chapter 109 of the Public Acts of 1943, Federal Estate taxes are prorated equitably among the beneficiaries and persons interested in the estate. The above is true in the absence of a will providing to the contrary. The Chancellor held that these taxes were a charge against the real estate under the terms of the will above set out. We adopt the opinion of the Chancellor as the opinion of this Court, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\u2018 This cause is tried upon the original bill and exhibits, the answer and the exhibits filed in the record, the only issue being the construction of the will of Mrs. Lillie Jones, who departed this life on the 13th day of November, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\u201cThe complainant is the administrator with the will annexed of said estate, while the defendants are some of the beneficiaries named in the will. Other beneficiaries were not made parties as it was unnecessary, their interest not being involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">\u201cIn \u2018Item 1\u2019 of the will it is provided that the executor pay all of the testatrix\u2019s just debts as soon as convenient,\" and these debts are made a charge against the rents arising from lands therein devised to Dr. Thomas James Jones. ... .</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cThe testatrix evidently thought that such ..rents would pay all of her debts, but as a precautionary measure .she provided further'in-said'\u2018Item 1\u2019 that if there should not be sufficient rents from said lands \u2018when <em>needed\u2019 </em>to pay her- debts then she directed, her executor to .pay. said debts by renting, out all of her lands using the rents thereon for the purpose of paying the debts..until they were paid in full. She also provided that if necessary he'-use the rent notes for the purpose of borrowing money to pay said debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\u201cHaving stated that she wished all of her debts to be a charge against the lands devised to Dr. Thomas James Jones and then later providing for the rental of all lands, the Court concludes that she intended to- chargee these debts to Dr. Thomas-James. Jones, but. if they were not sufficient to use- the rents from other- lands and pay these debts. She wished her debts paid profnptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\u201cIf it is necessary under this item' of the will, to'use the rents of other lands to complete the payment ef her debts, then if that is done under both this and later provisions of the will,- I incline- to the opinion: that -She -.desired- the lands devised to Dr;' Thomas James Jones to be continued rented out until sufficient rents had accrued to reimburse, or repay, that used from the rental of the other lands.. \" - . \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u201cIn \u2018Item 2\u2019 she piovides for the sale of-all the other lands. save that devised -to Dr. Thomas Jame's Jones, which sale she directs to be made within two years. Evidently she- thought that with the- -rental due at the. time of her- death -and the' rental accruing' within two' years from all of said-lands, \u2022 a sufficient amount would be -realized.-to pay-all debts;' She still-does-:not- release--the-rents of Dr. Thomas James Jones from the payment of debts, but evidently intended that they should bear these debts.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj_1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>\u2018 </em>\u2018In'this item-she, also directs the converting'of her personal property, as,-\u201cwell as all-other lands save that deyised to Dr. Thomas. James Jones, into cash (within the two years above mentioned) and nses this statement, \u2018 and after payment of all my debts, I direct my executor to pay the following bequests or legacies.\u2019 This to me merely emphasized her desire that her debts be paid promptly and does not release the lands devised to Dr. Thomas James Jones, from the primary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\">\u2018.\u2018In this same item she made certain bequests and these bequests I think she desired paid out of the moneys received from the conversion of her personal property and the.'lands therein ordered sold and they are not a charge against the interest of Dr. Thomas James Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">. <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>Items 3 and 4 \u2019 of the will are not here involved, but the Court is requested to construe\u2018Item 5.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">. \u201cIn this item the testatrix gives and devises to Dr. Thomas James Jones the lands in said item described, they being the.same referred to in \u2018Item 1,\u2019 but she gives it to him subject to the right and power before given her executor to rent out said- lands until her debts have been fully paid, as provided in \u2018Item 1\u2019 of the'will. Thus far there is no conflict or repugnancy between \u2018Item 1\u2019 and \u2018Item 5,\u2019 nor between \u2018Item 2\u2019 and \u2018Items 1 and 5.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\u201cIn the last part of \u2018Item 5\u2019 the testatrix reaffirms, her- desire that the debts owed by her at the time of her death, the cost of administration and charges against the estate \u2018shall be a charge against the said lands disposed, of by this item of'my will,\u2019 that is the same lands referred to, in \u2018Item 1\u2019 and devised to Dr. Thomas James Jones. She states that she does not desire this tract.of land sold to pay the debts and again directs her executor to rent out said lands, not for a period of two years, but for \u2018a sufficient length of time to pay all my debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and tlie taxes on said lands and the upkeep of the same and the costs of the administration of my estate.\u2019 She limits the obligations charged against this tract to those items and I think she meant here to include the inheritance taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\u201cFrom a study of the will in its entirety I am convinced that the testatrix desired to charge the tract of land given Dr. Thomas James Jones with all the debts, taxes, cost of administration (which I think includes the inheritance tax) and all debts and cost of all kinds, and every charge except the special bequests set out in \u2018Item 2.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\u201cI believe that the reason that the provision she made relative to renting out other lands, for not exceeding two years, was in order that the debts and charges above mentioned might be promptly paid all the time desiring that they be a primary charge against the lands of the said Dr. Thomas James Jones and if any of the proceeds of rents from the other lands were used they were to be repaid out of a continu\u00e9d renting of the Dr. Thomas James Jones lands, until it equalized. In other words primarily the Dr. Thomas James Jones lands were to bear the expenses, except the special bequests, which were to be paid from a sale of the personal property and the other lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\u201cHaving reached this conclusion, it necessarily follows that a decree may be submitted accordingly and the costs of this proceeding taxed against the administrator as a part of the cost of administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">We find no error in the decree of the Chancellor and \u25a0 it is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b630-9\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
