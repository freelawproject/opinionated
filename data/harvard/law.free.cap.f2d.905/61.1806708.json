Gilbert\u2019s motion to reconsider was denied, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">At a <em>Spears </em>hearing, Gilbert testified that the sole defendant, prison officer Wise, kicked the door to the food slot of his cell, cutting off the tip of Gilbert\u2019s finger, which was reattached by plastic surgery. Gilbert testified that the officer\u2019s action was intentional. One Jackson, apparently a prison employee, testified that a prison use-of-force-report absolved the officer. \u201c[I]t was not a sustained violation against the officer in that there was a reflexive action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">In her findings, the magistrate relied on a \u201cmedical report\u201d that was not mentioned or otherwise identified at the <em>Spears </em>hearing, but which is included with the record. She also relied on an \u201cinternal affairs report,\u201d apparently the report mentioned by Mr. Jackson, showing that defendant Wise\u2019s action in kicking the slot door closed \u201cwas a reflex, unintentional act.\u201d She assumed for the purposes of the <em>Spears </em>hearing that \u201cthe alleged assault was unwarranted.\u201d Relying on <em>Hines v. Boothe, </em>841 F.2d 623, 624 (5th Cir.1989), the magistrate determined that Gilbert was injured but \u201cit was not a severe injury and he has recovered. There is no indication of malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">This case is one of many held for screening pending a decision in <em>Huguet v. Barnett, </em>900 F.2d 838 (5th Cir.1990). <em>Huguet </em>borrowed the excessive-force-to-arrest standards of the Fourth Amendment, established in <em>Johnson v. Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477 (5th Cir.1989) (en banc), and applied them to an Eighth Amendment use-of-force-to-restrain situation in a prison. The <em>Huguet </em>panel also added the Eighth Amendment wanton-infliction-of-pain factor. <em>Id. </em>at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">After <em>Huguet, </em>in order for a plaintiff to prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim, the plaintiff must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-20\">1. a significant injury, which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-21\">2. resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to the need, the excessiveness of which was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">3. objectively unreasonable, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">4. the action constituted an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Clearly, under this formulation, if the finding that there was no malice is correct, Gilbert cannot prevail. We are troubled by the factual underpinnings of the finding, however, which Gilbert attacks on appeal. Although Fifth Circuit jurisprudence gives broad discretion to district courts in conducting <em>Spears </em>hearings, the use of hearsay witnesses and unauthenticated records to counter the plaintiffs testimony is improper. \u201c[T]he most important consideration in a \u00a7 1915(d) credibility assessment is the inherent plausibility of a prisoner\u2019s allegations based on objective factors ...\u201d <em>Cay v. Estelle, </em>789 F.2d 318, 326 (5th Cir.1986). Gilbert alleged an episode of brutality, an occurrence that was inherently plausible; but the magistrate, relying on the unauthenticated internal affairs report, found an absence of malice. Gilbert\u2019s testimony was to the contrary: \u201cI know it [Wise\u2019s kicking of the door] was intentional. He saw my arm sticking out that bean chute.... the officer was nowhere in the area when I reopened the food slot and the food slot did not hit him. He came back to my cell and kicked it closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The finding cannot stand. We vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Huguet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
