We affirm the judgment entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-17\">The appellee, EMI Medical, Inc. (EMI), developed and markets a device known as the computerized axial tomographic scanner (C.A.T. scanner), a marriage of the computer with the x-ray machine that permits the visualization of tissue structures of the human body in far greater diagnostic detail than is possible with the x-ray machine alone. EMI makes both \u201chead\u201d and \u201cwhole-body\u201d units; both are sold nationwide to hospitals and medical centers (now in competition with several other manufacturers); the whole-body units cost in the neighborhood of $500,000 apiece. The scanners are warranted for one year following their installation. During that year EMI conducts monthly preventive maintenance inspections on them and otherwise services them during regular business hours without charge for parts or labor, charging only for after-hours service. EMI has developed a service organization that installs its scanners and maintains them during the warranty period; when the warranties expire, this organization is available to continue servicing the scanners, for a fee and for profit. The service organization\u2019s several district offices, which together cover the whole country, are supplied with parts and technical support from EMI\u2019s national headquarters in Northbrook, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>In 1976 EMI set up an office in St. Louis, Missouri to install and service its scanners in a district that included parts of Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri. EMI employed technical personnel to perform this work, and accumulated a parts inventory in St. Louis to help expedite the repair of its scanners in the district. One of the service engineers hired was appellant James Duckworth, who began work for EMI in October 1976. While he was with EMI, Duckworth helped install its scanners, helped service them after installation, and supervised service work on them. He also aided EMI\u2019s then district manager, Prank Mortimer, in the sale of post-warranty service contracts to hospitals with EMI scanners. At that time EMI offered its customers only a limited range of post-warranty service arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">Duckworth left EMI\u2019s employ on April 14, 1978. Later the same month he and a friend incorporated Third Party Services, Inc., the other appellant herein, and began to solicit the business of servicing off-warranty C.A.T. scanners, notably EMI scanners, in the St. Louis and surrounding areas. The new business started small: Duckworth and his friend each invested only $250 in it; each continued for a time to hold another job; they secured no bank financing until October 1978; and to begin with they maintained no parts inventory of their own. However, they offered services and service contracts with several advantages over those offered by EMI. Their prices were lower for similar services. Most importantly, they would perform routine maintenance during off hours without charging overtime rates, thus permitting the hospitals to keep their scanners in profitable operation more of the time during regular business hours. They offered a wider range of possible service arrangements than did EMI. Finally, they would shop around for parts, often getting them more cheaply for their customers than would have been possible through EMI. Appellants succeeded in attracting some clients away from EMI\u2019s service organization almost immediately; others came later; and the business grew to include the servicing of C.A.T. scanners made by manufacturers other than EMI, located at medical centers as far away from St. Louis as Kansas City, Missouri (about 250 miles). Nevertheless, by the time of trial (July 16-20, 1979), EMI still occupied some 76% (down from about 95% in April 1978) of what appellants claim is the relevant market for purposes of this case: the market for servicing EMI-made C.A.T. scanners at institutions within a 150-mile radius of downtown St. Louis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">Appellants\u2019 claim at trial was that they were prevented from capturing more of EMI\u2019s business \u2014 and were thus injured in their business or property \u2014 by reason either of EMI\u2019s monopolization or of its attempted monopolization of the allegedly relevant market. The allegedly illegal acts committed by EMI were primarily those of Frank Mortimer, EMI\u2019s St. Louis district manager. When he learned in April or May of 1978 of appellants\u2019 efforts to establish a competing service business, he contacted all his customers with the aim of persuading them to stay with EMI. Among other things, he informed them that EMI\u2019s rates for certain services would be going down, and that EMI would now be offering a wider range of post-warranty service arrangements than formerly; and he made various comparisons between appellants\u2019 abilities to service EMI scanners and EMI\u2019s. After Mortimer contacted his customers, several of them that had expressed an interest in appellants\u2019 services decided to stay with EMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">EMI does not seriously dispute that Mortimer did substantially what appellants say he did. It does challenge appellants\u2019 proof of each other element of both their theories of recovery, including appellants\u2019 market definition, their claim that EMI possessed monopoly power or came dangerously close to possessing such power even in the suspect market, their claim that EMI intended to monopolize the market, and their theory of causation of their alleged injuries. EMI moved for a directed verdict both at the close of appellants\u2019 evidence and at the close of all the evidence. Rulings on these motions were deferred, and rendered moot by the verdict. Nevertheless, EMI has argued on appeal that the judgment should be affirmed for the reason that appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>failed to make a submissible case. Without adopting this view, we will say that upon our review of the record we agree that appellants\u2019 case at trial was tenuous at best. As for the issues raised in this appeal, we find it necessary to consider explicitly only two of the numerous assignments of error brought before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">1. The district court charged the jury at length on both of appellants\u2019 theories of recovery, using for this purpose instructions drawn largely from 3 Devitt and Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 90 (1977). In addition, the court gave several special instructions requested by the parties. Included among these was the following, given over appellants\u2019 objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-5\">The Court instructs the jury that after plaintiffs began competing with it, EMI had the lawful right to compete with plaintiffs in meeting the plaintiffs\u2019 quoted price for services, in offering contracts with comparable terms and in comparing plaintiffs\u2019 ability to service the hospitals\u2019 scanners with EMI\u2019s <em>so long </em>as <em>EMI did not engage in conduct evidencing an intention to obtain or maintain a monopoly in the servicing of scanners. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">Appellants argue that the district court committed reversible error by giving this instruction because, they claim, the instruction misleadingly suggested to the jury that they would have to find that EMI committed acts <em>in addition to or other than </em>those enumerated in the instruction in order to find that EMI intended to obtain or maintain a monopoly in the servicing of scanners. Appellants, citing <em>United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>110 F.Supp. 295 (D.Mass.1953), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>347 U.S. 521, 74 S.Ct. 699, 98 L.Ed. 910 (1954), argue that the very acts mentioned could be used as evidence of illegal monopolization or attempted monopolization, especially when committed by a firm with as much power in the market as that allegedly held by EMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Whatever the merits of the challenged instruction as an abstract statement of the law, a topic that might be long discussed, we cannot find that in the context of the rest of the instructions it was seriously misleading in the way suggested by appellants. The instructions given by the district court on the elements of monopolization and attempted monopolization, which were adapted from 3 Devitt and Blackmar, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 90.27 and 90.29, clearly permitted the jury to find, from the evidence of EMI\u2019s meeting appellants\u2019 quoted prices for services, its offering contracts with comparable terms, and its comparing appellants\u2019 ability to service scanners with EMI\u2019s, that EMI had monopolized or attempted to monopolize the market (assuming adequate proof of the other elements of the charged offenses). Any possible implication in the challenged instruction that only <em>other </em>acts than these could evidence EMI\u2019s wrongful intent was dispelled by the surrounding instructions. It goes without saying that instructions must be read as a whole, and that what is potentially misleading in isolation may not be so in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">2. Prior to trial appellants deposed administrators at two of the hospitals whose business they claimed they had lost because of EMI\u2019s allegedly illegal activities. The testimony of these officials, Mr. Horrall and Mr. Lovett, did not particularly confirm appellants\u2019 theory of causation of their alleged injuries, and appellants did not call either of them to testify at trial; but on the other hand neither did EMI. Instead, EMI had its expert witness read the depositions of Horrall and Lovett prior to trial; and then at trial the following colloquy took place during the direct examination of the expert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-10\">Q [By counsel for EMI] What did you find in the depositions of Steve Horrall and Mr. Lovett with respect to their decision that was made in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-11\">A The two hospitals involved, upon the expiration of the warranty had to decide whether they were going to stay with EMI or accept the offer of Mr. Duckworth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-12\">They considered all aspects of the services offered by the two companies and they decided to stay with EMI in spite of the fact that Mr. Duckworth was offering them a lower price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-13\">Q What was the expressed reason for that in their depositions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>[Counsel for appellants]: Your Hon- or, I\u2019m going to object to this witness being asked to characterize the testimony of \u2014 well, nontestimony &lt;3f other witnesses in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-5\">[Counsel for EMI]: Your Honor, this is an expert witness and he can rely upon the evidence, doesn\u2019t have to be brought into the courtroom, and it wasn\u2019t brought in by [counsel for appellants], but the expert witness can rely on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-6\">[Counsel for appellants]: Your Hon- or, this witness is purporting to tell the jury the reasons that the hospitals have \u2014 I feel that the hospital personnel are the people who are the only ones who can give those reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-7\">[Counsel for EMI]: You chose not to bring them in and this expert is here testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-8\">THE COURT: Well, this \u2014 the expert cannot state what they said because then that becomes hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-9\">[Counsel for EMI]: But he can state\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-11\">THE COURT: But he can state an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-12\">[Counsel for EMI]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-13\">THE COURT: As to the result of what they said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-14\">[Counsel for EMI]: Right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1U\">Q [By counsel for EMI] Do you have an opinion on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-15\">A Yes I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-16\">Q What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-17\">A This may be around the barn but this, there are two kinds of people in the world. There are some people who are willing to take a risk or more risk, and there\u2019s some people take more risk and get a lower price. Other people who are willing to, less willing to accept risk, they are willing to pay money to avoid taking that risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-18\">Both of these hospitals had had experience under the warranty with the EMI scanner and the EMI service. They had had no experience with Mr. Duckworth, his ability to service the machines, his ability to provide parts when needed, so that they chose to pay a higher price and have the certainty associated with EMI during the warranty period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1145-21\">Appellants argue that the district court committed reversible error by permitting EMI\u2019s expert to testify in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-22\">The court properly sustained the objection to the question calling for hearsay, and no hearsay came in in the testimony now in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think that the testimony may nevertheless have been objectionable on the ground that the matter testified to was not a proper subject for expert testimony, even testimony in the form of an opinion. However, it is clear that no timely objection was made stating this or any other ground of objection to the district court\u2019s ruling that EMI\u2019s expert could give his opinion \u201cas to the result\u201d of what Horrall and Lovett said in their depositions, nor was a motion to strike made after the testimony came in. Appellants are therefore precluded by F.R.Evid. 103(a)(1) from predicating error on the court\u2019s ruling or its aftermath. Nor do we find that the ruling amounted to the sort of plain error affecting appellants\u2019 substantial rights that would warrant reversal even though not brought to the attention of the trial court. We note that appellant Duckworth himself testified that the hospitals whose business he solicited had a tendency to be conservative and to scrutinize new businesses such as his very carefully. <em>See </em>Trial Transcript at 194-95. EMI\u2019s expert did not say much more than that in the testimony now objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-23\">We have carefully considered each of the other points raised by appellants. There is no good reason for us to discuss them here, except to say that we find in them, individually and collectively, no sufficient ground for reversal of the judgment. <em>Cf. </em>Rule 14, Rules of the Eighth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">. Appellants withdrew their \u00a7 1 claims before the case went to the jury. Appellee\u2019s counterclaim, alleging tortious interference with its business, unfair competition, and breach of duty as a former employee, was submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict against appellee. No appeal has been taken from the judgment entered on that verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1142-19\">. The Honorable James H.
