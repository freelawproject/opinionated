He appeals its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">A three-time convicted felon free on probation, Maddox was arrested in late 1978 on two new charges of aggravated robbery. In March 1979, he pled guilty to one charge and was assessed a 23-year prison term by a jury. On July 30 of that year he pled guilty to the other charge in exchange for a concurrent 23-year sentence. Probation on his earlier sentences was also revoked at that time. He was sentenced either on July 30, 1979, as the sheriff contends, or on September 21,1979, as Maddox claims. It is undisputed, however, that he was transferred to the Texas prison system about August 16, 1979, and was returned from there to the Dallas County Jail on September 17, about a month later. On September 21, 1979, he was returned to prison to serve out his punishment. His claimed damages arise from his having spent the last half of August and the first half of September 1979 in prison rather than in the Dallas County Jail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claiming deprivation of a \u201cliberty interest,\u201d he sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Maddox has, generally speaking, no fourteenth amendment liberty interest in being imprisoned at one c\u00e1rcel rather than other, even if \u201clife in one is much more disagreeable than in another .... \u201d <em>Meacham v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 2538, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976). The exception is where a defendant possesses some \u201cright or justifiable expectation rooted in state law that he will not be transferred except for misbehavior or upon the occurrence of other specified events.\u201d <em>Montanye v. Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 2547, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976). We agree with the court below that Texas law in general confers no such rights upon persons situated as was Maddox at the time of his transfer-confined prior to their sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At best, it is silent on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">. One might think such a matter de minimis, but the sheriff did not so contend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">. Maddox suggests that as a part of his plea bargain he requested that he be left in Dallas \u201cfor awhile,\u201d as his attorney\u2019s affidavit states, before being transferred to prison. The affidavit does not claim, however, that this request was agreed to by the authorities or that the sheriff was advised of any such agreement. In such circumstances, any expectation by Maddox that he would be retained in Dallas was not a \u201cjustifiable\u201d one; and he was, in fact, left there for over two weeks after his plea was accepted, a period that seems to us \u201cawhile.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
