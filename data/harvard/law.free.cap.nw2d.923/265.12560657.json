Arnold (On Remand)\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 325407). After\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   is decided, the Court of Appeals shall reconsider this case in light of that decision. We further direct the Court of Appeals to consider the challenge to the assessment of points under Offense Variable 13, MCL 777.43, which was raised by the defendant but not addressed by that court during its initial review of this case. In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
