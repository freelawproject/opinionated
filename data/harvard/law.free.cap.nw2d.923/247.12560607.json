The Court of Appeals shall consider whether a defendant's unpreserved claim regarding his or her lack of physical presence at sentencing is subject to review for plain error. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Heller,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12303189\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/316/314/\">\n    316 Mich.App. 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=891%20N.W.2d%20541\">\n    891 N.W.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). We direct the Court of Appeals' attention to the fact that it currently has before it the case of\n   <em>\n    People v. Enciso,\n   </em>\n   --- Mich. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559387,12559388\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/565/\">\n    920 N.W.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), a case we remanded as on leave granted on December 19, 2018. In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining question presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
