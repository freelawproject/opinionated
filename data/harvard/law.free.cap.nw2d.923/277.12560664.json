(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I respectfully dissent from this Court's order denying leave to appeal. In my judgment, the Court of Appeals' decision represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the common law of this state with regard to the duty imposed on landlords. More specifically, the panel's analytical errors improperly render landlords liable for defects in leased premises that arise\n   <em>\n    after the tenants have taken possession of the premises\n   </em>\n   . The duty to discover such defects rests primarily on the premises possessor, i.e., the tenant, rather than the landlord, as the tenant is better situated to discover such defects than the landlord is. Because I believe that the Court of Appeals improperly shifted the duty to discover defects that arise during the tenant's possession of the premises from the tenant to the landlord, I would reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case, plaintiff, Steven Thompson, signed a one-year lease to reside in a home owned by defendant, Ann Gibson. Approximately 10 months after signing the lease, plaintiff was injured while sweeping debris off the back deck of the home, which was within the leased premises. Plaintiff placed his left hand on the rail to sweep the debris off the edge and the rail \"freely gave way.\" In an affidavit, plaintiff averred that the rail was completely detached from the post, had no visible nails, and had a hole where it appeared a nail had once been. Plaintiff did not notice the defect in the rail before the injury occurred, and neither plaintiff nor the previous tenant notified defendant about a problem with the rail. Plaintiff sued for nuisance and also brought a negligence claim under a premises-liability theory. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary disposition on both counts, but the Court of Appeals reversed with respect to the negligence claim.\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Accordingly, defendant's common-law duty to inspect the premises ended when plaintiff signed the lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It appears that this Court has not expressly addressed the inference arising from the leasing of premises concerning whether a landowner possesses constructive notice of a defect. Nevertheless, the implication seems fairly straightforward to me: because a landlord has no duty to inspect when the premises are being leased, the landlord necessarily possesses constructive notice of a defect within the leased premises only if he or she should have known of the defect\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   leasing the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, however, the defect only arose (or became readily apparent)\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   leasing the property, the landlord would not have reason to know of the defect unless by some other means specifically informed of it. To hold otherwise would effectively shift responsibility from those in possession and control of the property (the tenants) to those who no longer have such possession and control, in contradiction of well-established common-law principles. By entering into a leasing agreement, plaintiff accepted primary responsibility for the condition of the property during the term of the lease, which includes the duty to discover and to report to the landlord defects arising during the term of that lease.

However, there is no evidence that the defect existed-let alone would have been apparent upon reasonable inspection-\n   <em>\n    at the time the lease was signed\n   </em>\n   . The defect could have arisen one week earlier, three months earlier, or five years earlier; the\n   jury could only speculate that it had (or had not) arisen and was (or was not) readily apparent\n   <em>\n    ten months\n   </em>\n   before the injury occurred. While the party opposing a motion for summary disposition is entitled to all reasonable inferences that arise from the evidence, it may not defeat such a motion with mere speculation.\n   <em>\n    Bernardoni v. City of Saginaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302802\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/499/470/#p475\">\n    499 Mich. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20N.W.2d%20109\">\n    886 N.W.2d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Accordingly, I would conclude that plaintiff, upon whom the burden of proof clearly rests, has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact that defendant was on constructive notice of the defect that caused plaintiff's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CONSEQUENCES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The common law reflects the practices and common sense of society.
