Appellant argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress because the evidence against him is the fruit of an unlawful search of hotel-registration records. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 14, 2015, police officers requested a guest list from a Bloomington hotel's registration records. A clerk at the hotel's front desk provided the list and told the officers that appellant had recently checked into a room, provided a Pennsylvania identification card, and paid cash to use the room for six hours. Because the brief cash rental by an out-of-state guest aroused the officers' suspicions, they checked appellant's criminal history. They discovered that appellant had numerous arrests for drugs, firearms, and fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The officers proceeded to appellant's room, knocked on the door, and identified themselves as police. Approximately 60 seconds elapsed, during which time the officers heard a toilet flush and papers shuffling. Then appellant answered the door and permitted the officers to enter, but immediately after allowing the officers into the room, he picked up a laptop, a cell phone, and a file folder that appeared to contain several checks. Appellant declined the officers' request to inspect those items. In the room, the officers observed a large amount of cash, two printers, and several envelopes. The officers then froze the scene and obtained a search warrant. In searching the room pursuant to the warrant, officers recovered several checks purporting to be paychecks from various hotels to \"Spencer Alan Hill\" at various addresses. Six of the checks indicated the same account number, but purported to be\n   from different banks. The amounts for which the checks were payable totaled $2,521.22. Officers also recovered $5,338 in cash, and check-printing paper that had been loaded into a printer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was charged with check forgery and offering a forged check. He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his hotel room. He argued that the warrantless search of the hotel's registration records was unjustified because the statutes that require hotel operators, under threat of criminal sanction, to maintain such records and make them \"open to the inspection of all law enforcement,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20327.10\">\n    Minn.

But the third-party-disclosure principle articulated in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   has a broader application than the facts of that case.

He asserts that he did not voluntarily provide information, but was instead required to do so \"without any opportunity for [him] to refuse while still renting a hotel room in Minnesota.\" This argument is unavailing. While Minnesota law required him to provide, and the hotel to collect, some of the information he disclosed-or else forfeit the desired accommodation-the Fourth Amendment concept of voluntary third-party disclosure does not depend on the gratuitous sharing of information. To the contrary, in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found the disclosure of certain financial information to be voluntary, as a means of retaining a bank account, despite legislation mandating banks to collect certain information from their depositors.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178379\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/435/#p443\">\n    425 U.S. at 442-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178379\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/435/#p443\">\n    96 S.Ct. at 1624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We decline to so hold. Article I, section 10 should be interpreted more\n   expansively than its \"textually identical\" federal counterpart only when there is \"a principled basis to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
