Horst claims she was denied due process when the district court issued an emergency ex parte custody order and refused to appoint counsel. She also claims imposing child support is unconstitutional, the district court erred in awarding Hagen primary residential responsibility,\n   and the district court erred in ordering supervised parenting time until Horst completes parenting and anger management classes and establishes residential stability. We summarily affirm the district court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b62] Horst argues her constitutional rights were violated when the district court issued an interim custody order and child support obligation.

Here, the district court's findings on the best interest factors contained sufficient specificity to show the factual basis for its award of primary residential responsibility to Hagen and was not clearly erroneous.
