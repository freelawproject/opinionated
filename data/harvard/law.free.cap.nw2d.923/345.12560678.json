Stat. \u00a7 609.713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1 (2016). The case was tried to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence at trial showed that Lagred and the victim, J.H., are acquaintances\n   and had known each other for over a decade. In 2013, Lagred and his then-girlfriend stayed at J.H.'s house for one or two weeks. J.H. allowed Lagred's girlfriend and her children, but not Lagred, to stay at his house again in 2014, which angered Lagred. In November 2014, J.H. confronted Lagred concerning Lagred's treatment of his girlfriend and his refusal to return property to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 15, 2017, J.H. visited an apartment complex to see a friend, unaware that Lagred lived in the same complex. As J.H. was walking to his car in the parking lot, he heard someone say, \"Come here you son of a b-tch.\" J.H. turned and saw Lagred approaching him with a baseball bat. Lagred was out of control and screaming. J.H. held up his hands and attempted to calm Lagred. Lagred yelled at J.H., swung the bat at him twice, and then hit him on the head with the bat. Next, Lagred demanded that J.H. empty his pockets. J.H. had a small pocket knife, which Lagred took. J.H. allowed Lagred to take the knife because he was afraid of being hit with the bat again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   S.D., one of Lagred's neighbors, was walking through a nearby parking lot and observed the altercation between J.H. and Lagred. S.D. testified that Lagred was holding a baseball bat and that Lagred and J.H. seemed to be arguing. S.D. stood between J.H. and Lagred, and tried to calm Lagred. Lagred was yelling and swinging the bat in the air. S.D. did not see Lagred hit J.H. with the bat, but he saw Lagred take J.H.'s pocket knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   M.P., another one of Lagred's neighbors, observed the incident from her living room window. M.P. testified that Lagred was \"behaving rather erratically\" and approached J.H. in \"a confrontational manner.\" M.P. saw Lagred hit J.H. with the baseball bat, but she did not see J.H. remove anything from his pockets or give anything to Lagred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the incident, J.H. drove to a police station and reported the incident to a police officer. The police photographed a bump on J.H.'s head, which had been caused by the blow from the bat. J.H. spoke with his mother, a registered emergency medical technician, about his injury, but he did not seek other medical attention. J.H. suffered from headaches and light-sensitivity for a month after the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court instructed the jury that it could find Lagred guilty of first-degree aggravated robbery either because he was armed with a dangerous weapon, or because he inflicted bodily harm upon J.H., while committing a robbery. Lagred did not object to the instruction or propose an alternative instruction. Consistent with the district court's instruction, the prosecutor argued, in closing, that although the jury was required to reach a unanimous verdict on the elements of aggravated robbery, it did not need to unanimously decide whether Lagred was armed with a dangerous weapon or inflicted bodily harm while committing the alleged robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury found Lagred guilty as charged. The district court entered judgment of conviction on the aggravated-robbery charge, granted Lagred's motion for a downward dispositional departure, and stayed execution of a 68-month prison term. Lagred appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Did the district court's jury instructions regarding first-degree aggravated robbery violate Lagred's right to a unanimous verdict?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   District courts are entitled to considerable latitude when selecting language\n   for jury instructions, but the jury instructions cannot materially misstate the law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, the breadth of possible conduct embodied in the aggravated-robbery alternatives is narrow, and it includes behaviors that have similar degrees of seriousness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133882\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/813/#p817\">\n    526 U.S. at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133882\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/813/#p817\">\n    119 S.Ct. at 1711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a \"statute's breadth also argue[d] against treating each individual violation as a means,\" noting that the statute \"cover[ed] many different kinds of behavior of varying degrees of seriousness\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Lastly, in\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court considered that the legislature \"chose to punish kidnapping similarly, regardless of which purpose is found underlying the commission of the crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450796\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/725/717/#p729\">\n    725 N.W.2d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court reasoned, \"While the legislature's determination of penalties is not dispositive, it lends credence to assigning similar blameworthiness or culpability among each purpose for kidnapping,\" noting that the plurality in\n   <em>\n    Schad\n   </em>\n   said that \"fundamental fairness and rationality were met if the two [alternatives] reasonably reflect notions of equivalent blameworthiness or culpability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450796\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/725/717/#p729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450796\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/725/717/#p729\">\n    at 731-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). The circumstances here are similar: the legislature prescribed one punishment for first-degree aggravated robbery regardless of which means is used to commit the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.245\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1 (prescribing penalty of \"not more than 20 years\" of imprisonment for first-degree aggravated robbery). The legislature's penalty determination indicates that the alternatives in the aggravated-robbery statute reflect notions of similar blameworthiness and culpability, consistent with fundamental fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the reasons above, we hold that the alternative statutory means of committing first-degree aggravated robbery do not create a risk of unfairness that violates due process. Thus, a jury need not unanimously agree regarding which of those means was used to commit a first-degree aggravated robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Because the alternatives set forth in Minnesota's first-degree aggravated-robbery statute are means of committing the offense, and those alternatives are consistent with the fundamental fairness required by due process, the district court did not err by not instructing the jury that it must unanimously agree regarding the means by which Lagred committed that offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
