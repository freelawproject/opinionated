We VACATE those parts of the March 15, 2018 Court of Appeals judgment and the Clare Circuit Court's orders of adjudication and disposition pertaining to the minor child, OTC, and we REMAND this case to the Clare Circuit Court, which shall dismiss without prejudice the petition against the respondent as to all three children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The application for leave to appeal as it pertains to the minor child, OTC, is DISMISSED with prejudice and without costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
