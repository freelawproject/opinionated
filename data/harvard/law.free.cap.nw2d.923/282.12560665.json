Filip, 12th District Court Judge, consents. It is accompanied by a settlement agreement, in which the respondent waived his rights, stipulated to findings of fact and conclusions of law, and consented to a sanction of public censure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In resolving this matter, we are mindful of the standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20Mich.%201291\">\n    461 Mich. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292-1293,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.W.2d%20744\">\n    625 N.W.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   Everything else being equal:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (1) misconduct that is part of a pattern or practice is more serious than an isolated instance of misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (2) misconduct on the bench is usually more serious than the same misconduct off the bench;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (3) misconduct that is prejudicial to the actual administration of justice is more serious than misconduct that is prejudicial only to the appearance of propriety;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (4) misconduct that does not implicate the actual administration of justice, or its appearance of impropriety, is less serious than misconduct that does;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (5) misconduct that occurs spontaneously is less serious than misconduct that is premeditated or deliberated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (6) misconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy, or to reach the most just result in such a case, is more serious than misconduct that merely delays such discovery;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (7) misconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic background, gender, or religion are more serious than breaches of justice that do not disparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the present case, those standards are being applied in the context of the following stipulated findings of fact of the Judicial Tenure Commission, which, following our de novo review, we adopt as our own:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1.
