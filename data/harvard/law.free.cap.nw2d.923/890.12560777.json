In addition to the brief, the petitioner-appellant shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1). The respondent-appellee shall file a supplemental brief within 21 days of being served with the petitioner-appellant's brief. The respondent-appellee shall also electronically file an appendix, or in the alternative, stipulate to the use of the appendix filed by the petitioner-appellant. The lawyer-guardian ad litem for the minor child is invited to file a supplemental brief within 21 days of being served with the petitioner-appellant's brief. A reply, if any, must be filed by the petitioner-appellant within 14 days of being served with the respondent-appellee's brief. The parties should not submit mere restatements of their application papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Children's Law and Family Law Sections of the State Bar of Michigan, the UDM Juvenile Appellate Practice Clinic, and the University of Michigan Law School Child Advocacy Law Clinic are invited to file briefs amicus curiae.
