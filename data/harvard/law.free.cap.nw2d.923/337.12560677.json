Because we agree that the district court erred in both respects, we reverse and remand for recalculation of the judgment to be entered against respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant Frederick Fish suffered workplace injuries while on loan by his employer, Albany Manufacturing, Inc., to Wells Concrete Productions Company (Wells). Fish was injured while working aboard a flatbed trailer being pulled by a semi-tractor driven by an employee of respondent Ramler Trucking, Inc. Pursuant to the loaned-servant agreement, Albany's insurer paid workers' compensation benefits to Fish. Fish received 130 weeks of temporary total disability (TTD) benefits totaling $48,560.68. He also received $2,245 in permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits and $125,744.18 in medical-expense benefits. And he settled the balance of his workers' compensation claim for a lump sum of $79,755 (the lump-sum settlement) and $13,000 in attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After settling his workers' compensation claim, Fish sued Ramler for negligence; Ramler brought a third-party action against Albany and Wells. Ramler, Albany, and Albany's insurer settled their respective contribution and subrogation claims before trial in a \"reverse-\n   <em>\n    Naig\n   </em>\n   \" agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The case was tried to a jury, which found Wells, Ramler, and Fish causally negligent and apportioned fault 75% to Wells, 20% to Ramler, and 5% to Fish. The jury awarded damages of $125,000 in past pain, disability, and emotional distress; $108,288 in past health-care expenses; $105,000 in lost wages; $72,500 in future, pain, disability, and emotional distress; $16,552.54 in future health-care expenses; and $100,000 in loss of earning capacity. Following the verdict, the district court held a hearing and issued an order reducing the damages awarded based on the amount of workers' compensation benefits Fish received and calculating the judgment to be entered against Ramler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relevant to this appeal, the district court offset against the $105,000 past wage-loss award not only the $48,560.68 in TTD benefits and $2,245 in PPD benefits Fish received, but also $38,101.08 of his lump-sum settlement, based on the district court's calculation of TTD benefits Fish would have received through the date of trial but for the settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After reducing the damages awarded to reflect workers' compensation payments, the district court further reduced the awards by 5% based on Fish's percentage of fault. From the remaining $278,913.58, the district court calculated 20%-Ramler's percentage of fault-and ordered judgment against Ramler in the amount of $55,782.72.

First and foremost, as amended in 2003, the statute applies \"[w]hen\n   <em>\n    two or more\n   </em>\n   persons are severally liable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20604.02\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 604.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Because employers are not liable to employees in tort, there is no basis for common liability, and section 604.02 does not apply. The\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   procedure is distinct from apportionment of damages under section 604.02, and that statute, while it informs the\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   procedure, does not control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   , 257 N.W.2d at 689 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kempa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10646616\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/370/414/\">\n    370 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   421 ;\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10673210\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/326/149/\">\n    326 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   157 ;\n   <em>\n    Cambern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677754\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/323/795/\">\n    323 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   799 ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10686672\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/276/79/\">\n    276 N.W.2d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the supreme court adopted the\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   procedure because there was no basis under existing law to limit the third party's exposure as the sole party liable in tort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   , 257 N.W.2d at 689 (explaining that procedure was \"solution we consider most consistent with fairness and the various statutory schemes before us\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, the legislature has not evinced an intent to supplant\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   .

The legislature did not respond to\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   until the 2000 amendments, through which it\n   <em>\n    adopted\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   rule, subject to the employer's right to avoid contribution exposure by waiving its subrogation claim before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2000 Minn.

Based on the 2000 amendments, we would expect any further legislative changes to the\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   procedure to be codified in the act. Accordingly, as in\n   <em>\n    Decker\n   </em>\n   , we have no basis to conclude that the 2000 legislative amendments to section 604.02 were intended to impact the\n   <em>\n    Lambertson\n   </em>\n   procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Staab v.

The supreme court rejected this argument, interpreting \"persons\" in the 2003 amendment to section 604.02 to mean \"all persons who are parties to the tort, regardless of whether they are parties to the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068526\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/813/68/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068526\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/813/68/\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Staab\n   </em>\n   court\n   explained that liability is created at the time a tort is committed, and exists \"independent of any claim or civil action that arises from that liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068526\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/813/68/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068526\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/813/68/\">\n    at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, the tortfeasors shared common liability, such that section 604.02 applied. In this case, Wells is immune from liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.061\">\n    Minn.

Fish argues that the district court erred by offsetting $38,101.08 of the lump-sum settlement against the jury's $105,000 past wage-loss award. More specifically, he asserts that the district court erred by treating the $38,101.08 as duplicative of TTD benefits because he had exhausted those benefits prior to the settlement. Ramler concedes that the district court erred, but argues that the award for past wage loss should nonetheless be reduced by $38,101.08 because that amount duplicates permanent total disability (PTD) benefits Fish received. Ramler essentially asserts that any error was harmless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In reducing the jury's damages awards for workers' compensation benefits paid, the district court considered $38,101.08 of the $79,755 lump-sum settlement to represent continuing TTD benefits at a rate of $373.54 per week. But Fish had exhausted his TTD benefits (receiving $48,560.68 over 130 weeks) before the settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.101\">\n    Minn.

Thus, we\n   agree with the parties that the district court erred by offsetting $38,101.08 from the verdict. But we decline to address for the first time on appeal Ramler's arguments that $38,101.08 should nevertheless be offset as duplicative of PTD benefits. On remand, the district court shall determine whether the $38,101.08 duplicates PTD benefits and thus should be offset against the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The district court erred by applying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20604.02\">\n    Minn.
