Accordingly, we once again affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We begin our discussion with the pertinent testimony elicited by the prosecution at trial. Jaeden Kammers posted on his Facebook page that he had a video game for sale. Kammers and a friend, Daniel Ribon, later rode their bikes to Hackley Hospital because it had wireless Internet service and they wished to send a message about the game to a friend, Jainautica Watkins, who was attending a graduation party. From the hospital, a message was sent by Kammers, and Watkins responded\n   using his cell phone, indicating that he was interested in purchasing the video game. Watkins allowed defendant, who was also present at the graduation party, to use his cell phone to check Facebook. Defendant, using Watkins's cell phone, began communicating with Kammers. Defendant learned about the video game and the presence of Kammers at Hackley Hospital. He then left the graduation party, telling Watkins, \"I'm gonna go get that game.\" Defendant went to the hospital, meeting Kammers and Ribon at that location. Defendant, who was unknown to both Kammers and Ribon, falsely identified himself, giving the name of a personal rival. Defendant indicated a desire to purchase the game but claimed that he first needed to break a couple of 20-dollar bills. He supposedly was unsuccessful in doing so at the hospital. Defendant next informed Kammers and Ribon that he could get change at his house, and the three of them biked to a house. Defendant did not go inside, and he engaged Kammers and Ribon in friendly conversation outside the house. Kammers and Ribon allowed defendant to examine the video game and their cell phones after defendant suggested the possibility of trading phones. With the game and phones in hand, defendant began walking toward the house, leading Kammers and Ribon to believe that he was going to get money inside. Defendant instead started to run away, and upon an attempt by Kammers and Ribon to stop him, defendant pointed a gun at the pair, asking whether they were \"tryin' to do something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the day before the trial began, defendant, who had earlier told the police that he had an alibi, provided a new statement to the police, indicating that defendant had been at the graduation party on the day\n   of the offense, that he left the party after about 30 minutes, that he walked to nearby Hackley Hospital to use a bathroom, that he inadvertently bumped into Kammers and Ribon at the hospital, with the two making a request to purchase drugs from defendant, and that defendant refused to sell them any drugs. Defendant further asserted that Kammers and Ribon then pulled out a video game and asked him whether he was interested in buying it, and that defendant looked at the game, but then returned it to them, declining to purchase the game because he did not have the required gaming system. Defendant additionally claimed that, upon request, he allowed Kammers and Ribon to look at defendant's cell phone, that they returned his phone to him, and that he then left. Defendant's statement effectively constituted a claim that he went to the hospital with innocent intent, lacking any plan or intent to rob Kammers and Ribon, and that he indeed did not rob them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With respect to the other-acts evidence, the 2011 robbery committed by defendant entailed defendant walking behind the 15-year-old victim, suddenly attacking the teenager from the rear, physically assaulting him, and then stealing the victim's MP3 player and headphones. The prosecutor successfully argued in favor of the introduction of the other-acts evidence, maintaining, in part, that it was admissible to show intent and motive, especially in\n   light of defendant's most recent statement that he had an innocent interaction with Kammers and Ribon at Hackley Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We review for an abuse of discretion a trial court's decision to admit evidence.\n   <em>\n    Denson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20385\">\n    500 Mich. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n    902 N.W.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"However, whether a rule or statute precludes admission of evidence is a preliminary question of law that this Court reviews de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When a trial court\n   admits evidence that is inadmissible as a matter of law, the court necessarily abuses its discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MCL 750.529, Michigan's armed robbery statute, sets forth the nature of the crime, providing, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A person who engages in conduct proscribed under section 530 and who in the course of engaging in that conduct, possesses a dangerous weapon or an article used or fashioned in a manner to lead any person present to reasonably believe the article is a dangerous weapon, or who represents orally or otherwise that he or she is in possession of a dangerous weapon, is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for life or for any term of years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As indicated in this statutory language, MCL 750.529 incorporates by reference MCL 750.530, which is the general robbery statute, and which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) A person who, in the course of committing a larceny of any money or other property that may be the subject of larceny, uses force or violence against any person who is present, or who assaults or puts the person in fear, is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) As used in this section, \"in the course of committing a larceny\" includes acts that occur in an attempt to commit the larceny, or during commission of the larceny, or in flight or attempted flight after the commission of the larceny, or in an attempt to retain possession of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Armed robbery is a specific-intent crime, requiring proof that the defendant intended to permanently deprive the owner of his or her property.\n   <em>\n    People v.

[Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Denson\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court examined MRE 404(b) in the context of other-acts evidence that was admitted on the basis of similarity and for the purpose of\n   rebutting the defendant's claims of self-defense and defense of others. The Court reviewed the test for admitting other-acts evidence under MRE 404(b), citing the\n   <em>\n    VanderVliet\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    Denson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20385\">\n    500 Mich. at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n    902 N.W.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the first prong, the\n   <em>\n    Denson\n   </em>\n   Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    VanderVliet\n   </em>\n   test, the question is whether the prosecution has articulated a proper noncharacter purpose for admission of the other-acts evidence. The prosecution bears the burden of establishing that purpose. MRE 404(b) prohibits the admission\n   of other-acts evidence when the prosecution's only theory of relevance is that the other act demonstrates the defendant's inclination for wrongdoing in general and thus indicates that the defendant committed the conduct in question. On the other hand, such other-acts evidence may be admissible whenever it is also relevant to a noncharacter purpose, such as one of the purposes specifically enumerated in MRE 404(b)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ... [W]e have warned that a common pitfall in MRE 404(b) cases is that trial courts tend to admit other-acts evidence merely because the proponent has articulated a permissible purpose. The \"mechanical recitation\" of a permissible purpose, without explaining how the evidence relates to the recited purpose, is insufficient to justify admission under MRE 404(b). It is incumbent on a trial court to vigilantly weed out character evidence that is disguised as something else. In other words, merely\n   <em>\n    reciting\n   </em>\n   a proper purpose does not actually demonstrate the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   of a proper purpose for the particular other-acts evidence at issue and does not automatically render the evidence admissible. Rather, in order to determine whether an articulated purpose is, in fact, merely a front for the improper admission of other-acts evidence, the trial court must closely scrutinize the logical relevance of the evidence under the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    VanderVliet\n   </em>\n   test.

Generally, the threshold is minimal: any tendency is sufficient probative force. In the context of prior acts evidence, however, MRE 404(b) stands as a sentinel at the gate: the proffered evidence truly must be probative of something\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the defendant's propensity to commit the crime. Thus, although the prosecution might claim a permissible purpose for the evidence under MRE 404(b), the prosecution must also\n   <em>\n    explain how\n   </em>\n   the evidence is relevant to that purpose without relying on a propensity inference. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the prosecution has established some intermediate inference, other than the improper inference of character, which in turn is probative of the ultimate issues in the case. If not, the evidence is inadmissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In evaluating whether the prosecution has provided an intermediate inference other than an impermissible character inference, we examine the similarity between a\n   defendant's other act and the charged offense. In this case, we note that the prosecution sought to admit the other-acts evidence\n   <em>\n    particularly\n   </em>\n   based on the alleged similarities between the 2002 incident and the charged offense.

Indeed, Kammers and Ribon were not even concerned when defendant initially began to walk away from them with their property. Subterfuge and deception were revealed when defendant provided Kammers and Ribon with a false name at the hospital. Under these circumstances, we believe that the crime first began unfolding when defendant met Kammers and Ribon at Hackley Hospital. Thus, defendant's conduct and interactions with the victims associated with events at Hackley Hospital, placing Kammers and Ribon at ease and making them susceptible to robbery, can be viewed as occurring in the course of committing a larceny or during the commission of a larceny, even though the period was somewhat protracted. MCL 750.529 ; MCL 750.530.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Regardless, as indicated earlier, the prosecution was required to prove that defendant acted with the intent to permanently deprive Kammers and Ribon of their property, i.e., that defendant intended to rob them or steal from them. As part of attempting to satisfy that burden of proof, the prosecution was certainly entitled to present evidence showing that defendant had formed the requisite intent to steal as early as the graduation party when he was using Watkins's cell phone. Importantly, the prosecution was not limited to proving intent solely by way of evidence pertaining to the immediate point at which defendant walked off\n   with the cell phones and video game.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The intent to commit a crime can be developed or exist long before an offense is actually committed. Thus, for example, if there is testimony that a perpetrator was overheard stating an intent to kill a particular person and that person was murdered a week later, the testimony can be used to establish an intent to kill in a murder prosecution, with the testimony being critical on the issue of intent despite the lapse of time between the perpetrator's statement and the killing. In the instant case, there was evidence that defendant told Watkins at the graduation party that he was leaving in order to \"go get that game\" and that defendant was just stringing Kammers and Ribon along while at the hospital, using a false identity. On the other hand, in defendant's statement given to police right before trial, defendant claimed that he went to the hospital simply to use a bathroom and coincidentally ran into Kammers and Ribon. Stated otherwise, defendant asserted a completely innocent intent in going to Hackley Hospital. In light of this conflicting evidence, we conclude, as to the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    VanderVliet\n   </em>\n   test, that admission of the other-acts evidence served the proper purpose of showing defendant's \"intent\" MRE 404(b)(1), even if it was developed earlier than when he and the victims were at the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to logical relevance, the second\n   <em>\n    VanderVliet\n   </em>\n   prong, the evidence of the 2011 robbery committed by defendant was material to a fact that was of consequence at trial, i.e., defendant's intent to permanently deprive the victims of their property, which is an element of the crime of armed robbery.\n   <em>\n    Denson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20385\">\n    500 Mich. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n    902 N.W.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Harverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077967\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/291/171/#p177\">\n    291 Mich.

Also, both crimes involved teenage victims. Although different in character, both robberies involved the element of surprise, with defendant suddenly and unexpectedly pouncing on the victim from behind in the 2011 robbery and, here, defendant lulling Kammers and Ribon into a false sense of security before suddenly and unexpectedly walking off with their property. We recognize that there are also differences between the two offenses, given that the 2011 robbery entailed an actual physical assault and battery\n   and the instant offense did not and that a gun was displayed in the charged offense but not in connection with the 2011 robbery. That said, defendant used his cunning to avoid the need to physically assault and injure Kammers and Ribon, while still revealing an intent to employ violence if necessary when he flashed and pointed the gun at Kammers and Ribon. For purposes of establishing an intermediate inference of \"intent,\" we rule that the two offenses were sufficiently similar.
