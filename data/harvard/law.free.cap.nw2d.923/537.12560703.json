Roedder challenges his conviction, claiming his guilty plea was not supported by an adequate factual basis. He also argues the circuit court erred when it relied upon his five prior felony convictions to enhance his sentence and impose a forty-year sentence rather than the presumptive sentence Roedder sought. Roedder further claims the court's sentence violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. We affirm Roedder's conviction but reverse his sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62.] On August 24, 2017, Aberdeen police officers responded to a call from a resident who reported screaming and crying in a nearby apartment. Once there, officers found Roedder and Nashay Wurtz. Roedder was on parole for a 2011 distribution of a controlled substance conviction. Wurtz was also on parole and was taken into custody when police officers learned she had been drinking alcohol in violation of her supervision conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63.] Before Wurtz was transported to the Brown County Jail, a police officer accompanied her into the apartment so that she could retrieve some property. Inside the apartment, the officer noticed a hollowed-out pen tube lying on a dining room table. The officer recognized it as a device used to ingest narcotics, and an inspection of the tube revealed the presence of small white crystal flakes that field tested positive for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64.] Officers obtained a search warrant for the apartment and a vehicle parked nearby registered to Roedder. A search of the apartment yielded methamphetamine residue near the location of the hollowed-out pen and approximately twenty-two grams of methamphetamine in a packaged baggy inside a golden balloon. While searching Roedder's vehicle, officers discovered a bag of golden balloons similar to the one found filled with methamphetamine in the apartment. Roedder later admitted\n   to methamphetamine use, which was confirmed by a urinalysis test administered pursuant to the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b65.] Roedder was indicted and charged in a series of superseding indictments with the following drug-related offenses: (1) possession with intent to distribute a controlled drug or substance in violation of SDCL 22-42-2 ; (2) conspiracy to distribute a controlled drug or substance in violation of SDCL 22-3-8 and 22-42-2 ; (3) unauthorized possession of a controlled substance in violation of SDCL 22-42-5 ; and (4) unauthorized ingestion of a controlled drug or substance in violation of SDCL 22-42-5.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b66.] The State also filed an amended part II information, alleging Roedder was a habitual offender and listing five prior felony convictions. Included were a 2000 Arizona conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery, along with four 2011 convictions for drug-related offenses in Brown County. The part II information listed the same date for all four Brown County convictions. Roedder challenged the part II information, arguing the four Brown County convictions arose out of the same transaction and therefore could only be counted as a single prior conviction for enhancement purposes. He also claimed the Arizona conspiracy conviction did not constitute a felony in South Dakota, citing differences in the two states' conspiracy statutes. The circuit court rejected Roedder's arguments; deemed the Arizona conviction to be a crime of violence; and determined that Roedder's enhanced maximum potential punishment, if convicted, was the equivalent of a Class C felony, or life imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b67.] On September 5, 2017, Roedder pled guilty to unauthorized possession of a controlled substance in violation of SDCL 22-42-5, without the benefit of a plea agreement. He also admitted to the allegations contained in the part II information, despite still disputing the ability of the circuit court to use the convictions to enhance his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b68.] During the change of plea hearing, the circuit court advised Roedder that he could receive a sentence of up to life in prison for the possession of controlled substance offense. Roedder acknowledged the risk and continued with his plan to waive his rights and plead guilty. The court elicited a factual basis statement from the prosecutor with which Roedder agreed, adding only that he possessed \"a small amount of methamphetamine[,]\" not the twenty-two-gram amount described by the prosecutor. Roedder did not challenge any of the circuit court's findings regarding the sufficiency of the guilty plea and indicated he would not request a presentence investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b69.] At Roedder's sentencing hearing, the circuit court imposed a forty-year prison sentence. Roedder was already being supervised on parole by the Department of Corrections and argued unsuccessfully for the imposition of a presumptive fully suspended penitentiary sentence for his Class 5 felony conviction. The State did not proceed with the other charges, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b610.] Roedder raises several issues which we restate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1.

Under SDCL 22-42-5, a person is guilty of the offense when he knowingly possesses a drug that appears on the list of controlled substances without any authority to do so. Roedder agreed with the prosecutor's statement that he had possessed methamphetamine at an Aberdeen residence on August 24, 2016, offering only a clarifying comment regarding the amount of drugs he possessed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\n   </strong>\n   Actually, we have no disagreement with that information. But as far as the actual possession, Mr. Roedder possessed a small amount of methamphetamine that had been supplied to him. But he admits that he did possess methamphetamine on August 24, 2016, in Brown County, South Dakota, and he possessed that methamphetamine illegally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    [THE COURT]:\n   </strong>\n   Is that correct, Mr. Roedder?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    [ROEDDER]:\n   </strong>\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b616.] Roedder's argument challenging the factual basis for his guilty plea rests uneasily upon his unconnected claim that he cannot be found guilty under SDCL 22-42-5 because he ingested the methamphetamine and could only be found guilty of SDCL 22-42-5.1. This argument is unsustainable for at least two perceptible reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b617.] First, Roedder unequivocally admitted to the circuit court that he, in fact, knowingly possessed methamphetamine. Indeed, his signed petition to plead guilty states in no uncertain terms that Roedder \"will admit that he illegally possessed methamphetamine on August 24, 2016 in Brown County, South Dakota.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b618.] Second, Roedder has long-since waived any separate argument that the circuit court erroneously allowed him to plead guilty to the wrong charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326239\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/730/416/\">\n    2007 S.D. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326239\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/730/416/\">\n    730 N.W.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (\"It is 'the general rule that a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty waives a defendant's right to appeal all nonjurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

With the benefit of counsel, Roedder unilaterally pled guilty to unauthorized possession of a controlled substance. Roedder's plea was not required as part of a plea agreement with the State, and it appears he simply opted for the unauthorized possession charge over the ingestion of a controlled substance charge. The circuit court determined the plea was the product of Roedder's own volition, without threats or coercion, and undertaken with a full understanding of the rights he was waiving and the maximum possible sentence of life in prison. Roedder does not challenge any of these findings, and under the circumstances, we conclude he has waived any argument that the circuit court could not have accepted his guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether the circuit court erred when it determined Roedder's enhanced statutory maximum sentence.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    a.

During the 2011 change of plea hearing, Roedder agreed that he knowingly possessed one-half of a gram of methamphetamine, establishing the offense of unauthorized possession of a controlled substance. Roedder also acknowledged a second criminal act in which he possessed a larger quantity of methamphetamine, five-and-one-half ounces, for the purpose of distributing it. This conduct supported his conviction for possession with the intent to distribute a controlled substance. In a third criminal act, Roedder distributed a personal-use quantity of methamphetamine to another individual, providing support for one of his convictions for distribution of a controlled substance. Roedder's final criminal act relating to the 2011 convictions came when he distributed an additional, larger quantity of methamphetamine to the same individual to facilitate her retail distribution. This conduct supported a second conviction for distribution of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b622.] Roedder argues the failure of the State to produce additional evidence relating to his 2011 convictions precludes their use for enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument suggests that because his convictions arose out of a single arrest, they were necessarily part of the same transaction-especially in the absence of a carefully constructed sequence of events establishing otherwise.

Although the statutory maximum sentence for the class 5 felony at issue in\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   was subject to enhancement by virtue of a habitual offender information, it remained a class 5 felony, and the provisions of SDCL 22-6-11 applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782683\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/885/783/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b636.] We have examined the sentencing record further and believe it lacks a sufficient statement of aggravating circumstances that would justify a departure from a presumptive sentence. During the sentencing hearing, the court commented generally on recidivism, mentioned the prior leniency Roedder obtained through a post-conviction sentencing reduction following his 2011 convictions, and referred to the traditional sentencing factor concerning \"the protection of society from continued violations of the law.\" Though topics such as criminal history and public safety are among the factors that can be relevant to a sentencing court's decision to depart from a presumptive sentence, the court's statements here are inadequate to constitute a finding that \"aggravating circumstances exist that pose a significant risk to the public.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b637.] The fact that the circuit court later accepted the prosecutor's statement of aggravating factors does not change the analysis.

In cases like this, even with a habitual offender, the State lists aggravating circumstances in the judgment of conviction. I just want to make sure that I can list the proper ones. The State intends on listing the repeated offenses of the same nature, the defendant's extensive criminal history, the fact that he committed these crimes while on parole, the fact that he has a conviction for a crime of violence, and the fact that he committed this crime shortly after being released from prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    [THE COURT]:\n   </strong>\n   Well, I think those coincide with what the [c]ourt was trying to say here in sentencing, that those are certainly factors that the [c]ourt has considered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b638.] Read in the context of the entire sentencing record, the prosecutor's effort to list aggravating factors in an apparent effort to satisfy SDCL 22-6-11 was more a recapitulation of the State's sentencing argument, not the circuit court's stated analysis. Under the clear and unambiguous provisions of SDCL 22-6-11, the sentencing court, not the prosecutor, must state on the record the aggravating circumstances which impact public safety as a predicate to departing from a presumptive sentence and include those factors in the written judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b639.] In this regard, Roedder's case differs from our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v.

Viewed in this way, Roedder's case more closely resembles the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   where the sentencing court overlooked the applicability of SDCL 22-6-11 altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b641.] Therefore, Roedder's sentence must be vacated and the case remanded to the circuit court for resentencing. The parties are free to develop the sentencing record by presenting aggravating or mitigating information or making sentencing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b642.] In order to foreclose its consideration on remand, we also consider Roedder's additional argument that the text of SDCL 22-6-11 mandates, in all cases, a fully suspended penitentiary sentence for those who are on parole at the time they commit a qualifying class 5 or class 6 felony. Roedder's textual argument parses the provisions of SDCL 22-6-11 and isolates the last part of the statute's third sentence, noting that the court's findings to justify a departure from a presumptive sentence refer only to \"a departure from presumptive probation\" without mentioning a presumptive fully-suspended penitentiary sentence. The absence of the parallel reference Roedder suggests is, in our view, not consequential because it overlooks SDCL 22-6-11 's preceding text expressly authorizing a sentencing court to \"impose a sentence other than probation\n   <em>\n    or a fully suspended penitentiary sentence\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Emphasis added). Accepting Roedder's argument would strip the sentence of its principal purpose and be at odds with the well-settled rule of statutory construction that obligates us to, wherever possible, \"give effect to all [of a statute's] provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

However, the court erred when it concluded Roedder was ineligible for consideration of a presumptive sentence under SDCL 22-6-11. Therefore, we vacate Roedder's sentence and remand the case to the circuit court for resentencing. In light of our remand, it is premature to consider whether Roedder's sentence violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b644.] We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b645.] GILBERTSON, Chief Justice, and KERN and JENSEN, Justices, concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SDCL 22-7-8 (authorizing sentencing enhancement for offenders with three or more prior felonies, including a crime of violence);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    SDCL 22-1-2(9) (listing conspiracy to commit robbery as a crime of violence).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Roedder did not object to the circuit court's determination that his guilty plea was supported by a factual basis.
