The district court characterized the Olivers' motion as a motion to modify the appraisal award and denied the motion as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We reverse the district court's decision for three reasons. First, the Olivers were unambiguously entitled to preaward interest for pecuniary damages awarded by the appraisal panel and may claim preaward interest without proving wrongdoing by the insurer or breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Poehler v. Cincinnati Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334267\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/899/135/#p140\">\n    899 N.W.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140-41 (Minn. 2017) (interpreting and applying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20549.09\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 549.09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1(b) ). Second, Minnesota caselaw establishes that an appraisal panel determines the amount of loss under the insurance policy. Consequently, an appraisal panel lacks authority to grant preaward interest, which is a statutory right that arises independent of the insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Third, the district court erred in applying a 90-day filing deadline to the Olivers' motion. Precedent establishes that the Minnesota Uniform Arbitration Act (MUAA), Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 572B.01 -.31 (2018), applies to insurance appraisal awards, in addition to arbitration awards. And, under the MUAA, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24(a) requires that a party seeking to modify an arbitration award on specified grounds must do so within 90 days of an arbitrator's decision. Because an appraisal panel's authority is limited to determining amount of loss under the policy, a motion to modify an appraisal award may not include a request for preaward interest, which arises from statute and not the policy. We conclude that section 572B.24 does not apply to the Olivers' motion for preaward interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thus, we reverse the district court's decision denying the Olivers' motion for preaward interest and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 11, 2015, a fire occurred at the Olivers' home in Edina. On May 20, 2015,\n   the Olivers submitted a claim to State Farm under their homeowners' insurance policy. The parties were \"unable to agree on the measurement of the loss.\" In January 2016, the Olivers sent State Farm an email demanding an appraisal under the terms of the insurance policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Olivers' email did not include a request for preaward interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 14, 2016, after hearing testimony and receiving evidence from the parties, the appraisal panel issued an award in favor of the Olivers; the total award was $1,143,778.39. State Farm paid the appraisal award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 8, 2017, in a letter to State Farm, the Olivers demanded $94,009.18 in preaward interest. State Farm refused to pay preaward interest \"based on the two-year limitation clause provided in the [Olivers'] homeowners' policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 25, 2017, the Olivers filed a motion in district court requesting that the court (1) confirm the appraisal award under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.22, and (2) grant preaward interest on the appraisal award under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20549.09\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 549.09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1(b). The Olivers argued that Minnesota law \"unambiguously provide[s] for preaward interest on insurance appraisal awards.\" The Olivers also contended, based on the language in section 549.09, that \"[i]nterest accrues from the date of the first written notice of the claim\" through the date of the appraisal award. The first written notice of the Olivers' claim occurred on May 20, 2015, and the appraisal award was issued on March 14, 2016. Because there were 300 days between the dates of the first written notice and the appraisal award, the Olivers argued that State Farm owed them $94,009.18 in preaward interest, after applying the statutory interest rate. Finally, the Olivers asserted that, because their claim to preaward interest was a statutory right, it was not subject to the homeowners' policy's \"limiting language,\" and therefore, that they did not have to request preaward interest within the two years specified in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   State Farm opposed the Olivers' request on three grounds. First, State Farm argued that the Olivers' request amounted to a new legal action that had to be dismissed for insufficient service of process because no summons and complaint were served. Second, State Farm argued there was no award to confirm because it had already paid the appraisal award. Third, State Farm argued that the Olivers' claim was untimely because it was made more than two years after the date of loss, contrary to the policy's requirement, and filed more than 90 days after notice of the appraisal award, contrary to Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court issued an order granting the Olivers' motion to confirm the award in the amount of $1,143,778.39. With regard to the preaward-interest request, the district court agreed with State Farm that the Olivers had made a motion to modify the appraisal award under the MUAA. Because the Olivers proceeded under the MUAA, the district court reasoned that their request was \"subject to its limitations\" and not \"obviate[d] [from] the need to seek [preaward interest] in an appropriate procedural fashion.\" Because the Olivers failed to comply with the 90-day filing deadline in section 572B.24(a),\n   the district court denied their motion for preaward interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Olivers asked for leave to file a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the district court incorrectly characterized their motion as a motion to modify because their motion for preaward interest under section 549.09 did not require a modification of the award. The Olivers also argued that the appraisal panel was not authorized to grant preaward interest, which can only be decided by the district court. In short, the Olivers asked the district court to grant preaward interest as authorized by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court denied the reconsideration request in a letter and filed an amended order with some additional legal analysis. The amended order again granted the Olivers' motion to confirm the appraisal award, denied the motion for preaward interest, and directed entry of an amended judgment. The Olivers appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Did the district court err in denying the Olivers' motion for preaward interest?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The availability of preaward interest and the interpretation of the MUAA are both statutory issues that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KSTP-TV v.

The appraisal panel lacked authority to award the Olivers preaward interest.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is undisputed that the Olivers did not seek preaward interest from the appraisal panel and, in fact, did not demand preaward interest until after the appraisal award was issued and paid by State Farm. State Farm contends that, because the Olivers first sought preaward interest after the appraisal award was issued, their motion was one to modify the appraisal award. This argument assumes that the appraisal panel would have been authorized to grant preaward interest. The district court determined that the Olivers \"could, and should have, asked for preaward interest in the appraisal ... [because] [i]n most cases the award is a mathematical calculation within the authority of the appraisers to administer.\" Thus, we consider whether an insurance appraisal panel has the authority to grant preaward interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   An\n   <em>\n    arbitration\n   </em>\n   panel undoubtedly has authority to grant preaward interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hedlund v.

Brooks\n   </em>\n   was decided, section 549.09 did not\n   authorize\n   <em>\n    preaward\n   </em>\n   interest; instead, the statute authorized\n   <em>\n    prejudgment\n   </em>\n   interest from the time of verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10647475\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/370/434/#p435\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10647475\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/370/434/#p435\">\n    at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20549.09\">\n    Minn.

Second,\n   <em>\n    David A. Brooks\n   </em>\n   preceded the supreme court's 2012 decision in\n   <em>\n    Quade\n   </em>\n   , which clarified that an appraisal panel has limited authority to make legal determinations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7070068\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/814/703/#p706\">\n    814 N.W.2d at 707-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Quade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    David A.

In contrast, the supreme court's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Quade\n   </em>\n   provides a detailed analysis of an appraisal panel's authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7070068\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/814/703/#p706\">\n    814 N.W.2d at 707-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For all of these reasons, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    David A. Brooks\n   </em>\n   held that an appraisal panel has authority to grant preaward interest, it is expressly overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, because an appraisal panel lacks authority to make legal determinations and preaward interest is a statutory right that requires a legal determinations, we conclude that an appraisal panel lacks authority to grant preaward interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The district court erred in applying the 90-day filing deadline from Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24(a) to the Olivers' motion for preaward interest.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The district court concluded that the Olivers \"failed to seek timely modification of the award under\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24, and thus, denied their motion for preaward interest. Under section 572B.24 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Upon motion filed within 90 days after the movant receives notice of the award in a record pursuant to section 572B.19 or within 90 days after the movant receives notice of an arbitrator's award in a record on a motion to modify or correct an award pursuant to section 572B.20, the court shall modify or correct the award if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) there was an evident mathematical miscalculation or an evident mistake in the description of a person, thing, or property referred to in the award;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) the arbitrator has made an award on a claim not submitted to the arbitrator and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the claims submitted; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (3) the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the decision on the claims submitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24(a). The parties disagree whether this provision applies to the Olivers' motion for preaward interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is true that Minnesota courts often treat appraisals as equivalent to arbitration proceedings and subject them to the same legal standards. In particular, this court has previously held that appraisal decisions are subject to the MUAA.\n   <em>\n    QBE Ins. Corp. v. Twin Homes of French Ridge Homeowners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7085925\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/778/393/#p398\">\n    778 N.W.2d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (Minn. App. 2010). Further, Minnesota courts have used the terms \"arbitration\" and \"appraisal\" interchangeably.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Mut. Serv. Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8307991\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/732/340/#p345\">\n    732 N.W.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345-46 (Minn. App. 2007) (collecting numerous Minnesota cases in which terms were used interchangeably),\n   <em>\n    review denied\n   </em>\n   (Minn. Aug. 21, 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, section 572B.24(a) applies to motions to modify an appraisal award. However, that begs the question of whether the Olivers' motion for preaward interest is properly characterized as a motion to modify the award. We have already stated that the appraisal panel lacked authority to grant any request for preaward interest under Minnesota law. Additionally, section 572B.24(a) provides limited grounds for modification, such as mistakes of form, description, and calculation of the award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We conclude that a motion for preaward interest does not constitute a request to modify an appraisal award under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 572B.24(a) for three reasons. First, a claim for preaward interest arises from Minnesota statute and not the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Schwickert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9245945\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/680/79/#p88\">\n    680 N.W.2d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, granting preaward interest involves legal determinations that are outside the appraisal panel's authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7070068\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/814/703/#p706\">\n    814 N.W.2d at 706-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And third, a motion for preaward interest on an appraisal award does not fall within the narrow grounds for modification specified in section 572B.24(a).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adler v. Safeco Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10665933\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/413/566/#p568\">\n    413 N.W.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 (Minn. App. 1987) (concluding that insurer's request that the arbitration panel modify its award to exclude prejudgment interest was not authorized by the modification statute because it sought a substantive change that went beyond \"clarifying the award\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, the district court erred in applying the MUAA's 90-day filing deadline for motions to modify an appraisal award to the Olivers' motion for preaward interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We conclude that the district court erred in denying the Olivers' motion for preaward interest on the appraisal award. The right to preaward interest arises from the statute, not the policy; therefore, the appraisal panel was not authorized to grant preaward interest and the 90-day filing deadline in section 572B.24(a) did not apply to a motion for preaward interest. Because the district court erroneously denied the Olivers' motion for preaward interest, we reverse the court's decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Retired judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, serving by appointment pursuant to Minn.
