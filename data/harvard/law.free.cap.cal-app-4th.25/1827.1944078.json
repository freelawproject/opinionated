(collectively Midland), against their real estate agents, Cold-well Banker Commercial Group, Inc., and Kent Williams (collectively Cold-well). The judgment stemmed from Midland\u2019s forfeiture of a warehouse property (the property), on which it had held a lease and option to buy, after Coldwell sublet the property for Midland in violation of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">The issues on appeal concern additions or offsets to the judgment that the parties contend the trial court should have made. Coldwell contends that two payments which Midland and its bankruptcy estate received from other cross-defendants before trial should have been credited against the judgment, to avoid excessive or multiple recovery. On cross-appeal, Moallem contends that a similar payment to him should not have been deducted from his award, and that he should have been allowed additional prejudgment interest, and attorney fees. The latter contention raises the significant issue of whether, in light of Civil Code section 1717, Moallem may recover attorney fees for his successful tort action, under a contractual attorney fees provision that is broad enough to encompass tort claims but names only Coldwell as its beneficiary. This issue is addressed in the published portion of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">We conclude that Coldwell\u2019s contentions with respect to the judgment are meritorious, but that Moallem\u2019s are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">Factual Background<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">I. Coldwell\u2019s Appeal*</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">II.

(b)), and therefore denied both requests for fees. Moallem, but not Coldwell, has appealed from that disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">In claiming entitlement to attorney fees, Moallem no longer seeks directly to invoke section 1717, which in terms allows fees only to \u201cthe party prevailing on the contract,\" in an \u201caction on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1717, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of this plain language, the statute has consistently been held not to afford recovery of fees for tort claims arising out of or related to such a contract. (E.g., <em>Reynolds Metals Co. </em>v. <em>Alperson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 129 [158 Cal.Rptr. 1, 599 P.2d 83]; <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Turney </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 718, 730 [150 Cal.Rptr. 637, 586 P.2d 1228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1831\">*1831</page-number>Moallem instead relies primarily on a recent series of cases allowing attorney fees for tort claims where a contractual attorney fees provision was phrased broadly enough to cover such noncontractual claims. <em>(Xuereb </em>v. <em>Marcus &amp; Millichap, Inc. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1338 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 154] <em>(Xuereb); </em>accord, <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Shawback, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th 296; <em>Lemer </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 155 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 486]; <em>3250 Wilshire Blvd. Bldg. </em>v. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 990 F.2d 487.) In all of those cases, however, the contract provisions that the courts enforced also provided for attorney fees to whichever party prevailed, whereas here the provision in question runs only in favor of Coldwell. Moallem thus occupies the difficult position of arguing that the \u201cpublic policy\u201d of reciprocity of contractual attorney fee provisions, which section 1717 appears to implement, should control a noncontractual case that is specifically beyond section 1717\u2019s ambit. Although we sympathize with Moallem\u2019s position, we conclude that, just as its reach exceeds the statute\u2019s grasp, to adopt it would overreach our judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">Like the present case, the <em>Xuereb </em>line of cases all involved tort claims arising out of real estate sales transactions, in which the contract provided that attorney fees would be allowed to the prevailing party in any action \u201carising out of\u2019 the contract (or similar language). In each case, the court held that although the prevailing party could not claim attorney fees under section 1717\u2014because the action in which it had prevailed had been in tort, rather than \u201con the contract\u201d\u2014the contract\u2019s \u201carising out of\u2019 or equivalent language extended beyond simply actions \u201con the contract,\u201d and embraced the tort claims that had been decided. Therefore, under authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021, which permits parties to contract for attorney fees, the prevailing party was entitled to an award of fees by dint of the contract itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">The attorney fees provision in Coldwell\u2019s contract with Midland extends to any \u201clegal action . . . relating to\u201d the contract. This language is broad enough to include tort claims of the type brought and won by Moallem here, just as in <em>Xuereb </em>and its progeny. Coldwell does not contend to the contrary. However, the critical difference between this case and the <em>Xuereb </em>cases is that in those cases the attorney fees provision specifically covered and benefited all parties to the contract, while in this case the provision specifically limits entitlement to attorney fees to Coldwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1832\">*1832</page-number>This difference is dispositive. In the <em>Xuereb </em>cases, the contracts did provide for attorney fees for the party that sought them, and therefore such an award of fees was sanctioned by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021, which, again, leaves the recoverability vel non of attorney fees \u201cto the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.\u201d But in this case, for better or worse, the agreement of the parties was that only Coldwell could obtain attorney fees for an action \u201crelating to\u201d the contract. Thus, in contrast to <em>Xuereb, </em>Moallem\u2019s present prayer for fees lacks support in the terms of the contract and, consequently, in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">Moallem contends, however, that the unilateral right to attorney fees in Coldwell\u2019s contract should be available to him too, by dint of what he perceives as \u201c[t]he public policy of mutuality of remedy established by [section] 1717 ... the public policy that unilateral attorneys\u2019 fees provisions should be bilaterally enforced.\u201d The existence of such a public policy cannot be denied. As noted by cases decided early in section 1717\u2019s existence, the purpose of the section was to advance \u201cthe policy of the state to protect the unequal bargaining power of the Tittle man\u2019 in contracts of adhesion.\u201d <em>(System Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Union Bank </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 137,163 [98 Cal.Rptr. 735]; see also <em>Coast Bank </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 581, 596-597 [97 Cal.Rptr. 30].) Indeed, given the ability of contracting parties to provide for attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021, section 1717\u2019s \u201conly effect is to make an otherwise unilateral right to attorney fees reciprocally binding upon all parties to actions to enforce the contract.\u201d <em>(Xuereb, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">Moallem\u2019s position sounds a strong call of fairness. The same policy considerations that underlie section 1717\u2019s provision for attorney fees for the prevailing party in a contract action, \u201cwhether he or she is the party specified [as entitled to recover fees] in the contract or not\u201d (\u00a7 1717, subd. (a)), would appear to warrant such a reciprocal allowance when the contract provides for fees not only \u201cincurred to enforce that contract\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>but also on account of litigation, as here, \u201crelating to\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">But this is a judgment that is not ours to implement. In section 1717, the Legislature has prescribed with clarity that the public policy Moallem seeks to invoke presently applies only to attorney fees for contract actions, not tort claims. As <em>Xuereb </em>itself summarized, \u201cBy its terms . . . section 1717 has a limited application. It covers <em>only </em>contract actions, where the theory of the case is breach of contract, and where the contract sued upon itself specifically provides for an award of attorney fees incurred to enforce <em>that </em>contract.\u201d <em>(Xuereb, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 1342.) Fairly or not, this restriction has for 25 years denied tort litigants the benefits of section 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1833\">*1833</page-number>And so it must here. In this case the asymmetry of statutory rights between contract and tort litigants painfully appears, because Moallem could have invoked section 1717 had he prevailed on his contract claim instead of his tort claims. But that situation is a consequence only of the Legislature\u2019s enactment as it now stands. Although we can suggest that the statute be rewritten to take into account <em>Xuereb </em>and its progeny, we cannot perform that revision. The public policy underlying section 1717 may be clear. But a court is not free to advance the public policy that underlies a statute by extending the statute beyond its plain terms and established reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">We therefore conclude that because the present contract provided for recovery of attorney fees for tort actions \u201crelating to\u201d the contract by Coldwell only, Moallem\u2019s request for fees under that contract was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, with respect to the amount awarded. The superior court shall reduce that amount in conformity with this decision. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">Boren, P. J., and Gates, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 13, 1994, and the petition of appellant Steve Moallem for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 15, 1994.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1327-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1827.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">Section 1717 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to other costs. Q] Where a contract provides for attorney\u2019s fees, as set forth above, that provision shall be construed as applying to the entire contract, unless each party was represented by counsel in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and the fact of that representation is specified in the contract, [f] Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.

Moallem does not renew that particular argument here; he permissibly adduces a different legal rationale to be applied to the same facts.
