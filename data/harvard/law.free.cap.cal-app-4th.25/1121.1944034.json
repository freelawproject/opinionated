(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2), 12022, subd. (d).) In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that the minor\u2019s Fourth Amendment search and seizure rights were not violated when he consented to accompany two detectives to a police station for purposes' of interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>The minor argues that his confession was the product of an unlawful detention. Prior to the adjudication hearing, the minor moved to suppress his confession on search and seizure grounds pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 700.1. The motion was denied.  The following is the standard of review we are required to apply on appeal: \u201cAccordingly, we reaffirmed in <em>[People </em>v. <em>Lawler </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 160 (107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621)] that for the purpose of finding those facts \u2018the power to judge the credibility of the witnesses, resolve any conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial court. On appeal all presumptions favor the exercise of that power, and the trial court\u2019s findings on such matters, whether express or implied, must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 596-597 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 678 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].) When that standard of review is applied, the following was the state of the evidence taken in a light most favorable to the order denying the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">On April 21,1992, two Los Angeles Police Department detectives went to the minor\u2019s home in Fontana. The minor\u2019s mother came to the front door. The detectives asked if she was the minor\u2019s mother. She acknowledged she was. The detectives asked if they could enter the house and she said, \u201c[Y]es.\u201d She then opened the door so the detectives could enter. The detectives asked if they could speak to the minor. One of the detectives \u201cadvised her that we would like to talk to her son at Hollenbeck station regarding an incident that happened in the Hollenbeck area, and asked if she and her son didn\u2019t mind we\u2019d like to interview her son at Hollenbeck station.\u201d The minor\u2019s mother indicated he was expecting to stay the next evening at his grandmother\u2019s home. She asked the detectives to take him to his grandmother\u2019s home in the \u201cEl Sereno area\u201d after the interview. The detective indicated that \u201cif nothing occurs after the interview\u201d both he and his partner would ensure that the minor was taken to the grandmother\u2019s home. The minor was asked \u201cif he had any problem coming along.\u201d The minor said, \u201c[N]o, that he\u2019d like to pack a suitcase.\u201d The minor went to his bedroom and packed a suitcase. The minor accompanied the two detectives in a \u201cstandard four-door unmarked police vehicle\u201d on the 90-minute trip from Fontana to the Hollenbeck station in Los Angeles where he confessed after being advised of his constitutional rights. At no time did the minor indicate he wanted to leave. He was interrogated in the office of the station commander. When the minor indicated he was hungry, the detectives went to a nearby fast food establishment and purchased some breakfast. While the detectives went to purchase the food, the minor remained in the commander\u2019s office with the door open. There were some homicide investigators in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>nearby room. They were told the minor was sitting in the commander\u2019s office. The minor was told that if he had any questions he should \u201cjust holler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The foregoing testimony by a detective constituted substantial evidence that the minor consented to go to the police station and that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred.  In order for the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to come into play in the context of an arrest or a detention, it is necessary that a \u201cseizure\u201d of a person has occurred. Contact between state officers and an individual \u201cwill not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny unless it loses its consensual nature.\u201d <em>(Florida </em>v. <em>Bostick </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 429, 434 [115 L.Ed.2d 389, 398, 111 S.Ct. 2382].) The United States Supreme Court has set forth the following test for determining whether an individual has been \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment: \u201cThe test provides that the police can be said to have seized an individual \u2018only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that [she or] he was not free to leave.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Michigan </em>v. <em>Chesternut </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 567, 573 [100 L.Ed.2d 565, 572, 108 S.Ct. 1975].) Later, the Supreme Court noted: \u201cThe test\u2019s objective standard\u2014looking to the reasonable [person\u2019s] interpretation of the conduct in question\u2014allows the police to determine in advance whether the conduct contemplated will implicate the Fourth Amendment. [Citation.] This \u2018reasonable person\u2019 standard also ensures that the scope of Fourth Amendment protection does not vary with the state of mind of the particular individual being approached.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 574 [100 L.Ed.2d at p. 572].) In a thoroughly motley array of circumstances, appellate courts have held that when a person agrees to accompany the police to a station for interrogation or some other purpose, the Fourth Amendment is not violated. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Ortega-Santana </em>(1st Cir. 1989) 869 F.2d 12, 14 [\u201c. . . the inspectors\u2019 invitation to appellant was unaccompanied by any threat or show of force or other form of physical restraint.\u201d]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(Me. 1990) 580 A.2d 678, 681 [\u201c. . . the officer asked, not ordered, [the defendant] to accompany him to the . . . police station to make a statement.\u201d]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kramar </em>(1989) 149 Wis.2d 767 [440 N.W.2d 317, 323] [\u201c. . . notwithstanding the fact that the officers never expressly told the defendant that he did not have to accompany them to the police station, we conclude that under the circumstances outlined above, a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have concluded that such was the case.\u201d]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1988) 150 Vt. 438 [555 A.2d 369, 377] [\u201c. . . two police officers with a third nearby, in a manner neither threatening nor compelling asked defendant if he would mind going to the police station to answer some questions.\u201d]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Coy </em>(1983) 234 Kan. 414 [672 P.2d 599, 601] [\u201c. . . police officer . . . asked defendant to go to the police station to talk with him about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>rape incident and . . . defendant agreed to go.\u201d] <em>State </em>v. <em>Thibodeaux </em>(La. 1982) 414 So.2d 366, 368 [\u201cdefendant was approached by two plainclothes police officers at his house . . . [who] . . . advised him of his rights and requested that he accompany them to the police station.\u201d]; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska 1980) 621 P.2d 1, 2 [police officer asked defendant \u201c. . . would he mind coming down []\u201d to the police station in order to be fingerprinted]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1980) 299 N.C. 191 [261 S.E.2d 827, 830] [a detective \u201cidentified himself and told defendant that they would like to talk to him at the sheriff\u2019s department.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wipfler </em>(1977) 68 Ill.2d 158 [11 Ill.Dec. 262, 368 N.E.2d 870, 871] [defendant\u2019s mother informed that a detective \u201cwould like to talk to Steven about some burglaries under investigation\u201d and she said \u201cshe would tell Steven to go to the police station after school.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">In the present case, the minor\u2019s mother was asked if her son would accompany two detectives to the Hollenbeck station in Los Angeles. Additionally, the minor was asked if he would accompany the detectives from his home in Fontana. Further, the detectives agreed that if nothing developed as a result of the questioning at the Hollenbeck station, they would take the minor to his grandmother\u2019s house. At the station, the minor was apprised of his constitutional rights while eating breakfast with his interrogators in the station commander\u2019s office. Under these circumstances, substantial evidence supported the implied finding of the juvenile court that when all of the circumstances are viewed objectively, a reasonable person would have believed that he or she did not have to accompany the detectives to the Hollenbeck station. As a result, the minor\u2019s confession was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">III.
