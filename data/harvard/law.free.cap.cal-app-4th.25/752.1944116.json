Moustakas\u2019s claim for payment for legal services rendered. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>I. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The trial was recorded on videotape. No court reporter was present. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 270; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 980.5 and 980.6.) The record furnished for our review includes both a certified transcription of the audio portion of the videotape and an uncertified copy of the videotape. The latter is included in the appellant\u2019s appendix in lieu of clerk\u2019s transcript. The video image contains running subtitles showing the hour, minute, and second of recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In his brief, appellant cites specific portions of the videotape in support of three of his arguments. First, he argues that the videotape shows the trial court spent only forty-three seconds examining six documentary exhibits, one of which was seven pages long. Second, he argues that after he made an offer of proof, \u201cthe videotape reveals a very telling silence on the part of the court.\u201d Third, he argues that an 84-second segment of the videotape establishes that the trial court, while listening to his testimony regarding respondent\u2019s failure to render an itemized bill, had an itemized bill on the bench but failed to tell him.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">It was probably inevitable that those responsible for the practical aspects of judicial administration would decide to use video cameras to make a record of trial proceedings. Though this technology lacks the advantages of computerized court reporting, the visible and audible information thus recorded might be of value to many people, including judges. California Rules of Court, rule 980.5(i) provides that a videotape may be made part of the record on appeal upon stipulation of the parties and approval by the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The rules of court do not address the most important implication of the videotaping of trial proceedings. Many aspects of the time-honored rules limiting the scope of appellate review are based on the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to see and hear witnesses, attorneys, and jurors. A drastic change in the principles of appellate review would be needed before we could base our decisions on appeal on our own evaluation of the sights and sounds of the trial courtroom. Because of the far-reaching implications, any such change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>must come from the Legislature or from higher judicial authority. Accordingly, we do not regard the videotape as part of the record on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Costs to respondent. Both parties\u2019 requests for sanctions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Vogel (C. S.), Acting P. J\u201e and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 23, 1994, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 8, 1994.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Judge of the Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial District sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 752.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
