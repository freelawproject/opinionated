Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 232) to his son Curtis S. Curtis\u2019s maternal grandparents (Kenneth A. and Carol A.) petitioned for the termination approximately one year following the death of their daughter and Curtis\u2019s mother, Kelly S.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The grandparents sought Curtis\u2019s freedom from James\u2019s custody and control on grounds he had intentionally abandoned the child both before and after the mother\u2019s death by failing to support and communicate with him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> James raises a variety of issues, none of which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>meritorious. We affirm. In the published portion of this opinion, we determine that we are not authorized to appoint appellate counsel at the public\u2019s expense in a private section 232 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Facts and Proceedings<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">I.-VIL*</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">VIII. <em>Appellate Counsel for the Father</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">On this court\u2019s own motion, we questioned whether it was appropriate to appoint appellate counsel for the father, James. Counsel was initially appointed based on a miscategorization by the Central California Appellate Project (CCAP) that this was an appeal from a criminal conviction. Upon learning of this error, we revoked the appointment. We subsequently invited briefing on the issue not only from the parties but also from CCAP, as a friend of the court. It was and it remains this court\u2019s position that we lack the authority to appoint appellate counsel for a parent who challenges a termination order in a private section 232 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">While a parent is statutorily entitled to a court-appointed <em>trial </em>attorney in section 232 proceedings provided he or she is indigent (\u00a7 237.5, subd. (b)), the statutory right to appointed counsel <em>on appeal </em>is not as expansive. The Legislature directs the appellate courts to appoint appellate counsel for an indigent parent only if the child who was freed from parental custody was a juvenile court dependent. (\u00a7 237.7.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case, Curtis S. was not such a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">CCAP relies upon <em>In re Jacqueline H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 170 [145 Cal.Rptr. 548, 577 P.2d 683] in which the California Supreme Court construed then existing sections 237.5 and 238 to require a reviewing court to appoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>counsel for any indigent parent appealing from a section 232 termination order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, in 1984, well <em>after </em>the <em>Jacqueline H. </em>opinion, the Legislature added section 237.7. (Stats. 1984, ch. 605, \u00a7 1, p. 2326.) As noted above, the code provision on its face restricts a parent\u2019s right to appointed appellate counsel to situations in which the child who was freed from parental custody was a dependent child of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">While CCAP argues that a literal interpretation of section 237.7 raises a serious equal protection problem, we disagree. We find the parent who appeals a termination order in a private section 232 action and the parent who appeals a termination order in an action initiated by the state are not similarly situated for purposes of equal protection analysis. True, the parental rights of each have been terminated. However, in the former case, the state, with all of the legal and financial resources available to it, is not the respondent. In the more typical termination action brought by the state with regard to a juvenile court dependent, appointed appellate counsel is necessary to assure a \u201clevel playing field\u201d <em>(Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 242, 255 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 851 P.2d 1307]).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Alternatively, CCAP argues any indigent parent is entitled to appointed appellate counsel under either the federal or state Constitutions. However, we are not persuaded a constitutional mandate exists when a private party initiated the termination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"><em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 18, 31 [68 L.Ed.2d 640, 652, 101 S.Ct. 2153], a case on which CCAP relies, expressly rejected a claim that the federal Constitution required the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding. The United States Supreme Court announced there is a presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel <em>only </em>when there is at least a potential deprivation of physical liberty. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 26-27 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 648-649].) It also identified the private interests at stake, the government\u2019s interest and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions as the three elements which, when weighed against the presumption, could constitutionally require, on a case-by-case basis, court appointment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 27, 31 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 649, 652].)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We believe the concern for an \u201cequal contest of opposed interests\u201d <em>(Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 28 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 650]) is not as strong in an appeal from a private section 232 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>order as in an appeal in a termination action brought by the state. Therefore, we find no federal constitutional right to appointed appellate counsel when a parent appeals from a private section 232 termination order. (Cf. <em>In re Christina P. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 115, 129 [220 Cal.Rptr. 525].)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Likewise, we find no state constitutional right to appointed appellate counsel for a parent when a private party initiated the termination proceedings.  \u201cThe touchstone of due process is fundamental fairness. Whether due process requires the appointment of counsel in a particular case depends on the interests involved and the nature of the proceedings.\u201d <em>(Salas </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 22, 27 [154 Cal.Rptr. 529, 593 P.2d 226].)  We are persuaded that when a parent appeals from a termination order in a private section 232 action, due process does not require appointed counsel if the parent is indigent. Even though the parenting right is at stake, there is nothing fundamentally unfair about an appeal from a termination order in a private section 232 action in which the appealing parent either retains counsel or appears in propria persona before the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Finally, CCAP makes a public policy argument in favor of appointed appellate counsel for parents whose rights are terminated in private actions. However, this is not the proper forum for such an argument. This is a claim better made to the Legislature. In the absence of some constitutional requirement, infirmity in the statute or direction from a higher court, we are bound to follow the law as mandated by the Legislature. It is not our role to legislate or appropriate public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Martin, Acting P. 1, and Randall, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">All statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Effective January 1, 1994, the Civil Code sections cited in this opinion were repealed and reenacted in the new Family Code.
