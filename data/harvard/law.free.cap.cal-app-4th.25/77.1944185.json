J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azj\">Lester E. Dubins and Milton Sobel, appellants in these consolidated cases, were tenured professors at the University of California (University) compelled to retire at age 70 by a University policy they claim violates state law prohibiting age discrimination. The issue is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The appeals\u2014which challenge orders sustaining the University\u2019s general demurrers to the complaints without leave to amend<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014require us to interpret Government Code section 12942,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a provision of the Fair Employment and Housing Act. (\u00a7 12900 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Section 12942, which was originally enacted in 1980 and amended in significant particulars in 1983, states that \u201cEvery employer in this state shall permit any employee who indicates in writing a desire in a reasonable time and can demonstrate the ability to do so, to continue his or her employment beyond any retirement date contained in any private pension or retirement plan, [f] This employment shall continue so long as the employee demonstrates his or her ability to perform the functions of the job adequately and the employer is satisfied with the quality of the work performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Subdivision (a) of section 12942, which bears most directly on the issue before us, provides that sections 12941 (which generally prohibits age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>discrimination) and 12942 shall not be construed \u201cTo prohibit an institution of higher education . . . from imposing a retirement policy for tenured faculty members, <em>provided that the institution has a policy permitting reemployment of these individuals on a year-to-year basis.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The question is whether the University has such a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">As requested by the University, the trial court took judicial notice of Standing Order No. 103.6, promulgated by the Regents of the University, and a portion of the University\u2019s Academic Personnel Manual (APM) pertaining to the service of tenured faculty following retirement. Standing Order No. 103.6, as pertinent, provides that \u201cFor faculty members and other academic appointees who hold tenure or security of employment, the date of retirement shall be the July 1 coinciding with or next following the person\u2019s 70th birthday. . . . The President [of the Regents] may appoint on a year-to-year basis faculty members and other employees who have attained their applicable retirement age, as long as such appointments are not in conflict with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">APM 200-22, provides that \u201cAcademic appointees with tenure or security of employment . . . who have retired from the University of California may be recalled to active service on a year-to-year basis.\u201d The APM identifies four criteria that \u201cshall be considered in determining whether to recommend or approve a recall appointment: (1) The teaching, research, and/or administrative needs of the department or unit. (2) Availability of office and laboratory space. (3) Budgetary resources. (4) Ability of the candidate in the areas required for appointment in the particular academic title or series. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The parties advance sharply conflicting views as to the meaning of subdivision (a) of section 12942 and whether the policy described by Standing Order No. 103.6 and APM 200-22 is one \u201cpermitting reemployment\u201d within the meaning of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">According to appellants, the premise of the statute is \u201cthat employees who have reached \u2018retirement age\u2019 should be permitted to continue to work if they wish and are able to do so.\u201d According to appellants, the right of able individuals who have reached retirement age to continue to work is \u201cnullified\u201d by a policy that leaves the reemployment decision to the employer at its sole and unfettered discretion. The University\u2019s policy is a \u201csham,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>appellants argue, because when a tenured member of the faculty reaches retirement age the University typically \u201cremoves his or her budgetary allocation from the departmental budget, and then claims that he or she cannot be reemployed because the \u2018temporary academic staff budget\u2019 is inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The University responds that under appellants\u2019 interpretation of the statute the University could never impose retirement on a tenured member of the faculty who desired to continue to work. According to the University, \u201cthe Legislature unambiguously gave the University discretion to reemploy only some retired professors\u2014as circumstances warranted\u2014thus allowing the University to hire new professors, including women and minorities, and to promote intellectual debate with innovative and different ideas from those professors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The trial court agreed with the University. Based on its conclusion that the 1983 amendment did not require the University to \u201cdo anything more than have a policy,\u201d which could be as restrictive as it wished, the court concluded that the University \u201ccan impose restrictions on rehiring which make rehiring essentially ephemeral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Where, as here, the appeal is from a judgment of dismissal after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, we must assume the truth of all material facts properly pleaded by the plaintiff-appellant or reasonable inferences that may be drawn from such facts. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]; <em>First Nationwide Savings </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 173].) The trial court commits reversible error when it sustains a demurrer without leave to amend where the plaintiff has alleged facts showing entitlement to relief under any available theory. <em>(Platt </em>v. <em>Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate Services </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1444 [266 Cal.Rptr. 601]; <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Cariss </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 905, 908 [274 Cal.Rptr. 186]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Purvin </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1208, 1213 [256 Cal.Rptr. 827].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Appellants\u2019 principal cause of action for violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleges that instead of adopting the permissive policy prescribed by subdivision (a) of section 12942, \u201cthe University has adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and followed a practice that, by its terms and as applied, is intended to circumvent the requirement of the statute; has the intended effect of denying reemployment on account of age; and was applied against plaintiff because of his age and without good-faith consideration of his application for reemployment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We believe the complaint satisfactorily states a cause of action under the Fair Employment and Housing Act and that, accordingly, it was error to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">At the outset, we note our unwillingness to enter the debate as to whether mandatory retirement for university professors is good or bad social policy. As explained at considerable length in our opinion in <em>Rittenband </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 410, 425-432 [205 Cal.Rptr. 576], which pertains to the forced retirement of judges, we appreciate that reasonable arguments can be mustered both in support of and in opposition to mandatory retirement of individuals engaged in an intellectual enterprise affecting the public interest and welfare. Unlike <em>Kubik </em>v. <em>Scripps College </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 544 [173 Cal.Rptr. 539]\u2014holding that an earlier version of section 12942 authorizing compulsory retirement of university professors satisfied the rational basis standard of equal protection review\u2014appellants in this case are not questioning the constitutionality of the statute. The University\u2019s contention that mandatory retirement advances a legitimate state interest begs the question tendered in this case: whether the existing statute <em>authorizes </em>mandatory retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u201cThe meaning of the words of a statute, or to use the alternative approach favored by many courts, the intent of the Legislature, can only be determined with reference to the context in which the words are used; that is, with reference to such purpose as may be discerned from examining the entire enactment of which the words are part. A statutory phrase may be' said to be clear and unambiguous if the meaning assigned to it is not in conflict with other language in the same act. [Citations.] Thus, \u2018in analyzing the legislative usage of certain words, \u201c \u2018the objective sought to be achieved by a statute as well as the evil to be prevented is of prime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>consideration [Citation.]\u2019\u201d <em>(Leslie Salt Co. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Bay Conservation etc. Com. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 605, 614 [200 Cal.Rptr. 575], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">As earlier noted, subdivision (a) of section 12942\u2014the provision we are called upon to construe\u2014is part of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, the purpose of which is to prohibit certain forms of invidious discrimination. (See \u00a7 12920.) Thus, section 12921 states that \u201cThe opportunity to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical handicap, medical condition, marital status, sex, or age is hereby recognized as and declared to be a civil right.\u201d Similarly, section 12941, which immediately precedes the statute in question, makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to hire or employ, or to discharge, dismiss, suspend, or demote, any individual over the age of 40 on the ground of age, except in cases where the law compels or provides for such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Section 12942, which provides the most immediate context of the subdivision whose meaning we must discern, commences with the statement that \u201cEvery employer in this state shall permit any employee who indicates in writing a desire in a reasonable time and can demonstrate the ability to do so, to continue his or her employment beyond any retirement date contained in any private pension or retirement plan.\u201d The statute goes on to say that \u201c[t]his employment shall continue so long as the employee demonstrates his or her ability to perform the functions of the job adequately and the employer is satisfied with the quality of the work performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">As originally enacted in 1980, subdivision (a) of section 12942 provided that nothing in sections 12941 and 12942 \u201cshall be construed to prohibit compulsory retirement\u201d of any employee \u201cserving under a contract of unlimited tenure, or similar arrangement providing for unlimited tenure at an institution of higher education . . . .\u201d In other words, tenured professors at the University were originally exempt from the provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act barring mandatory retirement and could be forced to retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The 1983 amendment of subdivision (a) of section 12942 would therefore have accomplished nothing if, as the University claims, it vests the University with sole and essentially unconstrained discretion to decide whether to rehire a tenured professor who had reached retirement age, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>University already had that power.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Fair Employment and Housing Act never prevented an employer from rehiring an employee it was given the legal authority not to rehire if it wished to do so. The interpretation of section 12942 urged by the University therefore assigns a meaning to the statute that would render the 1983 amendment purposeless. The contention that the amendment was not intended to and did not work a change in the law is not persuasive.  As we stated in <em>Froid </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 832 [183 Cal.Rptr. 461], \u201c\u2018[t]he mere fact that the legislature enacts an amendment indicates that it thereby intended to change the original act by creating a new right or withdrawing an existing one. Therefore, any material change in the language of the original act is presumed to indicate a change in legal rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 837, quoting 1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1973) \u00a7 22.30, p. 178, fns. omitted; accord, <em>Twin Lock, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 754, 761 [344 P.2d 788]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Weitzel </em>(1927) 201 Cal. 116, 118 [255 P. 792, 52 A.L.R. 811]; <em>Abbott v. City of San Diego </em>(1958) 165 Cal.App.2d 511, 524 [332 P.2d 324].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We agree subdivision (a) of section 12942 would also be meaningless if it were construed to mean that tenured professors were automatically required to be rehired, because that result would obtain if the subdivision did not exist. But that is not the interpretation appellants urge nor the one we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">As appellants correctly point out, the compromise that was fashioned by the statute was to deprive a member of the faculty who had reached retirement age only of the conclusive presumption tenure provides that he or she is able to meet the University\u2019s performance standards. Section 12942, subdivision (a) now obliges a retirement aged member of the tenured faculty to annually show that he or she is not only desirous of continuing to work but able to perform to the satisfaction of the University. Because it was reasonable to believe the ability to maintain the high standards of scholarship and creativity required of tenured faculty might decline after age 70, the Legislature allowed the University to require a member of the faculty over that age to demonstrate, <em>year-by-year, </em>that he or she could still perform at a high level, a requirement not permitted to be imposed on other retirement age employees. In other words, section 12942, subdivision (a) relieves the University of the burden of showing that an elderly member of the tenured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>faculty should be deprived of tenure for good cause<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and shifts to such a person the burden of regularly demonstrating continuing competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Contrary to the University\u2019s claim, this interpretation is not inconsistent with the legislative history. The 1983 amendment to section 12942 was enacted as part of Assembly Bill No. 398 (Stats. 1983, ch. 666, p. 2614 et seq.), a comprehensive age discrimination measure that amended many other statutes as well. As originally introduced, the bill would simply have repealed the existing version of section 12942 permitting mandatory retirement of tenured faculty. The University opposed this provision and urged the author, Assemblyman Peter Chacon, to adopt language from the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act authorizing the mandatory retirement of tenured professors at age 70 but providing that \u201c[a]ny employee whose tenure contract is terminated <em>may, in the discretion of the institution, </em>be allowed to continue in the employ of the institution on a nontenured basis.\u201d (Italics added.) The University points to the fact that in remarks on the floor of the Assembly in support of Assembly Bill No. 398, Assemblyman Chacon stated: \u201cI have also agreed to accept the so-called \u2018Vermont\u2019 amendment, that would allow colleges and universities to mandatorily retire professors under their own policy, provided that there be provisions for rehiring on a year-to-year basis.\u201d According to the University, this statement demonstrates not only that \u201cthe author of the legislation believed that institutions of higher education had the discretion to refuse to reemploy retired professors, even if they were able to continue working,\u201d but that \u201c[t]he Legislature wholly embraced these sentiments.\u201d We cannot agree with either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">While it is true that courts inquiring into legislative purpose give consideration to statements made by the sponsor of a bill (see, e.g., <em>Galvan </em>v. <em>Press </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 522, 525-527 [98 L.Ed. 911, 918-920, 74 S.Ct. 737]; <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>F.T.C. </em>(5th Cir. 1985) 752 F.2d 116, 120-121), the rule that legislative intent may be inferred from the statement of the sponsor only applies to a sponsor\u2019s statement that is itself unambiguous. \u201cIsolated remarks by the sponsor of a bill that are ambiguous are not sufficient to demonstrate [legislative] intent.\u201d (2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th ed. 1994 supp.) \u00a7 48.15, p. 74, citing <em>Arkansas State Bank Commissioner </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>(8th Cir. 1990) 911 F.2d 161, 175, which in turn cites <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Rossi </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 25, 35 [71 L.Ed.2d 715, 723-724, 102 S.Ct. 1510].) Assemblyman Chacon\u2019s statement is no clearer than the measure it describes. The statement\u2014which refers to the bill\u2019s requirement \u201cthat there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>be provisions for rehiring on a year-to-year basis\u201d\u2014certainly does not show, as the University claims, that \u201cthe author of the legislation believed that institutions of higher education had the discretion to refuse to reemploy retired professors, even if they were able to continue working\u201d; still less does it show that any other member of the Legislature held such a view.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The principle that legislative intent may be inferred from the statements of a sponsor of a bill also \u201conly applies where the statement is consistent with the statutory language and other legislative history.\u201d (2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 48.15, p. 74, citing <em>DeVargas </em>v. <em>Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co., Inc. </em>(10th Cir. 1990) 911 F.2d 1377, 1387.)  Unlike the Vermont statute, subdivision (a) of section 12942 does <em>not </em>say that re-employment after termination of a tenure contract shall be left to \u201cthe discretion of the institution.\u201d Accordingly, there is no basis in our statute upon which to infer an intent to confer virtually unfettered discretion upon the University. Considering the purpose of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, of which the statute is part, and because the 1983 amendment would be meaningless if not construed to limit the unbounded discretion the University previously possessed, we think the language is more compatible with an intention to actually \u201cpermit\u201d\u2014i.e., to require\u2014reemployment on a year-to-year basis of tenured members of the faculty over the age of 70 whose continuing competence is annually established.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">This interpretation is consistent with the meaning ascribed to section 12942, subdivision (a) by the Trustees of the California State University. As noted in <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Trustees of Cal. State University </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1456 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 150], \u201c[t]he trustees\u2019 regulations provide that a tenured professor who reaches 70 years of age shall have the right to continue teaching only if, upon the professor\u2019s timely request, he is certified annually by the president of the particular university. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 43660, 43661.) Such certification \u2018shall be granted to the tenured faculty member whose job performance is standard or above.\u2019 (\u00a743663, subd. (d).).\u201d (19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1460, fn. omitted.) Moreover, the court in <em>Webster </em>suggests that section 12942, subdivision (a) denies employers the degree of discretion claimed by the University in the present case. As stated in <em>Webster, </em>\u201c[t]he statute permits a wide range of responses, from a full continuation of tenure beyond age 70 to a system with annual reviews at which the employee must \u2018demonstrate the ability to do\u2019 his or her job.\u201d (19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1461.) The court in <em>Webster </em>did not need \u201cto pass upon the outer limits of any policy establishing a less-vested type of posttenure employment,\u201d as we do, because, unlike the Regents of the University, \u201c[t]he trustees have in fact adopted a clear policy that is much closer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u2018unlimited tenure\u2019 end of the scale than the \u2018not vested\u2019 end of the scale.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We conclude that the complaint adequately states a cause of action under section 12942. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Smith, J., and Phelan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 22, 1994, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 7, 1994. Werdegar, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The notices of appeal from the identical orders sustaining the University\u2019s demurrers, which were both entered on June 23, 1992, are not appealable. (See, e.g., <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 644, 651 [150 Cal.Rptr. 242, 586 P.2d 556].) However, since judgments in favor of the University were duly entered in October 1992, after the notices of appeal were filed, no prejudice to the University would result, and dismissal of the appeal would serve no purpose, we exercise our authority under rule 2(c) of the California Rules of Court to treat the notices of appeal as premature but valid notices of appeal from the subsequently entered judgments of dismissal. (See, e.g., <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Sortini </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 220, 224, fn. 2 [182 Cal.Rptr. 337, 643 P.2d 954].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\">All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The complaints each allege a residual cause of action \u201cfor violation of public policy,\u201d which assertedly consists of having \u201cobtained] a statutory exemption from the prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>against age discrimination on the condition set forth [in section 12942, subdivision (a)], while practicing age discrimination in circumvention of that condition in deception of the Legislature.\u201d This cause of action is clearly redundant, because it assumes a violation of the statute which, if true, is sufficient to entitle appellants to all the relief they seek.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The University claims its discretion is constrained by the amendment in that the statute now requires it to promulgate a policy relating to reemployment of tenured faculty members at retirement age.
