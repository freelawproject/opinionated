(a)), and that he had served a prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). The court sentenced appellant to the upper term of six years for the assault and imposed consecutive enhancements of five years and one year, respectively, for the prior conviction and the prior prison term, making an aggregate prison sentence of twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">Appellant raises a multitude of issues on appeal. We will reject all of them except one relating to sentencing. We will conclude that the one-year enhancement must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-11\">On February 11, 1993, sometime after 8 p.m., Lisa L. picked up her four-year-old son at her sister\u2019s house in the Hanford, California, area and drove towards the residence which she shared with Ron Riso. Riso\u2019s three-year-old son was also in the car. As she drove, Lisa noticed another vehicle following very closely behind hers. The other vehicle continued to follow, \u201cpretty much bumper to bumper,\" as Lisa made at least three separate turns and drove on at least four streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-12\">As she arrived at her home, Lisa pulled her car into the driveway. The other vehicle, which was a small pickup truck, followed and stopped approximately a foot behind. Appellant, who had been driving the truck, got out and was standing near Lisa\u2019s car when she opened her door. Appellant said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you were someone else,\u201d turned, and appeared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1596\">*1596</page-number>getting back into his truck. Lisa, who was then out of her car, placed her purse atop the car and helped her son get out of the backseat. She was immediately confronted by appellant who told her to turn around and put her hands on top of the car. He then grabbed Lisa by the hair, pushed her back into the driver\u2019s seat, and told her not to look at him. As Lisa struggled to look up, appellant then shoved his free hand up inside her sweater or shirt. He placed his hand flat against her chest, touching both of her breasts outside her bra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Ron Riso was inside the house. His attention was attracted outside when he heard the two boys shouting. Looking out a window he saw Lisa in the driver\u2019s seat of her car with another person on top of her. Riso went outside and pulled appellant off Lisa. As he did so he saw appellant\u2019s hand coming out from under her shirt. Riso asked appellant what he was doing, and when he received no response, he hit appellant with his fist. Appellant ran around his truck, but Riso pursued and continued to hit appellant. At one point appellant offered Riso $100 \u201cif you let me go right now.\u201d Riso struck him again, grabbed the keys to appellant\u2019s truck and locked appellant inside. Sheriffs deputies were called. When they arrived, appellant was sitting in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Appellant was arrested. After being \"Mirandized\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he said he did not want to discuss the incident but volunteered a spontaneous statement that \u201cI got a call saying my old lady was at that address. I went there, saw someone who looked like her; that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Appellant testified that about 7 p.m. on February 11 he received a phone call from someone with whom he used to work. The caller told him the woman appellant had been dating was seeing some other man at an address on Curtis Street in Hanford. Appellant drove to that address, saw Lisa L. as she got out of her car, said, \u201cNo, you ain\u2019t the one,\u201d and was then attacked by Riso. He denied telling Lisa to place her hands atop her car, having any physical contact with Lisa, or offering Riso money to let him go. He admitted that in 1989 he was convicted on two counts of false imprisonment and two counts of attempted kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">During the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal, the court, over appellant\u2019s objection, admitted testimony by two women concerning two separate incidents occurring on September 11, 1988. Each witness testified that she was driving in the Hanford area that night and was followed home by appellant who approached her asking for directions. In each incident appellant pulled a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1597\">*1597</page-number>knife, placed it near the victim\u2019s throat, and attempted to get the woman to go with him. He put his hand on the blouse and bra of each victim, fondling the breast of one, and put a hand underneath the skirt of one, touching her panties. Appellant fled from the scene of each incident, in one case after the victim began honking her car\u2019s horn, and in the other when the victim\u2019s passenger, who had been sleeping, attempted to help the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">I. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">The crime of which appellant was convicted, assault with intent to commit rape, requires proof that he intended to have sexual intercourse with Lisa and to use force to overcome her resistance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nye </em>(1951) 38 Cal.2d 34, 37 [237 P.2d 1].)  Appellant concedes there was substantial evidence from which the jury could find he intended \u201csomething sexual,\u201d committed forcibly or without consent. He claims, though, that the evidence fell short of showing he intended to accomplish an act of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">\u201cThe proper test for determining a claim of insufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is whether, on the entire record, a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.] On appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the People and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].) While \u201c. . . we must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value,\u201d we are not permitted to reweigh the evidence, reappraise the credibility of the witnesses, or resolve factual conflicts, as these are functions reserved for the trier of fact. <em>(Ibid.; People </em>v. <em>Culver </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 542, 548 [111 Cal.Rptr. 183, 516 P.2d 887]; <em>In re Frederick G. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 353, 367 [157 Cal.Rptr. 769].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">\u201cThe specific intent with which an act is done may be shown by a defendant\u2019s statement of his intent and by the circumstances surrounding the commission of the act.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duke </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 296, 300 [219 Cal.Rptr. 873].) \u201cIn objectively assessing a defendant\u2019s state of mind during an encounter with a victim, the trier of fact may draw inferences from his conduct, including any words the defendant has spoken.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1154 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 276].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">Appellant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 622 [110 Cal.Rptr. 160], in which a conviction of assault with intent to commit rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1598\">*1598</page-number>was reversed, the appellate court concluding there was insufficient evidence of the specific intent. The victim, Linda, was a 16-year-old girl walking towards her home from a baby-sitting job. The <em>Greene </em>court summarized the victim\u2019s testimony as follows: \u201c. . . The defendant, who approached from the direction in which Linda was walking, put his arm around her waist and turned her around. She thought his conduct was unusual, and she was startled and afraid. Defendant spoke in a soft voice and said, \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid. I have a gun. Don\u2019t move.\u2019 The defendant was on her right with his left arm around her waist, and she felt something hard against her right side. She did not look down to see whether it was a gun and did not know whether it was his finger, or a piece of metal or wood. The defendant told her to be quiet. At his request she placed her right arm around his waist and they started walking in the opposite direction from which she had been headed. Linda asked the defendant, \u2018What do you want?\u2019 or \u2018Oh God, what do you want?\u2019 and he replied, T just want to play with you.\u2019 She also remonstrated, \u2018Don\u2019t hurt me.\u2019 As they walked slowly the defendant had a hold of Linda and moved his left hand up and down her waistline, a little bit, in a manner which she demonstrated to the jury. An objection was sustained to Linda\u2019s volunteered statement, \u2018He just put his hand where he\u2019s not supposed to,\u2019 and a question and answer indicating he did \u2018other things.\u2019 When defendant indicated that he was going to play with her, Linda attempted to get away and shook her head and said \u2018No, no.\u2019 The defendant told her to stop it and be quiet. Linda remained quiet and then broke from defendant\u2019s embrace without a struggle, screamed and ran to a friend\u2019s home. According to Linda she only walked with the defendant past a couple of houses, and the whole incident took no more than six or seven minutes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The court concluded that Linda\u2019s testimony \u201cwhen considered alone falls short of furnishing substantial evidence that the defendant assaulted her with intent to commit rape.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Greene, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d at p. 651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">The court also referred to evidence of other similar incidents involving the defendant which had been admitted at trial. In one incident, which occurred about four weeks prior to the one involving Linda, the defendant approached a fifteen-year-old girl who was walking home from a school dance. He told the girl he wanted to talk with her, but she tried to avoid him. The defendant continued to follow the girl, eventually grabbing her, pinning her arm with one of his arms, and shoving his other hand into her vaginal area. The girl freed her hand, hit the defendant with a pen, and broke away screaming until she entered her house. The appellate court concluded that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s acts on that occasion \u201ccould not impart greater meaning to similar acts\u201d against Linda. (34 Cal.App.3d at p. 652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">A third victim (Miss K.), who was 15 or 16 at the time of the incidents, testified that she was accosted by the defendant on 4 occasions about 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1599\">*1599</page-number>months before the assault on Linda. In each of those incidents the defendant exposed himself, in three he expressed a desire to have sexual intercourse, and twice he offered the victim money for sex. The reviewing court opined that although that evidence may have shown some sexual motivation, it was \u201cof little if any persuasive value on the issue to commit sexual intercourse, as distinguished from lascivious acts\u201d in the incident involving Linda, during which the defendant neither said he desired intercourse, exposed himself, nor offered Linda money. The court further noted that the evidence was \u201cof no persuasive value on the issue of intent to use force.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Greene, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d at p. 653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Respondent argues that this case is factually distinguishable from <em>Greene </em>and cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradley, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th 1144 as support for its assertion that sufficient evidence of a specific intent to rape is present here. In <em>Bradley </em>the defendant accosted a 16-year-old girl who was using a public telephone at nighttime outside a restaurant. He grabbed her by the hand and upper arm and walked her around the side of the building to a more dimly lighted dumpster area which was enclosed with a six-and-one-half-foot high block wall. He then pulled the victim\u2019s hair and head back, kissed her neck, and tried to kiss her mouth. Another man who was with the defendant and helped him guide the victim to the dumpster area said he would not mind \u201cgetting a \u2018piece of that\u2019 \u201d and the defendant responded: \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I will.\u2019 \u201d The defendant used his free hand to caress the victim under her shirt and under her shorts to within an inch of her vaginal area. The victim could feel the defendant\u2019s erection pressing against her back. The assault stopped abruptly when car lights shone into the dumpster area and the victim kicked the defendant in the shins, after which he and his companion fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The <em>Bradley </em>court held that the evidence sufficiently supported the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had the specific intent to commit rape. (15 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1154-1155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">As we view them, the facts of this case fall somewhere between those in <em>Greene </em>and those in <em>Bradley. </em>We see three important areas in which comparisons may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">In <em>Greene </em>the defendant assured his victim that he only wanted to \u201cplay\u201d with her, indicating that rape was not his goal. In <em>Bradley </em>the defendant and his companion exchanged comments about \u201cgetting a \u2018piece of that\u2019 \u201d which suggested that intercourse was the defendant\u2019s aim. Here, appellant made no statements suggesting that his intent was to commit rape or that it was not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1600\">*1600</page-number>There was, however, evidence that in a prior assault on another victim, under very similar circumstances, appellant said \u201ccome with me now, or I\u2019ll do it here, now\u201d and \u201cI want you now.\u201d While those statements may be susceptible of more than one meaning, the phrase \u201cdo it\u201d is frequently employed as a euphemism for other terms connoting an act of sexual intercourse, and \u201cI want you\u201d can be interpreted as stating a desire for intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">In <em>Greene </em>the defendant\u2019s physical act was putting his arm around the victim\u2019s waist and moving his hand around her waistline, all of which was consistent with his declaration that he only wanted to \u201cplay\u201d with her. In <em>Bradley </em>the defendant placed his hand under the victim\u2019s clothing, touching her breast and coming close to her vaginal area. Here appellant placed his hand under Lisa\u2019s shirt to her breasts. There was also evidence that in a prior similar attack on another victim appellant slid his hand up her skirt to her panties. The evidence of physical acts leading towards intercourse was stronger here than it was in <em>Greene.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Finally, in <em>Greene </em>the assault ended when the victim simply pulled away from the defendant without a struggle, and he did not pursue her. In both <em>Bradley </em>and this case, though, the attacker was interrupted by some intervening force. A reasonable inference can be drawn that appellant would have continued to pursue a sexual end if Riso had not physically pulled appellant off Lisa and struck him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">Appellant also cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Raley </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 870 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 678, 830 P.2d 712], in which the Supreme Court found evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction for attempted oral copulation. In <em>Raley </em>the defendant locked two girls (Jeanine and Laurie), ages 16 and 17, in a basement safe, required them to remove their clothes, handcuffed them as they emerged from the safe in their underwear, brandished a large knife, and told the girls he would release them after they \u201cfool[ed] around\u201d with him for 5 minutes. He led Jeanine to a separate area. Laurie heard Jeanine scream. After about 15 minutes the defendant and Jeanine, now clothed, returned. Jeanine appeared frightened and her lips and face were purple, possibly from cold. The defendant then led Laurie to a kitchen and forced her to orally copulate and manually manipulate his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">After the sexual attacks on Laurie, the defendant stabbed and beat each girl numerous times and placed them in the trunk of his car. Many hours later, after further beatings, he threw them down a ravine. Laurie was able to crawl up a hill and flag down help. When rescuers arrived, Jeanine was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1601\">*1601</page-number>alive and, hearing someone mention rape, became distraught and explained she had not been raped, but that the defendant had made her remove her clothes and \u201cfool around\u201d with him. Tragically, Jeanine died as emergency room doctors tried to treat the injuries inflicted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">The defendant was convicted by a jury of several offenses, including attempted oral copulation by force against Jeanine. The Supreme Court held, however, that while there was \u201csubstantial evidence of a forcible sexual attack of some kind on Jeanine,\u201d the inference that because he committed a forcible oral copulation against Laurie he may have attempted the same against Jeanine was based on \u201clayers of inference far too speculative to support the conviction.\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 890.) The court stated that because the defendant forced Laurie to engage in more than one type of sexual activity, the phrase \u201cfooling around\u201d apparently meant more than one thing to him and was not necessarily restricted to oral copulation. The court flirther rejected as speculative the argument that Jeanine used the term as referring to oral copulation even if that was the sense in which the defendant used it. Finally, the court found significance in the fact that the jury found not true a special circumstance allegation that Jeanine\u2019s murder occurred in the commission or attempted commission of oral copulation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 891.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">The factual pattern and the issue considered in <em>Raley </em>are so different from those here that we do not consider it controlling. In <em>Raley </em>the question was not limited to the defendant\u2019s intent but extended to what his actual conduct was. The only evidence of <em>any </em>sexual attack on Jeanine was an inference drawn from all the circumstances, but those circumstances did not reveal the nature of the sexual assault. There was no evidence as to what precisely occurred between the defendant and Jeanine while they were outside Laurie\u2019s presence, and there was no physical evidence of an attempted oral copulation. Without knowing what the defendant did or tried to do to Jeanine, the <em>Raley </em>jury could only speculate on whether his conduct was consistent or inconsistent with an attempt to accomplish forcible oral copulation. Here, by contrast, Lisa directly testified that appellant forcibly grabbed her and placed one of his hands under her clothing. That conduct is consistent with an intent to commit rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">Even if the <em>Raley </em>defendant\u2019s intent to commit forcible oral copulation could be inferred from his \u201cfool around\u201d statement, he could not be convicted of an attempt to commit that crime without substantial evidence of a direct but ineffectual act done toward its commission. (\u00a7 21a.) Here there was clearly substantial evidence that appellant committed a sexual assault on Lisa, the only question being whether he had the requisite specific intent to rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1602\">*1602</page-number>Respondent cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Dobson </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 1177 [91 Cal.Rptr. 443] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Collier </em>(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 861 [249 P.2d 72], both of which found sufficient evidence to support a conviction of assault with intent to commit rape when a man assaulted a woman without attempting to steal money or property from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Appellant acknowledges the cases cited by respondent, but argues that whatever strength those cases may have previously had was lost in 1982 when the Legislature enacted section 243.4, defining the crime of sexual battery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to appellant, . . [T]he very existence of [] section 243.4 reflects a more discriminating and exacting approach to the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1603\">*1603</page-number>sex crimes. And the Legislature, which has seen fit to include within the ambit of section 220 assaults with intent to commit any number of other sex crimes (see Stats. 1979, ch. 944, \u00a7 3), has chosen <em>not </em>to include within its ambit an assault with intent to commit \u2018sexual battery.\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In his closing brief appellant continues the argument: \u201c. . . [T]oday, when it is proved the assailant intended (only) \u2018something sexual\u2019\u2014such as to touch the woman\u2019s private parts, or to look at them\u2014what has been proven is an intent to commit \u2018sexual battery,\u2019 not an intent to commit rape.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">Appellant seems to argue that evidence sufficient under the sexual battery statute is necessarily insufficient under section 220. We fail to see the logic of that argument. Indeed, it seems precluded by section 243.4, subdivision (g), which expressly provides that \u201c[t]his section shall not be construed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1604\">*1604</page-number>limit or prevent prosecution under any other law which also proscribes a course of conduct that also is proscribed by this section.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">We are not persuaded that the Legislature, by simply enacting section 243.4, intended to affect the degree or type of proof required to show an assault with intent to commit rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">We believe from the entire melange of circumstances shown by the evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that appellant assaulted Lisa with the specific intent of committing rape. All of his conduct was consistent with that intent. Nothing he did or said indicated that he intended only to place his hands on her body or to accomplish some sexual act short of or different from intercourse. While other reasonable inferences also might be drawn, it was for the jury, not us, to draw them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">II.-VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">The matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to strike one-year enhancement of appellant\u2019s sentence for his prior prison term under section 667.5, subdivision (b), and to send to the Department of Corrections a corrected abstract of judgment. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">Ardaiz, Acting P.
