However, we may accept as a correct statement of the law the language of the decision quoted by appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-15\">\u201cFor an act to be \u2018dishonest\u2019 within the meaning of a fidelity surety-ship bond, there must exist the element of moral turpitude or want of integrity.\u201d Commercial Banking Corp. v. Indemnity Insurance Co. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>North America, D.C., 1 F.R.D. 380, 382.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">This Court has approved the charge \u2022of a trial court to the effect that the words \u201cpersonal dishonesty\u201d in such a toond \u201cmight include any acts which \u2022evinced a want of integrity and an intentional breach of trust.\u201d United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Bank of Thorsby, 5 Cir., 46 F.2d 950, 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The proof submitted to the trial \u25a0court here amply supported the court\u2019s .findings of facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It cannot be doubted, it seems to us, that the course of conduct here found by the court to exist amounted to \u201cacts [evincing] a want of integrity and an intentional breach of trust,\u201d the standard set in the Bank of Thorsby case, supra, or that they contained the \u201celements of moral turpitude,\u201d which appellant says is the standard. A willful and flagrant violation of a fiduciary trust to the detriment of the one who imposes the trust is an act of grave moral turpitude in the sense used by the court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AsZ\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">. The relevant provision of the contract is:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u201cIn consideration of an agreed premium the Glens Falls Indemnity Company, a corporation of tlio State of New York, with its Homo Office in the City of Glens Falls, N. Y., hereinafter called Underwriter, hereby agrees to indemnify</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">National Floor and Supply Company of 1807 N. Orange Ave., Orlando, Florida, hereinafter called Insured, against any loss of money or other property, real or personal (including that part of any inventory shortage which the Insured shall conclusively prove 1ms been caused by the fraud or dishonesty of any Employee or Employees) belonging to the Insured, or in which the Insured has a pecuniary interest, or for which the Insured is legally liable, or held by the Insured in any capacity whether the Insured is legally liable therefor or not, which the Insured shall sustain and discover as provided in Section 2, the amount of indemnity on each of such Employees being</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Ten Thousand and No/100 . . . Dollars (\u00a710,000.00)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">through any fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by any one or more of the Employees as defined in Section 3, acting alone or in collusion with others, during the term of this bond as defined in Section 1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-12\">. For cases decided by this Court dealing with the effect of such a provision see Now Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. W. D. Felder &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 214 F.2d 823; Cobb v. American Bonding Co. of Baltimore, 5 Cir., 118 F.2d 643. In the latter case the Court pretermitted the question. See also Morrow Retail Stores v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., D.C., 111 F.Supp. 772.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-18\">. Although appellant\u2019s counsel in oral argument questioned the sufficiency of proof as to the actual inventory shortage and as to the time when any proven shortage occurred, neither of these matters was mentioned in appellant\u2019s brief nor in the statement of points to be relied on. In its statement of points on which it claims the trial court erred it did not assert that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the court\u2019s verdict as to any matter except the alleged fraud or dishonesty. The statement as to all other facts merely complained that the judgment \u201cwas against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-19\">. Rule 24, subd. 2(b) of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A., provides that the brief of appellant shall contain \u201cA specification of the errors relied upon, which shall set out separately and particularly each error asserted and intended to be urged. Errors not specified according to this rule will be disregarded; but the court, at its option, may notice a plain error not specified.\u201d The failure to put ap-pellee on notice that it would argue these additional points would prevent this from being a case in which this Court should make an exception to the rule. Moreover, no plain error appears.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">. \u201c(1) The Court by requesting admissions from the Plaintiff and the Defendant, Glens Falls Indemnity Co., reduced the issue in this cause to proof of the actual loss caused by the fraudulent and dishonest acts of the employee of the Plaintiff and the compliance by the Plaintiff of notice of loss to the Defendant, Glens Falls Indemnity Co., as per the terms of the Fidelity Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u201c(2) The Plaintiff in behalf of its cause presented the testimony of six witnesses and its original records and books of account, and the Defendant, Glens Falls Indemnity Co., offered the testimony of \u2022one expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u201c(3) The 3rd party Defendant, George &lt;R.
