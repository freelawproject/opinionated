The Major had been assigned to and was occupying with his wife and two children quarters suitable for a married officer at the Air Force Base located on Government property. He and his wife and their two children died as the result of an accident which occurred at 6:45 o\u2019clock on the morning of December 17, 1953. The accident was occasioned by a plane's crashing into the dwelling occupied by the officer and his family. At the time of the fatal crash, Major Orken and his family apparently were still asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">The issue is whether the joint administrators of Major Orken can recover under the Federal Tort Claims Act in the circumstances of the case, in the face of the decision of the Supreme Court in Feres v. United States of America, 340 U.S. 135, 136, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152, wherein recovery was denied in a case where a Lieutenant quartered in barracks was killed as the result of injuries sustained through the negligence of a fellow soldier.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">In a carefully considered and well-reasoned opinion, United States District Judge Darr held the Feres case to be controlling and found no differentiation in principle between the Feres case and the instant one. Compare United States v. United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n, 8 Cir., 238 F.2d 364. We concur in Judge Darr\u2019s reasoning and upon that basis affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
