Relator argues that the Board did not really exercise its discretion but erroneously considered him \u201ctechnically \u2018ineligible\u2019 \u201d for relief. We disagree. The decision and order of the Board show clearly that its action was, as it stated, \u201con discretionary grounds\u201d after reviewing the facts and considerations pro and con.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">2. Relator\u2019s main contention is that the warrant of arrest for deportation issued in 1924 upon his arrival in this country, was invalid and hence the 1924 deportation order was likewise defective. As the next deportation order was issued in 1932, the relator claims it was invalid because of the expiration of the five-year statute of limitations contained in the first clause of \u00a7 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-12\">\u201c(a). At any time within five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law; * * * shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and deported * * 39 Stat. 889, former 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">But one of the grounds for petitioner\u2019s deportation was entry without possession of a properly visaed passport in violation of the Passport Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 559, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 223-226, and the Presidential Proclamation thereunder, Aug. 8, 1918, 40 Stat. 1829, and he was therefore also deportable under the second clause of this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-19\">\u201c * * * any alien who shall have entered or who shall be found in the United States in violation of this Act, or in violation of any other law of the United States; * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">Felich v. Meier, 8 Cir., 1927, 23 F.2d 185, as to which clause the Supreme Court has held that the five-year limitation does not apply. Costanzo v. Tillinghast, 1932, 287 U.S. 341, 53 S.Ct. 152, 77 L.Ed. 350. The 1932 and subsequent deportation orders were therefore timely, and the writ of habeas corpus was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"agi-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-14\">. Now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254(a) (1, 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
