The next day he surrendered; and meanwhile he had made no attempt to leave the area under control of American troops. He had had no intention to \u201cexpatriate\u201d himself or to become a national of any other country. Nor did he attempt to have any contact with any enemy of the United States, or to desert to any enemy of the United States or to any foreign country; and no claim was made in the court-martial proceedings that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>As will appear, we do not find enough doubt of the constitutionality of the statute to resort to any but the natural meaning of the words: i.e., that \u201cin time of war\u201d desertion of any kind results in \u201cexpatriation.\u201d Indeed, the proviso for possible restoration of \u201cnationality\u201d makes it impossible to suppose that the crime was confined to desertion to the enemy. It was true that at common law no subject could throw off his allegiance, and apparently the sovereign could not \u201cexpatriate\u201d him. However, the Supreme Court, in Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299, 36 S.Ct. 106, 60 L. Ed. 297, held that the Act of 1907, 34 Stat. 1228, was valid which \u201cexpatriated\u201d a woman who married an alien in this country; and that too although she had not intended to surrender her citizenship, and did not suppose that she was doing so. Again, in Savorgnan v. United States, 338 U.S. 491, 70 S.Ct. 292, 94 L.Ed. 287, a native citizen in 1940 married a citizen of Italy then in this country, and between 1941 and 1945 lived with him in Italy as his wife. She came back to this country on an Italian passport, and the action, like that at bar, was to obtain a judgment recognizing her continued status as a citizen, on the ground that, although she knew that she was being naturalized as an Italian (that being a condition, as her husband told her, of the validity of her marriage),, she did not know that she would forfeit her American status, and did not intend to surrender it. Nevertheless the court held that under the Act of 1940 she had done so, because her \u201cplace of general abode\u201d between 1941 and 1945 had been Italy, \u00a7 1101(a) (33), Title 8 U.S.C.A. See also Revedin v. Acheson, 2 Cir., 194 F.2d 482, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 820, 73 S.Ct. 17, 97 L.Ed. 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The important point in both these decisions is, not the especial \u201cobjective\u201d facts that the court accepted as the test, but that on both occasions the citizen forfeited her \u201cnationality,\u201d not only without supposing that she was doing so, but against her purpose. It is true that the act must not be that of an infant, Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 334, 59 S. Ct. 884, 889, 83 L.Ed. 1320: \u201cExpatriation is the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of nationality and allegiance. It has no application to the removal from this country of a native citizen during minority. In such a case-the voluntary action which is of the essence of the right of expatriation is lacking.\u201d We will also assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the same is true when the act is-under duress ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but when it is voluntary and the actor is <em>sui juris, </em>it is not necessary that he shall be aware that what he does will \u201cexpatriate\u201d him, any more than it is in many other situations where the law imposes liability regardless of the actor\u2019s knowledge of the legal effects of his act.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">There is still another reason why we may not limit the word \u201cdesertion\u201d to desertion to an enemy of the United States. Section 1483(a) of Title 8 provides that, except for subsections (7), (8) and (9), none of the acts mentioned in \u00a7 1481, shall result in \u201cexpatriation\u201d if they' occur within the United States, unless they are followed by a \u201cresidence outside the United States.\u201d Subdivision (7) provides for a \u201cformal written renunciation,\u201d subdivision (9) is for treason and subdivision (8) is the one at bar. Thus Congress provided that \u201cin time of war\u201d desertion within the United States should at once and unconditionally result in \u201cexpatriation\u201d if determined by the conviction of a court-martial, and it would be most unreasonable to confine desertions \u201cwithin the United States\u201d to desertions to an enemy.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">We have not considered, and do not consider, whether under the circumstances at bar \u201cexpatriation\u201d was, or was not, a \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff did not suggest anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>of the kind in his complaint, or upon the motion for summary judgment; Judge Inch did not mention it in disposing of the motion, nor did the plaintiff do so in argument. The only part of the brief that by the widest latitude could be considered as so much as a vague intimation of the sort is a passage on page 11; and that did not mention the Amendment, but appears to be a part of the general argument that all involuntary expatriation is a denial of \u201cDue Process of Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\">. See Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. ,133, 73 S.Ct. 135, 97 L.Ed. 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b582-5\">CLARK, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8r\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">I am constrained to disagree with both the substance and the procedural form of the result here reached. Plaintiff-appellant has cited to us and obviously relied on the masterful analysis of expatriation legislation set forth in the Comment, The Expatriation Act of 1954, 64 Yale L.J. 1164, 1189-1199. I agree with the author\u2019s documented conclusions therein that punitive expatriation of persons with no other nationality constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and is invalid as such. Since I doubt if I can add to the persuasive arguments there made, I shall merely incorporate by reference. In my faith, the American concept of man\u2019s dignity does not comport with making even those we would punish completely \u201cstateless\u201d \u2014 fair game for the despoiler at home and the oppressor abroad, if indeed there is any place which will tolerate them at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On procedure I think we are bound as judges to face and decide this issue. It is unfair to the capable and experienced lawyer who presented this appeal to hold that he did not present this argument. For what other possible reason could he have made the specific and exact citation I have given above? His refreshingly brief statement, I conceive, needed no more. But I had supposed that we were bound in any event to do justice and administer the law as between the parties who have come before us.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
