There was ample \u25a0substantial evidence to support the ver-dict.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">The argument of appellants is \u25a0that they were entrapped unlawfully by A. T. U. officials. In our judgment, the point is not well taken, as revealed by the evidence in the record. The fact that officers of the United States merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of an offense, although artifice and strategem may be employed to catch persons engaged in criminal enterprises, does not constitute unlawful entrapment. Unlawful entrapment is constituted only where the criminal design originates with Government officials and such officials implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit an offense and induce its commission in order to prosecute the offender. Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 441, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413. See also Grimm v. United States, 156 U. S. 604, 610, 15 S.Ct. 470, 39 L.Ed. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
