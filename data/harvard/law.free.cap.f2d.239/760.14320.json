But we think that a jury issue was properly presented And resolved. Plaintiff, an independent trucker, was commissioned to deliver an \u25a08,500 pound transformer from defendant\u2019s freight terminal in New York City to the consignee. On the loading platform defendant\u2019s agents used, in order to lift the rear end of the transformer, a lifting device known as a \u201chilo\u201d with a capacity of 3,000 pounds. In the course of the operation the transformer came down upon plaintiff\u2019s hand, causing serious injury. Under the attendant circumstances the jury could properly find that the defendant\u2019s agents were negligent in overloading the hilo, that this caused the injury, and that plaintiff lacked knowledge of the hilo\u2019s capacity and did not participate in its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"AUaz\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
