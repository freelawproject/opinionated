S. patent; and that the appellants had failed to join the Secretary of Interior as an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">The appellants take the position that the minerals were reserved by the United States Government in the original patents; that the subsequent reservation of the minerals by the appellee in deeds to settlers was therefore ineffectual; that the appellee holds the minerals in trust for the public; and that attempted leasing is ultra vires and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">The uncontroverted facts are well stated in the exhaustive and well reasoned opinion of the trial court. See D.C., 139 F.Supp. 588. It is sufficient to say that we fully agree with the trial court and can add nothing to the completeness of its opinion. Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
