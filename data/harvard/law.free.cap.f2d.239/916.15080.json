United States, 1943, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819, requires, exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>sion of the testimony concerning appellant\u2019s oral confession. We conclude that it does, because, like the McNabbs, appellant confessed as a result of being \u201cquestioned while held in \u2018plain disregard of the duty enjoined by Congress upon Federal law officers\u2019 promptly to take them before a judicial officer.\u201d Upshaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410, 413, 69 S.Ct. 170, 171, 93 L.Ed. 100. And in that view of the case, we do not reach the question of legal effect of psychological mistreatment of the appellant during questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Rule 5(a) .of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure directs that arrested persons must be taken \u201cwithout unnecessary delay before * * * [an] officer empowered to commit persons * *<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 5 (b) empowers the committing officer to admit such persons to bail and directs him to inform such persons of the complaint against them, their right not to make a statement and that any statement they do make may be used against them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Emphasing that this required procedure \u201cchecks resort to those reprehensible practices known as the \u2018third degree\u2019 * * 318 U.S. at page 344, 63 S.Ct. at page 614, the Supreme Court in McNabb established a rule of evidence excluding confessions \u201csecured through * * * flagrant disregard of the procedure which Congress has commanded * * Id., 318 U.S. at page 345, 63 S.Ct. at page 615. In describing the circumstances in which the commitment requirements were violated there, the Court mentioned not only that the McNabbs had not been brought promptly before a magistrate, but in addition described the unremitting and obviously oppressive interrogation to which they had been subjected. Id., 318 U.S. at pages 344-345, 63 S.Ct. at pages 614-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">Thereafter, in United States v. Mitchell, the Court said, \u201cInexcusable detention for the purpose of illegally extracting evidence from an accused, and the successful extraction of such inculpatory statements by continuous questioning for many hours under psychological pressure, were the decisive features in the McNabb case * * 1944, 322 U.S. 65, 67, 64 S.Ct. 896, 897, 88 L.Ed. 1140. Mr. Justice Reed, concurring in the result, considered this \u201ca desirable modification of the McNabb case.\u201d Id., 322 U.S. at page 71, 64 S.Ct. at page 899. The confession was held admissible, however, on the sole ground that there had been \u201cno disclosure induced by illegal detention * * The accused had confessed \u201cwithin a few minutes of his arrival at the police station,\u201d and his subsequent illegal detention for eight days did not \u201cretroactively change the circumstances under which he made the disclosures.\u201d Id., 322 U.S. at pages 69, 70, 64 S.Ct. at page 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">Four years later, the Court decided Upshaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410, 69 S.Ct. 170, 93 L.Ed. 100. Up-shaw had confessed after being held for interrogation without arraignment for more than 30 hours, and his confession had been admitted at the trial. This court, despite the Government\u2019s confession of error, affirmed the conviction on the ground that there had been no coercion, physical or psychological, during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>the illegal detention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We stressed, as the Supreme Court pointed out, that Up-shaw\u2019s \u201cdetention unlike McNabb\u2019s, \u2018was not aggravated by continuous questioning for many hours by numerous officers.\u2019 \u201d 335 U.S. at page 412, 69 S.Ct. at page 171. In holding the confession inadmissible under the McNabb rule, the Supreme Court made clear that in Mc-Nabb it had described the oppressive interrogation simply \u201cto show that the record left no doubt that the McNabbs were not promptly taken before a judicial officer as the law required, but instead were held for secret questioning * * * \u201d 335 U.S. at page 413, 69 S.Ct. at page 171. The Court added: \u201cThe McNabb confessions were thus held inadmissible because <em>the McNabbs were questioned while held in \u2018plain disregard of the duty enjoined by Congress upon federal law officers\u2019 promptly to. take them before a judicial officer.\u201d </em>Ibid., emphasis supplied. The Court pointed out that its <em>holding in Mitchell </em>\u201cwas only that Mitchell\u2019s subsequent illegal detention did not render inadmissible his prior confessions,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>and it declared that under the McNabb rule \u201c * * * a confession is inadmissible if made during illegal detention due to failure promptly to carry a prisoner before a committing magistrate, <em>whether or not the \u2018confession is the result of torture, physical or psychological </em>* * *.\u2019 \u201d Ibid., emphasis supplied. The dissenting justices, per Mr. Justice Reed, found the majority opinion inconsistent with the Mitchell explanation of McNabb, 335 U.S. at page 423, 69 S.Ct. at page 176, and criticized it for holding that \u201cillegal detention alone is sufficient to bar from evidence a confession to the police during that unlawful detention.\u201d Id., 335 U.S. at page 430, 69 S.Ct. at page 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">In United States v. Carignan, 1951, 342 U.S. 36, 72 S.Ct. 97, 96 L.Ed. 48, the Court adhered to the Upshaw statement of the McNabb rule. Id., 342 U.S. at page 43, 72 S.Ct. at page 101. It held, however, that a murder confession made by one who had been properly arraigned on an assault charge, but not for murder, was not excludable. The Court reasoned that since Carignan had been initially arraigned in conformity with Rule 5(a) \u201cthis case falls outside the reason for the rule, <em>i. e., </em>to abolish unlawful detention. S\u00fcch detention,\u201d the Court said, \u201cwas thought to give opportunity for improper pressure by police before the accused had the benefit of the statement by the commissioner. Rule 5(b) [F.R. Crim.P., citing Upshaw and McNabb]. Carignan had received that information at his commitment for the assault.\u201d Id., 342 U.S. at pages 44-45, 72 S.Ct. at page 101. Thus, Carignan implies that the McNabb rule applies to all confessions made in response to interrogation while the accused is held in violation of Rule 5(a), and hence before he has received the benefits of Rule 5(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">In two recent state confession cases, the Supreme Court distinguished the coerced confession rule, applicable in state as well as federal courts, from the Mc-Nabb rule which applies only in the federal courts. In Brown v. Allen, the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">\u201cUnder the leadership of this Court a rule has been adopted' for federal courts, that denies admission to confessions obtained before prompt arraignment <em>notwithstanding their voluntary character. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>* * * <em>This experiment has been made in an attempt to abolish the opportunities for coercion which prolonged detention without a hearing is said to enhance.\u201d </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">In Stein v. People of State of New York, the Court likewise indicated that no explicit showing of coercion is required under the McNabb rule. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-6\">\u201cPetitioners confuse the more rigid rule of exclusion which, in the exercise of our supervisory power, we have promulgated for federal courts with the more limited requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. This, we have held, did not impose rules of evidence on state courts which bind them to exclude a confession because, <em>without coercion, </em>it was obtained while a prisoner was uncounseled and illegally detained.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of our decision in Upshaw, the prevailing view in this jurisdiction had been that relentless questioning or other \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d were required in order to invalidate a confession made during an illegal detention.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Garner v. United States, the first case to come before this court after Upshaw, we declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-15\">\u201c * * * we must consider it to be a settled principle that, when arresting officers unnecessarily delay taking a prisoner before a committing magistrate, any confession made to them during that delay is inadmissible; and that is true even though the confession was not induced by the illegal detention nor by any form of coercion, but was voluntarily given.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">This dictum was repudiated three years later by other dictum in Pierce v. United States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We said: \u201cFurther study of the Upshaw opinion causes us to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>that the Court did not intend to enlarge and extend the original McNabb ruling. Its restatement of the rule should be read, we think, in the light of the facts of the McNabb case * * <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We took the same position, again as dictum, in Allen v. United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Since the views expressed in the Pierce and Allen cases were dicta, we are not bound by them in deciding this case. We think, with due deference, that the McNabb rule is not limited to the facts of the McNabb case. The holding in Upshaw and language in the Brown and Stein cases, decided by the Supreme Court subsequent to Pierce and Allen, indicate the contrary. Under Brown and Stein, the McNabb rule operates as a sanction against police irregularities that create an <em>opportunity </em>for third degree methods by compelling an accused to face his questioners incommunicado, uncounseled, and uninformed of his rights. A confession obtained through secret interrogation during illegal detention is not admissible in evidence, whether or not, as in McNabb, the questioning is not merely secret but is coercive in other respects as well.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We turn now to determine whether the confession in the present case was made in circumstances which bring it within McNabb.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Appellant returned from her employ-meht as a waitress to the apartment where she lived with her husband, at 2 :- 20 a. m., Sunday, October 24, 1954. At about 6:15 a. m., she reported to police that her husband had been stabbed while asleep with her on the sofa. Police Sergeant Deenihan described what he saw when he arrived at the apartment shortly after the report. Then he testified that appellant told him that \u201csomeone came in, and she didn\u2019t know who it was, and that he must have stabbed her husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">At that point the court granted defense counsel\u2019s request for a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether, as the court put it, there had been an \u201coverlong detention.\u201d The police testimony was that, in a middle-of-the-night interrogation of appellant 16% to 19% hours after her arrest, she told the police she had stabbed her husband after they had fallen asleep together on the sofa.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">At the hearing it was established that appellant was placed under arrest at 7:30 a. m., Sunday, October 24, and taken to the Homicide office. From about 8:30 to 9:00 a. m., Sergeant Deenihan questioned her. From about 9:00 to 10:30 a. m., he gave her a lie detector test to which she consented. From about 10:30 to 11:00 a. m., she was at the Identification Bureau. From about 11:00 to 11:-30 or 11:45 a. m., the Sergeant interviewed her at the Homicide office. From about 12:00 noon to 2:00 p. m., he gave her another lie detector test. From about 2:00 p. m. to \u201cquarter of 3, 3 o\u2019clock\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>interviewed her again. Thereafter she was returned to the Homicide office where she remained until \u201csome time after' 3:30.\u201d She was then sent to the Women\u2019s Bureau where she arrived at 4:30 p. m. At 7:45 p. m. she was interviewed for 20 or 30 minutes by an officer from Precinct No. 9, who believed she was awakened for that purpose. She was awakened some time between 12 midnight and 3:00 a. m., Monday morning, and questioned by Sergeants Deeni-han and Clark from Homicide for about 40 minutes to an hour. It was during this period of questioning, said the officers, that appellant made the oral confession. Not until approximately 11:15 Monday morning, was appellant taken before the coroner for an inquest.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Upon completion of the Government\u2019s \u25a0evidence at the hearing, the court observed that the period between appellant\u2019s \u25a0arrest and oral confession was \u201ccertainly dealing with a long period of time.\u201d But the court, the prosecutor and defense counsel thought that illegality of detention was not the sole prerequisite to \u25a0exclusion of the confession. As the prosecutor expressed it, \u201ca showing * * * of a patent denial of due process by coercion\u201d was required in addition. Defense counsel argued that, although illegal detention in itself is insufficient, sufficient psychological pressure had been shown by the Government\u2019s own witnesses to render the confession inadmissible as a matter of law. He subscribed to the interpretation of McNabb expressed in Mr. Justice Reed\u2019s dissent in Upshaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410, 414, 69 S.Ct. 172, 93 L.Ed. 100, namely, that \u201cpressure short of coercion but beyond mere detention makes confessions inadmissible.\u201d Id., 335 U.S. at page 429, 69 S.Ct. at page 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">On the question of whether the application of the McNabb rule is to be decided by judge or jury, the trial court disregarded McNabb itself<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and followed the line of Mr. Justice Reed\u2019s dissent in Up-shaw.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He determined that the evidence of coercion was not so patent as to justify a conclusion that it existed as a matter of law and that the issue was, therefore, one for the jury. Accordingly, upon the resumption of the trial before the jury, Sergeant Deenihan was permitted to relate the circumstances under which appellant was detained and to testify to the statements alleged to constitute the confession.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">The case was submitted to the jury on Mr. Justice Reed\u2019s theory that \u201cpressure short of coercion but beyond mere de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>tention\u201d is necessary to make the alleged confession inadmissible. The jury was told that the defense contention <em>as </em>to the confession was based \u201cupon the proposition that there was a psychological pressure brought to bear on her, by virtue of the length of time that she was incarcerated; and this was somewhere from, let us say roughly, 6:30 in the morning until whenever it was, between midnight and 3 in the morning * *</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The submission of the McNabb question to the jury was clearly erroneous. \u201cIt was for the trial judge to determine in accordance with the procedure outlined in McNabb v. United States, whether Rule 5 had been satisfied in accordance with our standards.\u201d Watson v. United States, supra, note 7, 234 F.2d at page 48. And, on the facts of this case, that determination should have been to reject the confession testimony. The confession was secured between midnight and 3:00 a. m., 16% to 19% hours after arrest and before arraignment, after appellant had been subjected to prolonged questioning at various intervals. We would hold that in these circumstances she was not taken before a committing magistrate \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5(a),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that the confession was produced by interrogation during an illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The Government suggests that the delay in arraignment was necessary because the police are not required by Rule 5(a) to take appellant before a committing officer on Sunday. We think this view is without merit. So, apparently, did the trial court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The prosecutor admits that no effort was made on Sunday to take appellant before any officer empowered to commit on the theory that commissioners are <em>unavailable on </em>Sunday.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But <em>that </em>theory is refuted, at least in this jurisdiction, by James v. Lawrence, 1949, 84 U.S.App.D.G. 355, 356, 176 F.2d 18, 19, where a preliminary hearing before a commissioner took place at 2:00 p. m. on a Sunday. No language in the rule justifies an exemption of Sunday arrests from the requirement of prompt commitment. To carve out that exemption by holding that delay is automatically \u201cnecessary\u201d on Sundays, or at times other than the regular office hours of an available commissioner is, as the Second Circuit has suggested, \u201cunrealistic * * * from both the accused\u2019s and the court\u2019s standpoint.\u201d United States v. Levit\u00f3n, 2 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 848, 854. It would mean that a \u201cweek-end or midnight arrest gives the officers all sorts of powers they do not otherwise possess * * * they may then delay the arraignment as much as three days if a holiday succeeds the Sunday.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">We think the issue of whether there has been an \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d in arraignment must be resolved, in every case, by deciding whether there have been reasonable and bona fide efforts<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>promptly to seek a commissioner or \u201cother nearby officer.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And, since \u201cevery judge or justice of the United States\u201d is empowered to take arraignments,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> making about 50 such officers available in the District of Columbia, the good faith effort cannot be confined to a commissioner. It may be that committing magistrates are not as readily available on Sundays or holidays as they are during regular working days. That factor, however, does not conclude the issue of delay, but is only one circumstance to be considered in determining whether the delay is reasonable or necessary. Another circumstance to be considered, but only in the event that it is shown that earlier arraignment was not possible, is whether the police have given the prisoner the benefit of the advisory statement which the committing officer would give under Rule 5(b).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here, even if it could be shown that Sunday arraignment was not possible, the delay would nevertheless be unreasonable and the detention illegal, because the record shows no such advisory statement to the appellant before the inquest.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">FAHY and WASHINGTON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">We agree with Judge BAZELON\u2019S analysis, in which Judge EDGERTON concurs, of the requirements of the Mc-Nabb rule and concur in reversal of the judgment of conviction on the ground that those requirements have not here been met, as well as on the ground that the evidence showed that the confession was involuntary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\">. \u201cAn officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States.

Detained without arraignment, \u201cthe accused is under the exclusive control of the police * * Mr. Justice Douglas, concurring in Carignan, 342 U.S. at page 46, 72 S.Ct. at page 102. The obvious benefit of Rule 5 is that the committing magistrate removes the accused from police control to the control of the jail warden, beyond the peril of secret interrogation and pressure. If delay in commitment is unavoidable, the danger inherent in continued police control may to some extent be mitigated by the police advising the accused of his rights and affording him the opportunity to consult counsel.

Mitchell, 1944, 322 U.S. 65, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140, in Sykes v. United States, 1944, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 143 F.2d 140, we held that a \u201cvoluntary confession obtained during an illegal detention\u201d was admissible \u201cprovided it was not induced by the illegal detention.\u201d We took a seemingly contrary position in Akowskey v. United States, 1946, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 354, 158 F.2d 649, 650, holding simply that since the detention was illegal, \u201cthe incriminating statements of the accused were inadmissible <em>* * *.\u201d </em>Subsequently, however, in Boone v. United States, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 359, 164 F.2d 102, we reverted to the view that an illegal detention did not nullify a <em>voluntary </em>confession uttered during its continuance. We read McNabb and Mitchell as holding that a confession was inadmissible only if <em>induced </em>by the illegal detention, and distinguished the Akowskey case on the ground that there the confession had been the result of relentless questioning and it was that factor, not the illegal detention <em>per se, </em>that had nullified the confession. In Wheeler v. United States, 1947, 82 U.S. App.D.C. 363, 165 F.2d 225, certiorari denied 1948, 333 U.S. 829, 68 S.Ct. 448, 92 L.Ed. 1115; and Alderman v.

United States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> compels exclusion of the appellant\u2019s oral admissions. We believe that before admissions or confessions are to be excluded under the McNabb rule, the inculpatory statements must be shown to have been induced by an illegal detention, to have been elicited through illegality, and thus to constitute fruits of wrongdoing by the officers. The disclosures must have been the result of the unlawful detention. In Hines v. United States, we affirmed without opinion after the trial judge, expressly relying upon our opinions in Pierce v. United States, infra note 11, and Allen v. United States, infra note 12, had refused to exclude confessions not shown to be the product of illegal detention. Certiorari was denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">As we read it, McNabb is based upon the premise that when there has been inexcusable detention for the purpose of illegally extracting evidence from an accused, coupled with the successful extraction of inculpatory disclosures as a result of continuous questioning for many hours under psychological pressure, the statements of the accused so produced shall not be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">The Supreme Court has had repeated opportunities to say that its rule of evidence for federal courts means less, but it has declined to do so. Rather than automatically exclude all self implicating statements by an accused while in cus tody, the Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-14\">\u201cBy United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 70-71, [64 S.Ct. 896, 898, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>L.Ed. 1140], this Court decided that the McNabb rule was not intended as a penalty or sanction for violation of R.S.D.C. \u00a7 397, a commitment statute. The same conclusion applies to Rule 5, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A74\">It is true that at one time, as when the Mitchell case <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was before us, some members of this court, like some members of other Courts of Appeals, thought the Mc-Nabb rule must be rigidly defined to bar confessions received during a period of unlawful detention, irrespective of whether or not the detention produced the disclosures. Chief Judge Groner noted the distinction thus in Boone v. United States <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-4\">\u201cBut on appeal to the Supreme Court our view was rejected and the Supreme Court itself interpreted its language in the McNabb case wholly contrary to the position now taken by counsel for appellant in this case. In the Mitchell case the Supreme Court said, as it had said in the Mc-Nabb case, that inexcusable detention for the purpose of extracting evidence from the accused is both wrong and unlawful, but pointed out that while this is true, detention, standing alone, does not affect the admissibility of the confession except in a case in which it appears that the disclosure is induced by it. In short, that unlawful detention, without more, does not require rejection of a confession otherwise-admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-18\">After the Boone opinion had been written, we were again faced with the problem in Garner v. United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There,, we reverted to our first interpretation of the so-called McNabb rule, thinking we were required to do so because of the-opinion in Upshaw v. United States, infra note 17, which was subsequent to our Boone case. We considered in the Garner opinion the applicability of the new Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure-which had become effective as of March-21, 1946. We decided that Rule 5(a)\u2019 does not command that an arrested person be taken before a magistrate \u201cforthwith,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the Rule contemplates-, circumstances out of which there well' may be the possibility of necessary delay. It was decided that the delay in arraigning Garner was not unreasonable andi that the confession had been properly-received.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-19\">While there were yet other cases raising comparable questions, both here and\u2019 in other circuits, many, perhaps most of' them, have been cited in Tillotson v. United States<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Watson v. United; States.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without further elaboration^ we come to Pierce v. United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Once again we considered whether or not an illegal detention which did not induce-the accused to disclose his guilt made his-confession inadmissible. The opinion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Judge WILBUR K. MILLER explained the gradual crystallization of the true rule to govern such situations. Judge BAZELON concurred in the result, having reached the conclusion that the confession was not made either during or because of unnecessary delay in presenting the accused before a committing magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">The question was again presented in Allen v. United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Judge WILBUR K. MILLER wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-5\">\u201cFor the reasons stated in Pierce v. United States * * * we think the McNabb rule * * * is that <em>illegal detention before presentment to a committing magistrate, standing alone and without more, does not invalidate a confession made during its contimiance, unless the detention produced the disclosure.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Again Judge BAZELON concurred in the result since he found there had been no unnecessary delay in arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The rule of the Pierce and Allen cases has since been followed by this court, and, in essence, by other circuits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Some of our colleagues would strike down the Pierce and Allen cases. They read the McNabb case as commanding that result, not because of express language in the McNabb opinion, but by virtue of what someone says it says. Perhaps any such proposed test can be countered in like vein. For example, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said: \u201cInexcusable detention for the purpose of illegally extracting evidence from an accused, and the successful extraction of such incul-patory statements by continuous questioning for many hours under psychological pressure, were the decisive features in the McNabb case which led us to rule that a conviction on such evidence could not stand.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He added, having explained the Court\u2019s own rationale, \u201cWe adhere to that decision and to the views on which it was based.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Again, in Upshaw v. United States,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Mr. Justice Black pointed out that the accused had not been arraigned because the officer thought there was not a sufficient case for the court to hold him, and had he been arraigned, the officer would no longer have been able to question him. Thus, the confessions were the fruits of wrongdoing by the police since the petitioner had been \u201cillegally detained for at least thirty hours for the very purpose of securing these challenged confessions. He thereby refutes any possibility of an argument that after arrest he was carried before a magistrate \u2018without unnecessary delay.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">It may prove of interest to note that in the McNabb opinion the Court had said of the accused, \u201cThey were not brought before a United States Commissioner or a judge\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and again, \u201cHe was not taken before a United States Commissioner, or a judge.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> When the case went back for a new trial, the facts as to the time of arraignment were brought out. The Court of Appeals concluded that the record sustained a finding that the accused had been arraigned so that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8x\">\u201cthis circumstance is now out of the case and there is no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>evidence that the confessions were elicited by means of illegal procedure. As pointed out in the Me-Nabb case, supra, 318 U.S. [at] page 346, 63 S.Ct. [at] page 615, 87 L. Ed. 819, \u2018The mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible.\u2019 This quotation was repeated in United States v. Mitch\u25a0ell, 64 S.Ct. 896, 899. The Mitchell \u2022opinion embodies a clarification of its MeNabb opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-4\">\u201cWe think that the circumstances in the present setting do not compel the exclusion of confessions upon the ground that they were involuntary.\u201d' <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">\u2019Thus the McNabbs were convicted, and \u2022certiorari was denied.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Judge PRETTYMAN and I are satisfied that since the adoption of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the application of Rule 5 is to be governed by the Pierce and Allen cases. By applying, \u25a0not disparaging, the rule to be deduced from Pierce and Allen, we have concluded that the conviction in this case must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">The record shows that the defense \u2022voiced timely objection and moved to ex-elude the appellant\u2019s allegedly inculpatory admissions. The trial judge properly conducted an extensive hearing out \u2022of the presence of the jury. But it was the duty of the trial judge thereupon to \u25a0determine preliminarily whether the motion to exclude should be granted or \u2022denied,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> his ruling to depend upon the facts and circumstances shown, within the Pierce and Allen rule. Assuming, \u2022without deciding, that there was no unnecessary delay in arraigning the appellant, there still remained the question of \u2022whether or not \u201cthe detention produced the disclosure.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">We are of the view that upon the face of events, the motion to exclude the admissions should have been granted. The record develops the setting thus:</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">Appellant had worked as a waitress on a night shift. She came home from work at about two o\u2019clock on a Sunday morning and, according to her testimony, did some household chores, going to bed between three-thirty and four o\u2019clock in the morning. She was alone in the apartment with her husband. At about six o\u2019clock she aroused a neighbor with word that her husband had been stabbed. From then on she was in the custody of the police. What sleep she had had between four o\u2019clock and six o\u2019clock is a guess (she said she had none), but it could not have been more than two hours. She was questioned at intervals all day Sunday. She was twice given polygraph tests, each test lasting about an hour or an hour and a half, both being \u201cinconclusive,\u201d due to her distraught condition. She had no food, having declined lunch. Finally at about eight o\u2019clock: Sunday evening she was taken to a room at the Women\u2019s Bureau and went to bed. Sometime after one o\u2019clock Monday morning she was aroused and taken downstairs to a witness room or conference room in the Women\u2019s Bureau, and the questioning by police officers began. This questioning lasted about three-quarters of an hour, or possibly an hour. At this interview she is said to have confessed orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">At no time was she warned that anything she said would be used against her, and at no time was she advised of her right to counsel. She at no time saw any of her family or friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">At all times after early Sunday morning she was obviously the prime suspect in the case, having been alone in the apartment with her husband, having given the alarm, and having made conflict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>ing statements to the police from time to time. By her own statement she was always a material witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">If we assume this woman had worked eight hours on the Saturday night shift and had been awake an hour prior to going to work, she had had no more than two hours\u2019 sleep in twenty-seven hours when she went to bed at the Women\u2019s Bureau Sunday evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">It counters our experience and the teaching of the cases, to believe that the police can question such a person, distraught from the circumstances, without food, without rest, off and on from seven o\u2019clock in the morning to eight o\u2019clock at night, and then wake her in the middle of the night, take her out of bed to a conference room, question her again, without warning and without advice as to counsel, and then obtain inculpatory admissions, free from taint. There was no reason for not warning her or advising her of her right to counsel. There was in this case no reason for not booking her, either on probable cause for suspicion of murder or as a material witness.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> There was no conceivable reason for waking her up at one o\u2019clock in the morning for further questioning except to get a confession or admissions before the morning hour arrived when the officers knew they would have to charge her before a committing magistrate. That the admissions were the product of her detention under the circumstances narrated, seems to us to be perfectly plain, and the disclosures fail to survive the interdiction of the Pierce and Allen rule. The failure of the trier so to rule requires that the conviction be reversed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-19\">. 1943, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.

MILLER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Arg\">with whom BASTIAN and BURGER, Circuit Judges, concur, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Between 5:30 and 6:00 a. m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sunday, October 24, 1954, Robert Rettig was. stabbed twice as he lay asleep on a couch in the living room of his second-floor apartment. He died soon thereafter. The two stab wounds, either of which would have caused death, were inflicted with a knife or dagger owned by Rettig himself which he kept, in its. sheath, as an ornament on a television table in the living room. His common-law wife Katherine was indicted for the killing and a jury found her guilty of' second degree murder. She appeals, and a majority of the court reverse her conviction. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">The principal reason for reversal advanced by the appellant is that an oral confession, attributed to her in the testimony of two police officers, was inadmissible because they said it was given after midnight Sunday when she had been in custody since 7:30 that morning without having been presented to a committing-magistrate. In her testimony she did not. attribute any coercive effect to the delay in arraignment, nor did she say the-alleged confession was induced or extorted by any form of physical or psychological persuasion or coercion. She does not. make such claims in argument here. Thus she did not say from the stand and does not say now that she confessed involuntarily. Instead, she stoutly swore she did not confess in the post-midnight interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She is therefore in a poor position to rely on the McNabb rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assert that, had she been more-promptly arraigned, she would not have-confessed. Her testimony makes equally-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>difficult the position of those who say she confessed involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Nevertheless, despite the inconsistency of doing so, on appeal the appellant invokes the so-called McNabb rule. Solely because the officers were permitted to testify that Mrs. Rettig told them she stabbed her husband, my brothers of the majority reverse her conviction. Some of them think the confession was the result of pressures (which she denied w\u00e9re ever applied to her) and was therefore involuntary, and others think it was inadmissible under the doctrine of the Mc-Nabb case, because of the mere lapse of time before arraignment plus what they regard as aggravating circumstances short of coercion. These two theories differ sharply, as will appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">1. If the confession was involuntarily given, its admission in evidence violated Mrs. Rettig\u2019s constitutional right to due process, and it is not necessary to consider whether the other evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. This is because the reception of a confession which denies a constitutional right requires reversal, even though the evidence apart <em>from </em>the confession was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilt. Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 475, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469; Malinski v. People of State of New York, 1945, 324 U.S. 401, 404, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029; Lyons v. State of Oklahoma, 1944, 322 U.S. 596-597, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 88 L.Ed. 1481; Bram v. United States, 1897,168 U.S. 532, 540-542, 18 S.Ct. 183, 42 L.Ed. 568. This is true in federal as well as in state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">2. On the other hand, if Mrs. Rettig\u2019s confession was merely inadmissible under the McNabb rule prescribed for federal courts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> no constitutional right was involved. The Supreme Court said in the McNabb opinion, and has repeated several times since, that the federal rule does not arise from constitutional sources.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That being true, a reviewing court which holds a confession inadmissible because it was obtained in violation of the McNabb rule should not reverse the conviction on that account unless it appears that, with the confession excluded, the remaining evidence was insufficient to support'the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. This is the indirect teaching of the McNabb and Upshaw cases, in both of which the Supreme Court was at pains to point out that the confessions constituted the basis of the conviction. The Supreme Court said in the McNabb case, 318 U.S. at page 338, 63 S.Ct. at page 612, \u201cConced-edly, the admissions made by Freeman, Raymond and Benjamin [McNabb] constituted the crux of the Government\u2019s case against them, and the convictions cannot stand if such evidence be excluded.\u201d Likewise, in its opinion in Up-shaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410-411, 69 S.Ct. 170, the Court said, \u201cPre-trial confessions of guilt without which petitioner [Upshaw] could not have been convicted were admitted in evidence against his objection that they had been illegally obtained.\u201d And the Court said in a footnote at page 411 of 335 U.S., at page 170 of 69 S.Ct., \u201cAfter the evidence was all in, the trial judge stated that without the confessions there was \u2018nothing left in the case.\u2019 \u201d Cf. Garner v. United States, 84 U.S.App.D.C. 361, 384,174 F.2d 499, 502, certiorari denied 1949, 337 U.S. 945, 69 S.Ct. 1502, 93 L.Ed. 1748.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">I cannot concur in the reversal of this conviction on either of the two theories just described and differentiated, for reasons which will be stated separately with respect to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">1. In my opinion, the confession was not involuntarily given and so was not excludable on constitutional grounds. As I have said, Mrs. Rettig did not claim the confession was obtained from her by any form of coercion or inducement. She simply said she did not confess, thus in effect saying she had not yielded to any sort of pressure. From this I think it follows that the corifession cannot logically be said to have been involuntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>given, unless it ought to be held as a matter of law that the detention on Sunday and the events and circumstances of that day which preceded the confession were in themselves so oppressive as to induce an involuntary admission of guilt, even though the appellant herself did not claim she had been coerced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">I do not think the delay in arraignment and the events of Sunday amounted <em>per se </em>to coercion. The Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the McNabb case confirms me in that view. For the facts assumed and described in the McNabb opinion showed much more prolonged delay in arraignment, much more intensive questioning and, in general, much more psychological pressure than the facts here disclose. Yet the Supreme Court did not hold the McNabb confessions involuntary, and did not reverse the convictions on constitutional grounds. It expressly said its decision was not based on the violation of any constitutional right. Hence I think the experienced trial judge was correct when, after an extensive hearing with the jury absent, he refused to rule that Mrs. Rettig\u2019s confession was involuntary as a matter of law on the face of the factual situation, but left it to the jury to decide the question of voluntariness. Cf. Tyler v. United States, 1951, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 2, 6, 193 F.2d 24, 28, certiorari denied 1952, 343 U.S. 908, 72 S.Ct. 639, 96 L.Ed. 1326. My conclusion is there is no basis for reversal on the ground that the confession was obtained in violation of the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">2. Next to be considered is the second theory, adopted by some of the majority, that the McNabb rule was violated here, from which they seem to think reversal automatically follows. My brothers Edgerton and Bazelon say, \u201cThe issue is whether the rule adopted by the Supreme Court in McNabb v. United States * * * requires exclusion of the testimony concerning appellant\u2019s oral confession.\u201d I suggest they do not state the issue fully. One question is, as they say, whether Mrs. Rettig\u2019s confession was inadmissible under the McNabb doctrine. But if so, there arises immediately the question whether the conviction should therefore be reversed. For, as I have pointed out above in differentiating the two majority theories, reversal does not necessarily flow from a violation of the McNabb rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Before taking up the two questions which constitute the McNabb issue here, it will be helpful to state in the language of the Supreme Court what the rule is and what it is not. Before doing so, I interject that we of the minority who would affirm are in accord with Judge Danaher\u2019s analysis of the McNabb rule and his approval of the Pierce and Allen cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">In United States v. Mitchell, 1944, 322 U.S. 65, 67, 64 S.Ct. 896, 897, the Court described the McNabb ruling by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHP\">\u201c* # * Inexcusable detention for the purpose of illegally extracting evidence from an accused, and 'the successful extraction of such in-culpatory statements by continuous questioning for many hours under psychological pressure, were the decisive factors in the McNabb case which led us to rule that a conviction on such evidence could not stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">And Mr. Justice Reed, concurring in the result of the Mitchell opinion, said, 322 U.S. at page 71, 64 S.Ct. at page 898:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201cAs I understand McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 322, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819, as explained by the Court\u2019s opinion of today, the Mc-Nabb rule is that where there has been illegal detention of a prisoner, joined with other circumstances which are deemed by this Court to be contrary to proper conduct of federal prosecutions, the confession will not be admitted. Further, this refusal of admission is required even though the detention plus the conduct do not together amount to duress or coercion. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">In Upshaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410, 413, 69 S.Ct. 170, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> said the McNabb rule is \u201cthat a confession is inadmissible if made during illegal detention due to failure promptly to carry a prisoner before a committing magistrate, whether or not the \u2018confession is the result of torture, physical or psychological * * *.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ajb-dedup-0\">With respect to the Upshaw statement of the McNabb rule we said in Garner v. United States, 84 U.S.App.D.C. 361, 364, 174 F.2d 499, 502, certiorari denied 1949, 337 U.S. 945, 69 S.Ct. 1502:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWaA\">\u201cUnder this rule, however, there still remains open in every case the question whether the detention was illegal; that is, whether the delay in presenting the prisoner to a magistrate was unnecessary. For Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does not command that an arrested person be taken before a magistrate \u2018forthwith.' It provides that the officer \u2018shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States.\u2019 This phrasing envisages the possibility of necessary delay. It would be an extension of the Up-shaw opinion to construe it as holding that a confession is inadmissible if given <em>after delay </em>in presenting the defendant to a magistrate because such a construction would completely ignore the word \u2018unnecessary\u2019 in Rule 5(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">In this case, a murder suspect was taken into custody about 7:30 Sunday morning and was carried before a committing magistrate at 9:00 o\u2019clock Monday morning. I do not think this delay was <em>prima facie </em>\u201cunreasonable\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5(a). Mrs. Rettig made no effort to prove that it was, although the burden of doing so rested upon her. Tillotson v. United States, 231 F.2d at page 738; Pierce v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. at page 23, 197 F.2d at page 193; White v. United States, 5 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 509, 512; United States v. Leviton, 2 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 848, 854; United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 564, 567. I know of no requirement that committing magistrates be on duty all day Sunday. The police worked all that day tracking down leads, such as appellant\u2019s statement that an unknown intruder killed her husband, which might have exonerated her. Nor does it appear that arraignment was delayed in order to extract the confession. Nobody said, as did an officer in the Upshaw case, that the suspect was held for that purpose. For these reasons, it is my opinion that Mrs. Rettig\u2019s confession was not barred by the McNabb rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>In our zeal to protect the appellant under the McNabb rule of evidence, we should not forget that a jury heard undeniably admissible evidence tending to show guilt, quite apart from the somewhat equivocal confession, and then solemnly determined that she terminated Robert Rettig\u2019s right to life and so forfeited her own right to liberty. We should remember that society has a stake in this business. The public has the right to expect the criminal laws to be strictly enforced. They should never be given any reason to suppose that at times the courts coddle convicted criminals by unduly emphasizing their rights over the wrongs they have done to the rights of others. I am afraid that the reversal of this conviction on a borderline application of the McNabb doctrine may seem to some to support such a supposition. I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\">. This time range was fixed by the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-12\">.

United States, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 202 F.2d 329; and Pierce v. United States, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 19, 197 F.2d 189, all of which the Supreme Court declined to review, I need not depend on that interpretation here, and I do not because we are told that denial of <em>certiorari </em>does not necessarily indicate acquiescence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b982-7\">. One of the majority opinions states that Mrs. Rettig was not offered an opportunity to see her own relatives or counsel until after the inquest (held on Monday). The statement ignores the fact that two police officers testified Mrs. Rettig not only did not ask to see ber relatives on Sunday but, on tbe contrary, stated \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to see any of her people; that she had not been in touch with them and that she didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201d One of the police officers testified he made repeated efforts on Sunday to find out from Mrs. Rettig the name or location of a relative but to no avail. The same officer testified he believed it was not until Monday that Mrs. Rettig gave him the name of her sister. There was evidence that she did not want the services of the attorney provided for her by her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"ADMr\">On the other hand, Mrs. Rettig testified that on Sunday she requested a police officer to call her sister, and gave him the telephone number. She further testified that one of the police officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>told her she could not call anyone. Thus, if the absence of Mrs. Rettig\u2019s relatives from the police station on Sunday had significance, it was for the jury to determine whether such absence was the fault of the police or of Mrs. Rettig. The majority, however, seems to have made this determination, ignoring the testimony of the two police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-25\">Other points should be clarified because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>they are not clearly reflected in the two majority opinions. Mrs. Rettig was not forced to take lie detector tests but agreed to do so when asked by the police officer. She made no claim that she asked for food and that it was denied at any time; on the contrary, she stated she never asked for anything to eat or drink except coffee, which she received. A police officer testified he offered Mrs. Rettig food at about 11:30 Sunday morning but that she declined to take anything. She testified she could not say the officer didn\u2019t offer her food but that \u201cto my knowledge I did not hear him.\u201d There is no claim by Mrs. Rettig that she was harassed by lack of sleep or prevented from sleep by \u201ccontinuous questioning\u201d as in the McNabb case. There is no evidence from her in any form that any act, omission or delay on the part of the police in any way compelled, induced, or led her to do or say anything in the nature of admitting guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
