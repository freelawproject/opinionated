They subsequently filed motions to set aside their sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, upon the ground that the indictment was insufficient to sustain a conviction or support, a plea of guilty because each count failed to state the motor number of the automobile stolen. This is an appeal from the denial of those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number> In our opinion the appellants\u2019 contention is entirely without merit. Each count of the indictment clearly stated every essential element of the offense of transporting a stolen automobile in interstate commerce with knowledge of its theft. Moreover, the sufficiency of an indictment not questioned at the trial is not subject to collateral attack in a proceeding of this nature unless the indictment is so grossly defective that it cannot be said under any reasonable construction to charge the offense for which conviction was had. Smith v. United States, 10 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 768; Risken v. United States, 8 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
