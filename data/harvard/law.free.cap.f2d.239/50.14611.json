MILLER and BURGER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A12\">PER CURIAM,</author>\n<p id=\"AZG\">Appellant was indicted under D.C. Code, \u00a7 22-903 (1951, Supp. IV)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on two counts; Count One charged wilful non-support of his destitute wife and Count Two charged wilful non-support of his five named minor children. While represented by counsel, appellant entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to one year on each count. The sentences, which were to run consecutively, were suspended and appellant was placed on two years\u2019 probation. Failure to comply with the terms of the probation led to revocation of the suspension and commitment under the sentences. This apPeal is from the district court\u2019s denial a motion for relief under 62 Stat. 967 (1948), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">Appellant urges that the structure of the statute and the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d show the statute contemplates that, only one offense be charged, based upon the non-support of either the wife <em>or </em>the children or both. Having been charged and sentenced separately on one-count as to his wife and a second count as to his children, appellant contends he has been charged and sentenced twice-for a single offense.</p>\n<p id=\"Aol\"> That part of the statute which makes the non-support of the wife an offense rests primarily on violation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>duty which arises from the marriage relationship and is limited to acts by a <em>husband </em>against a wife, whereas the existence of a marital state is not essential to make out an offense against a minor child and either parent may be charged with a violation under the second clause <em>of </em>the statute. Thus, we believe Congress was concerned with two-crimes, one by a husband' against his wife and the other by <em>any person </em>against his or her minor child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Finding no error in the indictment or in the sentences the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-16\">. \u201cWilful neglect or refusal to support wife or minor child \u2014 Punishment\u2014Order of allowance \u2014 Recognizance\u2014Trial under original charge.</p>\n<p id=\"ACd\">\u201cAny person in the District of Columbia who shall, without just cause, desert or wilfully neglect or refuse to provide for the support and maintenance of his wife in destitute or necessitous circumstances, <em>or </em>any person who shall, without just excuse, desert or wilfully neglect or refuse to provide for the support and maintenance of his or her minor children under the age of sixteen years in destitute or necessitous circumstances, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment in the workhouse of the District of Columbia for not more than, twelve months, or by both such fine and, imprisonment * * (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-14\">. The structure of the statute, treating the two offenses in separate clauses, supports this construction. See Rapeer v. Colpoys, 1936, 66 App.D.C. 216, 219, 85 F.2d 715', 718; Williams v.
