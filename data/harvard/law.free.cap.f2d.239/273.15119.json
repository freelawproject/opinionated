Upon pre-trial hearing the facts were stipulated and the cause submitted to the court upon the stipulation and briefs of the parties. Thereafter findings and judgment were made and entered setting aside that part of the order which granted the appellant a sum \u201con account of serious facial disfigurement\u201d. The trial court filed an opinion giving its reasons for the decision, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u201cAt pre-trial hearing the parties presented a stipulation of facts and submitted the cause for decision upon briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">\u201cThe admitted facts,' as disclosed by the pre-trial stipulation and the admissions made by the pleadings, are briefly these. On March 27, 1951, while performing services as a stage rigger on the Steamship Cache, afloat off shore from the yards of libelant Todd Shipyards Corporation, respondent Clarence Rupert slipped and fell a distance of approximately sixteen feet, landing on his forehead and face, thereby sustaining serious injuries, totally disabling and permanent in character and including serious facial disfigurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">\u201cRespondent Rupert thereafter duly filed his claim for compensation, and on April 29, 1955, respondent Warren H. Pillsbury by respondent David R. Landy, Deputy Commissioner, made findings of fact and predicated thereon an award of 207% weeks\u2019 compensation at $35.00 per week for \u2018temporary total disability\u2019 (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(b) ) from March 28, 1951, to March 18, 1955, inclusive; 6 weeks\u2019 compensation at $35.00 per week for \u2018permanent total disability\u2019 (id. \u00a7 908(a) ) from March 19 1955, to April 29, 1955, with continuing payments thereafter for permanent total disability at the rate of $35.00 per week until otherwise ordered; and $50.00 per month to the wife of respondent Rupert for services as an attendant as long as the services may be necessary. (Id. \u00a7 907(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">\u201cIn addition, the award directs the payment to respondent Rupert of the challenged sum of $2,000 \u2018on account of serious facial disfigurement.\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908(c) (20).)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">\u201cLibelants here object to the award for facial disfigurement, and the stipulation of the parties states that: \u2018the sole question, to be decided is whether the Deputy Commissioner, in addition to total temporary and total permanent disability, has the power and jurisdiction under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to award additional sums on account of * * * serious facial disfigurement. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">\u201cThe matter must be considered as <em>res integra, </em>since it does not appear that the question has been previously decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-17\">\u201cLibelants urge that the statutory scheme for compensation for disability plainly indicates that an award for \u2018permanent total disability\u2019 (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(a) ) is the absolute maximum to be paid to the injured employee, and precludes any added award for facial disfigurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">\u201cThe schedule of compensation for disability to be paid to the employee is set forth in \u00a7 8 of the Act. (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-19\">\u201cSection 8(e) covers \u2018temporary partial disability\u2019, and provides that: \u2018In case of temporary partial disability resulting in decrease of earning capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the compensation shall be two-thirds of the difference between the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wages before the injury and his wage-earning capacity after the injury in the same or another employment, to be paid during the continuance of such disability, but shall not be paid for a period exceeding five years.\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908(e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u201cSection 8(b) covers \u2018temporary total disability\u2019, and provides that: \u2018In case of disability total in character but temporary in quality 66% per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance thereof.\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cSection 8(c) deals with \u2018permanent partial disability\u2019, and specifies that: \u2018In case of disability partial in character but permanent in quality the compensation shall be 66% per centum of the average weekly wages, which shall be in addition to the compensation for temporary total disability or temporary partial disability paid in accordance with subdivision (b) or subdivision (e) of this section, respectively, and shall be paid to the employee, as follows: (l)Arm lost, two hundred and eighty weeks\u2019 compensation; (2) Leg lost, two hundred and forty-eight weeks\u2019 compensation; (3) Hand lost, two hundred and twelve weeks\u2019 compensation. * * * (20) Disfigurement: The deputy commissioner shall award proper and equitable compensation for serious facial or head disfigurement, not to exceed $3,500.\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908 (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u201cSection 8(a) covers \u2018Permanent total disability\u2019, and provides that: \u2018In case of total disability adjudged to be permanent 66% per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of such total disability. Loss of both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs or both eyes, or of any two thereof shall, in the absence of conclusive proof to the contrary, constitute permanent total disability. In all other cases permanent total disability shall be determined in accordance with the facts.\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u201cRespondents apparently do not question that as a general proposition there can be no award for \u2018permanent partial disability\u2019 in addition to an award for \u2018permanent total disability\u2019, but seek to draw a distinction between the types of \u2018permanent-partial disability\u2019 injuries designated in paragraphs (1) through (19) of \u00a7 8(c), and the \u2018serious facial or head disfigurement\u2019 specified in paragraph (20).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u201cBasis for the distinction is said to be found in the mandatory language of paragraph (20), in particular the use of \u2018shall.\u2019 However, the language throughout subdivision (c), indeed throughout. \u00a7 8, appears to be in like manner mandatory. What is meant no doubt is that just as an employee \u2018shall be paid\u2019 212 weeks\u2019 compensation for the loss of a hand (Id. \u00a7 908(c) (3)), so \u2018shall\u2019 the deputy commissioner award him \u2018proper and equitable compensation for serious facial or head disfigurement, not to exceed $3,500\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908(c) (20)), provided he isn\u2019t already receiving the maximum amount of compensation payable under the Act for a disability that is both total and permanent. (Id. \u00a7 908(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\u201cAnother claimed distinction between the provisions of \u00a7 8(c) (20) and \u00a7 8 (c) (1)-(19) is that while compensation for certain named injuries listed in paragraphs (1) through (19) of subdivision (c) is payable for a specified number of weeks at 66%% of the average weekly wages, not to exceed $35.00 per week (Id. \u00a7 906(b)), compensation for \u2018serious facial or head disfigurement\u2019, on the other hand, is payable as a lump sum, to-be fixed by the deputy commissioner. The reason for this distinction would' appear obvious. As pointed out in la-cone v. Cardillo, 2 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d: 696, 699;</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">\u2018Schedules are set up not to put a \u201cprice\u201d on certain parts of the human body, but to ameliorate an otherwise intolerable administrative burden by providing a certain and easily applied method of determining the effect on wage-earning capacity of typical and classi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>fiable injuries.\u2019 208 F.2d at [pages] 699-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u201cIt seems clear from the very framework of the statute itself, as Judge Garrecht pointed out in Case v. Pillsbury, 9 Cir., 1945, 148 F.2d 392, 393, that: \u2018This subdivision [\u00a7 8(c) (20), 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(c) (20)] is just one of a series of classifications of injuries for permanent partial disability. * * * Subdivisions (1) to (19) under (c) provide specific awards for impairment due to loss of members and subdivision (c) (20) provides a separate award for disfigurement.\u2019 (148 F.2d at [page] 393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u201cThe view that \u00a7 8(c) sets forth \u2018a series of classifications of inj.uri'es for permanent partial disability,\u2019 and is not applicable to cases of' \u2018permanent total disability\u2019 (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(a) ), finds support in the language of \u00a7 8 (c) providing for \u2018permanent partial disability,\u2019 which expressly declares that awards thereunder shall be \u2018in addition to\u2019 compensation for \u2018temporary total disability\u2019 and for \u2018temporary partial disability\u2019 paid in accordance with \u2018subdivision (b) or subdivision (e),of this' section, respectively\u2019 ; but significantly omits any mention of subdivision (a) covering cases of \u2018permanent\" total disability.\u2019 (Id. \u00a7 908(b) and (e) and (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201cUpon testing the soundness of the conclusion that \u00a7 8(c) (20) is not applicable to cases of \u2018permanent total disability,\u2019 it is helpful to examine decisions of the New York courts interpreting the New York statute upon which the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is based. (See) Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit &amp; Steamship Co., 1949, :336 U.S. 198, 205 [69 S.Ct. 503, 93 L.Ed. 611]; Iacone v. Cardillo, supra, 208 F.2d .at [page] 697; Case v. Pillsbury, supra, 148 F.2d at [page] 394; Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Parker [D.C.] D.Md.1947, 72 F. Supp. 35, 39, affirmed 4- Cir., 1947, 163 F.2d 334.) The provisions of the New York statute .relating to disfigurement .are similar to those-of \u00a7\u20188(c) (20). (See: N.Y. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law [Consol. Laws, c. 67], \u00a7 15(3) (t).) And they have been interpreted by the New York courts to'mean that an award for disability that is both total and permanent, such as was granted in the case at bar, precludes an additional-award for facial or head- disfigurement. (See: Beekman v. N. Y. Evening Journal, 1939, 258 App.Div. 833, 15 N.Y.S.2d 671; Freeland v. Endicott Forging &amp; Mfg. Co., 1931, 233 App.Div. 440, 253 N.Y.S. 597; Clark v. Hayes, 1924, 207. App.Div. 560, 202 N.Y.S. 453, affirmed 1924, 238 N.Y. 553,144 N.E. 888.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u201cIt is interesting,-moreover, that the earliest of the New York decisions just cited was decided some years prior to adoption in 1927 of the Act here. So it may fairly be presumed that Congress was aware of the construction given the . facial disfigurement provisions of the New York law when the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was drafted. (See: Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. v. Monahan, 1 Cir., 1937, 91 F.2d 130; Terminal Shipping Co. v. Branham, [D.C.] D.Md.1942, 47 F. Supp. 561, affirmed 4 Cir., 1943, 136 F.2d 655.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\u201cFinally, the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as its name implies, is a compensation statute and invokes wage-compensation principles rather than tort principles. (See: Iacone v. Cardillo, supra, 208 F.2d at [page] 699; Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Cardillo, 1940 [72 App.D. C. 52], 112 F.2d 11, 17, certiorari denied 1940, 310 U.S. 649 [60 S.Ct. 1100, 84 L. Ed. 1415]; Wheeling Corrugating Co. v. McManigal, 4 Cir., 1930, 41 F.2d 593, 595; ;Chappell v. C. D. Johnson Lumber Corp. [D.C.] Ore.1953, 112 F.Supp. 625; Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Parker, [D.C.] D. Md.1946, 64 F.Supp. 615.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">- [1] \u201cAs a compensation statute im- \u25a0 posing upon the employer liability re- - gardless-of fault, the Act should generally be interpreted as providing for an award intended to compensate for loss of earning capacity. Any interpretation permitting an award of compensation for facial disfigurement-to be super-imposed upon' 'an award for \u2018permanent total disability\u2019 which presupposes a permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>loss of all earning capacity, would run counter to the manifest spirit and purpose of the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"> \u201cIf considerations of social policy argue for allowance of an additional award for \u2018serious facial or head disfigurement\u2019 under \u00a7 8(c) (20) (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(c) (20)) in cases of \u2018total disability adjudged to be permanent\u2019 under \u00a7 8 (a)' \u2014 thus applying tort rather than wage compensation principles where such disfigurement results \u2014 this end should be accomplished by Congressional enactment and not by judicial decision. (See: New York Central R. v. Bianc, 1919, 250 U.S. 596, [40 S.Ct. 44, 63 L.Ed. 1161]; Kobilkin v. Pillsbury, supra, 103 F.2d [677,] at [page] 670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u201cAccordingly the award, insofar as it directs libelants to pay respondent Clarence Rupert the sum of $2,000 on account of serious facial disfigurement, must be set aside, and enforcement thereof permanently enjoined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We approve that opinion. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
