Sec. 14, sub. c(4), Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 32, sub. c(4), Title 11 U.S.C.A. The Referee found that at the time the bankrupt made the transfers to his mother, he did so with intent to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, sustained the objections, and denied the application for discharge. On review, the District Judge held that the Referee\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and sustained the order, from which ruling this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-22\">The referee, in making his findings, reviewed the evidence and clearly pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>out the facts upon which the findings were based. For the reasons given by the Referee, the findings, which have been confirmed by the District Judge, are approved. In re Pcnfield Distilling Co., 6 Cir., 131 F.2d 694; New Southern Ohio Gas Co. v.
