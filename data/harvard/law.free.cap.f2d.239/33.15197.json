Mrs. Florence F. Loudon is the holder of U. S. Patent No. 2,672,-194, entitled \u201cSupporting Means for Curtains and the Like.\u201d The patent covers a tape which is applied to the top edge of a curtain or drape, together with a form of hook which fits into pockets in the tape in such a way as to form the drape into pleats and folds. She caused her attorneys to send letters to numerous department stores, charging that her patent was being infringed by tape and hook combinations being manufactured by the Consolidated Trimming Corporation, and demanding the discontinuance of the sale of \u201cdevices which constitute infringements\u201d of her patent. Consolidated thereupon filed suit in the District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that Mrs. Loudon\u2019s patent is invalid and is not infringed by Consolidated\u2019s product. Mrs. Loudon filed an answer but no counterclaim. After a trial the court concluded that plaintiff (Consolidated)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had the burden of proving \u2014 but had not proved \u2014 its allegations that the patent in suit is invalid, that the patent is unenforceable, and that it is not infringed by plaintiff\u2019s products. The court further concluded that defendant\u2019s patent is presumed to be valid and enforceable unless the contrary is proved, that plaintiff is not entitled to any of the relief which it seeks, and that the complaint should be dismissed. Judgment was thereupon entered dismissing the complaint. On this appeal Consolidated argues that the burden of proof on the issue of infringement was on defendant Loudon, who had theretofore charged infringement, that the plaintiff\u2019s accused devices do not infringe the defendant\u2019s patent, and that in any event the patent is invalid, chiefly by reason of lack of invention in view of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">Under the better practice, a court\u2019s first concern in cases of this sort should be with the question of the validity of the patent allegedly infringed. Sinclair &amp; Carroll Co. v. Interchemical Corp., 325 U.S. 327, 330, 65 S.Ct. 1143, 89 L.Ed. 1644 (1945). In Mrs. Loudon\u2019s patent, Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 describe the pleater hook; Claim 1, which is representative, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-18\">\u201cFor use with a drape having at its upper end a plurality of vertically extending horizontally spaced parallel tunnels or loops closed at their upper ends and open at their lower ends, a pleater and supporting means having four inverted U-shaped pocket engaging fingers of narrow width and having rounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>upper ends and disposed in a single plane and a hook located between the two center fingers and directed substantially at right angles to the plane of the fingers, said hook having the supporting portion thereof below the rounded upper ends of the fingers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Claim 5, which describes the combination of the hook with the pleater tape, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201cThe combination of a drapery curtain having a pleater pocket strip applied transversely at the upper hanging edge of the curtain and said pleater strip being provided with a plurality of spaced apart vertically extending parallel pockets open at their lower ends and closed at their upper ends, said pleater strip being secured to the curtain at its upper and lower edges to leave the lower ends of the pockets open and unobstructed, a supporting hanging and pleating hook member having four elongated upright non-penetrating pocket entering fingers of substantially the same length extending upwardly in closely disposed horizontally spaced relation, said fingers having blunt upper ends and being disposed in a single plane for insertion upwardly into the open ends of a plurality of said pockets, and a supporting hook portion located between the two middle fingers with the hook portion thereof disposed rearwardly and substantially midway of the length of said fingers, said fingers being more closely spaced and brought together than the spacing of the pockets whereby the fingers when fitted endwise upwardly into said pockets cooperate to draw the upper edge of the curtain together in a pinch-pleat arrangement with the several fingers each supporting a pleat through substantially the entire vertical extent of the pinch-pleat and supporting each pleat laterally and forwardly and rearwardly with the upper ends of the fingers in the pockets having closed upper ends supporting the curtain against sagging upon the fingers of the supporting member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amf\">The essential principle of appellee\u2019s device is this: When prongs with little space between are inserted into pockets of a tape spaced at greater intervals, the prongs will cause the tape to bunch or pleat. And of course if the tape is sewn to a curtain and the prongs are equipped with a hook, proper insertion will cause the curtain to have pleats, and it may be hung. This idea was shown in 1904 by Knight\u2019s British Patent No. 24,-522 and in 1906 by Carr\u2019s U. S. Patent No. 834,188. The specification for Knight discloses: \u201cA tape or webbing for heading of curtains and hangings having loops attached or interwoven at intervals of its length. A hook or suspender carrying three claws arranged in triangular form. By means of the hooks and tape or webbing aforementioned, the curtain or hanging to which they are attached is gathered into folds, or box pleats, by inserting one or more of the claws of said hook, into whichever, or as many of the loops in or on the tape as may be necessary to produce the desired result.\u201d Both Knight\u2019s and Carr\u2019s hooks create pleats or folds because the distance between the pockets in the tape is greater than the distance between the hooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The question is, then, whether Mrs. Loudon\u2019s patent shows invention over the prior art.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She says that it does: that she has produced a \u201cnovel combination.\u201d Her device differs from both Knight and Carr in that the back or shank of the hook is lower than the top of the prong. But this development is shown as early as Nachmann (No. 763,780), who specifically notes its utility in causing the curtain to conceal the hanging device behind it. Appellee\u2019s prongs are all in a single plane, an arrangement which is found in Carr and Steiner (No. 2,012,-734). Appellee\u2019s prong supports the top <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of a closed pocket, which Carr clearly does not teach and Knight apparently does not. However, Charlton (British Patent No. 151,108) has a single prong, to be inserted in a tape, supporting the closed top of the tube in the tape. And French (No. 2,183,188) specifically states that some of his hooks for use with heading tape are \u201cadapted to engage the furthest parts of the hook tubes.\u201d Appellee describes the prongs of her device as being \u201cinverted U-shaped.\u201d While we doubt that invention could reside in this modification of styling, it is enough to point out that this same design was employed by Charlton (British Patent No. 151,108).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u201cThe mere aggregation of a number of old parts or elements which, in the aggregation, perform or produce no new or different function or operation than that theretofore performed or produced by them, is not patentable invention.\u201d Lincoln Engineering Co. of Illinois v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 303 U.S. 545, 549, 58 S.Ct. 662, 664, 82 L.Ed. 1008 (1938). And in Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), the Court said: \u201cThe conjunction or concert of known elements must contribute something; only when the whole in some way exceeds the sum of its parts is the accumulation of old devices patentable.\u201d Like the A. &amp; P. case, the case now at bar \u201cis wanting in any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned,\u201d and there is nothing to indicate that the District Court \u201cscrutinized the claims in the light of this rather severe test.\u201d Ibid. Again, to paraphrase A. &amp; P., we note that neither the Board of Patent Appeals nor the District Court has made \u201cany finding that old elements which made up this device perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it.\u201d Ibid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The District Court\u2019s finding as to validity states only that \u201cPlaintiff has failed to carry its burden of proving that the patent in suit is invalid.\u201d Nor does the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals offer anything to indicate wherein the aggregation there approved rises to the level of patentable invention. Indeed the Board appears to have applied standards contrary to those laid down by the courts. The conclusion of the Board\u2019s opinion notes that Mrs. Loudon\u2019s device \u201cfacilitates the curtain hanging operation and while, in our opinion, * * * [her] contribution is not great, we think that in view of the fact that the art here-involved is highly developed, patentability of the claim is not negatived by the cited patents.\u201d In the first place, \u201cA mere advance in efficiency and utility is not enough to convert a non-inventive aggregation into a patentable combination.\u201d Kwikset Locks, Inc., v. Hillgren, 210 F.2d 483, 486 (9th Cir., 1954). Secondly, the Board has misconstrued the significance of the crowded state of the art. On the contrary, \u201cto make sure that a monopoly is not granted for mere perfection of workmanship, the courts closely scrutinize claims to combinations for improvements in a crowded art.\u201d Shaffer v. Armer, 184 F.2d 303, 307 (10th Cir., 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">We think it is clear that Mrs\u00bb Loudon\u2019s patent is invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The A. &amp; P. decision seems to us to be controlling. As was there said: \u201cWe set aside no-finding of fact as to invention, for none has been made * * *. The defect that we find in this judgment is that a standard of invention appears to have been used that is less exacting than that required where a combination is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>up entirely of old components. It is on this ground that the judgment below is reversed.\u201d 340 U.S. at pages 153-154, 71 S.Ct. at pages 130, 131, 95 L.Ed. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter a judgment declaring that defendant-appellee\u2019s patent is invalid, and granting such further relief to plaintiff-appellant as may appear to the court to be just and proper.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\">. On this point, Consolidated in effect concedes that it has the burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">. Neither party urges that the new patent act, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. (1952), alters the rules announced in Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Corp., supra; furthermore, several courts have held that it does not. E.g., Interstate Rubber Products Corp. v. Radiator Specialty Co., 214 E.2d 546, 548 (4th Cir. 1954); General Motors Corp. v. Estate Stove Co., 203 F.2d 912, 918 (6th Cir. 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b88-14\">. We do not reach the issue of infringement <em>vel non, </em>and express no opinion on whether Consolidated had the burden of proof in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
