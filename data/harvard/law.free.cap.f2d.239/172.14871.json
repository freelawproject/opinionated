Indeed it shows on its face that nothing alleged shows or tends to show, as required by the section, \u201cthat the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
