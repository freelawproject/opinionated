The Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission affirmed his dismissal late in 1952. From April 1952 to May 1954 his counsel was seriously ill. His present complaint was filed August 16, 1954. We see no reason to disturb the District Court\u2019s conclusion that any relief to which he might otherwise be entitled was barred by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
