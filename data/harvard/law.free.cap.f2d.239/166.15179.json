It was contained in an envelope bearing the United States postmark for September 14, 1955. Hence the court correctly held it had no jurisdiction of the petition, since it was not filed within the 90 days required by I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a), 26 U.S.C., and since I.R.C. \u00a7 7502(a), providing for treating timely mailing as timely filing, was inapplicable in view of its express requirement that the postmark date must fall within the prescribed period.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
