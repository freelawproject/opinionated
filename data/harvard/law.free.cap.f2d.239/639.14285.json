Plaintiff made a motion for a new trial, which was overruled. In support of the motion, she contended that the verdict was inadequate in amount because it was not sufficient to compensate her for her damages and injuries. The same contention is made in this court on appeal by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">We have examined the evidence bearing upon the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and the relationship of- her subsequent illness, expenses and loss of income to the alleged accident. The jury had a right to consider all of this evidence and determine the extent to which these elements of damages were attributable to the accident on the train. Damages assessed by a jury are largely discretionary with it. The trial court may, in an exercise of its discretion, grant a new trial because the damages assessed by the jury are inadequate. However, in this case, to reverse the judgment below we must conclude that the trial court has abused its discretion in failing to conclude that the jury abused its discretion in returning a verdict fixing damages in the sum of $1,800. Bucher v. Krause, 7 Cir., 200 F.2d 576. On the record, we fail to find any abuse of discretion in this respect by either the jury or the trial court. Therefore the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
