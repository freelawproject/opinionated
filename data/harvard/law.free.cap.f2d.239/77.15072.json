They contend the character of the neighborhood makes the Commission\u2019s refusal to rezone arbitrary and unreasonable. The District Court found that \u201cthe matter is at most debatable and finding this, we must affirm the determination of the Zoning Commission if we are not to exceed our proper scope of review. See Lewis v. District of Columbia (1951) 89 U.S.App. D.C. 72 [190 F.2d 25].\u201d We do not think the court was clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
