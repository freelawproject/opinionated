The court properly instructed the jury with reference to these charts, that they were offered merely in explanation of the witness\u2019s testimony and his computations, and that it was for the jury to say \u201cwhether there is competent evidence in the record to support the figures as shown on these charts.\u201d The admission of such tabulations as an aid to the jury does not constitute reversible error. It has been approved by this court in recent cases of income tax evasion. In Gariepy v. United States, 6 Cir., 189 F.2d 459, 462, the court declared that the computation was at best \u201cbut an estimate, but as an estimate it was entitled to the consideration of the jury because based on substantially the entire evidence in the record.\u201d Cf. Eggleton v. United States of America, 6 Cir., 227 F. 2d 493; American Vitrified Products Co. v. Wyer, 6 Cir., 221 F.2d 447. The use of such calculations was approved by the Supreme Court in United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 519, 63 S.Ct. 1233, 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1546. The record shows that within the holding of the Johnson case the trial court herein left the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cfree to exercise its untrammeled judgment upon the worth and weight\u201d of the evidence given in these charts.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The trial was fair. It was shown by overwhelming evidence that appellant had made substantial understatements of her income for the years in question. No reversible error appears in the record and it is ordered that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
