The outer end of the hollow rod is closed by a cap, the opposite end of the horizontal rod being also closed. The upper side of the hollow rod is provided with an air vent adjacent the outer end thereof to prevent entrapped air from hampering the movement of said hollow rod either inwardly or outwardly.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The board sustained the examiner\u2019s rejection of claim 4 as being unpatentable over Carlson taken alone or in view of Pederson. It was the examiner\u2019s contention that the novelty, if any, which resides in appellant\u2019s closet pole is in the use of the air vent in the supporting cup, the other elements of appellant\u2019s apparatus being clearly shown by Carlson. Noting that, as described in appellant\u2019s specification, the closet pole is assembled by first mounting the supporting means and subsequently extending the ends of the rods into their respective cups, the examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * When employing such manner of assembly the air vent is unnecessary and of no utility for the following reasons: Rod 28 is open at its opposite ends during extension of the rod towards the cups 26 of brackets 20 attached to cleats 14 and 16. Thus no rarefaction of the air in the tubular rod will occur during such extension. The ends of the rod 28 will be closed to entrance or escape of air when the rod just begins to seat in both cups 26, assuming that the fit between the cups and rod is air-tight. However even during the further extension of the rod to complete the seating in the cups substantially no compression will occur within the rod because the decrease in the volume which the air occupied in the cup before extension of the rod will be substantially off-set by the increase in the volume which the air must occupy in the rod after extension. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u25a0 The examiner concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201c * * * Moreover, even if an air vent were necessary in the Carlson device, no invention is seen in providing such means as taught by Pederson. The advantages which, applicant argues will be attained by providing such air vent in the bottom of the cup of Carlson rather than in the extensible rod, in accordance with the teachings of Peder-son, are obvious and expected, and if it were found that the rod location of the air vent resulted in clogging of the vent by dust, or the blowing of dust on the clothes during extension or retraction of the rod, it would readily occur to one having ordinary skill in the art that, such defect could be remedied by relocating the air vent in a more concealed position such as in the bottom of the cup. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, it does not appear that the location of the air vent is critical. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Appellant concedes that broadly to provide an air vent in the closet pole of Carlson would not amount to invention* but argues that it is the particular location of the air vent which renders his-, closet pole structure patentable over the prior art. Since the Pederson reference discloses an air vent which is disposed directly <em>on </em>the clothing rod, it can do na more than to teach the provision of a vent opening on one of the extensible rods of Carlson. This, appellant continues, is not the equivalent of his structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Appellant further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">\u201c * * * Pederson discloses [the air vent] adjacent the end of the rod, so that if the air vent is positioned in the structure o,f Carlson as shown in the structure of Pederson, it would be blocked off by the cup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>within which the end of the Carlson rod seats. If, however, the air vent were placed at some other position along the rod, then the air vent would be exposed to dust, grease, hanger paint and other clogging impurities as well as the possibility of clogging from clothes hangers themselves resting on the rod.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cBy placing the air vent in the bottom of the cup within which the end of the extensible rod section seats, appellant avoids any possibility of clotting [sic] this vent and not only utilizes the extensible rod as well as the cup as a means for protecting the vent from clogging but, in addition, serves as a means to position the vent in a concealed, unobtrusive position which is unaffected by handling of the rod no matter how the rod is handled, and which is unaffected by any bending, pinching, or twisting stresses occasioned on the rod by hanger weights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In regard to the examiner\u2019s rejection on Carlson alone, appellant appears to have abandoned his original contention that there is appreciable expansion or rarefaction of the entrapped air within the extensible rods and now asserts that the pressure within said rods will vary proportionally with the increase and decrease of the ambient temperature, necessitating the air vent which he had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We have carefully considered the arguments advanced and are of the opinion that the decision of the board is sound and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Except for the provision of an air vent, appellant\u2019s clothes closet pole does not substantially differ from that of Carlson. The examiner has adequately shown that the use of an air vent in the Carlson structure is unnecessary and produces no new or unexpected results. We are satisfied both with his reasoning and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">It is well established that mere differences between that which is alleged to be patentable and the prior art do-not of themselves support patentability; the ultimate question is whether the features of the subject matter in question display inventive concept over the prior-art. In re Voit, 152 F.2d 987, 33 C.C. P.A., Patents, 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the air vent is desirable and necessary due to a. pressure variant resulting from changes-in the ambient temperature is tenuous. Any change in temperature in a closet-in which appellant\u2019s closet pole is placed' would be minute and not of such consequence as would cause any appreciable-change of pressure of the air entrapped within said pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Were we to assume, arguendo, that an air vent were desirable in the-Carlson structure, we would nevertheless be constrained to conclude that appellant\u2019s contribution to the art was of' no patentable moment. It would be an idle task for this court to add to what has been sufficiently discussed in theaforequoted rejection of the examiner as to this contention. Appellant\u2019s argument that the incorporation of the Pederson air vent in the closet pole of Carlson would not produce the results obtained by his particularly located vent is apparently based upon the assumption that the disclosures of two or more prior art references may not be combined to-negative invention unless they are <em>bodily </em>incorporated into the disclosures of the-primary reference. Upon both precedent and reason, such a proposition could not be accepted by this court as being-declaratory of the law. Suffice it to say that it is adequate to negative patent-ability if one skilled in the art, having the teachings of the references before him, is able, without the use of the inventive faculty, to produce the subject, matter recited in the claim. In reTwomey, 218 F.2d 593, 42 C.C.P.A.,, Patents, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate in place of COLE, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">WORLEY, J., was not present at the argument of this case, but, by agreement of counsel, did participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
