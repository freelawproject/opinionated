On November 5, 1954, the Commission ordered that a hearing be held on the question of denial of registration to petitioner, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(b), which hearing was held at Los Angeles, California, in November and December 1954. On February 8, 1955, the Hearing Examiner filed a 44 page Recommended Decision which recommended that petitioner\u2019s application for registration as a broker and dealer become \u201ceffective forthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">The Commission\u2019s Division of Trading and Exchanges filed exceptions to this Recommended Decision, and in response, petitioner sought adoption of the recommended decision. Following an independent review of the evidence, the Commission, on August 16,1955, issued its Findings, Opinion and Order denying petitioner\u2019s application for registration. On October 24, 1955, the Commission denied petitioner\u2019s petition for rehearing. On October 14, 1955, petitioner petitioned this Court for Review of the order denying petitioner registration as a broker and dealer, asking \u2019this Court to \u201cset aside\u201d the order so far as it denies petitioner registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">The Commission found that petitioner had willfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77q(a); 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 78j (b) and rule X-10B-5, 17 C.F. R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, issued thereunder; 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(c) (1) and rule X-15C1-2, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15cl-2, issued thereunder; and 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(b) and rule X-15B-8, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15b-8 issued thereunder. The Commission found that petitioner had willfully violated 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(a) in that petitioner engaged in transactions as a broker and dealer before he was registered although the Commission\u2019s Assistant Regional Administrator had, on several occasions, advised petitioner to apply for registration, and on one occasion sent petitioner the necessary application forms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Petitioner makes three specifications of error, the first of which is that the order of the Commission issued August 16, 1955, denying petitioner registration as a broker-dealer is based on findings which are contrary to the record and are not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78y(a) provides that \u201cAny person aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission * * * may obtain a review of such order * * *.\u201d Such section also states that \u201cThe finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d The scope of this review is to determine if the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. Norris &amp; Hirshberg, Inc., v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 268, 177 F.2d 228; Archer v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1943, 8 Cir., 133 F.2d 795, 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">This Court has carefully reviewed the evidence and believes there is not only substantial evidence but an abundance of evidence to support the Commission\u2019s elaborate findings of fraud and willful misrepresentation by petitioner, particularly with respect to certain stock transactions with a Mr. Hayward, a resident of California, and in respect to petitioner\u2019s financial statement filed with the Commission which failed to list approximately $3,000 of unsecured liabilities owed by petitioner, $1,900 of which was owed by petitioner to Hayward. This latter obligation is especially interesting as it appears that petitioner stated to the Commission\u2019s Los Angeles staff that he had settled with Hayward. As to the transactions while unregistered, petitioner admits that he acted as a broker-dealer while unregistered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It should be noted that these transactions occurred while he was unregistered, as he has never been registered by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">The second specification of error is that the order of the Commission \u201c * * * does not give proper weight, as required by law, to the Recommended Decision of the Hearing Examiner, who heard the evidence, which Recommended Decision was favorable to Petitioner.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">Petitioner cites Morgan v. United States, 1936, 298 U.S. 468, 481, 56 S.Ct. 906, 912, 80 L.Ed. 1288, where the Court stated, \u201cThe one who decides must hear.\u201d But petitioner overlooks the immediately succeeding paragraph in that opinion, which reads in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-16\">\u201cThis necessary rule does not preclude practicable administrative procedure in obtaining the aid of assistants in the department. Assistants may prosecute inquiries. Evidence may be taken by an examiner. Evidence thus taken may be sift\u00e9d and analyzed by competent subordinates. Argument may be oral or written. The requirements are not technical. But there must be a hearing in a substantial sense. And to give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making determinations upon evidence, the officer who makes the determinations must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>sider and appraise the evidence which justifies them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It would seem to be petitioner\u2019s position that the Commission did not give sufficient consideration and weight to the findings of the Hearing Examiner, which findings were favorable to petitioner. Petitioner further suggests that the Commission relied upon a \u201cdigest\u201d of the record prepared by its staff. In this matter the opinion of the Court in Norris &amp; Hirshberg, Inc., v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 163 F.2d 689, 693, certiorari denied 1948, 333 U.S. 867, 68 S.Ct. 788, 92 L.Ed. 1145, is relevant. The Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c* * * An administrative agency, such as the respondent here, may utilize the services of subordinates to sift and analyze the evidence received by the trial examiner and subsequent use by the agency of a written resume of that sifting and analyzing is a part of its internal decisional process which may not be probed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c * * * We are not concerned with the manner in which the Commission gives consideration to the record; it is enough if it certifies that consideration has been given and that its findings arise therefrom * * (Footnote citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">In its Findings and Opinion, the Commission stated, \u201cOur findings are based upon an independent review of the record.\u201d From a reading of the Commission\u2019s Findings and Opinion it seems self-evident that the Commission made a thorough analysis of testimony and of the documentary evidence connected with the securities transactions at issue. This Court has considered the Findings of the Hearing Examiner and has given them reasonable probative force in answering the question whether the evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s order is substantial. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456; Federal Communications Commission v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp., 1955, 349 U.S. 358, 75 S.Ct. 855, 99 L. Ed. 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">The third and final specification of error is that \u201cThe penalty imposed upon Petitioner, who has already been denied the right to earn a living as a registered broker-dealer for a period of over a year and a half, is cruel, unusual and excessive.\u201d We quote a portion of petitioner\u2019s brief which summarizes his legal position well: \u201cThe proceedings in this case have obviously cost Pierce several .thousands of dollars. They have also been a liberal education to him as to S.E.C. regulations. There appears no proper basis for any inference he would injure anyone in the future. Pierce desires to register and comply with the S.E.C. regulations. It appears to us that further penalties, after a year and a half of suspension, would be arbitrary, cruel and unusual and not in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">In our view, petitioner misinterprets the purpose of the broker-dealer registration law here involved. Denial of registration is not to be regarded as a penalty imposed on the broker. To the contrary, it is but a means to protect the public interest. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(b); Wright v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1940, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 89, 94; Smolowe v. Delendo Corporation, 1940, D.C.N.Y., 36 F.Supp. 790. The Commission is given the duty to protect the public. What will protect the public must involve, of necessity, an exercise of discretionary determination. This Court ordinarily should not substitute its judgment of what would be appropriate under the circumstances in place of the Commission\u2019s judgment as to measures necessary to protect the public interest. Wright v. Securities and Exchange Commission, supra; cf. Shawmut Association v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1945, 1 Cir., 146 F. 2d 791. Since the evidence substantially supports the Findings of the Commission as to violations of law by petitioner, we cannot conclude that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>abused its discretion in denying him registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Upon the whole record the Commission\u2019s determination should be, and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-16\">. It appears that on October 7, 1954, the Commission commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada to enjoin petitioner from engaging as a securities broker and deal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>er in violation of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(a). No injunction has been issued due to a stipulation entered into with the approval of the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">. In his statement of points on which he intended to rely on this appeal, Rule 17, subd. 6, Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 28 U.S.C.A., petitioner stated, \u201cPetition- . er concedes that he did act as a broker-dealer while unregistered and now desires to correct that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\">. The Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, Rule 9, 15 U.S.C.A. following section 78u, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.9, provides for a recommended decision by the bearing officer. Rule 9(d) states, in part, \u201cAll recommended decisions shall be advisory only, and the findings, conclusions and other matters therein contained shall not be binding upon the Commission. The initial page of the recommended decision shall contain a statement to such effect.\u201d The initial page of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s recommended decision contained the following statement, \u201cPursuant to Rule IX (d) of the Rules of Practice, this Recommended Decision is advisory only and the findings, conclusions and other matters herein contained shall not be binding upon the Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
