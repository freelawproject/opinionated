It is unlawful in the District of Columbia for any person to \u201cknowingly have in his possession * * * any * * * paper * * * used or to be used in violating the provisions of sections 22-1501, 22-1504, or 22-1508 * * D.C. Code (1951 Ed., Supp. IV) \u00a7 22-1502. Section 22-1508 makes it unlawful to \u201cpurchase, possess, own, or acquire any chance, right, or interest * * * in any policy lottery or any lottery * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-26\">It was proved that in executing a search warrant, police found in appellant\u2019s possession papers on which numbers were written. An officer who quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>fied as an expert testified in effect that these papers were numbers slips. Appellant testified in effect that he intended to play these numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Since conscious possession of papers \u201cto be used in violating * * * 22-1508\u201d was clearly proved, \u00a7 1502 covers the case and there is no constitutional difficulty. Cf. Benton v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 84, 232 F.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
