To salvage something from the situation plaintiffs now attempt to show a breach of confidential relations by defendants in marketing a toothbrush made according to a design disclosed confidentially by plaintiffs to defendants. If we may properly reach this issue not pleaded or raised below, we can see no merit in it. The relations between the parties are subject to a definite contract of July 11, 1947, wherein plaintiffs granted defendants the right of exclusive manufacture and distribution of their \u201cPocket Tooth Brush\u201d in return for a royalty of 5 per cent of net sales. The parties operated under this agreement for the manufacture of the toothbrush first with a solid handle of the plastic molding and then with a modification to a \u201cweb head,\u201d so called, with lateral cavities formed in the head. This was a minor change, in appearance and perhaps in the amount of material used, but only that as the parties themselves showed by the continuance of the royalty payments accepted by the plaintiffs until disagreement arose. Thus the Patent Office viewed the designs as so much alike that it required plaintiffs to elect which to press, the plaintiffs then selecting the web design. Now the plaintiffs are attempting to claim purloining of this newer design, but it is clear that it is covered by the general terms of the licensing agreement and that plaintiffs\u2019 rights are limited entirely to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-22\">The parties appear to be in sharp dispute as to who is initially in default in the performance of that agreement. But since no claims based upon it are before: us here, we need not try to settle any questions which may arise as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-23\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
