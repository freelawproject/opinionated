One 1953 Oldsmobile \u201c88\u201d Two Door Sedan, D.C.N.D.Fla.,. 122 F.Supp. 488. That case arose under \u00a7 3116 of the I.R.C. of 1939,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was brought forward in changed form as \u00a7 7302, I.R.C.1954 (see footnote 1, supra). The explanation of the change in the Committee Reports <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u00a7 7302. <em>Property used in violation of internal revenue laws</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXB\">\u201cThis section contains no material change from existing law. The language of the section has been changed slightly in order to make clear that its provisions have general application under this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aet\">Without much discussion, the new \u00a7 7302 was held by the Western District of Arkansas to apply to property used in violating the wagering tax laws in United States v. One 1953 Oldsmobile Sedan, D.C., 132 F.Supp. 14, 19; and, without any discussion, it was apparently assumed to be so applicable by this Circuit in United States v. Roberson, 5 Cir., 233 F.2d 517, where we sustained the district court\u2019s judgment denying forfeiture on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence. While those cases are persuasive, we think that neither of them should preclude consideration of the questions raised below and seriously argued on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">It is urged that the specific penalties provided for violation of \u00a7 3290 and \u00a7 3291 of the 1939 Code should prevail over the general forfeiture provisions of \u00a7 7302 of the 1954 Code. To sustain such an argument would leave little or no field for the operation of \u00a7 7302, since every violation of the internal revenue laws, that we know of, is accompanied by its own specific penalties. Where the liquor tax laws contained specific forfeiture as well as penalty provisions, similar arguments have been rejected. United States v. Caney, 5 Cir., 183 F. 2d 273; One Ford Tudor Automobile, etc. v. United States, 5 Cir., 164 F.2d 1020; United States v. Windle, 8 Cir., 158 F.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">It is urged that \u201cForfeitures are not favored; they should be enforced only when within both letter and spirit of the law.\u201d United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 De Luxe Coach, 307 U.S. 219, 226, 59 S.Ct. 861, 865, 83 L.Ed. 1249. As noted in the same opinion, however, \u201cThe point to be sought is the intent of the law-making powers.\u201d In an earlier case, the Supreme Court had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">\u201cWe are not called upon to give a strained interpretation in order to avoid a forfeiture. Statutes to prevent fraud on the revenue are construed less narrowly, even though a forfeiture results, than penal statutes and others involving forfeitures.\u201d United States v. Ryan, 284 U.S. 167, 172, 52 S.Ct. 65, 67, 76 L.Ed. 224.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">See, also, Manufacturers Acceptance Corporation v. United States, 6 Cir., 193 F. 2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">It is said that we should construe \u00a7 7302 with especial strictness since 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3617, providing for remission or mitigation of forfeitures, has reference only to the liquor tax laws. Available, however, are the compromise pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ers of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which formerly provided the procedure to afford relief to innocent owners in liquor tax cases. United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 De Luxe Coach, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AMA_\">The gist of the offense is said to be the failure to pay the tax,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the truck was not used in failing to pay the tax. Section 7302 requires only that the vehide be used or intended for use \u201cin violating the provisions of the internal revenue laws.\u201d One of the acts going to constitute such violation was the engaging in the business of receiving wagers especially when, as here alleged, that was done \u201cwith intent to defraud the United States of the wagerin'g occupational tax.\u201d A like contention has not prevailed in liquor tax cases. One Ford Tudor Automobile, etc. v. United States, supra; United States v. Ganey, supra; Jarrett v. United States, 4 Cir., 184 F. 2d 532; Shively v. United States, 4 Cir., 210 F.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"AWc\">Finally, it is insisted that, while \u00a7 7302 of the 1954 Code broadens the scope of \u00a7 3116 of the 1939 Code, it should be confined to cases involving a commodity upon which a tax is imposed, that the truck itself must in some way be guilty. See Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 505, 510, 511, 41 S.Ct. 189, 65 L.Ed. 376; United States v. One 1948 Plymouth Sedan, 3 Cir., 198 F.2d 399; United States v. Lane Motor Co., 344 U.S. 630, 73 S.Ct. 459, 97 L.Ed. 622. In the last cited case, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat a vehicle used solely for commuting to an illegal distillery is not used <em>in </em>violating the revenue laws.\u201d 344 U.S. at page 631, 73 S.Ct. at page 460. The rule is different, however, where the vehide is used not merely for the convenfence of the operator in commuting, but also as an active aid in violating the revenue laws, even though not for the transportation of any commodities subject to seizure. United States v. One 1952 Lincoln Sedan, 5 Cir., 213 F.2d 786; One Ford Tudor Automobile, etc. v. United States, supra; United States v. Ganey. supra; Jarrett v. United States, supra; Shively v. United States, supra. Cf. United States v. Jones, 5 Cir., 194 F. 2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"avc-dedup-0\">The plain language of \u00a7 7302 covers a truck used and intended for use in violating the wagering tax laws.
