Rule 32(b), Fed.Rules Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-21\">\u201cIt is Further Adjudged that prison terms be suspended and defendant placed on probation for period of two years from this date, <em>on condition that defendant make every effort to pay tax liability to the United States. </em>(Italics ours.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-22\">That was a final and appealable judgment. Korematsu v. United States, 1943, 319 U.S. 432, 63 S.Ct. 1124, 87 L.Ed. 1497; Berman v. United States, 1937, 302 U.S. 211, 58 S.Ct. 164, 82 L.Ed. 204. But the appeal now before us is from an order, dated May 31, 1956, revoking Steiner\u2019s probation, after a hearing, and committing him \u201cto the custody of the Attorney General for a period of eighteen months, imposed in the original judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-23\"> Almost two years after he has been under the order placing him on probation, Steiner challenges the italicized condition, embodied in it, and already quoted. \u201cProbation or suspension of sentence comes as an act of grace to one convicted of a crime * * *.\u201d Escoe v. Zerbst, 1935, 295 U.S. 490, 492, 55 S.Ct. 818, 819, 79 L.Ed. 1566. By accepting probation on the condition, now challenged, without earlier seeking review of the 1954 order within the time, Rule 37, Federal Rules Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., provided for appeals, defendant is foreclosed from attacking it. From the record it appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Steiner was represented by two attorneys at the time sentence was imposed and probation granted, and when the district judge and defendant exchanged these remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">\u201cThe Court: One of the conditions under which I am placing you on probation is that you make every reasonable effort and every honest effort to satisfy your tax liability with the government. It won\u2019t be up to the Internal Revenue Department to determine whether you are making that effort; it will be up to this court. It will be that you have to satisfy this court to make every reasonable effort\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201cA. I think I can do that. I will try.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cQ. (Continuing) \u2014 to discharge this liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cThe Clerk: Fine of $10,000; the defendant committed to<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> custody of the Attorney General for eighteen months, and sentence be suspended and the defendant placed on probation for a period of two years, conditioned that the defendant make every effort to pay the tax liability to the U. S. Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201cThe Court: And that the court shall be the judge of whether this effort, your utmost effort\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">\u201cA. I think that\u2019s fair, your hon- or.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Even if Steiner\u2019s belated attempt at eradicating the condition, \u201cthat he make every effort to pay tax liability,\u201d is before us, by indirection at least, we refrain from disturbing the judicial discretion ordering it, and exercised under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651, providing for granting probation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-19\">\u201cWhen * * * the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby * * * upon such terms and conditions as the court deems best.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">Judicial discretion is the fabric from which probation is cut and tailored. See e. g. Berra v. United States, 8 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 590 affirmed 1956, 351 U.S. 131, 76 S.Ct. 685. We think defendant\u2019s argument erected on the restitution clause of \u00a7 3651 lacks persuasive force. United States v. Stoehr, 3 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 276, strongly pressed on us by defendant, contains a dissimilar condition of probation requiring <em>payment </em>of taxes within ninety days after probation commenced upon the defendant\u2019s release from prison \u2014 he having been sentenced to imprisonment on other counts. Determination of tax liability and efforts to pay taxes are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">But <em>effort </em>to pay is what was required of Steiner. After reading the record made during the probation revocation hearings we are satisfied that the district judge\u2019s discretion was again unabused. Burns v. United States, 1932, 287 U.S. 216, 53 S.Ct. 154, 77 L.Ed. 266, instead of providing the comfort which defendant seems to find in it, lends strength to our approval of the proceeding held below. See also: Kirsch v. United States, 8 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 652. Other points urged by defendant display a robust abandon of the record revealing ample, timely and explicit notice of, and alleged grounds for, revocation, as well as Steiner\u2019s unqualified declaration that he was going to act as his own attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed he questioned some of the five witnesses who testified in support of the petition to revoke probation. By sorting out this printed record it reveals that the first stage of the revocation proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>began April 24, 1956 and was resumed May 31, 1956. The first extensive hearing adequately demonstrates Steiner\u2019s acute and astute grasp of the situation and, the continuance given him for the express purpose of reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The order appealed revoking probation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-24\">. It was also ordered that the $5000 deposited by defendant as bail \u201cbe applied as part payment of fine, and that execution of sentence be stayed as to the bal-anee of the fine for six months.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-12\">. See e. g. T. R. 106 when at the continued hearing, May 31, 1956, after stating some other matters, Mr. Steiner said to the district judge: \u201c * * * As you know, when I appeared here before you the last time, I was not represented by counsel; and as a result \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b714-22\">\u201cThe Court: But you had every opportunity to appear by counsel. No one prevented you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b714-24\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, no, I am not using that as an excuse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
