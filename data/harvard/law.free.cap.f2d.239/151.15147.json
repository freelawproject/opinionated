The complaint was filed February 4, 1956, next after Williams\u2019 complaint in the case of Williams v. Mc-Nealy, 9 Cir., 239 F.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-24\">As in that case, the Alaska statute, 3 A.C.L.A. \u00a7 55-2-7, limiting the period during which suit can be brought for such a tort to two years, is applicable. Williams here makes the same claim of the tolling of the statute by the provisions of 3 A.C.L.A., 1949, \u00a7 55-2-15, which statute is inapplicable for the reason stated in Williams v. McNealy, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-25\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
