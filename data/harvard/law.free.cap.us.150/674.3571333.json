One gave a short blast from its whistle to indicate an intention to pass on the port side. The other answered by a similar blast, and then gave two whistles and changed its course so as to cross,, the bow of the first vessel. This resulted in a collision, whereby the . second vessel was sunk. An action at law was brought in a state court by the owners of the sunken vessel against the owners of the first., vessel. On the trial the court was asked to instruct the jury that the pilot who first blew the.sharp whistle-had the right to determine the . course which each was to adopt; that the answer by a single whistle .was an acceptance of his determination; that it then became the duty of the second vessel to pass the other according to that determination; \u25a0 and that the second Vessel was guilty of negligence in giving the two whistles and in changing its .course. The court refused these instructions, and instructed the jury, in substance, that they were to-determine' whether those in management of the vessels were guilty of negligence or not, and whether they did or omitted to do that which persons of ordinary- care and prudence ought to have done. <em>Held,</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b695-5\">(1) That in refusing to give the instructions 'asked for and in charging in this general way, the obligatory force of the rules of navigation was substantially ignored;</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b695-7\">(2) That the instruction did not put to the jury the question whether the second vessel was justified in departing from the rules, which was error j</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b695-9\">(3) That th^\\ jury should have been told that two vessels approaching-head .tip head and exchanging the signal of a single whistle, were bound to pursue the course prescribed by the rules;-</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b695-11\">(4) And that they should have been further instructed that if the first vessel assented to the signal of the two whistles, and there was an error in the course, it'was at the risk of .the second vessel, or, at the most, both were in fault and there could be no recovery.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b695-13\">This was an action at law brought by- William Donahue, .owner of the steamboat Charlotte Yanderbilt, in the Supreme Court of the. .State of New' York, against William Belden, .owner of the yacbt Yoserriite, for so negligently navigating the yacht as to\" run down and sink the-steaniboat in the Hudson River a little north of Esopus Meadow light-house, and .some ninety'miles nor,tb of New York City, at or about half-past nine on' the. evening of- July 14, 1882..

exchanged, the Yanderbilt blew two whistles and followed up this signal by such a .change in her course as brought her head rapidly to the eastward until she was in a position almost directly across

or the westward when the Yanderbilt gave two whistles, announcing her own intention of going to the left or to the eastward. The Yosemite claimed negligence on the part of the Yanderbilt in that when the latter was below the upper ice-house at Big Bock Point and both vessels were showing their red lights to each other, the Yanderbilt changed her course to the eastward and headed for Dinsmore\u2019s house, thus throwing herself across the path of the Yosemite; in that, when the two'vessels exchanged signals of a single whistle, the Yanderbilt did not comply with the signal thus given, arid go to the right, but continued her course to-the left; in that the Yanderbilt, having the Yosemite on her starboard side, failed to keep out of the latter\u2019s way; in that, if the Yanderbilt was in doubt, she did not comply with, the applicable rule by giving \u00e1larm whistles and slacking up her speed; in that the Yanderbilt, after complying with the signal whistle, changed her mind, blew two whistles, and took a sudden sheer to the left or eastward. It was admitted that the Yosemite did not have range lights, and in this-particular the Court of Appeals held that she failed to comply with the law. It was insisted on behalf of-the Yosemite that her sidelights were not dim, and that she could, not go to the left when the two whistles of the Yanderbilt were heard because it was impossible for her to change her course at that moment in time to avoid the collision, and that the Yanderbilt had no right to blow the two whistles and go to the left after the interchange of signal whistles \\i-hich determined that each should go to the right. There was evidence on behalf of the Yanderbilt tending to show that after she gave two whistles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the Yosemite replied with two whistles; but on behalf of the Yosemite the evidence tended to show .that she did not reply with two whistles, but began to give three whistles, and the collision occurred before she could do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-5\">The enrolment of the Yanderbilt was issued at the port of Albany, September 25, 1880, in conformity to Title Fifty of \u2019 the Revised Statutes, entitled \u201cRegulations of Yessels in Domestic Commerce,\u201d and stated, among other things, that she was built in 1857, was two hundred and seven feet long, and measured five hundred and eighty-five and seventy-four hundredths tons.

Por an answer to this question the court is- referred to' section 4235 of the Revised Statutes that <em>\u201c </em>until further provision is mad\u00e9 by Congress, all pilots in the bays, inlets* rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States shall continue to be regulated in conformity with the existing laws of the States respectively wherein such pilots may be, or with such laws as the States may respectively enact for the purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b708-8\">Thus we see that this judgment rests on the construction of the state statute of New York, and consequently this court has no jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b708-9\">II. It was gross negligence in the yacht when in the second situation \u2014 running on a parallel line with the steamboat \u2014 to have given one whistle. She should have given two whistles: that Would have required each vessel to have continued on her course. If the yacht wanted to cross the bow of the steamboat, she should have given a single whistle and procured the assent of the steamboat, in time to have enabled the vessels to pass in safety on a crossing course \u2014 which she did not do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b708-10\">In all cases the signals by whistle first given, must be given in time to allow the other vessel to comply with and to pass as desired. If not so given in time, the vessel to which it is given is not bound by. it although it may have accepted by an answering whistle. <em>The Voorwarts </em>v. <em>Khedive, </em>5 App. Cas. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>876, 905 ; <em>The Wenona, </em>19 Wall. 41, 42; <em>The </em>Dexter, 23 Wall. 69; <em>The </em>Milwaukee, Brown\u2019s Adm. 313; <em>The Aurania and The Republic, </em>29 Fed.

S. 72.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b709-5\">The yacht immediately on giving her single whistle changed her course to a crossing course in front of the bow of the steamer, without waiting for and obtaining an answer ;this she had no right to' do. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway </em>v. <em>The Panama, </em>46 Fed. Rep. 496; <em>The Hudson, </em>14 Fed. Rep. 489 ; <em>The Britannia, </em>34 Fed. Rep. 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b709-6\">If the single whistle which was answered as well as the two whistles which were answered were all given too late, then the yacht is in fault for having given the first whistle too late to initiate the manoeuvre. The proposition made by the single whistle was a guarantee to the vessel to which it was given that it could be complied with in time. The answer to the first whistle was only an assent to be taken at the risk of the yacht, and if it could not be complied with, the responsibility remained with the yacht.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b709-7\">The steamboat is also free from blame under another rule that where one party suddenly puts another in jeopardy, <em>in ex-tremis, </em>if the party so put in jeopardy uses his best judgment to avoid the collision, it is free from blame. <em>The Bywell Castle, </em>4. P. D. 219; <em>The Beryl, </em>9 P. D. 137; <em>McLaren </em>v. <em>Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise, &amp;c., </em>9 App. Cas. 640; <em>The Blue Jacket, </em>144 U. S. 371; <em>The Nacoochee, </em>137 U. S. 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b709-8\">In any event, after the single whistle was given and answered it was competent for the parties to agree upon passing the other way by giving two whistles, these being answered. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Eastern Transportation Co., </em>75 N. Y. 116; (dismissed for want of jurisdiction, 99 U. S. 78); <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>New Jersey Steamboat Co., </em>59 N.

Stat. \u00a7 4233, and Inspectors\u2019 Rule 3, each require, wThen the vessels have approached so near that danger-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of a collision is apprehended, that each vessel shall slow, stop, and back if necessary to avoid a collision; and Inspectors\u2019 rule 3 lias it, that if the vessels shall have approached within a half a mile of each other, without having come to an agreement by whistles, or have failed to understand the intention of each other, they must slow, stop, back, etc. <em>The City of New </em>York, <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b710-4\">III. The steamboat was not guilty of contributory negligence. The yacht gave a single whistle which was heard on the steamboat; and at that instant of time changed her course to cross the bow of the steamboat; and from that time to the time of the collision, was not more than probably one-half a minute. Therefore the assumption that they were approaching each other on oblique courses must be limited to the' time subsequent to the time the yacht gave the single whistle which was heard on the steamboat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b710-5\">The. Inspectors\u2019 rules provide for signals to be given in each of the seven situations: When the signal is given which initiates the intended movement, that this movement shall be continued until it has been finally agreed upon and shall all be completed before either vessel undertakes to make the change. If the vessels were Approaching on oblique courses, to make this rule apply they must have been running on these courses before the initial movement was made; if not, then the moment the initial movement was made produced another situation and required other signals to be given in that situation, and so you will- go all around the circle of the seven . situations without arriving at a completion of signals required by the rules to be given under such circumstances.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b710-6\">IIk.

It is of vital importance that these rules should be interpreted and enforced by. the state courts in the same sens\u00f3 that they are in the courts of the United States. This action was for a maritime tort committed upon navigable waters and within the admiralty jurisdiction, and the appellate jurisdiction of this court over questions national-and international in their nature .cannot be restrained by the mere fact that the party plaintiff has elected to pursue' his common law remedy in a state court. \u2022 \u25a0 - \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The doctrine in admiralty of an equal division of damages in the case of a collision between two vessels when both are in fault contributing to the collision, h\u00e1s long prevailed in England and this country. <em>The Max </em>Morris, 137 U.

But at common law the general rule is that if both vessels are culpable in respect of faults operating directly and immediately to produce the collision, neither can recover damages. for injuries so caused. <em>Atlee </em>v. <em>Packet Co., </em>21 Wall. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In order to maintain his action, the plaintiff was obliged to establish the negligence of the defendant, and that' such negligence was the sole cause of the injury, or, in other words, he could not recover, though defendant were negligent, if it-appeared that his own negligence directly contributed to the result complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">(1) The particular fault imputed to the Yosemite was that she did not carry the range lights prescribed by Buie seven of the Buies of Navigation enacted by section 4233 of the Bevised \u2022Statutes, and, this fact being admitted, it was ruled,-as matter of law. that she was therefore guilty of negligence. The correctness of this ruling depends on whether, upon the true construction and application of those rules, the Yosemite Came within Buie seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Under Buie two, the lights prescribed by the rules, and no others, are required to be carried in all weathers, between sunset and sunrise.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>By Buie three, \u201call ocean-going steamers, and steamers carrying sail, shall, when under way, carry,\u201d at the foremast head, a bright white light; on the starboard side, a green light; on the port side, a red light; all as described.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">By Bale four \u201c steam-vessels, when towing other vessels, shall carry two bright -white masthead lights vertically, in \u2022addition to their side lights,\u201d of the same character and construction as the masthead lights prescribed by Buie three.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Buie five provided: \u201cAll steam-vessels, other than oceangoing steamers and steamers carrying sail, shall, when under way, carry on the starboard and port sides lights of the same character and construction, and in the same position as are prescribed for side lights by Buie three, except in the case provided in Buie six.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Bule sjx related to \u201c river steamers navigating waters flow-' ing into the Gulf of Mexico and .their tributaries,\u201d and provided that they should carry the red and green lights on their starboard and port smoke pipes instead of on their sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">By Buie eight, sail-vessels, when under way, or being towed, must carry the same lights as steam-vessels under way, but not the white-masthead lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">By Buie nine, vessels too small to have the green and red lights fixed upon their starboard and port sides shall have them ready \u201c for instant exhibition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Buie seven read: \u201c All coasting steam-vessels, and steam-vessels other than ferry-boats, and vessels otherwise expressly provided for, navigating the bays, lakes, rivers, or other inland waters of the United States, except those mentioned in Buie six, shall carry the red and green lights as prescribed for oceangoing steamers; and in addition thereto a central range of two white lights; the after light being carried at an elevation of at least fifteen feet above the light at the head of the vessel.' The headlight shall.be so constructed as to show a good light through twenty points of the compass, namely: from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on either side of the vessel; and the after light so as to show all around the horizon. The lights for ferry-boats shall be regulated by such rules as the board of supervising inspectors of steam-vessels shall prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The manifest object of this rule was the requisition of the range lights; but, out of abundant caution, and notwithstanding the provisions of-Rule five, the mandate as to the red and green lights is repeated, and the range lights declared to be \u201c in addition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The importance attributed to the red and green lights is apparent throughout these rules and in the rules and regulations of the board of supervising inspectors. After diagrams are given in illustration of the working of the system of such lights, it is there said that by reference to them \u201cit will appear evident that in any situation in which two vessels may approach each other in the dark, the colored lights will instantly indicate to both the relative course of each; that is, each will know whether the other is approaching directly or crossing the bowrs, either to starboard or port. This intimation, with the signals by whistle, as provided, is all that is required to enable vessels to pass each other in the darkest night with almost equal safety as in broad day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Rule seven applied to coasting steam-vessels, and steam-vessels, other than ferry-boats and other than vessels otherwise expressly provided for, navigating inland -waters, and excepting the river steamers mentioned in Rule six.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Steam-vessels not otherwise expressly provided for were those not expressly provided for in the matter of lights other than the red and green lights. Ocean-going steamers \u2022 and steamers carrying sail and steam-vessels when towing other vessels were thus otherwise expressly provided, for in Rules three and four. Rule five related- wholly to the red and green lights, and did not expressly provide for other lights. Mississippi steamers were expressly excepted from the operation of Rule five, because, although they also carried red and green lights, these lights occupied a different position than in the-instance of other steam-vessels; and Mississippi steamers were also expressly excepted from the operation of Rule seven, because under these rules they were to carry only red and green lights, and were, therefore, not otherwise expressly provided for-in respect of lights other than the red and green lights. The rules were accurately- drawn, and should n\u00f3t be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>deprived of their obvious application by refined construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">To repeat: Ferry-boat lights were to be regulated.by the board of supervising inspectors; all steam-vessels were to carry red and green lights, but differently placed on river steamers navigating the waters flowing into the Gulf of Mexico; coasting steam-vessels and steam-vessels engaged in inland navigation were governed by Eule seven ; and vessels otherwise expressly provided for by the provisions thus made. And it was expressly provided that, in addition to .the green and red lights, steam-vessels when towing other vessels should carry two bright white masthead lights vertically,'and ocean-going steamers and steamers carrying sail should carry, when under way, at the foremast head, a bright white light, and no others.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">It may be added that range lights were originally required by the statute of New York of 18-26. Laws N. Y. 1826, c. 222, p. 253. Side-lights were not then provided for, and there were practically no ocean-going steamers.. When colored lights were introduced' and changed conditions obtained, new rules became necessary and were adopted. -</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">As to ocean-going steamers and steamers carrying sail, the bright white light required, at' the foremast head was to be \u201c so constructed as to show a uniform and unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of twenty points of the compass,\u201d while as to coasting steamers, of the centra! range of two white' lights prescribed, the after light was to be \u201c at least fifteen feet above the light at the head of the vessel,\u201d and \u00a3\u00a3 to show all around the horizon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The argument that by reason of the difference between the two classes, the lights required as to one class would be im- - \u2022practicable in respect of the other, is not without force, and indeed, on April 9,1887, the Secretary of the Treasury approved the conclusion of the Supervising Inspector-General, that ,\u00a3\u00a3 the central range lights provided in Eule seven, Section-4333, Eevised Statutes, are never to be used on ocean steamers, as the.white light aft required by that rule would be obscured by the masts, yards, and- rigging of such a steamer, and therefore useless.\u201d ' Treas.

These terms were merely descriptive of her characteristics, and not of her situation. She was \u201cunder way,\u201d which words, in Rule three, would be superfluous if she must be traversing the ocean in order to be \u201c ocean-going,\u201d and have her sails set in order to be \u201ccarrying sail;\u201d and she was \u201cunder steam\u201d and therefore not governed by the rules applicable to a steamer solely \u201cunder sail,\u201d by Rule one, a rule demonstrating that \u201cunder sail\u201d and.\u201ccarrying sail\u201d were not used as synonymous terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In our judgment, the lights she was required to carry were expressly provided for in Rule three, and these lights she had.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The decision of the Court of Appeals that the Yosemite was bound to carry \u201ca central range of two white lights,\u201d as prescribed in Rule seven, was based upon the ground that she was \u201cin legal character and by nomenclature \u2018a coasting steam-v\u00e9ssel; \u2019 \u201d and that, even if this might \u201c not be absolutely true of the Yosemite in all situati\u00f3ns, it was nevertheless true of her when navigating inland waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">By the first section of the act of Congress of August 7,1848, 9 Stat. 274, c. 141, the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to cause yachts used and employed exclusively as vessels of pleasure, to be enrolled and licensed as vessels which were not required to qualify at the custom house; and this act was ' amended by that of June 29, 1870, 16 Stat. 170, c. 170, by inserting after the words \u201cport to port of the United States\u201d the words \u201c and by sea to foreign ports,\u201d and as thus amended was carried forward into section 4214 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The Court of Appeals was of opinion that yachts licensed under the statute of 1848 were exclusively coasting vessels, and that, as by the act of 1870, the}7 might be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>proceed by sea to foreign ports, they thus might have a double character, that is, of coasting vessels and vessels entitled to go upon the. seas to foreign ports. Reference was made to the fact that the Yosemite was enrolled at the port of New York ' in conformity to Title Fifty of the Revised Statutes, entitled \u201cRegulation of Vessels in Domestic Commerce,\u201d and was also licensed in pursuance of chapter two, Title Forty-eight, entitled \u201cRegulations of Commerce and Navigation.\u201d And it was said that Title Fifty related exclusively to coasting and fishing vessels, while Title Forty-nine was entitled \u201cRegulations of Vessels in Foreign Commerce.\u201d The conclusion was then announced that the Yosemite, being enrolled under the statute relating to coasting vessels, and her license being a coasting license, with the added privilege of being allowed to proceed to'foreign ports, it did not seem to allow, of reasonable doubt \u2022that the Yosemite while navigating the Hudson River was navigating under her license in the character of a coasting vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"><em>We </em>are unable to accept this conclusion. While Title Fifty is entitled by way of convenience \u201cRegulation of Vessels in Domestic Commerce,\u201d there are many provisions contained under that title relating to vessels engaged in foreign commerce, and among them sections 4322 and 4323; which enable the owner of a coasting vessel to surrender his enrolment and register his vessel, or to surrender his register and take out an enrolment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The register declares the nationality of a vessel engaged in foreign trad\u00e9, the enrolment, the national character of a vessel engaged in the home traffic and enables her to procure a coasting license. By section 4318, under the same title, vessels navigating the waters of the northern, northeastern, and northwestern frontiers, otherwise than by sea, may be enrolled and licensed in such form as other v\u00e9ssels, and need not take out a certificate of registry. <em>The Mohawk, </em>3 Wall. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Ordinarily the terms \u201ccoaster\u201d and \u201ccoasting vessel\u201d are ' applied to vessels plying exclusively between domestic ports, and usually to those engaged in domestic trade as distinguished from vessels engaged in the foreign trade or plying between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>port of the United States and a port of a foreign country. <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>9 Wheat. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The- mere fact that an ocean-going steamer may touch at some other port of the United States, after leaving her port of departure, would not make- her a coaster, and this is recognized by section 4337, which is another of the sections included' in Title Fifty worthy of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Pleasure-yachts, designed as modeU of naval architecture, are not coasters in any statutory seise, for they are not allowed to transport merchandise or carry passengers for pay, and we do not think it reasonable to construe the words of the statute applicable to coasters as applicable' to them in view of their character and the .legislation upon the subject taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">As we have remarked, vessels engaged in domestic commerce may be transferred to the class of vessels authorized to sail to foreign ports by a change from an enrolment to a register ; but, in the Case of yachts, the statute provides that when entitled to be enrolled as American vessels, they may be authorized to proceed from port to port of the United States, and also by sea to foreign ports, so that, by a simple license, being mere pleasure-boats, not authorized to transact business, they may sail to either, but their essential character as oceangoing steamers, if they are such, remains the same, whether they are actually, navigating from port to port of this country or to ports abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The Yosemite was enrolled in 1881, and in May, 1882, took out the license which authorized her to proceed by sea to foreign ports and also from port to port in the United States. The privilege of doing both was granted, and her license np more authorized her to proceed to domestic ports, with the added privilege of going to foreign ports, than to proceed to foreign ports with the added . privilege of navigating between domestic ports. She could do both, and to enable yachts to do so was the design and express language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">We have not deemed it necessary to discuss the supposed bearing of the act of February 28, 1871, 16 Stat. 440, 454, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>100, referred to by defendant in error, or the acts of 1861, 13 Stat. 58, c. 69, and of 1866,' 11 Stat. 227, e. 231, as substantially the same question- would arise under those acts, and the obscurity, if any, is not in the revised law.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Nor have we felt called-upon to refer to the acts of March 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 138, c. 354, or that of August 19, 1890, 20 Stat. 320, c. 802, as this collision occurred in 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\"We hold that Nule seven was not applicable to the Yosemite, and that therefore the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court, .which approved the instruction of the learned trial judge, (to which exception Ayas duly saved,) that \u201cthe Yos\u00e9mite, upon that occasion, Avas bound to have those, lights which I have described to you as central range lights, and the absence of those statutory signals Avas, upon her part, negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">(2) In addition to the rules for preventing collisions, prescribed by section-1233, it was provided by section 1112 that \u201c the board of \u2022 supervising inspectors shall establish such regulations to be observed by all steam-vessels. in passing each other, as they shall from time to time d\u00e9em necessary for safety.\u201d The rules laid down by the latter as thus authorized have the force of statutory enactment, and their construction, (when put in evidence as they were in this case,) as Avell as that of the rules under section 1233, is for the court, whose duty it is to apply them as matter of law upon the , facts of a given case. They are not mere prudential regulations, but binding enactments, obligatory from the time that the necessity for precaution begins, and continuing so long' as the means and opportunity .to avoid the danger remains. <em>The </em>Dexter, 23 Wall. 69. Obviously they must be rigorously enforced in order to attain t.he object for Avhich they were framed, which could not be secured if the masters of ATessels were permitted to indulge their discretion in respect of obeying or departing from- them. Nevertheless it is true that there may be extreme cases where departure from their requirements is rendered necessary to avoid impending peril, but only to the extent-that such danger demands. <em>The John L.

Indeed, in <em>The Agra, </em>it was ruled that not only must it be shown that the departure at the time it took place was necessary in order to avoid immediate danger, but also that the course adopted was reasonably calculated to avoid that danger. And it is the settled rule in this court that when a vessel has committed a positive breach of statute, she must show not only that probably her fault did not contribute to the disaster, but that it could not have done so. <em>The Pennsylvania, </em>19 Wall. 125, <em>136; Richelieu Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Ins.

Masters are bound to obey the rules and entitled to rely on the assumption that they will be obeyed, and should not be encouraged to treat the exceptions as subjects of solicitude rather than the rules. <em>The Oregon, </em>18 How. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">By Buie nineteen, \u201c if two vessels under steam are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">By the eighteenth, if two vessels under steam are meeting end on or nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, the helms of both must be put to port so that each may pass on the port side of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">This is repeated in Bule 1 of the inspectors\u2019 rules, and it is provided not only that when steamers are thus approaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>each other, it shall be the duty of each to pass to the right, or port side of the other, but that the pilot of either may be first \u25a0 in determining to pursue this course, and thereupon shall give as a signal of his intention one short and distinct blast .of his whistle, which the pilot of the other vessel shaft answer by a similar blast, and thereupon said steamers shall pass to the {port side of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">By Eule 2, when steamers are approaching each other in an oblique direction, (as shown in fourth situation,) they shall pass to the right of each other as if meeting \u201c head and head,\u201d or nearly so, and the signals by whistles shall be given and answered promptly as in that case specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">By Eule 3, if, when steamers are approaching each other, the .pilot of either vessel fails to understand the course or intention of the other, whether from signals being given or answered erroneously, or fi\u2019om other causes, the pilot, if in doubt, shall immed iately signify the same by giving several short and rapid blasts of the steam whistle, -and if the vessels shall have approached within half a mile of each other, both shall be immediately slowed until the proper signals are given, answered, or understood, and until the vessels shall have passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">It seems to us that these rules were strictly applicable, and were disregarded by the Yanderbilt. When the plaintiff rested, the defendant moved to 'dismiss, which was overruled, and it is contended here that on the plaintiff\u2019s own showing the Yanderbilt was palpably guilty of negligence which contributed directly to produce the collision, and hence that that motion should have been sustained; but we do not care to \u2022pass upon that question, and content ourselves with indicating certain errors in the rulings Of the trial court, which appear to us to so essentially deprive the rules of the force which should have been given them as to amount to a decision against rights claimed under the statute of the United States. The speed of the Yosemite was about sixteen miles, and that of the Yanderbi\u00edt nine miles, an hour,- and they Avere approaching each other, therefore, at an aggregate speed of twenty-five miles an hour. The pilot of the Yanderbilt testified that he saw the white light of the Yosemite when he was between the ice-houses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>apparently a mile distant. The steamers were then on parallel courses. He did not see her green light at any time, but saw her red light just before or just after she blew two whistles. 'When he was abreast of the lower ice-house, he thought about a quarter of a mile from the place of collision, he headed her for Dinsmore\u2019s house, \u201c way off to the eastward,\u201d and, believing that the Yosemite was a tow, laid his course more to the eastward. He was thus crossing the course of the Yosemite, which was brought on the starboard. At this point the pilot of the Yosemite gave a short and distinct blast from his whistle as required by law, as a signal of his intention to pass to the port side of the Yanderbilt, and this the pilot of the Yanderbilt answered by' a similar blast; whereupon under the rules it became imperative for the steamers to pass to the port side of each other. The Yanderbilt was bound to go to the right after the bargain was made by the exchange of single whistles; but instead of doing this, and immediately after, the Yanderbilt\u2019s pilot gave two whistles, which it is claimed on behalf of the plaintiff were answered by two whistles from the yacht. This is denied by the latter; and even if true, an assent to the Yanderbilt\u2019s change was at the latter\u2019s risk. The Yanderbilt\u2019s pilot on the instant sheered his boat to port, then slowed, and the collision occurred, the Yanderbilt being struck nearly at riglitangles.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Among other instructions the court was requested by the defendant below to give, were these :</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u201c 8. As the proof is undisputed that the steamboat Yanderbilt and the yacht Yosemite were approaching each other head and head, or nearly so, the law prescribes their duties respectively in regard to blowing their whistles.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\u201c 9. If the yacht Yosemite, as the'vessels were approaching each other, blew a single whistle and the steamboat Yanderbilt answered it by a single whistle, the course which she was thereupon bound to pursue was thereupon determined and each-vessel was bound to pass to its own right, that is, to the port side of each other, which would have been the Yanderbilt to the west and the yacht Yosemite to the east.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201c10. The pilot who first blew the'first whistle thereby had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the right to and did determine the course which each was then to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u201c 11. The blowing of the single whistle by the steamboat Yanderbilt after the first single whistle from, the yacht Yosemite was an acceptance by the steamboat Yanderbilt of the \u2019 election of the course so adopted by the yacht Yosemite, and it then became the duty of the steamboat Yanderbilt to pass to the port or western side of the Yosemite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u201c 14. Even if the Yanderbilt, after having by one whistle accepted the one whistle of the yacht, had a right to change the conditions and course by a blast of two whistles, yet unless these two whistles were given in time to enable the yacht to go in safety to the west of the Yanderbilt, they would tend to complicate the situation, and the Yanderbilt was in that event guilty of negligence in giving the signal of two whistles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYM1\">These instructions were refused and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"A22\">The court instructed the jury on this branch of the case that it was claimed on the part of the defendant that it was negligence for the Yanderbilt to blow the two whistles and to take the rank sheer and cross the bow of the Yosemite, and on the part of the plaintiff that at the time of the two signals being given it was impracticable to carry out the agreement which had been made by the signal which had been given and accepted of the one whistle; that he was compelled to give the two signals, and believed the Yosemite accepted his ' proposition that each should go to the left, while on the part of the defendant it was contended that two whistles were not blown in response,- but that the pilot of the Yosemite started to blow three as a signal of danger and of repudi\u00e1tion of the offer made by the Yanderbilt, but befoi\u2019e he could get them out the collision occurred ; and the court left it to the jury to say whether the pilot of the Yanderbilt in attempting to change his course and to cross the bows of the Yosemite was guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident. Rule 3 was treated by the court in a similar way.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In short, the learned judge instructed the jury that it was for them to determine whether those who were in the management of the respective boats w.ere guilty\u2019- of negligence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>not, and. whether or not they did or omitted to do that which persons of ordinary care and prudence ought to have done; but in charging in this general way, and refusing to give the instructions above named, the obligatory force of the rules of navigation was substantially ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The question whether, upon the proofs, the departure by the Vanderbilt from the rules was justified was not put to the jury, but whether upon the whole there was negligence in what was done or left undone. In this, there was such error as the defendant may avail himself of in this court, so far as saved by his requests to charge.-</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">If these two steamers were approaching each other head and head, or nearly so, or obliquely,-as; mentioned in Rule two, the law-prescribed their duties respectively, and the jury should have been told so; and as there was no doubt that upon the exchange of single whistles the course each was bound to pursue was determined, the instructions to that effect should have been given. And so, if the Yosemite assented to the two whistles and the Vanderbilt\u2019s course, this, if an error, was one at the risk of the Vanderbilt, and at most would be an error in which both concurred, and if both were in fault, there could be no recovery. Of course, the test as to whether the departure from the rules was excusable, if there were clear and satisfactory evidence to that effect, might have been applied through proper instructions or qualifications on that subject, but as the case stood, we think those above quoted should have been-given, and that the refusal to do so, taken with the actual instructions, erroneously disposed of a Federal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\n<em>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b723-8\">Mr. Justice.Brown</author>\n<p id=\"Aru\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\"While I fully concur, in the opinion of1 the court that this case should be reversed upon the ground of the contributory negligence of the Vanderbilt, I think the Yosemite was guilty of a breach of the regulations in failing to cany the range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>lights provided by Rule seven, although it may be open to doubt whether such failure contributed to the collision, in view of the gross fault on the part of the Yanderbilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Rule seven, upon the construction \u00a9f which the question turns, requires \u201call coasting steam-vessels and steam-vessels other than ferry-boats and vessels otherwise expressly provided for, navigating the . . inland waters of, the United States,\u201d to carry range lights. Were the Yosemite an ordinary coasting vessel, there could be no doubt of her obligation to be provided with these lights'when-navigating inland waters. She was, however, licensed under Rev. Sfcat. sec. 4214 \u00e1s a yacht \u201cused and employed exclusively as a pleasure-vessel, and designed as a model of naval architecture,\u201d on terms which authorized her \u201c to proceed from port to port of the United States, and by sea to foreign ports, without entering or clearing at the custom house.\u201d She was enrolled under Rev. Stat. Title 50, which relates exclusively to coasting and fish-. ing vessels. To put upon this statute (sec. 4214) the construction most favorable to her, it seems to me that she was invested with a double character: first, as an ocean-going steamer; and second, as a coasting vessel; and that, when navigating the inland waters of the country, she was bound to conform to the usages of those waters, and to carry the lights provided by law for \u201csteam-vessels other1- than ferryboats and vessels otherwise expressly provided for.\u201d Even admitting that ocean vessels when navigating inland waters are; not. bound to carry these range lights, because it.is not contemplated that they shall navigate these waters, I am clearly of the opinion that yachts, \u2022which ply chiefly between ports and places within the United States and upon the inland waters of the country, should carry them. It seems to me an exceedingly dangerous practice, and one which, according to the theory of the Yanderbilt, had much to do with the collision in this case, to permit vessels not carrying ' the lights appropriate to inland navigation to navigate the narrow waters of the.country. Yessels navigating those waters are entitled to expect that other vessels which they ifieet are required to carry the same lights which they carry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and any distinction in that particular in favor of yachts is' liable to create uncertainty and confusion with regard to the character of the approaching vessel. While upon the ocean, I have no doubt her obligations would be discharged by carrying the white and colored lights provided by Rule three for ocean-going steamers, but while, plying upon the Hudson River, I think she was navigating under her license as a coast- ' ing vessel, and should have carried the range lights required in inland navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">If the case required it, I would even go further and say, as did the dissenting judge when this case was heard before the general term, (34 Hun, 571, 577,) that ocean-going steamers 'when navigating the inland waters of the country, and not under sail, should carry the range lights provided by Rule seven. If this be not obligatory, I find it difficult to understand to what the words \u201c steam-vessels other than ferry-boats and vessels otherwise expressly provided for \u201d apply. \u2019 There is an exception of ferry-boats which is easy to understand. There is, also, an exception of \u201c vessels otherwise expressly provided .for,\u201d which, in the opinion of the court, applies to ocean-going steamers, which are provided for by Rule three; but in my opinion these words should be construed as if reading \u201c steam-vessels other than ferry-boats and vessels otherwise expressly provided for <em>in respect to i/nlanct </em>navigation.\u201d After expressly excepting ferry-boats, which are of a limited class, it seems to me a violation of the jmle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>that, under the words <em>\u201c </em>vessels otherwise expressly provided for \u201d should be exempted the very large class of ocean-going steamers, and, as observed by the dissenting judge of the general term, these words are perhaps used as words of caution, either as to present or future possible provisions. I have no doubt that ocean-going steamers are not obliged to carry range lights when ascending the waters of- a river as far as their customary wharves near the mouth of such river; but if such steamers were in the habit of ascending the Hudson River as far as' Albany, or the Mississippi as, far as St. Louis, it would be exceedingly dangerous to permit them to navigate without the customary <em>range </em>lights provided for those waters. But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>as before observed, it is unnecessary to place the liability of the Yosemite upon this broad ground.</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-5\">Mr. Justice Field and Mr. Justice Cray did not hear the argument, and took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
