W. Bound </em>v. <em>The South Carolina Railway Company and </em>others, Daniel H. Chamberlain was appointed receiver of the railway company; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and al'1 of its property was placed under his care and management and protected by injunction. In the operation of - the railroad as a common carrier, there was delivered to the receiver April 12, 1893, a barrel of liquor shipped by citizens of North Carolina from Statesville in that State, and consigned .to their agents in Charleston, South Carolina. By reason of some confusion arising over the bill of lading, or from the markings on the barrel, there was difficulty in discovering the consignees, and the barrel was stored in the warehouse of the railroad company awaiting the result of an \u2022 investigation in that particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-4\">An act of the'general assembly of South Carolina, commonly called the Dispensary Daw, and entitled \u201cAn act to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, within this State, except as herein provided,\u201d was approved December 24, 1892, and by-its terms was to go into full operation July 1, 1893. Acts South Carolina, 1892, No. 28, p. 62.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-5\">On the first of August, 1893, while the matter of the ascertainment of the consignee was being investigated and the barrel .was in the warehouse of the receiver, freight unpaid, -one C_B. Swan entered the warehouse, seized.the barrel, took it out of the custody of. the receiver, and deposited it in the jail of Charleston County, in the care of the sheriff. Swan showed no authority either from the consignee or the consignor of the goods, and produced no warrant by virtue of which the seizure was made. \"When questioned by the receiver, the sole authority referred to by him was his commission as a constable of the State. His suspicions had been excited respecting this barrel, it having been, presumably from necessity, removed from one part of the floor of the warehouse to another, and he acted on his suspicions. It was admitted that he took the course he did of his' own motion without instructions from-any one in the legal department-of the State, and probably without instructions from any other person. After the seizure the goods remained in the place where deposited by Swan without any proceeding or application whatever until on August J, 1893, the receiver filed his petition in the Circuit' Court in the case in which he was appointed, -setting forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>facts and praying that Swan be attached and punished for contempt of court in seizing the goods without warrant, and that he- be compelled to restore them to the receiver\u2019s custody for delivery to the consignee. A rule to show cause was accordingly entered, to which Swan made answer, disclaiming any purpose to commit contempt of court, but justifying the seizure under the Dispensary Act, and making no offer to restore the goods. The court after full hearing ordered that the rule be made absolute, and committed him to the custody of the marshal to be imprisoned in the jail of Charleston County until he returned, \u201cto the custody of the receiver, the barrel taken by him from the warehouse without warrant of law. And when that has been surrendered that he suffer a further imprisonment thereafter in said county jail for three months and until he pay the costs of these proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-5\">In its opinion, the court, (Simonton, J.,) after stating the, facts, said: \u201cWere this a simple case of interference with property in the hands and custody of this court, without notice to it, and without action on its part, its settlement would be easy. Were it even based upon a charge of violation of the law on the part of the receiver, and sustained by a mandate issuing from any proper authority, the court would not be slow to believe that the manner of the execution of the mandate arose from inadvertence, and would lend its aid to an investigation of the charge, and a due execution of the law. As a'common can\u2019ier, the receiver is bound to respect .and obey the laws of the State. He and the court from whom he holds his appointment are servants of the law, exceptionably bound to pay it the. utmost deference and respect. But the real issue in this case is vastly more important than an interference with property in the hands of the court. It is far reaching in its consequences, and concerns, not only the receiver, but every other citizen. Has any constable the right, without warrant, to search premises, and to seize property, when he suspects that a violation of the law is intended ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-6\">The various sections of the Dispensary Act were then considered and the result reached that a constable had no authority to so search and seize under the terms of the act, on general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>principles, or under the constitution' of South Carolina, and it was said in conclusion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-5\">\u201c In the case now before us there is not even the excuse for haste. The goods were stored and kept in a warehouse, not at a place for sale. No concealment whatever was practised. In his answer the respondent says that for several days he saw the package, and watched it. Any notification to this court would have absolutely secured him from any removal of it. Within his reach, at any hour of the day, he could have gone before any justice or judge, and could have obtained, or at least could have sought, a warrant. The process of law was within his reach. Even when he searched and seized the package, he openly disregarded the law. For eight days he remained inactive, taking no steps whatever to justify, support, or legalize his action. It does not appear even that he reported it to any one. His contempt of private rights went far beyond his disregard of the existence and authority of this court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-6\">Swan, having been committed, presented his petition for the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and a rule having been entered thereon, and a return having been duly made thereto, the application was heard by this court upon the petition and return, and the accompanying exhibits, which included the opinion, now reported in 57 Fed.

The Circuit Judge had no jurisdiction of the matter involved in the proceedings for contempt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-4\">. The petitioner was attached for contempt while discharging his duty as-an officer of the State, in the execution of a valid police law, and in doing so he was not violating the Constitution or laws of the United States, nor any order, process, or decree of any court or judge thereof. The Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the matter. Eev. Stat. \u00a7 753,- and cases noted; Could &amp; Tucker\u2019s Notes to \u00a7 753, p. 219.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-5\">II. That judge exceeded his authority in attaching the petitioner for contempt. The Dispensary Law is a valid police law. It is to be observed that the Circuit Judge bases his judgment solely upon the ground- that the petitioner, as state constable, had no right to seize the liquor without a warrant, as such seizure was forbidden by the constitution of the State; and only for that reason holds that such seizure was an improper interference with the receiver. It will also be seen that he concedes that the receiver \u201cas a common carrier is bound to respect and obey the laws of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQa\">The validity of the Dispensary Law, both in its general and particular provisions, will be shown by the following considerations:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-6\">(a) The legislature of the State is that department of the government in which the sovereign police power of the people is exclusively lodged, and it is restrained in the exercise of such power only by the provisions of the state constitution, which expressly, or by necessary implication, limit it, and cannot be restrained by Federal law. <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. Pendleton, 122 U. S. 347, 359; <em>New Orleans Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Louisiana Light </em>Co., 115 U. S. 650, 661; <em>Barbier </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>113 U. S. 27; <em>City of New York v. Miln, </em>11 Pet. 102, 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-7\"><em>In Crowley </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>137 U. S. 86, 91, it is said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-8\">\u201cIt\u201d (sale of liquor) \u201cis a question of public expediency and public morality, and not of Federal law. The police power of the State is fully competent to regulate the business \u2014 to mitigate its evils or to suppress it entirely. . . . The manner and extent of regulation rest in the discretion of the governing authority. That authority may vest in such officers as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>it may deem proper the power of passing upon applications for permission to'carry it on and to issue licenses for that purpose. It is a matter of legislative will only. As in many other cases, the officers may not always exercise the power, conferred upon them with wisdom or justice to the parties affected. But that is a matter which does not affect the authority of the State: nor' is it one which can be brought under the cognizance of the courts of the United States.\u201d See also <em>Trageser </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>73 Maryland, 250, 260 ; <em>Giozza </em>v. <em>Tiernan, </em>148 U. S. 657; <em>The License Cases, </em>5 How. 504, 631, 632; <em>Mugler </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>123 U. S. 623, 660; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>25 Connecticut, 290, 297.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-4\"><em>(i) </em>The provisions of the Federal and state.constitutions which limit legislative power are only intended to protect the individual citizen against any infringement upon his private rights by the public, and only apply when there is such infringement. In regard to the traffic in intoxicating liquors, no citizen has the inherent right to sell them. <em>Giozza </em>v. <em>Tiernan, </em>148 U. S. 657; <em>Bartemeyer </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>18 Wall. 129 ; <em>Mugler v</em>. <em>Kansas, </em>123 U. S. 623 ; <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>137 U. S. 86, 91.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-5\"><em>(c) </em>It follows, therefore, as a general conclusion from the two foregoing propositions, that the constitutional provisions, 'which are the bulwarks of private rights against public power, do not. apply in the matter of the police regulation of the liquor traffic by the State, and the legislature is wholly unlimited in the exercise of its power, save by its discretion as to the extent and manner thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-6\"><em>(d) </em>In the light of. this general conclusion of law it may be assumed that the Dispensary Law is a valid police law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-7\">Ill: It is not necessary to cite any authority to show that the trade in intoxicating liquors is a matter fully within the police power of the State, and that there is a necessity for the exercise of such power .in regard thereto. The validity of this Dispensary Law, both in its general purpose and scope and in its particular provisions, is shown by the authority already cited. The only general objection urged against it is, that it creates a monopoly. This is not a sound objection. As has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>been shown, no citizen of this country has a right to sell intoxicating liquors, and hence the people have no common right to engage in that trade as a business. When the legislature, in the exercise of the police power, sees fit to commit the control of that trade to the State, under such regulations as its discretion suggests, it does not deprive any citizen of his rightful business and does not create a monopoly in the proper and objectionable sense of that word.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-4\">Besides, as the prohibition or regulation of such trade rests entirely within the police power of the- legislature, it may make the license to sell intoxicating liquors exclusive in the State or in any corporation or citizen when deemed necessary. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Brennan's </em>Liquors, 25 Connecticut, 278.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-5\">This doctrine of monopoly by the State of the trade in intoxicating liquors is sustained in principle by the <em>SlaughterHouse </em>Cases, 16 Wall. 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-6\">IV. It is also urged that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated by some of the provisions in the Dispensary Law. But the Dispensary Law being a police law, the Fourteenth Amendment cannot, impair its provisions. Besides, there is no discrimination which makes the clause class legislation. <em>Barbier </em>v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 27, 32; <em>Trageser </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>73 Maryland, 250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-7\">V. It is further contended: (1) .that the statute does not authorize-a seizure without warrant, and (2), that if it be construed to give such authority, it violates the provisions of the constitution respecting unreasonable searches and seizures. \u2022This provision of the constitution of South Carolina is substantially the same as the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and of .Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont, in regard to searches and seizures. In the statutes of each of those States, as to intoxicating liquors, there is. an express provision allowing the proper officer to seize the liquor intended, for unlawful sale and to arrest the keeper of it \u201c wfithout warrant,\u201d and then to proceed formally in the matter, to its adjudication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-8\">These provisions of statutes of Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont as. to arrest and seizure \u201cwfithout a warrant\u201d have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>been construed and sustained by the highest courts in those states. <em>Jones v. Root, </em>6 Gray, 435; <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>58 Vermont, 140; <em>In re Powers, </em>25 Vermont, 261; <em>The State </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>59 Maine, 383; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>79 Maine, 104.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-5\">YI. The position taken by respondent\u2019s counsel, that the liquors in question could not be seized by the petitioner, because it was in the custody of the law, is untenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-6\">\u25a0 It is admitted that all the property of the South Carolina-[Railway Company, when it passed into the hands of the receiver, went into the custody of the law, and that the receiver could not be arrested for obeying the order of the court in reference thereto; nor could his possession of the property be interfered with by seizure under execution. But the liquor in question was not in the custody of the law simply because it happened to be in the temporary possession of the receiver. It was no part of the property of the railway company that had been taken into the custody of the law, under and by virtue of the receivership thereof. The receiver had transported it as a common carrier, as the property of Lowenstein Bros., to Charleston, and there held it as their property for delivery to them as the owners. He sustained no other relation to the liquor than that which the railway company itself sustained to it, to wit, that which imposed the duty upon him to deliver it, if not prevented by the law, and allowed him to charge proper freight thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-7\">So the receiver in this case being a commoh carrier, who had performed his duty as such in transporting the liquor, and then held it as the property of another, to be delivered upon payment of proper charges, had no higher rights in regard to the same than any other warehouseman would have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-8\">It follows, therefore, that the liquor not being a part of the property of the railway company in the control of the court, and being the property of another, in temporary charge of the receiver or warehouseman, he cduld not properly hold'it against the seizure by vour petitioner, and the court could not protect him in refusing that obedience to a valid police law incumbent upon every citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>YII. The position taken by the respondent\u2019s attorney, that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 974,' quoted by him, authorizes the punishment for contempt by both imprisonment and payment of the costs, is incorrect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-4\">That section evidently refers to regular prosecutions for crimes, and has no reference to punishment for contempts under rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-5\">It must be concluded either that, if the costs are a fine, they cannot be imposed as joint punishment with imprisonment; or that, if not considered a fine, they are added as a part of the punishment, and are in excess of the limitation of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-6\">In either case, the express limitation upon the power to punish must control.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-7\"><em>Mr. Joseph W.

To sustain the proposition that the court had no jurisdiction to commit, it is argued that the petitioner was in the discharge of his duty as an officer of the State in the execution of a valid police law of the State, authorizing the' search and seizure; that his action was therefore justifiable, and judicial interference with him absolutely precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">\u25a0The validity of the Dispensary Act was elaborately discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>by counsel for petitioner, but we perceive no necessity for entering upon an examination of that question. The Circuit Court was of opinion that the act did not authorize <em>&amp;\u25a0 </em>seizure ' without warrant. It was admitted below that such a seizure could not be made except under the authority of a statute conferring the power to do so, and nothing to the contrary has been adduced on this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Any other view would be inconsistent with settled principles of the common law and with familiar constitutional provisions for the security of person and property and immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures. The original occasion for securing that immunity may have been the abuse of. executive authority in the matter of obtaining evidence of political offences, but these safeguards are not therefore limited in their scope, and extendlprotection against every exertion in that direction of merely arbitrary power. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In some of the States authority to proceed in respect of liquors, without warrant in the first instance, is expressly given by statute, but is accompanied by the provision that when the seizure is so made, the property seized is to be kept in safety for a reasonable time until a warrant can be procured, and it is held that, should the officer neglect to obtain a warrant within such time, he will be liable as a trespasser. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Willey, </em>11 Gray, 368; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>71 Maine, 356. In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Favor, </em>14 Gray, 200, 202, Chief Justice Shaw said : \u201c The authority . to seize liquors without a warrant, though sometimes necessary, is a high power; and, being in derogation of common law right, it is to be exercised only where it is clearly authorized by the statute or rule of law which warrants it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In his examination of the Dispensary Act the learned judge , holding the Oircuit Court pointed out that it was to be strictly construed and not to be extended beyond the import of its terms. <em>Northern Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>149 U. S. 157. The act could not be regarded as dealing with intoxicating liquors as if they were a deadly poison whose presence was noxious <em>per se, </em>which might justify an enlarged construction of the language of the statute to the end that so fearful a nui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>sanee might be abated, for their use as a beverage was recognized, and their sale placed in the hands of , public officials. Moreover, it was not admissible to hold by construction that the statute had authorized the seizure of the goods without warrant, in view of section twenty-two of article I. of the constitution of South Carolina, which declared-that \u201c all persons liave a right to be secure from unreasonable searches, or seizure of their persons, houses, papers, or possessions. All warrants shall be supported by oath or affirmation, and the order of the warrant to a civil officer to make search or seizure in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, shall be accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure, and no warrant shall be issued but in the cases and with the formalities prescribed by the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Indeed, the statute upon any reasonable construction did not contemplate action without process. By the twenty-second section, places where intoxicating liquors were sold, bartered, or given away, or where persons were permitted to resort'for the purpose of drinking intoxicating liquors as a beverage, or where intoxicating liquors were kept for sale, barter, or delivery, in violation of the act, were declared to be common nuisances, and if the existence of such nuisance were established, either in a criminal or equitable action, upon the judgment of a court or judge having jurisdiction, finding the place to be a nuisance, it was to be abated and the liquors and accessories taken possession of and confiscated.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Under section twenty-three, such places might be\u2019enjoined and abated by action in the name of the State, careful provision being made that orders for the search and seizure of the goods should only be issued upon an affidavit stating or showing that intoxicating liquors particularly described were'kept for sale, or sold, bartered, or given away on the premises, particularly describing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The twenty-fifth section provided that liquors in transit intended for unlawful sale in the State might be seized and proceeded against as if \u201cunlawfully kept and deposited in any place,\u201d and were therefore not subject to seizure without pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>liminary proceeding or- judicial action, as provided in sections twenty-two and twenty-tliree'in regard to liquors so unlawfully kept and deposited. So far from the argument being well founded that because the provisions of the twenty-second and twenty-third sections were not express^ repeated in the twenty-fifth, it was to be inferred that they were dispensed with, the provision that liquors in transit might be seized and' proceeded against as if \u201c unlawfully kept and.deposited in any place,\u201d made them a part of the section by reference, and it was -in accordance with those sections that such property could be condemned; and that that involved here was turned-over by petitioner to the sheriff of Charleston County. The duties of a constable were under section twenty-four .to' notify the circuit solicitor of the violation of any of the provisions of the-act under section twenty-four, and under section twenty-two, if the existence of the nuisance therein mentioned were established either in a criminal or equitable action, he. might be' directed to abate the place by taking possession thereof. Certainly, seizure by him without warrant or judicial action was' not expressly authorized by the statute nor by implication upon any canon of construction applicable to an act creating offences unknown to the common law and authorizing confiscation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">It is insisted that the Circuit Court was in error in the views it entertained and. the conclusion reached in accordance therewith. But this objection is of error merely, and does not go. to-the power of the court in the premises. Judgments of courts, whether Federal or state, cannot be treated as void and' attacked collaterally on <em>habeas </em>corpus, even if error has actually supervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">It must be remembered that this property was in the custody of the officer of the court; that it had been brought into the State before the act went into operation; that it had not been delivered because of imperfect address; that there was no con-' ce\u00e1lment and no occasion for haste; and that there was no difficulty in the way of application to the court, to have the goods detained or for permission to withdraw them from the receiver\u2019s possession. Nothing can be clearer than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the court had jurisdiction to determine whether the goods were retained in violation of the laws of the State; whether the receiver in conducting the business of the railroad in respect of the transportation of this barrel was proceeding \u201caccording to the valid laws of the State\u201d as provided by the second section of the act of Congress of March 3, 1887, (21 Stat. 552, c. 373,) and whether the seizure was authorized by any law of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The possession of property by the judicial department, whether Federal or state, cannot be arbitrarily encroached upon without violating the fundamental.principle, which requires coordinate departments to refrain from interference with the independence of each other, <em>In re </em>Tyler, Petitioner, 149 U. S. 164, and the position that a petty officer can take property from the possession of a court without permission and without warrant, \u201cupon his own motion and without instructions from any other person,\u201d as petitioner admits he did, because in his view the duty is imposed' upon him by a particular statute, and that the court is without power to pass upon the questions involved, or; if it does so, that its judgment may be treated with contemptuous defiance, is utterly inadmissible in any community assuming to be governed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u25a0 <em>We </em>entertain no doubt whatever that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and it necessarily follows that its determination that the action of the constable was illegal, and that he was -in contempt in seizing and persisting in holding the property, is not open to review in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">2. It is further contended that the court exceeded its power in that the payment of costs, was required, because the costs were in the nature of a fine, and therefore the punishment inflicted was both fine and imprisonment. Under section 970 of the Revised Statutes, when judgment is rendered against a defendant in a prosecution for any fine or forfeiture, he shall be subject to the payment of costs, and on every conviction for any other offence, not capital, the court may in its discretion award that the defendant shall pay the costs of the prosecution; and as contempt of court is a specific criminal offence, it is said that the judgment for payment of costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>would appear to be within the power of the court, although by section 125 it is provided that contempts of the authority of courts of the United States may be punished <em>ilf </em>by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.\u201d But be that as it may, the sentence here was that the petitioner be imprisoned \u201cuntil he returns to the custody of the receiver', the barrel taken by him from the warehouse without warrant of law. And when that has been surrendered, that he suffer a further imprisonment thereafter in said county jail for three months and until he pay the costs of these proceedings. \u2019 As the prisoner has neither restored the goods nor suffered the imprisonment for three months, even if it was not within the power of the court to require payment of costs and its judgment to .that extent exceeded its authority, yet he cannot be discharged on <em>habeas corpus </em>until he has performed so much of the judgment or served out so much, of the sentence as it was within the power of-the court to impose. <em>Ex parte </em>Lange, 18 Wall. 163; <em>Ex parte Parks, </em>93 U.
