Smith, both citizens of Penm sylvania, against a life insurance compaii3r, a corporation of Connecticut, upon a policy of- insurance, dated January <em>14, </em>1887, on Smith\u2019s life in the sum of $10,000, payable in <em>\u201c </em>thirty days after due notice and satisfactory evidence \u201d of his death, and upon the express conditions that <em>\u201c </em>the following risks are not assumed by this company under this contract,\u201d and that \u201c in each and every of the foregoing cases this policy shall become and be null and void.\u201d One of those risks and cases was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">.\u201c Suicide. \u2014 The self-destruction of the insured, in any form, except upon proof that the same is \u2019the direct result of disease or. of. accident occurring\u2019 without the Voluntary act of the insured i.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-10\">The declaration, after setting out the policy, alleged that Smith died on February 23, 1887, having paid all the premiums and complied with all the requirements of the policy; and that on March 16, 1887, good and sufficient proof of his death was made to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit, with an affidavit of defence that Smith\u2019s death was a self-destruction or suicide, the direct result of laudanum poison administered by him to himself for the purpose and with the effect of causing his death,, and contrary to the provision of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-4\">The plaintiff filed a replication, denying these allegations, and alleging that, 'if Smith\u2019s death was a self-destruction, it was the direct result of disease or of accident occurring without his voluntary act, and without any purpose or intention of self-destruction or suicide, and his reasoning faculties at the time of taking the poison were so far impaired that he was not able to- understand the moral character, or the nature, consequence, and effect of the act he was about to commit, and it was not contrary to the provisions of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">\u25a0At the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence the policy, and\u2019 formal proof of death, as alleged in the declaration, and rested his case. The defendant then introduced evidence tending to support the defence pleaded. The plaintiff then introduced evidence tending to show that Smith\u2019s reasoning faculties at the time he took the poison were so far impaired that he was not able to understand the moral character, and the nature, effect, and consequence of the act he was about to commit; but, other than this, offered no evidence tending to show that his death\u2019 was the direct result of disease or of accident occurring without his voluntary act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">Upon this evidence, the defendant requested the court to instruct the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">\u201c First. If the jury believe from the evidence in the case that Smith, the insured, destroyed his own life, and that at the time of the self-destruction he had sufficient capacity to understand the nature of the act which he was about to commit and the consequences which would result from it, then and in that case the plaintiff cannot recover on the policy sued on in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">\u201cSecond. If the jury believe from the evidence that the self-destruction of the said Smith was intended by him, he having sufficient capacity at the time to understand the nature of the act which he was about to commit and the consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>which would result from it, then and in that case it is wholly immaterial in the present case that he was impelled thereto by insanity which impaired his sense of moral responsibility and rendered him to a certain extent irresponsible for his action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\">\u25a0\u201c Third. If the jury believe from the evidence that Smith\u2019s life was ended February 23, 1887, by means of laudanum poison administered by himself to himself, the plaintiff cannot recover on the policy sued upon in this case, unless the jury believe also from the evidence that the self-destruction aforesaid of said Smith was the direct result of disease or of acci7 dent occurring without his voluntary action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">\u201c Fourth. Under all the evidence in this case,'the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">The court declined to. give the first, second, and fourth instructions requested, and upon the third request instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">\u201cThe third point is.affirmed, with this exception : \u2022 that if the act of self-destruction was the .result of insanity, and was with- suicidal intent, and the mind of the insured was so far deranged as to have made him 'incapable of using a rational judgment in regard to the act he was about to commit, the. defendant is liable; but' if he was impelled to the act by an insane impulse, which the reason .that was left him did not enable him to resist, or if his reasoning powers were so far overthrown by his mental condition-that he could not exercise his reasoning faculties on the act he was about to commit, the defendant is liable. If from the evidence you- believe that the insured, though excited or angry or depressed in mind from any cause, formed the determination to take his own life, because in the exercise of his usual reasoning faculties he preferred death to- life, then the defendant is not liable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\">To this qualification of the third instruction, as well as to the refusal to give each of the other instructions requested, the defendaftt excepted, and, after verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for the amount of the policy, su\u00e9d out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-9\"><em>Mr. George W. Guthrie </em>for plaintiff- in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The phrase \u201cself-destruction in any form,\u201d used in the policy, is not merely the equivalent of suicide, but covers every case of self-killing, whether felonious or otherwise. If the death of the insured was brought about in the manner alleged, no recovery could be had, even though his mental condition was such \u00e1s described by the court, unless it was the direct result of disease (the opium having been self-administered with the intention of destroying his life, it could not be accidental), and unless proof thereof was furnished to the company before suit brought, or at least produced at the trial of the case;</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-4\">If by the expression \u201c self-destruction in an}^ form,\u201d the parties meant only suicide or felonious self-killing, then the words which follow have no significance or effect. A suicide could not be the result of disease or of accident occurring without the voluntary, act of the insured. Therefore, no proof that it was such could-be produced. . Self-killing by an insane man, or by accident, is not suicide, and to interpret this provision so that it excludes suicide on proof that it is not suicide, is to make it without sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\">It' follows, therefore, that the context in which the phrase is used clearly shows that by it the parties themselves intended something more than suicide only. It is also clear that the only other sense in which it could have been used was the generic one, meaning thereby any case of self-killing, whether felonious or otherwise. And therefore that it was used in_ that sense, and as the word is not a technical one and has never received a technical interpretation, the meaning which the parties themselves attached to it must prevail. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </em>93 U. S. 284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\">The word \u201cself-destruction\u201d is a generic word, and,has never been held to have only a limited technical meaning, as the word \u201c suicide \u201d has. It belongs to the same .class as the word \u201chomicide,\u201d which includes every mode by which the. life of one man is taken by the act of another, whether sane or insane, by intention or by accident, feloniously or innocently. (See the definition in Worcester, Webster, The Century, and the Encyclopaedia.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-7\">It is apparent, therefore, that when correctly used, the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cself-destruction\u201d does not of itself import any element of intention or design: it simply designates the act of taking one\u2019s, own life, without regard to whether it is felonious or non-felopiohs, intentional or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-4\">It was used in this sense- by.this court in the cases of <em>Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>15 Wall. 580; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </em>93 U. S. 284; <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rodel, </em>95 U. S. 232; <em>Manhattan Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Broughton, </em>109 U. S. 121; <em>Connecticut </em>Ins. <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>111 U. S. 612.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-5\">In each one of these cases the word \u201c suicide \u201d and the phrase \u201cdied by his own hand,\u201d are defined as meaning felonious self-destruction, a definition which has no meaning if \u201csuicide\u201d and \u201cself-destruction\u201d are synonymous terms. It would amount to nothing more than a statement that \u201c suicide\u201d me'ant \u201cfelonious suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-6\">On the other hand, if the word \u201c self-destruction \u201d is a generic term then the definition is correct. In common usage the word simply indicates that the man\u2019s life has been destroyed through his own instrumentality. To give color to the act some adjective qualifying phrase is necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-7\">We therefore submit that, as the evidence showed that the insured died from poison administered by himself with the intention of taking his own life, the plaintiff cannot recover, even though the insured was insane at the time, except by showing, that the insanity resulted from disease, and that the proof of it was given to the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">The circumstances leading to the incorporation of these provisions in life insurance policies are too. well known to require more than the merest reference. It having been held that an exception of suicide from the risks assumed would exclude only felonious self-destruction, the insurance companies sought some word or phrase which would have a wider meaning. Some, as the plaintiff in error, adopted the words \u201c.self-destruction in any form,\u201d while others retained the word \u201csuicide,\u201d qualifying it, however, with various phrases, as \u201csane or insane,\u201d \u201cfelonious or otherwise,\u201d \u201c voluntary or involuntary.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">The effect of this was to exclude mahjr risks which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>companies were willing to assume upon proper conditions, as, for instance, they were willing to insure against. self-destruction by accident, or while suffering from insanity the direct result of disease, provided they could be protected from imposition, and the well-known tendency of juries to find insanity in every case of self-destruction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-4\">The clause now before the court was designed for this purpose. The company agrees to pay in a certain time after proof of. death, self-destruction being excluded \u201c except \u2022 upon proof that it was the direct result of disease or of accident occurring without the voluntary act of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\">Nothing can be clearer than that it was the intention of the parties to exclude from the risks assumed some cases of self-destruction, and in all cases of self-destruction to impose upon the claimant the duty of furnishing proof that it was not one of the excluded cases; and, further, that the cases assumed are those in which the self-destruction ivas the direct result of disease or accident, and that all others were excluded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-6\"><em>Mr. D. B. Kurtz </em>and <em>Mr. O. II.

Co. </em>v. Terry, 15 Wall. 580 ; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Berkshire Ins. Co., </em>93 U. S. 284; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Rodel, </em>95 U. S. 232; <em>Manhattan Ins.

S. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>In the case at bar, the first two instructions requested were exactly like those held to have been rightly refused, and the modified instruction given upon the third request was substantially like that held to have been rightly given, in <em>Terry's case, </em>in which the words of the exemption were \u201cdie by his own hand.\u201d' That decision was followed and approved in <em>Iiodel's case </em>and <em>Lathrop's case, </em>in each of which the words were the same; and in <em>Broughton's case, </em>in which the words were \u201cdie by suicide,\u201d and the court, treating the two phrases as equivalent, expressed the opinion that \u201cthe rule so established is sounder in principle, as- well as simpler in application, than that which makes the effect of the act of self-destruction, upon the interests of those for whose benefit the policy was made, to depend upon the very subtle-and difficult question how far any exercise of-.the will can be attributed to a man who is so unsound of mind that, while he foresees- the physical consequences which will directly result from his act, he cannot understand its moral nature and character, or in any just sense be said to know what it is that he is doing.\u201d 109 U. S. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">In <em>Orandal's case, </em>it wras accordingly held that a policy of insurance against \u201c bodily injuries, effected through external, accidental, and violent means,\u201d and occasioning death or com- - p\u00edete disability to do business, but excepting- \u201cdeath or disability caused wholly or in part by bodily infirmities or disease, or by suicide or self-inflicted injuries,\u201d covered death by hanging one\u2019s self whilefinsane; the court saying, \u201cIf self-killing, \u2018suicide,\u2019.\u2018dying by his own hand,\u2019 cannot be predicated of an insane person, no more can \u2018self-inflicted injuries\u2019; for in either case it is not his act.\u201d 120 U. S. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In the .policy in suit, the clause of exemption is in these words : \u201c Suicide. \u2014-The.self-destruction of the assured, iit any form, except upon pro'of that the same is the direct result of disease or of accident occurring without the voluntary act of the assured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">It was argued that the word \u201c self-destruction,\u201d as here used, was more comprehensive than \u201csuicide,\u201d and included an intentional, though insane, killing of one\u2019s self. But the two words are treated as synonymous in the very clause in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tion, as well as in the .former opinions of this court. The act, whether described by words of Saxon or of Latin origin, or partly of the one and partly of the other \u2014 \u201cdying by his-own hand,\u201d \u201cself-killing,\u201d \u201cself-slaughter,\u201d \u201csuicide,\u201d \u201cself-destruction\u201d\u2014 without more, cannot be imputed to a man' who, by reason of insanity, (as is commonly said,) \u201c is not himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The added words \u201cin any form\u201d clearly relate only to the manner of killing; the word \u201c disease,\u2019? unrestricted by anything in the context, includes disease of the mind, as well as disease of the body; and the concluding words \u201cthe voluntary act of the assured \u201d point to the -act of a person mentally capable of controlling his will. The claiise contains no such significant and decisive words as\u2019 \u201cdie by suicide, sane or insane,\u201d as in <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Berkshire Ins. Co., </em>93 U. S. 284; or \u201cby suicide, felonious or otherwise, sane or insane,\u201d as in <em>Travellers' Ins. Co. </em>v. McConkey, 127 U. S. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Upon that part of the clause, which requires \u201cproof that the same is the direct result of disease or of accident occurring without the voluntary act of the insured,\u201d it was argued that such proof must be furnished to the company as part of the preliminary proof of death; and also that evidence that the mental condition of the insured, at the time of the self-destruction, was of the character which the court.below held to render him irresponsible for his act, was not sufficient proof that the self-destruction was the result of .disease or accident. But the word \u201c proof \u201d here clearly means, not the proof required as a preliminary to bringing suit on the policy, but the proof necessary to establish the liability of the insurer. And in making out such proof, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of the presumption that a sane man would not commit suicide, and of other rules of law established for the guidance of courts and juries in the investigation and determination of facts. <em>Travellers' Ins.
