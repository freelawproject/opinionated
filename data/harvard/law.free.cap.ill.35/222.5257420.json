Remedy\u2014where a sale of goods has been induced by fraud. Where a party has been induced to sell goods upon a credit by false and fraudulent representations, the defrauded creditor has his election to disaffirm the sale on the ground of fraud, and invest himself with the rights and entitle himself to the remedies the law affords in such cases; or, he may affirm the sale and have the rights and remedies of other creditors.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b222-14\" pgmap=\"222\">4.

Evidence \u2014 in trespass against an officer for seizing and carrying away goods. And where a sheriff- is sued in trespass by a purchaser from the fraudulent vendee for seizing and carrying away goods, and the sheriff justifies under a writ of attachment issued at the instance of the defrauded creditor, he so far represents such creditor that he may assert his rights according to the manner in which he has elected to assert them for himself.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b222-17\" pgmap=\"222(29) 223(22)\">1.

St. John against John Gray. It, appears that certain creditors of one Orville Finch had previously sued out of the Superior Court of Chicago, writs of attachment against him, which came to the hands of the defendant, Gray, as sheriff of Cook county, and were by him levied upon a quantity of dry goods found in the possession of St. John, the plaintiff, and by virtue thereof Gray seized the goods and carried them away; and in this consists the alleged trespass. The defendant justifies the taking under the writs.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-15\" pgmap=\"223\">Judgments were rendered for the plaintiffs in the attachment suits, and the goods were sold under executions issued thereon.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\" pgmap=\"224\">The merits of the controversy will appear from the following brief statement: On the 7th day of December, 1858, the goods were the property of Finch, and on that day, being a few days prior to the levy of the writs of attachment, he sold them to Darius 0. Jackson, and Jackson sold them to St. John, the plaintiff in this suit, in whose hands they were seized under the writs.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\" pgmap=\"224\">It is alleged by Gray that the sale from Finch to Jackson was fraudulent and void, for the reason that it was made for the purpose of hindering and delaying the creditors of Finch; and that both Jackson and St. John had knowledge of such fraudulent intent on the part of Finch at the time of the sales to them, respectively; therefore, the goods were held by St. John subject to the rights of Finch\u2019s creditors.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\" pgmap=\"224\">On the other hand, St. John, while he admits that he has no greater rights than those acquired by Jackson, insists that Jackson purchased the goods in good faith, in payment of a debt due from Finch to him.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\" pgmap=\"224(188) 225(58)\">The testimony shows that Finch was insolvent; that the sale to Jackson deprived him of all means of paying his other creditors, to whom he was largely indebted; and was clandestinely made; and that Jackson paid little or nothing for the goods, compared with their value, except the discharge of Finch\u2019s indebtedness; and it was also shown that Finch obtained the goods from those same attaching creditors upon time, by means of false and fraudulent representations. Some of the testimony offered to prove the fraudulent manner in which Finch obtained from the attaching creditors a large quantity of goods, including those in controversy in this suit, was rejected by the court below; but it is not necessary to notice that more particularly, because the ruling on that subject is sustained upon the grounds, 1st, that so far as that testimony tended to show the intent with which Finch disposed of the goods, it was unnecessary, that fact being already sufficiently established; and 2d, so far as the rejected testimony would go to establish the fratidulent means employed by Finch to obtain the goods, as an independent proposition, it was not properly admissible, for the reason that the attaching creditors had waived the fraud and affirmed the sales to Finch, by suing for the price of the goods; and the sheriff, in justifying under the writs, but asserts the rights of those creditors according to the manner in which they have asserted them for themselves.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\" pgmap=\"225\">It appears that Jackson had knowledge, at the time of his purchase, of the fraudulent intent with which Finch was disposing of the goods, and the question is presented, as to what effect that knowledge should have tipon Jackson\u2019s rights, in view of his purchasing the goods in payment of the debt he held against Finch; and thereby, the bona fides of that indebtedness is involved.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\" pgmap=\"225\">The plaintiff requested the court to give the following instructions, which were given, defendants excepting to each and all:</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-8\" pgmap=\"225\">1. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff, St. John, purchased the goods in question of D. C. Jackson, in good faith and for a valuable consideration paid, or secured to be paid by him for the same, and that the goods were delivered to him by Jackson (and a delivery to the railroad company to be carried to Wisconsin, and directed to the plaintiff, was a delivery to the plaintiff), they will find for the plaintiff the value of the goods at the time they were taken by the defendants, with six per cent, interest on that amount since the time of taking; unless the jury further believe from the evidence that St. John made such purchase with the purpose of assisting Jackson and Finch in defrauding, hindering or delaying the creditors of Finch.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-9\" pgmap=\"225(91) 226(21)\">2. The jury are instructed that fraud is not presumed to exist, but it must be proved; and unless the jury believe, from the evidence, that Jackson made the purchase of the goods in question with intent to hinder, delay or defraud the creditors of Finch, and that plaintiff knew of such intent on the part of Jackson, and assisted, or intended to assist in effecting that purpose; they will find for the plaintiff the value of the goods at the time of taking them by the defendant, with six per cent, interest on the same. This is so if plaintiff purchased the goods in good faith and for a valuable consideration.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\" pgmap=\"226\">3. The jury are instructed that a man has a right to pay one of his creditors in full to the exclusion of his other creditors; and if the jury believe, from the evidence, that Jackson made the purchase of the goods in question solely to secure a tona fide indebtedness due himself, and not for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding the creditors of Finch, they wiE find for the plaintiff the value of the goods as stated in the preceding instructions, notwithstanding Finch was insolvent at the time of said purchase by Jackson of Finch.</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\" pgmap=\"226\">4. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that Jackson was a creditor of Orville Finch at the time he purchased these goods, and that his sole object in making such purchase was to secure himself, and in good faith obtain his pay from Finch, then the fact that he may have known of Finch\u2019s indebtedness, or even insolvency, if such was the case at that time, does not vitiate or render fraudulent the sale of the goods from Finch to Jackson.</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\" pgmap=\"226\">5.

This is not good law, because, if the plaintiff', having knowledge of Finch\u2019s fraud, bought for the purpose of assisting and benefiting himself rather than Finch, the sale would have been invalid.</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-6\" pgmap=\"234\">4. The court erred in gualifying the instructions reguested by the appellant.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-7\" pgmap=\"234\">The first instruction, qualified by. the court, states a proposition which admits of no qualification whatever. It is good law at all times, and under all circumstances. The instruction given by the court, taken in connection with the one which it qualifies, is incoherent and meaningless. It misleads the jury; has no legitimate connection with the subject matter embraced in the instruction as requested, and both instructions taken and read together, were not, and cannot be made consistent.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-8\" pgmap=\"234\">The same remarks will apply to instructions requested by appellant, numbered 6, 8 and 18, which were qualified in the same manner and by the same instruction.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-9\" pgmap=\"234\">5. The instruction ginsen by the court, and marked \u201c instruction drawn and given by the courtf was improperly gi/ven.</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-10\" pgmap=\"234\">It enunciates an abstract legal proposition which might or might not have any application whatever to the case as the jury might find the facts to be from the evidence.</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-12\" pgmap=\"234\">It assumes that the purchase made by Jackson, was made by him as the creditor of Finch. At all events, it thrusts that idea prominently before the jury; whereas, as we insist, Jackson was not a creditor of Finch. At all events, that question should have been determined by the jury as a matter of fact, and not assumed by the court as a matter of law. It was practically the expression of the opinion of the court, five times repeated, as to the weight of evidence upon that point.</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-13\" pgmap=\"234(58) 235(47)\">This instruction was read to the jury by the court five times. There is nothing of sufficient merit in the instruction to entitle it to that degree of prominence in the case. It was evidently the intention of the court that the instruction, and all the inferences to be drawn from it, should have controlling weight with the jury. An instruction \u201c d/ra/wn and given by the court\u201d is entitled to no more weight than an instruction \u201c drawn by counsel and given by the court.\u201d This we think was unfair. We think it deprived us of a fair trial, and misled the jury.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\" pgmap=\"235\">The court cited authorities at the end of the instruction, marked \u201cinstruction drawn and given by the court.\u201d The instruction, therefore, went to the jury apparently supported and sustained by authorities, the application of which the counsel for appellants had no opportunity to meet and refute, as they think they could have done.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-7\" pgmap=\"235\">It is submitted that the court had no right or authority to volunteer an-instruction not requested by any of the counsel in the case.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-8\" pgmap=\"235\">6. The cowrt erred, in refusing to gioe instructions requested ly appellant.</p><p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-10\" pgmap=\"235\">Instructions numbered 12, 13, 14, 15, were simply based upon the facts proved in the case, and intended to make the application^ of the law to those facts. The ultimate questions to be determined by the jury were the motives of the parties to these sales, and the law as stated in those instructions is, as we claim, correct as to the inferences which are to be drawn from the existence of such facts. As such they should have been given to the jury.</p><p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-11\" pgmap=\"235\">Instruction numbered 16 should have been given. The court had already told the jury that fraud could not be presumed, but must be proved. The instruction thus given rendered it necessary to instruct the jury as to how fraud might be proven.

The creditors of one Orville Finch had sued out of the Superior Court of Chicago, writs of attachment against him under which the appellant, as the sheriff of Cook county, justified the taking. Judgments were rendered in the attachment suits and the</p> <p id=\"b237-10\" pgmap=\"237\">goods were sold upon executions issued thereon. On the 7th day of December, 1858, the goods were the property of Finch, and on that day, being a few days prior to the levy, he sold the same to Darius C. Jackson, who sold them to the appellee. The sale from Finch to Jackson is alleged to have been fraudulent and void for the reason that it was made to hinder and delay creditors. While the appellee admits that he has no greater rights than those acquired by Jackson, he insists that Jackson purchased the goods in good faith in payment of a debt due from Finch.</p> <p id=\"b237-11\" pgmap=\"237(75) 238(386) 239(56)\">The evidence discloses a conspiracy of a nature justly entitling the State to the services of the parties concerned in it, by which Finch obtained a large quantity of goods from the attaching creditors, and a portion of the goods in controversy are those thus obtained. On the trial, portions of the depositions of two of the conspirators, explaining more in detail the fraudulent means resorted to by them to accomplish their purpose, were excluded. The excluded portions of the depositions were competent evidence to establish a fraud on the part of Finch in obtaining goods from the attaching creditors, and were also evidence of fraud in the sale to Jackson. To prove the intent of Finch in making the sale we are of the opinion that the manner in which he had then recently obtained goods from his creditors was admissible, as well as the manner in which he disposed of them. Bridge v. Eggleston, 14 Mass. 249; Foster v. Hall, 12 Pick. 99; Howe v. Reed, 3 Fairf. 518; Carey v. Hotailing, 1 Hill, 316; Painter v. Drum, 40 Penn. 471. Courts have the right to limit the number of witnesses to be examined and the number of depositions to be read to prove a particular fact. When a fact is sufficiently established and is not controverted the court may properly refuse to suffer its time to be occupied in hearing further evidence on that point. The testimony introduced established beyond controversy, that Finch was insolvent, that the sale to Jackson deprived Finch of all means of paying his other creditors, and was clandestinely made, and that Jackson paid little or nothing for the goods compared with their value, excepting the discharge of Finch\u2019s indebtedness. It also established that the goods obtained from the attaching creditors were so obtained upon false and fraudulent representations. The manner in which they were disposed of, after they were obtained, was shown. The extent of Jackson\u2019s knowledge in regard to the transactions of Finch was also established. From the evidence the character of the sale to Jackson depended solely upon the Iona fides of the indebtedness of Finch in payment of which the goods were taken, and no attempt was made to sustain it upon any other ground. If that ground failed, there was no controversy as to its invalidity. Under the circumstances, there was no error in not receiving further testimony to prove the intention of Finch. It had been sufficiently proven, and it would have been only a waste of time to receive the testimony for that purpose. The excluded testimony was offered, not so much for the purpose of showing the fraudulent intention of Finch, as to establish the details of a conspiracy between him and others to defraud the attaching creditors, the appellant insisting that if he could establish a conspiracy and Jackson\u2019s knowledge of it at the time of his purchase, the jury should be instructed that the sale to him was invalid notwithstanding it was made in good faith to pay a bona fide indebtedness.</p> <p id=\"AaW\" pgmap=\"239\">We are of the opinion that the establishment of a conspiracy, and Jackson\u2019s knowledge of it, would not have entitled the appellant to the instruction sought for. \u25a0 The appellant, as sheriff, so far represented the attaching creditors as to enable him to assert their rights in the suits which they had commenced. They might have disaffirmed the sales made by them, and commenced actions of replevin or trover for the recovery of the property obtained by means of the conspiracy, or damages for its conversion, and in such actions the means by which Finch obtained the property, and Jackson\u2019s knowledge of such means, would have been important; but to sustain the rights of the creditors in actions of assumpsit to recover the price for which the goods were sold, such evidence was entirely immaterial.</p> <p id=\"b239-7\" pgmap=\"239(177) 240(128)\">The creditors had their election to disaffirm the sales made by them on the ground of fraud, and invest themselves with the rights and entitle themselves to the remedies the law affords in such cases; or they might affirm the sales and have the rights and remedies of other creditors. The commencement of the attachment suits was, at least, a prima facie affirmance of the sales and waiver of the fraud, and all rights resulting from it. The appellant, on behalf of the creditors, now asserts their rights in affirmance of the sales, and while thus asserting them he cannot insist upon rights which they would have had if they had disaffirmed the sales and were asserting rights resulting from such disaffirmance. The creditors who were defrauded by the conspiracy have, in this suit, no greater rights than creditors who were not thereby defrauded. It was, therefore, of no importance to establish the conspiracy, as it could only serve to establish' the fraudulent intention of Finch, and that was already established. The knowledge which Jackson had of the fraudulent intention of Finch did not prevent him from receiving pay of an honest debt. A creditor violates no rule of law when he takes payment of his demand, though other creditors are thereby deprived of all means of obtaining satisfaction of their own equally meritorious claims. Ewing v. Runkle, 20 Ill. 457. So far as Jackson received goods which were obtained from the attaching creditors by fraud, he may have received them subject to their rights upon a disaffirmance of the sales, but those rights are not now in controversy. The knowledge that Jackson had of the means by which the goods were obtained is of no importance, except in a suit for the assertion of rights resulting from a disaffirmance of the sales.</p> <p id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240\">The only questions in controversy on the trial were the bona jides of the indebtedness of Finch, and whether the sale was, in fact, made to pay it, and taking all the instructions together, we are of the opinion that these questions were submitted to the jury in a manner not likely to mislead them, and we are satisfied with the conclusion at which they arrived. We do not deem it necessary to consider, at length, the manifold and serious objections to the instructions given relating to matters which we are of the opinion are irrelevant to the merits.</p> <p id=\"b240-7\" pgmap=\"240\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b240-8\" pgmap=\"240\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
