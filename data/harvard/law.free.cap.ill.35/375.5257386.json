We mean the recital of a fact not appearing of record to have been done, and the recital of this supposed past fact does not contain a statement that this matter in pais was really an agreement of the defendant to waive the intervention of a jury, the record would show that the defendant consents to waive a jury and substitutes the judge, at the time of the trial, and the recital that there was a previous parol agreement that it might be done ought not to be allowed, especially when the recital is in an order entered up after the defendant\u2019s attorneys had withdrawn from the case. The only statements in the record on the subject, is in this order of June 20th, 1863.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\" pgmap=\"377\">We claim the waiver of a jury does not legally appear of record.</p> <opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b377-7\" pgmap=\"377\">Mr. Justice Breese</author> <p id=\"A_U\" pgmap=\"377\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b377-8\" pgmap=\"377\">No agreement that the court should try the issues made up in this cause, appears in the record, except the recital in the order of court, which order appears to have been made after the attorneys for the defendant had withdrawn from the case, which withdrawal took place before the court had disposed of the demurrers.</p> <p id=\"b377-9\" pgmap=\"377\">There is nothing then, in the record, to show that a jury was waived. If not waived, then the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have a jury to try the issues was invaded. Const, art., 13, \u00a7 6. No waiver of a jury, or of submission to the court alone, appears to have been made while the defendant had an attorney in court.</p> <p id=\"b377-10\" pgmap=\"377\">For this irregularity the judgment must be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b377-11\" pgmap=\"377\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
