Ranstead as to the. necessity of rules of practice being entered of record, was not designed to apply to motions, of course, made in the progress of a cause. No general rules can well apply to them.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b265-11\" pgmap=\"265\">2.

A judgment was rendered in favor of Jacob Helbig, an execution issued thereon, and the sheriff\u2019s return showed a sale of land to the plaintiff. The sheriff made a deed to Christopher Adleman, which recited a judgment in favor of John Helbig.

The defendant entered his motion for a new trial, which was refused, and judgment was entered upon the verdict. The defendant brings the case to this court by appeal. The questions presented under the assignment of errors, are, first, whether the Circuit Court erred in its action upon the motions of the plaintiff to strike the defendant\u2019s second plea from the \"files, and for leave to file a demurrer thereto; second, whether the sheriff\u2019s deed given in evidence was sufficiently supported by the judgment and execution; third, whether the special plea, asserting a right of homestead in the defendant, was a proper plea in the case; and fourth, whether the objection to the sheriff\u2019s deed for want of a seal can prevail in this court, that specific objection not having been made in the court below.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272\">Mr. Ubi Osgood, for the appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK0\" pgmap=\"272\">insisted- that the court below erred in entertaining the plaintiff\u2019s motions to strike the defendant\u2019s second plea from the files, and for leave to file a demurrer thereto: 1st, because neither of said motions, nor any reasons therefor, was reduced to writing, as required by the rule of the court mentioned, and cited the case of Owens v. Ranstead, 22 Ill. 161; 2d, because, independently of the requirements of that rule, it was irregular and improper to .entertain the motions, or to consider the demurrer after the jury were impanneled and sworn to try the cause.</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\" pgmap=\"272\">11. There is not that conformity in the judgment, execution, the return thereon, and the sheriff\u2019s deed, which the law requires: 1st. It will be seen that the first record produced and read by the plaintiff bore date on the 12th of March, 1860.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\" pgmap=\"272\">The execution read in evidence describes a judgment rendered at a term of court began and held at Joliet in said Will county on the 3d Monday of May, a. d. 1860.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\" pgmap=\"272\">There is no evidence that the execution introduced in evidence by plaintiff below, was issued on, or for the collection of the judgment introduced and read in evidence. That judgment was rendered June 8th, 1860, as shown by the record. The execution was issued, as shown upon its face, on and for the collection of a judgment rendered at a term of Will county Circuit Court, began and held on the 3d Monday of May, 1860, which was the 21st day of May, 1860. There is no evidence that the said judgment was rendered at said May Term of court, 1860. See 7 Conn. 6-8; 8 Iredell, 221.</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\" pgmap=\"272\">The deed, it will be perceived, describes a judgment rendered in favor of John Helbig (not Jacob Helbig) for the use \u25a0of Albert Eeadi, assignee, against Andrew Johnson, being a different judgment from the one described in the execution, and different from the judgment introduced in evidence by the plaintiff below.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\" pgmap=\"272(31) 273(97)\">It -also discloses that Christopher Adleman is the grantee, and that he was the person who bid off the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale in said deed described. The sheriff\u2019s official return to the execution read in evidence on the trial shows that said execution was satisfied in full by sale of the property therein described to the plaintiff. The plaintiff in the judgment and execution read in evidence was Jacob Helbig, and the party for whose use the suit was prosecuted was Albert Beadi. The execution read in evidence shows that Jacob Helbig was the plaintiff in the judgment on which it was issued, and the sheriff\u2019s return thereon shows that the plaintiff therein bid off the property sold under and by virtue of said execution.</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\" pgmap=\"273\">The deed read in evidence shows that the plaintiff in the judgment therein recited was John Helbig, and that the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, under the execution therein described, was Christopher Adleman, and not the plaintiff in the execution. Can it be successfully contended that this paper, called a deed, was executed pursuant to a sale under an execution issued on the judgment .of Jacob Helbig, read in evidence, when the deed upon its face shows a judgment in favor of John Helbig, an entirely different party from the one described in the judgment read in evidence? and that too, when the sheriff\u2019s return on the execution read in evidence shows a sale to the plaintiff in the execution, and the deed shows a sale to Christopher Adleman, an entire different person ?</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\" pgmap=\"273\">According to the evidence there must have been two different judgments, one in favor of Jacob Helbig, and the other in favor of John Helbig.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\" pgmap=\"273\">Before the plaintiff below could legally recover, he relying upon a sheriff\u2019s deed to make out his title, it was necessary for him to prove a valid judgment, an execution issued thereon, a levy and sale under the execution, and a deed corresponding with the judgment.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\" pgmap=\"273(65) 274(56)\">It cannot be successfully contended that this is a mere misrecital of the judgment in the deed, or a variance between the judgment and execution which will not vitiate. There is no misrecital or variance in this case. The judgment described in the deed is another and different judgment from that read in evidence and from that described in the execution read in evidence. Our statute designates what a sheriff\u2019s deed shall contain and furnishes the form of such deed. Eev. S. 1845, p. 304, \u00a7 19. This section requires that the deed shall contain a statement of the judgment upon which the lands therein described were sold, and the date of the execution, and then follows the form.</p><p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\" pgmap=\"274\">The judgment read in evidence was rendered June 8th, 1860.</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\" pgmap=\"274\">The execution was issued on a judgment rendered at a term of court commenced and held the 3d Monday of May (21st May), 1860, and there is no evidence showing that the judgment of June 8th was rendered at the May Term, 1860, of said court, nor can the court, in the absence of proof, presume that such was the fact. See the base of Gutter v. Wadsworth, 6 Conn. 6. In this case a judgment was rendered between the same parties at a term assigned by law on the 2d Tuesday of February, 1827, on which day the court commenced its session, and held until after the 4th Monday of the same month. Execution was issued counting on a judgment of the court held on the 4th Tuesday of February, 1827. The court say, in that case, \u201c There was no such term of the Superior Court as the \u201c execution counts upon; and if there had been, the process \u201cwould have been unauthorized, as the only judgment between \u201c the parties was not only rendered at the term of the court \u201cheld on the second Tuesday of February, but ten days before \u201cthe fourth Tuesday, on which the rendition of the judgment \u201c was affirmed in the execution to have been made.\u201d The court, in the same case, say, \u201cUndoubtedly the execution in question, unsupported by a judgment, is void. The sheriff was \u201c under no legal obligation to enforce it; nor could he do it \u201cwithout becoming a trespasser. If legal process is awarded \u201c erroneously, it is a vindication of the officer who acts under \u201c it, but if it issues without the authority of law it is utterly \u201cvoid.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-8\" pgmap=\"274(45) 275(138)\">FTot only was the execution read in evidence in the case, void (so far at least as the judgment read in evidence was concerned) but it was issued in favor of a different party as plaintiff from the party described as plaintiff in the judgment set out in the (so called) sheriff\u2019s deed read in evidence. The judgment described in said sheriff\u2019s deed, is in favor of a different party from that introduced in evidence on the trial, and the purchaser of the property under the execution introduced in evidence was a different person from the one described in said deed. The purchaser at said sale under the execution, being the plaintiff therein as specified in the sheriff\u2019s return, and the purchaser under the execution described in said deed being Christopher Adleman, a stranger to the proceedings \u2014 said sheriff\u2019s deed (so called) not being founded on the judgment read in evidence and relied on by plaintiff below, it was improperly and illegally admitted to be read in evidence by the court, and the ruling of the court was clearly erroneous.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275\">This is not like a case of a clerical mistake, which is amendable, nor of a defective return by the sheriff. The purchaser depends upon a valid judgment upon the levy and sale and his deed, when he makes his purchase, he is bound to know there is a valid subsisting judgment upon which' the sale is based, otherwise his purchase is invalid and he takes nothing by his purchase or his deed.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-7\" pgmap=\"275(203) 276(260)\">In the case of Williams v. Clayton et ad. 1 Scam. 503, the court uses the following language : \u201c It will be perceived that \u201c the deed recites a sale on an execution, made in an entirely \u201c different cause, between different parties in an action- at law, \u201c and therefore there could be no relevancy between a title \u201c acquired under th z fieri facias set out in the deed and the one \u201c offered in evidence under the decree. The point can admit of \u201c no doubt. The objection, that, as the decree was evidence \u201c conducive to prove the issue, it should have been left to the \u201cjury, is inconclusive.\u201d And in the case of Bybee v. Ashby, 2 Gilm. 151, the court uses the following language: \u201c The \u201c general doctrine in regard to the sale of lands by a sheriff \u201c is, that his deed is inadmissible in evidence unless the judg- \u201c ment and execution, under which sale is made, be produced \u201cto show the sheriff\u2019s authority to sell. The purchaser is \u201c bound to inquire into the power and means by which the \u201c property is subjected to sale, and will acquire no right to- \u201c the land, where the sheriff sells without legal \u00e1uthority.\u201d In the case of Davis v. McVicker, 11 Ill. 327, the court say: \u201c The grantee of a sheriff does not make out a title by the \u201cmere production of the sheriff\u2019s deed. He must in addition \u201c show a judgment and execution that authorized the sheriff \u201c to make the sale and conveyance. The deed passes no title \u201c unless it is based on a judgment and execution.\u201d In the case of Dickermann et al. v. Burgess et al., 20 Ill. 266, the court, speaking of sheriff\u2019s sales, the return, certificate and deed, uses the following language: \u201cWe hold that there must be \u201c entire conformity in all these proceedings, in the return, the \u201c certificate and the deed, and if they do not possess it they \u201c will be invalid.\u201d See also Picket v. Hartsock, 15 Ill. 279. In the case of Palmer v. Palmer, 2 Conn. 462, which was a judgment rendered in favor of a party in his representative capacity as administrator, an execution was issued in favor of the party in his private capacity as an individual, the court uses the following language: \u201c It is- an unquestionable rule \u201c that an execution must pursue and be warranted by the judg- \u201c ment to render it valid. Here is no judgment in favor of \u201c the plaintiff in his private character, but only as adminis- \u201c trator. The execution does not then pursue the judgment \u201c and there is no judgment to warrant it.\u201d \u25a0</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJr\" pgmap=\"276\">There was no proof on the trial of the case that the defendant below was the defendant in the judgment and execution introduced' in evidence. Without such proof the defendant was \u25a0entitled to notice to quit, and it was incumbent on the plaintiff then to show a demand for possession. Ho notice\" to quit was proven and no demand for poss\u00e9ssion was shown, and hence the instruction of the plaintiff given by the court, that \u201c it is \u201c not necessary for the plaintiff to prove a demand for possession \u201c prior to the bringing of suit,\u201d was erroneous. ' !</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\" pgmap=\"276\">The first and second instructions asked by defendant below and given by the court were undoubtedly correct \u25a0 and good law, and the qualifications to said instructions asked by plaintiff below and given by the court were improper and tended to 'mislead the jury. \u2022 -- -</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\" pgmap=\"277\">The sixth instruction asked by the defendant below on the trial and refused by the court is undoubtedly the law as applicable to the case and should have been given, and the refusal of the court to give said instruction was unquestionably erroneous. Can there be any question that the sheriff\u2019s deed must correctly describe the judgment under which it is given, in so essential a matter as the names of the parties to the judgment? The names of the parties are an essential ingredient to constitute a good and valid judgment, and the names of parties in a judgment in all legal proceedings dependent upon the judgment must be correctly stated.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\" pgmap=\"277(287) 278(34)\">In addition to the above cited cases, the court is referred to the case of Spangler v. Pugh, 21 Ill. 85, in which the court uses the following language: \u201c A distinction is, however, made \u201c between matters of substance and matters of essential description. The former may be substantially proved, but the \u201c latter must be proved with a degree of strictness extending in \u201c some cases even to literal precision. No allegation descrip- \u201c tive of the identity of that which is legally essential to the \u201c claim can ever be rejected. And of this character are names, \u201c sums, magnitudes, dates, durations and terms, which being \u201c essential to the identity of the writing set forth must in gen- \u201c eral be precisely proved.\u201d Also Blanchard v. Blanchard, 3 Ired. 105. This was an action of ejectment, and on the trial the lessor of the plaintiff, as a part of his title, produced a judgment in favor of Wm. McCurdy against Noah Blanchard, obtained before a justice of the peace, and a separate execution with subsequent legal proceedings in favor of Reuben Blanchard against Noah Blanchard. The court in that case says: \u201c It is also \u201cperfectly settled with us, that however an officer may be \u201cprotected in rendering obedience to an execution, although \u201cunwarranted by a judgment, because he is not bound to look \u201c behind his writ, but a purchaser under an execution sale must \u201c show not only the execution, but a judgment which warrants \u201c and sustains it. And this doctrine has been explicitly held in \u201c cases of levies made by constables returned to court and sales \u201c under writs of venditioni there awarded, Ingraham v. Kirby, \u201c2 Dev. and Bat. 21. Now, it cannot he pretended that an fi execution in favor of B. is warranted by a judgment rendered in favor of A.\u201d It seems unnecessary to multiply authorities.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\" pgmap=\"278\">The cases relied on to sustain the judgment of the Circuit Court are cases where sales have been made in pursuance of valid judgments, but where variances and misrecitals have occurred in the amount of the debt, damages or costs, some or all of them in the issuing of executions and in subsequent proceedings under the same, and which are amendable. Such are the eases of Durham et al. v. Heaton, 28 Ill. 264; Loomis v. Riley, 24 id. 307; Phillips et al. v. Coffee, 17 id. 154; Jackson v. Pratt, 10 Johns. 381; Jackson v. Walker, 4 Wend. 463; Borland v. Stewart, id. 568; Jennings v. Carter, 2 id. 446, and many others of the same class. The doctrine contended for in these cases is not denied where it is applicable.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\" pgmap=\"278\">The evidence in the case, however, does not show that the sheriff\u2019s sale, pursuant to which the deed (so called) introduced in evidence was executed, was had under a subsisting judgment and execution (so far at least as this ease is concerned), and there was no evidence to warrant the finding of the jury, and the verdict should have been set aside.</p><attorneys data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-8\" pgmap=\"278\">Hr. Gr. D. A. Parks, for the appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-9\" pgmap=\"278\">I. The misrecital of the judgment in the sheriff\u2019s deed in one particular (the description being correct in other particulars, so as to leame no doubt of its identity), does not vitiate the deed. Phillips et al. v. Coffee, 17 Ill. 154; Loomis v. Riley, 24 id. 307; Durham et al. v. Heaton, 28 id. 264; 10 Johns. 386; 4 Wend. 465, 480, 569; 2 id. 451; 18 Johns. 7; 5 Cow. 529; 9 id. 182.</p><p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-10\" pgmap=\"278(77) 279(48)\">To support the title given by a sheriff\u2019s deed, there must be a valid judgment and a valid execution. Of course it must be made to appear to the court, that the execution offered in evidence is the identical execution under which the sale was made, and that the judgment offered in evidence is the identical judgment upon which that execution was issued. If the description of the judgment in the deed is perfect in all respects, no question can arise. But the sheriff in preparing the deed is liable to make a mistake in describing the several features of his authority. If it appears that in point of fact he possessed the requisite authority, does such a misrecital make his deed void ?</p><p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\" pgmap=\"279\">The doctrine to be deduced from the decisions seems to be this, that if there is no doubt of the identity of the judgment referred to, a misrecital of the judgment on one or more particulars does not vitiate.</p><p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\" pgmap=\"279\">The mistake in the name does not differ from a mistake in any other feature by which the judgment is to be described.</p><p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-8\" pgmap=\"279\">Here there was no doubt of the identity of the judgment offered in evidence. Hone was pretended on the trial, or can be pretended here.</p><p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\" pgmap=\"279\">1. The surname of the nominal plaintiff was the same.</p><p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\" pgmap=\"279\">2. The name of the real or beneficial plaintiff is the same.</p><p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-11\" pgmap=\"279\">3. The name of the defendant is the same.</p><p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-12\" pgmap=\"279\">4. The description of the premises to be sold (it being a special execution) is the same.</p><p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-13\" pgmap=\"279\">5. The term of court is the same.</p><p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-14\" pgmap=\"279\">6. The character of the action is the same.</p><p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-15\" pgmap=\"279\">7. The amount of the judgment is the same.</p><p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-16\" pgmap=\"279\">8. The date of the execution issued on the judgment is the same.</p><p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-17\" pgmap=\"279\">The plaintiff, it will be observed, was a stranger to the judgment in question.</p><p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-18\" pgmap=\"279\">II. In the case of a special execution, a levy is unnecessary and absurd. The general object of a levy is to make an execution operative upon certain specific property of the defendant. But here the judgment itself is in rem., and the execution is by its terms confined to the premises described in the judgment. See also upon \"this point R. S. ch. 57, p. 21; 11 Ill. 513; 17 id. 157; Kent\u2019s Com. 432, note \u201c C.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-19\" pgmap=\"279\">III. The action of the court in sustaining the demurrer to the defendant\u2019s special plea, if erroneous, was immaterial to the rights of the parties, and left the real issues unchanged.</p><p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-20\" pgmap=\"279(10) 280(81)\">The pleadings in ejectment have been fixed by statute. The defendant below therefore neither had the right nor was under the necessity of adding a special plea. It was a simple nullity on the record. Whether disposed of by motion to strike from the files or by demurrer, and whether so disposed of before or after the commencement of the trial, could in no way affect the rights of the defendant. All his possible legal defenses to the action were still left in his hands. 15 Ill. 241; 29 id. 518.</p><p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\" pgmap=\"280\">The court, moreover, will not fail to observe, that on the trial the defendant did not attempt to show that the premises in question did not constitute his homestead.</p><p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\" pgmap=\"280\">The circumstance that the law prescribing the form of pleadings in ejectment was enacted prior to the homestead law, can make no difference. The object of the statute was to simplify the pleadings to the utmost degree. A form of defense so general and comprehensive, covering all the infinite diversity of cases where the plaintiff\u2019s claim of possession is denied, seems as well fitted to a species of defense given by a law passed afterwards as to any other species. See precedent in 29 331. 518. This case occurred under the operation of the homestead law of 1857.</p><p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\" pgmap=\"280\">If these views are correct, then manifestly there is no error in the judgment, and it should be affirmed.</p> <opinion data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b280-9\" pgmap=\"280\">Mr. Justice Beeese</author> <p id=\"ABt\" pgmap=\"280\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b280-10\" pgmap=\"280\">The points raised on the record are few and simple, and therefore not difficult to be decided.</p> <p id=\"b280-11\" pgmap=\"280\">As to the action of the Circuit Court, in apparent contravention of its own rules, we have to observe that the reasoning in the case of Owens v. Ranstead, 22 Ill. 161, as is apparent from the language used, and the case under consideration, was not designed to apply to motions, of course, made in the progress of a cause. Ho general rules can well apply to them. And besides, it was a matter of perfect indifference whether the court entertained a motion to strike out the special plea or sustained a demurrer to it. The plea had no proper place in the action on trial.</p> <p id=\"b280-12\" pgmap=\"280(11) 281(81)\">The important objection, as it strikes us, to the recovery in this case, is, that the evidence does not support it. The judgment in the scire facias, on which the premises were sold, was a judgment in favor of Jacob Helbig, and so was the execution which issued on it. The sheriff\u2019s return shows that he sold the property to the plaintiff. His deed is made to Christopher Adleman, and recites a judgment in favor of John Helbig. There is no proof there was no judgment in favor of John Helbig.</p> <p id=\"b281-6\" pgmap=\"281\">This court held, in the case of Dickerman v. Burgess, 20 Ill. 266, that there should be entire conformity in the return of the sheriff, his certificate and deed; and if they do not possess it, they will be held invalid.</p> <p id=\"b281-7\" pgmap=\"281\">The property was struck off to the plaintiff in the execution. The certificate should have been issued to him, and the deed made to him. The deed is made to Adleman as the purchaser. Here is not conformity.</p> <p id=\"b281-8\" pgmap=\"281\">It would be easy for the sheriff to amend his return, and show that the property was struck off to Adleman, if that was the fact. Then the deed would be correct, so far as that point is involved. As to the statement of the judgment being in favor of John Helbig, when it was really in favor of Jacob Helbig, that might be corrected on a proper application for such purpose.</p> <p id=\"b281-9\" pgmap=\"281\">Had there been proof that no other judgment had existed than the one in favor of Jacob Helbig, on the records of the Will Circuit Court, the recital would have been considered as a mistake, and not vitiating the deed. To that effect are the cases cited by appellee, especially the case of Durham et al. v. Heaton, 28 Ill. 264.</p> <p id=\"b281-10\" pgmap=\"281\">If a homestead right was claimed by the defendant, he could have shown it under the plea of not guilty. Patterson v. Kreig, 29 Ill. 514.</p> <p id=\"b281-11\" pgmap=\"281\">As to the paper purporting to be a sheriff\u2019s deed having no seal, it will be seen the defendant did not object to its going in evidence on that account, but for the other reasons which we have stated.</p> <p id=\"b281-12\" pgmap=\"281\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b281-13\" pgmap=\"281\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
