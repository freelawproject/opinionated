Highways\u2014of the certainty required in an order establishing a road, in the description of the route. The maxim that \u201c that is certain which can be rendered certain,\u201d applies to the order of supervisors establishing a public road. In this case, the order directed that a road be laid out, in pursuance of an application which had been made, commencing at the northwest corner of section one, in a designated township and range; that the width of the road be four rods, the courses whereof according to a plat thereof which the supervisors had caused to be made by the county surveyor, which plat was attached to and made a part of the order. The application referred to described the route of the proposed road, thus: Commencing at the northwest corner of section one, in township thirty-one, range two east of the third principal meridian; thence south to the southwest corner of section thirty-six, in the same township and range. The plat attached and made a part of the order, showed the route of a road, commencing at the northwest corner of section one, and running south on the sectional lines to the southwest corner of section thirty-six. Eeld, the order described the route with sufficient certainty. By reference to the plat, the commencement and end of the road were shown, and the course and distance.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b445-5\" pgmap=\"445\">4. Same\u2014whether the order should, show the assessment of damages as to all the owners along the road. In a proceeding against a party for obstructing a public road, it cannot be material to him whether in the order establishing the road damages were assessed to all the owners of land along the route, so they were assessed to him, he being one of .the owners. It might be that the other owners had released the damages, or were entitled to none.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b445-6\" pgmap=\"445\">Appeal from the County Court of La Salle county; the Hon. P. K. Lelaed, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\" pgmap=\"445\">This was an action of deht, originally commenced before a justice of the peace in La Salle county, by the town of Eagle against Thomas Clifford, for an alleged obstruction of a public highway. The cause was removed into the County Court by appeal. At the December Term of that court, 1863, the defendant appeared in the cause and moved for a continuance, which was allowed. At the March Term following, the defendant entered his motion to dismiss the suit for the want of a complaint. The court overruled the motion, and exception was taken. The cause then came on for trial before the court, without a jury.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\" pgmap=\"445\">It was conceded, for the purposes of the trial, that the petition for the road in controversy was posted up according to law, and that the signers were legal voters residing within three miles of the route; that the defendant was present before the supervisors, to whom an appeal had been taken, and had a hearing; that the damages allowed by the supervisors were tendered to the defendant and refused. That sixty days\u2019 notice was duly given him to open his inclosure, and that the commissioners opened the road after the notice expired, by throwing down the fence, and that Clifford replaced the fence in the supposed road, and, afterwards, the defendant received a copy of the following notice, on the 6th day of June, 1863, and did not remove the fence.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-9\" pgmap=\"445\">This is the notice:</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-10\" pgmap=\"445(44) 446(67)\">To Cha/rles Clifford: You are hereby notified that your fence along the east line of the northeast quarter of section fourteen, in township thirty-one, north of range two east of the third P.

The record first set out the prayer for an appeal by Luke Conness, then followed this order of the supervisors:</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\" pgmap=\"447\">An appeal having been made on the 30th day of March, 1852, by Luke Conness, of the town of Eagle, in the said county of La Salle, from the determination of the commissioners of roads in the said town, made on the 6th day of March, 1852, in refusing to lay out a road in said town upon the application of twelve legal voters of said town, residing within three miles of the road so petitioned to be laid out, commencing at the 2sT.

The motion to dismiss being of a dilatory character, should have been entered at the earliest moment.</p> <p id=\"b450-4\" pgmap=\"450\">On the merits of the case the appellant insists there was no sufficient order for the road which it was charged he had obstructed. Going back to the original petition for this road, we find it described thus: \u201c Commencing at the northwest corner of section one in township thirty-one, range two east of the third principal meridian; thence south to the southwest corner of section thirty-six, township thirty-one, range two east of the third principal meridian. An order was prayed for a survey of a road on this route. Then follows a list of the lands, with the owners\u2019 names on the route, and through which the proposed road would run, and among them is the appellant as owner of the east part of section fourteen and the west part of section thirteen.</p> <p id=\"b450-5\" pgmap=\"450\">The commissioners of highways refused to grant the petition, whereupon the petitioners took an appeal to three supervisors of the county to reverse this decision. On a hearing before these supervisors, their order shows, after reciting the application to the commissioners of highways to lay out the road as above described, that the determination of the commissioners in refusing to lay'out said road ought to be reversed, and the supervisors do therefore order and adjudge that the determination of the commissioners be reversed; and they further order that a road be laid out pursuant to the application of Luke Conness, commencing at the northwest corner of section one, township thirty-one (SI) north, range two east of the third principal meridian, and that the width of the road be four rods; the courses whereof according to a plat thereof which we have caused to be made by Joseph H. Wagner, county surveyor of La Salle county, will more fully appear, and which plat is herewith attached and made part hereof. They then assess the damages to some of the owners, and among them to the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b450-6\" pgmap=\"450\">The plat attached and made part of the order of the supervisors, shows the route of a road commencing at the northwest corner of section one, and running south on the sectional lines to the southwest corner of section thirty-six.</p> <p id=\"b450-7\" pgmap=\"450(25) 451(34)\">It is an old and familiar maxim of the law that, &lt;{ that is certain which can be rendered certain.\u201d So of this road, a reference to the plat which is a part of the order establishing the road shows the commencement and end of the road, the course and distance. What more could be desired is not perceived.</p> <p id=\"b451-6\" pgmap=\"451\">It cannot be material to the appellant whether the damages were assessed to all the land owners on the route or not. They were assessed to him; the others may have released their right to damages, or might not, possibly, have been entitled to any.</p> <p id=\"b451-7\" pgmap=\"451\">We cannot but think there was reasonable certainty in the route of this road, and the proceedings to obtain it perfectly regular and legal. Town v. Town of Blackberry, 29 Ill. 137.</p> <p id=\"b451-8\" pgmap=\"451\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b451-9\" pgmap=\"451\">Judgment affirmed*</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
