Young Scammon et al. v. Cornelius Swartwout.</parties><syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-9\" pgmap=\"326\">1. Judgment liens\u2014how created\u2014and of their duration. It is by the statute alone that a lien by judgment exists at all on real estate, and therefore it must be controlled by the statute.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-10\" pgmap=\"326\">2. Seven years is the assigned duration of a lien on real estate, by a judgment rendered in a court of record, and it cannot be extended beyond that period.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-11\" pgmap=\"326\">3. Heirs of a judgment debtor\u2014of their title to the realty as against a judgment creditor, and how they may he divested of their title. Where a judgment debtor dies, the seven years lien having expired, his real estate descends to his heirs-at-law, out of whom the title cannot be divested, except in the mode provided by law, by some proceeding to which they are parties.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-12\" pgmap=\"326\">4. In such case, the judgment creditor may subject the real estate of his debtor in the hands of his heirs, to the satisfaction of his judgment, by proceedings by scire facias to revive the judgment, making the heirs parties, and then upon the judgment of revivor issue an execution and sell the realty.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-13\" pgmap=\"326\">5. But the creditor cannot divest the heirs of their title to realty, acquired under such circumstances, simply by suing out an execution upon the original judgment, upon notice to the administrator, and obtaining a levy and sale under such execution.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-14\" pgmap=\"326\">6. Where such a course is pursued, the execution and all the proceedings under it will be void and of no effect, and, consequently, no valid title could grow up out of them.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-15\" pgmap=\"326(37) 327(57)\">7. Execution\u2014when it may issue upon a judgment, wherein the defendant has died. Section thirty-seven of the chapter in the Revised Statutes, entitled \u201c Judgments and executions,\u201d which provides that execution may issue upon a judgment, notwithstanding the death of the defendant, without first reviving the judgment against his heirs and legal representatives, was designed to apply to cases where there is an administrator or executor of a deceased debtor, and where there is a subsisting lien. In the absence of these elements, the plaintiff is bound to resort to a scire facias.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327\">8. Execution\u2014when it may issue upon a judgment wherein the plaintiff has died. And so of sections forty and forty-one of the same chapter, which provide that the collection of the judgments of courts of record shall not be delayed by reason of the death of the plaintiff, and that the judgment lien created by law shall survive to his executor or administrator. The provisions of these sections were intended to meet cases where the seven years lien has not expired, and only such cases.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-7\" pgmap=\"327\">9. Section forty provides that in case of the death of the judgment creditor, his executor or administrator may cause the letters testamentary or of administration to he recorded in the court in which the judgment exists; after which execution may issue, and proceedings be had thereon, in the name of the executor or administrator, as such, in the same manner it could be done if the judgment existed in the name of the personal representative. If the-seven years lien has not expired, the personal representative may obtain an execution in the manner indicated; but, even if the lien still exists, he cannot have the execution without first having produced and filed his letters testamentary or of administration in the court where the judgment was obtained. This is the condition on which he can obtain an execution in his fiduciary character.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-8\" pgmap=\"327\">10. So an execution cannot be issued at any time, upon one having previously been issued within a year and a day, as was insisted upon the authority of the case of Lampsett v. Whitney, 2 Scam. 441. As a matter of fact, in that case, seven years had not elapsed between the issuing of the alias writ of fieri facias, and the pluries writ which was sought to be quashed, and, therefore, it was not necessary to consider the effect of the act of 1825 which limits the lien of a judgment upon real estate to seven years. Moreover, our statute of limitations, which provides that judgments in a court of record may be revived by scire facias, or an action of debt may be brought thereon within twenty years next after the date of such judgment and not after, would seem to imply that an execution cannot be issued at any time.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-9\" pgmap=\"327\">11. The presumption is, that after the lapse of twenty years, the judgment has been extinguished, and this is rebutted only by bringing an action of debt, or suing out a writ of scire facias. It is not the design of the law to give to a fieri facias more vitality than the judgment on which it issued.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-10\" pgmap=\"327\">12. Pbiobity between judgments, where the lien has expired.

Stat. 348, 349.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-9\" pgmap=\"330\">From these premises we conclude, that the execution under which Eees acquired title to the demanded premises, was regularly issued and levied upon the demanded premises.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-10\" pgmap=\"330\">The levy was made just eleven, months before the judgment of revivor was entered in the proceedings by Swartwout, to revive his judgment against Jenkins, and a sale was made on the Demmond execution, almost ten months before that judgment of revivor; the levy under the Demmond execution was made thirteen months and seventeen days before the levy of the Swartwout execution; and the sale under the Demmond execution was made thirteen months and eleven days before the sale under the Swartwout execution; and the deed to Eees was made more than a year before the deed to Swartwout; so that all the several proceedings had by the parties to the Demmond judgment, were prior, in point of time, to those under the Swartwout judgment; and, we insist, gave Eees the paramount title to the demanded premises, and that Scammon and his co-defendants may defend their possession under that outstanding title.

Bees.</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-11\" pgmap=\"331\">The sdre fadas to revive plaintiff\u2019s judgment was issued before the expiration of twenty years from the recovery of the judgment, and the issuing of this writ a single day within the time saves the bar. Davidson v. Thornton, 7 Bar. 128.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzS\" pgmap=\"331\">The heirs of Thomas Jenkins were named as the defendants in the first and in the alias writ, and there was a return of two nihils, which in a suit or proceeding by sdre fadas is equivalent to a personal service, and gives the court jurisdiction of the person.</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-13\" pgmap=\"331\">The only question therefore is, whether Bees acquired a good title to the property.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-4\" pgmap=\"332\">The judgment under which he claims title was recovered in the Municipal Court of Chicago, April 1Y, 1838;' execution was issued within one year, but the alias execution was not issued until April Y, 1858; it was levied April 8, 1858, and the sale was made under the execution May 5, 1858.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-5\" pgmap=\"332\">I. At the time of the issuing of the alias execution, the judgment was not a lien upon the lot in controversy, even as against the heirs of Jenkins.</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\" pgmap=\"332\">Cm1 statute provides that \u201c all and singular the goods and \u201c chattels, lands, tenements and real estate of every person \u201c against whom any judgment has been or may be hereafter ob- \u201c tained in any court of record, * * * * shall be liable to \u201c be sold upon execution to be issued upon such judgment; and? \u201c the said judgment shall be a lien upon such lands, tenements \u201c and real estate from the last day of the term of the court in \u201c which the same may be rendered, for the period of semen yearns, \u201cprovided, that execution be issued at any time within one year \u201c on such judgment; and from and after the said seven years the \u201c same shall cease to be a lien on any real estate, as against bona \u201cfide purchasers, or subsequent incumbrancers, by mortgage, \u201cjudgment or otherwise.\u201d Scates\u2019 Comp., 602, \u00a7 1.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\" pgmap=\"332\">The judgment lien upon lands is conferred by statute alone, and not as \u00aba common law right; it can only attach and become effective in the mode, at the time, and upon the conditions and limitations imposed by the statute itself. Green v. Marks et al., 25 Ill. 223.</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\" pgmap=\"332\">The period for which the statute makes the judgment a lien upon lands is seven years, and the statute nowhere says that it shall be a lien after that period. It provides, it is true, that from and after seven years it shall cease to be a lien as against bona fide purchasers, &amp;c., but it does not provide that it shall not then cease to be a lien as against the judgment debtor and his heirs. As this lien is conferred by the statute alone, and the statute does not say that it shall exist for a longer period than seven yea/rs, it cannot be considered as existing beyond that time.</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-9\" pgmap=\"332(12) 333(94)\">The provision of the Hew York statute limiting the lien of a judgment as to subsequent purchasers, &amp;c., is in the language of our statute, except that the period is ten instead of seven years; and in that State it is held that the lien continues after ten years as against the judgment debtor. But the New York statute creating the lien of the judgment does not at all limit its duration, except as to subsequent purchasers or incumbrancers. It merely binds the real estate of the debtor by the hen of the judgment, without fixing the time for the continuance of such lien.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-5\" pgmap=\"333\">The judgment lien having expired during the lifetime of Demmond, the plaintiff in the judgment, it could not survive in favor of the executrix of Demmond so as to entitle her to sue out execution. Scates\u2019 Comp., p. 610, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 41.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\" pgmap=\"333\">The judgment lien having expired during the lifetime of Thomas Jenkins, the property in question descended to his heirs unaffected by the judgment, and could not have been taken from them except by a proceeding to which they were parties to revive the lien of the judgment. Turney et al. v. Young, 22 Ill. 253.</p><p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\" pgmap=\"333\">Even if Thomas Jenkins were living, the land in question could not have been sold upon the execution after the lien of the judgment had expired.</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-8\" pgmap=\"333\">The execution is merely instrumental in enforcing the lien of a judgment already acquired. The execution and levy of it does not create a new and additional lien, independent of and distinct from that of the judgment, and when the execution issues and is levied in the lifetime of the judgment, by the expiration of the lien of the judgment the lien of the execution is gone. Davis v. Ehrman, 20 Penn. (8 Harris), 256; Jameson's Appeal, 6 Barr. 280; Roe v. Stewart, 5 Cow. 294.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-9\" pgmap=\"333(68) 334(46)\">The chancellor, in Catlin, v. Jackson, 8 Johns. 427, says: \u201cIn several essentials the effect of the execution must be dif- \u201c ferent from a fi. fa. levied on personal estate only. The \u201c delivery of the fi. fa. gives no new rights to the plaintiff, \u201c and vests no new interests. The general lien is created by \u201cthe judgment, and execution is merely to give that lien \u201c effect, not by vesting a possessory right to the land affected \u201c by it in the plaintiff, but by designating it for a conversion \u201c into money by the operation of the fi. fa., and the act of the \u201c sheriff by virtue of it.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\" pgmap=\"334\">II. If the lien of the judgment continued after the expiration of seven years as against the judgment debtor, the sale under the execution upon the judgment did not take place until the 8th of May, 1858, more than twenty years after the judgment was recovered.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-7\" pgmap=\"334\">By the fifth section of an act entitled limitations, the remedy by action of debt upon the judgment, and by scire facias, is cut off, by the lapse of twenty years from its date. The statute does not say that no execution shall issue after the twenty years, but it says that a scire facias, which is simply an order to show cause why the plaintiff should not have execution of the judgment, shall not issue after that time. This is in effect a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to have execution of his judgment after the lapse of twenty years from its date. It is not only an extinguishment of the judgment lien, but an effectual bar to every remedy upon the judgment. If the plaintiff can at any distance of time cause execution to be issued upon his judgment, the above provision of our statute can be very easily evaded, and its effect as a limitation be entirely defeated. The statute is confined to judgments recovered in the courts of record in this State, and such a court can issue its execution to any county in this State, and as there is no way of pleading to a fi. fa.j the judgment debtor would be without the power of availing himself of the benefit intended to be conferred by this statute.</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\" pgmap=\"334\">The only way of allowing this statute to have the effect intended by the legislature, is not only to regard the lien of the judgment as gone, after the lapse of twenty years, but the judgment itself as having been paid, unless, in the meantime, the bar has been saved by the instituting of an action of debt, or a proceeding by sci. fa. to revive the judgment.</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-9\" pgmap=\"334(21) 335(13)\">The judgment cannot be revived, nor its lien continued or prolonged, by the mere issuing and levy of an execution. Roe v. Stewart, 5 Cow. 294; Davis v. Ehrman, 20 Penn. (8 Harris) 256.</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\" pgmap=\"335\">III. If the lien of the Eees judgment continued after the lapse of seven years, as against Jenkins and his heirs, so also did the lien of the judgment under which the plaintiff claims title, and the lien of both judgments having expired as to bona fide purchasers and subsequent incumbrancers in April, 1845, from and after that time they ranked in respect to each other accord/ing to their \u00a1priority of date, the same as if the provision limiting the lien to seven years as to subsequent purchasers and incumbrancers, had not been passed. This was distinctly held in the case of the Peru Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540, 559.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\" pgmap=\"335\">Plaintiff\u2019s judgment was the older judgment, and the sale under the junior judgment did not defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to sell under his judgment, and thereby get a complete title to the property.

When the \u25a0 statute provides that a-lien of a judgment shall cease at the eviration of five years from the date of its recovery, the issuing of the sci. fa. a single day within the time, preserves and continues the lien of the judgment. Davidson v. Thornton, 7 Barr. 128. The issuing of the writ being a continuation of the' original suit, it is a continuation of it specifically against the lands which have descended, and upon which the judgment obtained in that suit was a lien, for by the writ, the heirs and tenants are required to show cause why the land, a particular description of which is set forth in the writ, should not be held to satisfy the judgment. The court has jurisdiction by virtue of the original suit. Ho personal service of the writ is necessary, as two nihils are equivalent to a personal service; and the final order of the court names the property which is mentioned in the writ, and directs that the judgment stand revived in respect to this property, and that the same be sold to satisfy it. It is therefore a proceeding in rem., and the judgment reviving the former judgment must take effect by relation from the time the writ issues, at least as against subsequent purchasers or incumbrancers.-</p><p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-8\" pgmap=\"336\">As to them-it is Us pendens, and rights acquired after these proceedings are commenced must be subordinate to them. -</p> <opinion data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b336-9\" pgmap=\"336\">Mr. Justice Beeese</author> <p id=\"Arh\" pgmap=\"336\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b336-10\" pgmap=\"336(32) 337(50)\">This case is brought to.this court on .the following agreed state of facts: It is agreed that both parties derive title to the demanded premises from Thomas Jenkins, who was the, owner in fee of the premises in 1837, and remained such owner until his death, August 2,1852.

Demmond recovered a judgment, in the Hunicipal Court of the city of Chicago, against said Thomas Jenkins, impleaded with Reynolds &amp; Gilbert, April 17th, 1838, for the sum of $828.00; .that an execution issued upon that judgment, dated January 14th, 1839; that Demmond died in Will county, Illinois, July 18th, 1854, and his widow, Sophia Demmond, was duly appointed executrix of his last will and testament, August 17th, 1854; that she assigned the judgment in favor of her husband, to James H. Rees, April 2, 1858, who made affidavit of Jenkins\u2019 death; that he died intestate, leaving no heirs in this State, and had no executors or administrators of his estate in this State; and prayed for a special execution to issue against this lot in controversy; that execution issued, as prayed for, April 7th, 1858, was levied on the premises in question, April 8th, 1858; sold May 5th, 1858, and a sheriff\u2019s deed made of them to Eees, August 9th, 1859.</p> <p id=\"b341-6\" pgmap=\"341\">That defendant, Scammon, was in possession of the premises at the commencement of this suit, and sets up the deed to Eees as an outstanding title, to defeat a recovery by the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b341-7\" pgmap=\"341\">All the foregoing facts appear of record in the Circuit Court of Cook county, and Municipal Court, Eecord Ho. 1017.</p> <p id=\"b341-8\" pgmap=\"341\">Upon the foregoing facts, the court found the issues for the plaintiff, and rendered judgment in his favor.

Demmond against Thomas Jenkins, on the 17th of April, 1838.</p> <p id=\"b341-13\" pgmap=\"341\">It is to this branch of the case, the defendant\u2019s title, we will confine our view.</p> <p id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">It is contended by the counsel defending this title, that the execution under which Bees purchased, was regularly issued and levied upon the premises. If this be so, the defendant\u2019s case is made out. What are the facts and the law, on this point ?</p> <p id=\"b342-6\" pgmap=\"342\">The judgment in favor of Demmond was rendered April 17th, 1838, and execution issued thereon, January 14th, 1839. .Demmond died in Will county on the 18th of July, 1854. The execution under which defendant claims, was issued April 7th, 1858, levied on the demanded premises April 8th, 1858, sold Hay 5th, 1858, and a sheriff\u2019s deed executed to Bees August 9th, 1859.</p> <p id=\"b342-7\" pgmap=\"342\">The first question arising is, was the judgment of Demmond, at the time the alias execution issued, April 7, 1858, a lien upon the premises in controversy. This is to be determined by reference to our statute on judgments and executions. Oh. 57.</p> <p id=\"b342-8\" pgmap=\"342\">The first section of that statute provides, that all and singular the goods and chattels, lands, tenements and real estate of every person against whom any judgment has been obtained in any court of record, for any debt, damages, &amp;c., shall be liable to be sold upon execution to be issued on such judgment. And the said judgment shall be a lien on such lands, &amp;c., from the last day of the term of the court in which it is rendered for the period of seven years, provided that execution be issued at any time within one year on such judgment, and from and after the said seven years, the same shall cease to be a lien on any real estate as against iona fide purchasers, or subsequent incumbrancers by mortgage, judgment or otherwise. Scates\u2019 Comp. 602.</p> <p id=\"b342-9\" pgmap=\"342\">It is by this statute alone that a lien by judgment exists at all on real estate, and, therefore, it must be controlled by the statute. Seven years is the assigned duration of a lien on real estate, by a judgment rendered in a court of record, and it cannot be extended beyond that period. Demmond, then, lost his lien after the expiration of seven years, and so did Swartwout, the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b343-5\" pgmap=\"343\">How then do the subsequent proceedings affect the parties ? By the death of Jenkins, the judgment debtor, his real estate descended to his heirs-at-law, out of whom the title could not be divested except in the mode provided by law, by some proceeding to which they should be parties. That mode was pursued by Swartwout, who caused a scire facias to issue, in apt time, against the heirs-at-law of Jenkins, and against the terre tenants of his lands, and a judgment of revivor was obtained against them, and a regular execution and sale under it to the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">What was the course pursued by the claimant under the Demmond judgment? The lien was gone, the plaintiff was dead, and letters testamentary had issued to his executrix, who assigned the judgment to Bees. In such cases, what does the statute above cited provide ? By section 40, it is declared the collection of judgments of courts of record shall not be delayed or hindered by the death of the plaintiff or person in whose name the judgment shall exist, but the executor or administrator may cause the letters testamentary or of administration to be recorded in the court in which the judgment exists, after which, execution may issue and proceedings be had thereon in the name of the executor, &amp;e., as such, in the same manner that could or might be done or had, if the judgment exists and remains in the name, &amp;c., of the executor, &amp;c., in his or her capacity as such executor, &amp;c. Section 41 provides that the lien created by law on property shall not abate or cease by reason of the death of any plaintiff, but the same shall survive in favor of the executor, &amp;c., of the testator, whose duty it shall be to have the judgment enforced in manner aforesaid. Scates\u2019 Comp. 610.</p> <p id=\"b343-7\" pgmap=\"343(79) 344(14)\">It is very manifest from these sections that these provisions are intended to meet cases where the seven years lien has not expired, and only such cases. If it was such a ease, then the party did not proceed according to this statute, to enable an execution to issue in favor of the executrix. Here letters testamentary were not produced to be filed in the court where the judgment was obtained. This is the condition on which she could obtain an execution in her fiduciary character as executrix, if a lien existed.</p> <p id=\"b344-6\" pgmap=\"344\">The appellant, however, insists, that an execution having once issued within a year and a day, an alias could issue at any time thereafter. Reference is made, in support of this position, to several authorities, and among them to the ease of Lampsett v. Whitney, 2 Scam. 441. In that case, as a matter of fact, seven years had not elapsed between the time of the issuing of the alias writ of fieri facias, and the plv/ries writ which was sought to be quashed, and it was not necessary, therefore, to consider the effect of the act of 1825, which fixed the limit to the lien of a judgment on real estate to seven years. Sess. Laws, 1825, p. 151. The cases decided in other States to which reference is made, are presumed to have been decided in the absence of any such statute as ours and of any limitation law. By the fifth section of our limitation act, ch. 66, it is provided, that judgments in a court of record may be revived by scire facias, or an action of debt may be brought thereon, within twenty years next after the date of such judgment and not after. Scates\u2019 Comp. 751. This legislation would seem to imply that an execution cannot, as is contended, be issued at any time. If it could issue at any time, whence the necessity of such a provision ? The presumption is, that after the lapse of twenty years, the judgment has been extinguished, and this is rebutted only by bringing an action of debt, or suing out a writ of scire facias; under either of these proceedings, every legitimate defense could be made, but not under a fi. fa. It would be absurd to suppose the law designed to give to a fi. fa. more vitality than the judgment on which it issued.</p> <p id=\"b344-7\" pgmap=\"344(78) 345(68)\">The claimant under the assignment of the Demmond judgment, did not, as we have observed, pursue the requirements of section forty, nor could the executrix enforce the judgment in the mode the assignee adopted. Section forty-one provides expressly the judgment shall be enforced by the executor, in the mode pointed out in section forty, by producing for record the letters testamentary in the court wherein the judgment was rendered. Section thirty-seven of this act, was designed to apply to cases where there was an administrator or executor of a deceased debtor, and where there was a subsisting lien. In the absence of these elements, the executrix was bound to resort to a sci. fa. And so of sections forty and forty-one,\u2014they apply to the same kind of judgments the lien whereof had not expired. Such was the case of Durham v. Heaton, 28 Ill. 264.</p> <p id=\"b345-6\" pgmap=\"345\">The execution on the Demmond judgment, and all the proceedings under it, were void and of no effect, and consequently no valid title could grow up out of them.</p> <p id=\"b345-7\" pgmap=\"345\">The premises, on the expiration of the lien, became the property of the heirs-at-law, unaffected by the judgment, of which they could not be deprived by any proceeding to which they were not a party. Turney et al. v. Young, 22 Ill. 253. They were not parties to the proceedings consequent upon the Demmond judgment, and are not bound by them.</p> <p id=\"b345-8\" pgmap=\"345\">The lien of both these judgments having expired in April, 1845, as to bona fide purchasers and subsequent incumbrancers, what priority, if any, existed between them ? In the case Ex parte The Penn Iron Company, 5 Cow. 540, it was held, where several judgments were of more than ten years\u2019 standing, which is the limit of judgment liens in Hew York, the judgments rank in relation to one another, according to their actual priority of date. To the same effect is the case of Rogers v. Dickey, decided by this court, 1 Gilm. 636. The judgment of plaintiff below being first in date, would be entitled to priority, but this point need not be discussed or decided, as in our judgment the execution and proceedings under it through which the defendant claims title are, for the reasons we have given, a nullity.</p> <p id=\"b345-9\" pgmap=\"345\">We see nothing wanting in the proceedings of the plaintiff on his judgment to make them regular.</p> <p id=\"b345-10\" pgmap=\"345\">Judgment afirme!.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
