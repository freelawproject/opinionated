J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ARH\">Defendant appeals from County Court convictions of uttering loud and offensive language in public <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:170-29(1)) and of disturbing a place of assembly <em>(N. J. S. </em>A. 2AA70-28). He received concurrent 30-day jail sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">On Pebruary 7, 1969 defendant \u2022 attended a high school basketball game, anticipating some form of confrontation between black students and the administration, and intent on obtaining pictures and tape recordings of the events. During the pre-game activities the mayor announced that if anyone should show disrespect for the flag by refusing to stand during the national anthem, spectators would be barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>future sports events. Defendant shouted that it was illegal and unconstitutional to force anyone to stand during the ceremonies. He admits that disputes immediately flared up between himself and nearby spectators. At this point a plainclothes detective mounted the bleachers and sat next to defendant. The detective testified that nearby fans had requested defendant to be quiet; they wanted to watch the game, and some of them began to move away and express displeasure with defendant\u2019s mouthings. Defendant then gestured obscenely and loudly uttered a lewd chant: \u201c-\u25a0, -, Gestapo, -,--patently indecent language which need not be reproduced here. The detective then arrested defendant and quietly led him out of the gymnasium.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Defendant was charged as a disorderly person for uttering loud and offensive language in public, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :170~ 29(1), and for disturbing a place of assembly, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:17Q-28. After conviction in the municipal court, the matter was appealed to the County Court where, after a trial, the judge found defendant guilty on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">On appeal defendant contends that the conviction under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A\u00a1170-28 was erroneous both because the factual context of the ease is not covered by that statute and because his conduct is protected by the \u201cfree speech\u201d provisions of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\"><em>N. J. </em>8. <em>A. </em>2A:170\u201428 defines a disorderly person as anyone who \u201c'by noisy or disorderly conduct disturbs or interferes with the quiet or good order of any place of assembly, public or private, including schools, churches, libraries and reading rooms * * The arresting officer testified that defendant was making obscene gestures, uttering obscene language, and visibly disturbing the nearby spectators. An accompanying officer testified that numerous persons moved away from defendant. Defendant denied creating a disturbance, but the trial judge found sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Defendant first urges that the conviction violates his constitutional right to free speech. He argues that the offending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>conduct must have been his initial retort to the mayor and, relying on <em>Garner v. Louisiana, </em>368 <em>U. S. </em>157, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>348, 7 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 307 (1961), contends that the State may act to limit speech only in the narrowest of circumstances. We are not concerned with what he said then, but with his obscene language and gestures that followed after the game began \u2014 the real nub of the disorderly person charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"> While it must be conceded that the State may not unreasonably restrict personal freedoms \u25a0\u2014 see, for example, <em>State v. Caez, </em>81 <em>N. J. Super. </em>315 (App. Div. 1963) \u2014 it is equally apparent that the State may protect its citizens, in the exercise of their right to peaceable assembly, from riotous or potentially dangerous disturbances. In any event, the long line of cases attempting to delineate the permissible limits of restriction are neither consistent in theory nor particularly reconcilable in practice. Moreover, it might here be noted that defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Garner </em>is misplaced, for the holding in that case, a conviction of sit-in demonstrators for \u201cbreach of the peace,\u201d rested on the lack of adduced evidence that any \u201cdisturbance\u201d had in fact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In <em>State v. Smith, </em>46 <em>N. </em>J. 510 (1966), <em>cert. </em>den. 385 <em>U. S. </em>838, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>85, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>3d 71 (1966), the court, after distinguishing boisterous behavior at a public meeting from the southern sit-in cases, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">* * * Callender was not denied a chance to be heard. Rather he was denied a right he seemingly claimed to interfere with the right of others to hear and be heard. He was not ordered removed because he expressed views which displeased the presiding officer. He was ordered out because, in response to the president\u2019s call for quiet, he threatened even greater disruption of this public meeting. Whether the forum be the courtroom or the chamber of the legislature itself or of a political subdivision of the State, there must be order. It is frivolous to suggest the First Amendment stands in the way of that imperative, [at 516-517]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">While it is obviously less forceful to argue that \u201corder\u201d must be maintained at a basketball game, surely the municipality is entitled to exercise some degree of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>visory control over the more disruptive elements at an interscholastic event. We find that the State presented sufficient competent and credible evidence to indicate that the <em>totality </em>of defendant\u2019s conduct in the bleachers was loud, offensive, disruptive and disturbing to the neighboring spectators. Certainly, the constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom of speech do not extend to intemperate and intentional offensiveness which impinges on the rights of others. Moreover, defendant\u2019s conviction under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-28 does not rest so much on what he said or on when he chose to say it, but rather on the allegedly abusive and disruptive character of his intentional outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Alternatively, defendant argues that the general factual circumstances of the case \u2014 the physical setting \u2014 do not come within the ambit of the statute. To that end defendant argues that the character of the meeting \u2014\u2022 a sporting event \u2014 was such that loud outbursts were to be expected and even encouraged. Therefore, it is urged, his outburst was neither disruptive nor unusual within the context of this \u201cassembly.\u201d Accordingly, defendant would restrict the application of the statute to situations where solemnity or parliamentary order was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> The statute speaks of \u201cany place of assembly, public or private.\u201d It is established that the interpretation of what constitutes the \u201cquiet and good order\u201d of any gathering will depend on the character of the assembly. <em>State v. Smith, </em>above, 46 <em>N. J., </em>at 519. It is further apparent that government may impose a semblance of decorum, suitable to the given circumstances, in order to avert disorder. See <em>United States v. Woodward, </em>376 <em>F. </em>2d 136 (7 Cir. 1967), In any event, our Supreme Court has clearly stated that the application of the statute is not limited to the few examples listed in the enactment, but rather is to be applied generally to any assembly, although, as noted, the permissible limits of conduct will depend on the nature of the meeting. <em>State v. Smith, </em>above, 46 <em>N. J. </em>at 515, 519. Surely, it cannot be contended, merely because a basketball <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>game is more noisy in nature than a legislative assembly, that spectators at the former may engage in unbridled behavior regardless of its effect on other persons in attendance. Thus, while the relative measure of \u201cquiet or good order\u201d is plainly to be tailored to the peculiar circumstances of the meeting, the statute, as noted, applies to <em>\u201cany </em>place of assembly, public or private.\u201d Moreover, sufficient evidence was adduced to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s conduct was disruptive and disturbing to other persons attempting to view the game. Additionally, it might be observed that, unlike the case of a public hearing, defendant\u2019s actions herein were wholly unrelated, and in fact contrary, to the intended activity \u2014 a sporting event \u2014 and his outbursts tended to interfere with other persons\u2019 ability to watch the activities. See <em>State v. </em>Smith, above, at 515-516, 519. According^, the statute is patently intended to apply to the instant case, among others, and defendant\u2019s \u201cspeech\u201d was not herein protected from reasonable limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Defendant next argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case should have been granted as to both charges because no <em>prima facie </em>case had been proved. More particularly, as to the charge of disturbing an assembly, he urges that the lack of specificity as to the proofs and as to the potential and inherent \u201cdanger\u201d of his conduct was fatal to the State\u2019s case. Equally, as to the loud and offensive language charge, he argues that there was no proof that the utterance was \u201cloud\u201d \u2014 only that it was profane.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">To satisfy the requisite elements of proof under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-28, it must be established that the accused's conduct was disruptive of an assembly of persons. See <em>State v. Moore, </em>101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>419 (App. Div. 1968). While no nearby spectators testified that they had been disturbed by defendant\u2019s rantings, both police officers testified that defendant\u2019s actions were causing a disturbance. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant was disorderly and that his conduct, \u201cforeign to the nature and purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tlxc assembly,\u201d did disrupt the proceedings. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>above, at 516-517, 519. As to the relative weight to be accorded to the conflicting testimony, it is best left to the trier of fact to adjudge the credibility of the respective witnesses. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 13 (App. Div. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">With regard to the loud and offensive language charge, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170\u201429 (1), it is incumbent upon the State to establish that the offending utterance was both loud <em>and </em>indecent or offensive. See <em>Mullen v. State, </em>67 <em>N. J. L. </em>451 (Sup. Ct. 1902); <em>State v. Griffin, </em>92 <em>N. J. Super. </em>389 (App. Div. 1966). The language defendant uttered (\u201c-\u2022, -\u2022, Gestapo,--, -\u201d), with accompanying gestures, clearly breaches the common limits of decent speech, and the arresting officer testified that defendant uttered the mindless chant in a loud, if not shouting, voice. As to defendant\u2019s free speech argument, it has been held that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and that the statute of prohibition is a valid exercise of the police power. <em>State v. Bullis, </em>79 <em>N. J. Super. </em>221, 232 (App. Div. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b479-10\">Matthews, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">(dissenting in part). I dissent from the majority opinion insofar as it sustains defendant\u2019s conviction under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">In <em>State v. Smith, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>510 (1966), <em>cert. </em>den. 385 <em>U. S. </em>838, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>85, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 71 (1966), the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">The statute before us meets the constitutional demand. It speaks of \u201cnoisy or disorderly conduct\u201d which \u201cdisturbs or interferes with the quiet or good order\u201d of \u201cany place of assembly, public or private.\u201d Surely, a man of ordinary intelligence knows the council chamber at the time of a public hearing is a public \u201cplace of assembly.\u201d So, too, such a man knows the \u201cquiet or good order\u201d of a place depends upon the nature and the purpose and the needs of the meeting. He also knows a legislative chamber from a barroom or a ball park and knows what kind of behavior comports with each. (46 <em>N. J., </em>at 519)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Defendant was convicted of uttering loud and offensive language in public under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-29(1), and the record, I am satisfied, supports that conviction. The same record, however, cannot support a finding that defendant\u2019s conduct disturbed or interfered with the \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201cgood order\u201d of a high school basketball game. There is no evidence, save the statements of the police that a few spectators moved from defendant\u2019s immediate area, to show that defendant disturbed or interfered with anybody. He submitted to arrest quietly. Ho spectator was produced at trial to support the State\u2019s claim of defendant\u2019s disruptive conduct, except those who testified on defendant\u2019s behalf contrary to the State\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><em>N. J.'S. A. </em>2A:170-28 does not embrace the disruption and disturbance of a few individuals among many at an assembly. It seeks to preserve the \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201cgood order\u201d of a gathering, considering, as was held in <em>Smith, </em>above, the nature of such gathering. Defendant\u2019s conduct fell far short, in my judgment, of violating the spirit and letter of the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
