J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">This appeal arises out of negligence litigation following a collision between a car being driven south on Crows Mill R'oad in Fords and a car parked on the easterly side of the road. Plaintiffs Sas, the driver, and Drahos, his passenger, sue the defendant Strelecki, as Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles, and Drahos\u2019 complaint joins Sas as a party defendant. Defendant Director is sued under the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Act provision authorizing such suit in \u201chit and run\u201d cases. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6-78. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention at trial was that while they were traveling late at night a light-colored car came at theirs from the opposite direction and on the wrong side of the road, and that Sas swerved to the left to avoid it and in so doing collided with the parked car. The owner of that car is not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The main issue on appeal is the admissibility of an investigating police officer\u2019s testimony as to statements made to him at the scene of the accident by Sas, Drahos and a local resident, Mrs. Alliegro, and, in relation to the latter, of the admissibility of the officer\u2019s official report of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Called by Drabos as his first witness, the officer testified he arrived at the scene between five and ten minutes after receiving a radio signal to go to the scene. Over objection c\u00a3 the defendant the officer was allowed to state what Sas and Mrs. Alliegro (and, impliedly, Drahos) had told him as to how the accident happened. His account, practically identical with his official report, from which he apparently read, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">Q. Officer, what did they tell you as to how this accident happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfC\">A. Driver of vehicle number two [Sas] stated he was travelling south on Crows Mill Road when an unidentified car travelling north on Crows Mill Road swerved into his path forcing him to pul] his steering wheel and causing him to strike [the parked car] which was legally parked at the curb. He stated further that had he not swerved the unidentified vehicle would have hit him. head on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">Q. Officer, is there anything else contained in your report with regard to his statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">A. Yes, sir, there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">Q. Will you finish your report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">A. He told me that the vehicle, that the unidentified vehicle was a 1968 White Chevrolet, and after he hit the parked car, the Chevy picked up speed and left the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">\u2756 ::= * * \u00ed\u00a1f Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">Q. What did the witness tell you with regard to the happening of the accident or with regard to her observations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">* # # * * * * <em>* </em>A. The information given to me by [Sas] and his passenger was backed up by a witness [Mrs. Alliegro] who told me the same thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-14\">The trial judge admitted this testimony over objection because Sas, Drahos and Mrs. Alliegro were going to testify and because \u201cI think the jury should have the benefit of the comparison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Sas, called as a witness by Drahos, and Drahos himself gave testimony as to the accident substantially as recounted in the statements they gave the police officer and set forth above. Mrs. Alliegro testified that she heard the crash outside her door, looked out and saw the \u201clight\u201d car on the wrong side of road. \u201cHe hesitated, like he was going to stop and then he took off.\u201d On cross-examination Mrs. Alliegro admitted having signed a statement for an investigator to the effect that \u201c[b]oth cars were in the same direction toward Hew Brunswick Ave\u201d (south). In rebuttal, over objection, Drahos was permitted to offer in evidence the entitrety of the police report as containing a \u201cprior consistent statement\u201d by Mrs. Alliegro, purportedly to rehabilitate her testimony on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The jury by a 10-2 vote found for Sas and Drahos against defendant and for Sas in Drahos\u2019 action against Sas. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. Only defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Plaintiffs first offer defense of the admission of the statements given the police officer as spontaneous statements by the declarants and therefore exceptions to the hearsay evidence rfile. It is clear that this was not the basis for admission of the statements by the trial court. Under <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(4) the declarant must be shown to have been \u201cunder the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception [of the event which the statement describes or explains], in reasonable proximity to the event, and without opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u201d The police officer said he arrived at the scene five or ten minutes after receiving the call on the radio. Considering the probable lapse in time between the accident and the call to police headquarters and the detailed explanation of the accident to the officer by the occupants of the Sas car, it is highly unlikely that the requirement of unreflective spontaneity is satisfied. See <em>Rogalsky v. Plymouth Homes, Inc., </em>100 <em>N. J. Super. </em>501, 504 (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 52 <em>N. J. </em>167 (1968); <em>Fagan v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Newark, </em>78 <em>N. J. Super. </em>294, 303-304 (App. Div. 1963). We will not as an appellate court find these to be spontaneous statements particularly when the trial court has not so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Justification is next argued for the admissibility of the statements under the exception to the hearsay evidence rule constituted by <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(13)\u2014\u201cBusiness entries.\u201d Preliminarily, the offer of the statements and the ruling thereon were not made on the theory of a business entry but simply as declarations to the officer at the scene of the accident. Only during the course of the development of this evidence did it appear that the officer was reading his official report. As statements, the declarations were inadmissible hearsay. As to Sas, the statement was a self-serving one, with the prejudicial vice of buttressing his consistent in-court testimony to follow. Although the testimony was adduced by Drahos, a nominal adversary of Sas, the trial strategy of both these plaintiffs was to pin sole blame for the accident on the \u201clight\u201d car and thereby hold the defendant Director responsible. Sas\u2019 statement was therefore not competent under the \u201cadmissions\u201d exception, <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(7), and Drahos has not so argued either at trial or on appeal. (He filed a letter on appeal subscribing to Sas\u2019 brief). Nor does the statement to the officer by Drahos (implied from the officer\u2019s testimony) qualify under any exception to the hearsay evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">As to the officer\u2019s testimonial version of what Mrs. Alliegro told him, it is obvious from the foregoing quotation from the testimony that he merely summarized her communication to him in conelusory form. This was doubly objectionable. <em>Cf. Brown v. Mortimer, </em>100 <em>N. J. Super. </em>395, 405-406 (App. Div. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that since the officer had practically read his report into evidence, his testimony should be evaluated for admissibility as though it were the report which had itself been directly received in evidence, and considering plaintiff\u2019s argument that it was admissible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the business entry exception to the hearsay evidence rule, we find the contention to lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The crucial portion of <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(13) (business entries) here involved is \u201cif the sources of information from which it [the writing] was made and the method and circumstances of its preparation were such as to justify its admission.\u201d The language is not essentially different from the comparable part of former Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:82-35, which <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(13) replaced as of September 11, 1967. The purpose and proper interpretation of the new provision is substantially the same as the old. <em>Brown v. Mortimer, supra, </em>100 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at 403. It was held that the Uniform Act reposed \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in the trial judge in passing upon whether the sources of information, method and time of preparation of a business entry justified its admission into evidence. <em>Mahoney v. Minsky, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>208, 218 (1963). However, the Supreme Court has been firm in following the general requirement of the business entry exception to the hearsay evidence rule that where the business entry consists of information supplied the entrant by another, the informant must be shown to have been under a business duty\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to supply honest information to the entrant \u2014 that being the heart of the rationale of the exception. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>316, 330-331 (1966); <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Taylor v. New Jersey, </em>385 <em>U. S. </em>885, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>103, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 83 (1966). Because of the absence of any such business duty to \u25a0tell the truth on the part of the informant, the statement included in the business record (a hospital record) involved in <em>Taylor </em>was held to have been admitted erroneously and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>prejudicially. Apparently to the same effect is <em>State v. Gardner, </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>444, 461-462 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Among other authorities cited in <em>Taylor </em>in support of the position there taken was the leading New York decision of <em>Johnson v. Lutz, </em>253 <em>N. Y. </em>124, 170 <em>N. E. </em>517 (Ct. App. 1930), decided under the Model of Commonwealth Fund Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> version of the business entry rule. That case sustained the exclusion of a filed police report concerning an accident between a motorcycle and a truck founded upon information received by the officer from bystanders at the scene. The ground of exclusion was the absence of any duty on the part of the persons supplying the information to the officer analogous to the duty of persons supplying information to the makers of business entries\u2014a duty underlying the rationale of this exception to the hearsay evidence rule (170 <em>N. E., </em>at 518-519).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In <em>Fagan v. Newark, supra, </em>also cited by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Taylor, supra, </em>as authoritative in connection with the point under discussion, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">Where, however, the informant to the entrant of the record is under no duty to anyone to make a truthful account of the facts thus recorded, the record will not be admissible as proof of such facts. <em>Johnson v. Lutz, </em>253, <em>N. Y. </em>124, 170 <em>N. E. </em>517 (Ct. App. 1930) (report of policeman as to accident based on information from bystander witnesses; decided under Model xVct; leading case). Aside from Wigmore<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, no competent authority in the field and few courts have dissented from this qualification obviously basic to the rationale of the business entry exception. See <em>McCormick, op cit., </em>\u00a7 286, <em>pp. </em>602, 603; McCormick, <em>\u2018'Hearsay,\u2019\u2019 </em>10 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>620, 629, 630 (1956) ; <em>Maguire, Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law, op. cit., </em>at <em>p. </em>159; \u201cRevised Business Entry Statutes: Theory and Practice,\u201d <em>op. cit. </em>(48 <em>Colum. L. Rev., </em>at <em>p. </em>927). Illustrative cases are <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>166 <em>F. </em>2d 863 (2 Cir. 1948; <em>per Learned </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Hand, J.) </em>; <em>Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey v. Jules S. Sottnek Co., </em>258 <em>F. </em>2d So (2 Cir. 1958) ; <em>United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>89 <em>F. Supp. </em>349 (D. Ct. Mass. 1950). But see <em>Moran v. Pitishurgh-DesMoines Steel Co., </em>183 <em>F. </em>2d 467 (3 Cir. 1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">See the able and comprehensive discussion of this question in <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc., </em>249 <em>F. Supp. </em>681 (S. D. N. Y. 1965), in accord with the view here taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We thus conclude that the statements to the police officer made by Sas, Drahos and Mrs. Alliegro were not rendered admissible on the theory of incorporation in a business record because they were not under any \u2018business duty\u201d to render a truthful account of the accident to the officer. See also <em>Rogalsky v. Plymouth Homes, supra, </em>100 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at 506. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon the recent decision in <em>Schneiderman v. Strelecki, </em>107 <em>N. J. Super, </em>113 (App. Div. 1969), certif. den. 55 <em>N. J. </em>163 (1969), does not affect our conclusion. Since the court there reversed on other grounds, its remarks as to the admissibility of the police report were not essential, and, indeed, the court indicated that if at the retrial the statement of plaintiff to the officer recorded in his report were found to be a self-serving narrative of past events rather than a spontaneous declaration, it should be excluded. The point of absence of \u2018business duty\u201d of the declarant to relate an honest account of the occurrence to the entrant was not considered in the opinion of the court in <em>Schneiderman, </em>and the decision in <em>State v. Taylor, supra, </em>is of course controlling on us in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em> We </em>further hold that Drahos did not have the right to offer the police officer\u2019s report as containing a \u201cprior consistent statement\u201d of Mrs. Alliegro to rehabilitate her testimony in chief after the attack upon her credibility on cross-examination through her prior inconsistent statement. See <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 49, at 108 (1954). The rule is that such a prior consistent statement is admissible only where the nature of the attack upon the credibility of the witness tends to show that his testimony is a fabrication of recent date. <em>Evidence Rule </em>20. And see <em>State v. Neiman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>341, 344 (Sup. Ct. 1939), aff\u2019d o. b. 124 <em>N. J. L. </em>562 (E. &amp;A. 1940). It is doubtful that the necessary foundation was laid here. The problem was certainly not recognized at trial. In any event, no particular statement of Mrs. Alliegro is set forth in the officer\u2019s report \u2014 merely the officer\u2019s conclusion that she told him \u201cthe same thing\u201d as Sas and Drahos. Actually, her testimony in chief did not amount to the \u201csame thing,\u201d for she admitted she never saw the accident itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Pinal!y, plaintiffs argue that the admission, in effect, of the police report was harmless because the authors of the statements to the officer contained therein were present in court, did testify and were subject to cross-examination. They cite in support <em>Juaire v. Nardin, </em>395 <em>F. </em>2d 373 (2 Cir. 1968), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Juaire v. Marshak, </em>393 <em>U. S. </em>938, 89 S. Ct. 302, 21 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1968). That decision, while expressing the view (at 379) that \u201cProbably, * * * the best rule is that if the original source (the declarant) is not under a duty to tell the truth, or if the statement of the declarant does not itself come under some established hearsay exception * * *, then the police report; containing that information is inadmissible,\u201d concluded that on the whole case there involved the admission of such a report was harmless error. In part the court relied on the fact that the informants were in court and had testified and that the jury was \u201cfully aware of the limited observation on which\u201d two of the informants had based their statements to the officer (at 379).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The determination of the harmlessness or prejudieiality of incompetent evidence is always peculiarly a matter of appraisal of the circumstances of the particular case. Here defendant was in a particularly disadvantageous and vulnerable position because of the nature of the alleged accident. She had no recourse to the best source of defensive testimony \u2014 the driver of the 'light\u201d car. Any undue fortification of plaintiffs\u2019 case would thus tend to exert more than ordinary adverse effect. Here that undue effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>obtained because the circumstance of statements by plaintiffs to the police officer at the scene of the accident as to how it happened consistent with their courtroom testimony thereon, would tend to buttress the latter in the minds of the jury. We conclude there was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We do not agree with defendant\u2019s additional appellate argument that the trial court improperly charged the \u201cemergency doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Reversed; costs to abide the event of a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-5\"> Since public institutional records are \u201cbusiness records\u201d within the hearsay exception, <em>Fagan v. Newark, supra, </em>78 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at 308, the \u201cbusiness duty\u201d to tell the truth required of the informant need not pertain to any \u201cbusiness\u201d as such but must be a duty analogous to the duty of the business employee to furnish honest information to the entrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"> Discussed in <em>Fagan v.
