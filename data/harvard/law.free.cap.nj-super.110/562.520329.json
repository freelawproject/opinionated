He was sentenced to 15 to 25 years in State\u2019s Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">The instant post-conviction relief proceeding, prosecuted on his behalf by the Public Defender, contends that his plea was not voluntarily made and should not have been accepted. The issues of ineffective assistance of counsel and excessiveness of sentence were also raised. Basically, however, defendant asserts that his wife died from causes unrelated to the gunshot wound which defendant inflicted on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">The trial court, after holding a full hearing in the matter, rejected all of defendant\u2019s contentions, and specifically found that beyond any reasonable doubt the gunshot wound was the sole proximate cause of the wife\u2019s death. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>court\u2019s opinion is reported at 104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>67 (Law Div. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record and are in full agreement with the trial court\u2019s findings as set forth in its opinion. We are satisfied that defendant\u2019s plea was voluntarily made and was properly accepted. The contention of ineffective assistance of counsel is without legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
