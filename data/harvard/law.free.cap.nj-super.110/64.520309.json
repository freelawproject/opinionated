A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2I\">Defendant was indicted, tried and convicted of the offense of unlawful possession of narcotics in violation of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>24:18-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The single issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred \u201cin allowing the prosecutor to question the defendant as to his past conduct.\u201d It is argued that the challenged cross-examination was improper and \u201cseverely undermined the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">It is undisputed that 115 glassine envelopes containing narcotics were found in a brown paper bag under the front seat of a rented automobile which had just been returned to the rental agency by defendant, who was then accompanied by three other men and a woman. Immediately prior to this discovery, defendant had requested the agency to rerent to him \u201cthis specific\u201d vehicle, and, when he was advised that it could not be done, an argument ensued. The police were summoned, and they arrived shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">According to the testimony of Officer McGhee, defendant not only insisted that the ear be rerented to him but he pulled out a wad of money and said, \u201cI can buy the car if I want.\u201d When one of the men (not defendant) stated that he wanted to remove some draperies, Officer Daily went with him to the ear. Daily testified that, when the man reached into the vehicle to get the draperies, he noticed the aforementioned brown paper bag \u201chalf underneath the driver\u2019s seat and half protruding out where I could see it\u201d and that the bag had a \u201clittle rip in it, and a glassine bag was half protruding out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Defendant, after testifying on direct examination that he did not know how the narcotics got into the car, was asked on cross-examination, \u201cHave you ever used the contents of these types of envelopes before,\u201d to which, when his counsel\u2019s objection was overruled, defendant replied, \u201cI have used it * * * I have indulged.\u201d There was an immediate motion for a mistrial, which was denied by the trial court with the comment that the purpose of the question \u201cwas whether or not there would be a tendency on his [defendant\u2019s] part to be in possession of the narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In <em>State v. Homer, </em>86 <em>N. J. Super. </em>351, 364 <em>(App. Div. </em>1965), this court, in discussing the general rule that on the trial of a crime charged it is neither competent nor relevant to show that the defendant has committed other crimes unconnected in any way with the one in question, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">That rule is subject to several well-established exceptions, -which are listed in the elucidative opinion of Justice Heher in <em>State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>400, 418-419 (1957). One of the several exceptions therein noted relates to the commission of a different offense disclosing a motive for the crime charged. We specifically pointed out in <em>State v. Campisi, </em>47 N. <em>J. Super. </em>455, 459 (App. Div. 1957) [certification denied 26 <em>N. J. </em>304 (1958)], that proof of a collateral offense is admissible when it has \u201cprobative weight in respect of system, intent, knowledge, motive or state of mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\"><em>Cf. State v. Jones, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>137, 141 (App. Div. 1967). Note also <em>Rule </em>55 of the <em>Rules of Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b84-8\">Poley, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ADr\">(dissenting). I respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by the majority. Specifically, on the facts of this case I do not believe a showing that at some unspecified time defendant indulged in the use of narcotics had bearing upon the instant charge, in the sense that it had probative weight in respect of \u201csystem, intent, knowledge, motive, or state of mind.\u201d As noted by the majority, the general rule is that on the trial of a crime charged it is neither competent nor relevant to prove that defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>committed other offenses unconnected in any way with the one in question. While the rule is subject to several well recognized exceptions, indispensable to them is a showing of some \"real connection\u201d between the extraneous crime or conduct offered in evidence and the crime of which defendant is accused, beyond the allegation that they have both sprung from the same vicious disposition. <em>State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>400, 419 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On the proofs I am unable to see any <em>real connection </em>between defendant\u2019s prior use of narcotics at <em>some </em>time, with the presence of the narcotic drugs in the automobile which he had rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">If, as I believe, the evidence of use of narcotics (adduced on cross-examination) was inadmissible it was plainly prejudicial. Defendant testified that during the rental period the ear had been in the possession of persons other than himself and he denied knowledge of the presence of narcotics in the vehicle. This testimony, standing alone, could have engendered in the minds of one or more jurors a reasonable doubt of whether he was guilty of the crime charged, particularly since the State\u2019s purely circumstantial proofs in support of the charge rested essentially upon a showing that defendant had rented the automobile and thereafter narcotics were found in it. Such doubt may have been diminished considerably by defendant\u2019s admission on cross-examination that he had previously used narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In my judgment the total circumstances required the trial judge in the exercise of sound discretion to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial to the end that he be accorded the fair trial to which he was constitutionally entitled. Therefore I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
