An administrative law judge (ALJ), after considering all submitted medical records and hearing oral testimony from Johnson, Johnson\u2019s father, and a vocational expert, concluded that Johnson suffered no severe impairment and therefore was not disabled under section 1614(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act. The Social Security Administration Appeals Council denied Johnson\u2019s request for review of the ALJ decision. Johnson subsequently sought judicial review of the decision in federal district court, which affirmed the denial. Johnson now appeals the district court\u2019s decision. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence\u201d and whether \u201cthe final decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). The legal standard for evaluating evidence of the severity of an impairment was announced by this court in <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099 (5th Cir.1985): an impairment is not severe \u201conly if it is a slight abnormality [having] such minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or work experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1101 (alteration in original). The ALJ expressly cited and correctly applied <em>Stone </em>in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">To determine whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence, we \u201ccarefully scrutinize the record to determine if, in fact, [substantial] evidence is present,\u201d but \u201cwe may not reweigh the evidence ..., nor try the issues <em>de novo, </em>nor substitute our judgment for the [Commissioner\u2019s], even if the evidence preponderates against the [Commissioner\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Harrell v. Bowen, </em>862 F.2d 471, 475 (5th Cir.1988). Based on a careful review of the record, the parties\u2019 respective briefs, and the relevant district court opinion, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the decision. Because the district court\u2019s careful analysis thoroughly explains our reasoning, we need not engage in a redundant analysis simply to reach the same result. We therefore AFFIRM for essentially the same reasons as those assigned by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
