In the first incident, a woman came to Quire\u2019s house and assaulted her, beating her for twenty minutes and breaking her cheekbone. Though Quire did not know the woman, the assaulter claimed to have been sent by Parks. Quire called the police, but no arrest was made and Detective Smith<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> refused Quire\u2019s request that he obtain Parks\u2019 phone records to see if Parks had called the assaulter shortly before the assault. In the second incident, Parks followed Quire onto Quire\u2019s property and then one of Parks\u2019 friends (it is not clear if it was the same woman from the first incident) beat Quire with a baseball bat and a stone. When Quire called the police, the responding officer was \u201cnegative\u201d toward her and wrote in his police report that the State would not prosecute the case. In the third incident, Parks came to Quire\u2019s house and poured juice on her face. After Quire reported the assault, Sergeant Sawchoom threatened to arrest her. The complaint also asserts that the Miramar Police falsely arrested Quire. The complaint itself provides no details, but an attachment that Quire included along with her complaint indicates that,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at some point, Parks and her friends lied to the police, telling them that Quire had assaulted Parks with a knife. The police arrested Quire for assault with a weapon, she was charged with and ultimately convicted of that offense, and as a result spent a month in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Because Quire was proceeding in forma pauperis, the district court conducted a pre-service screening pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The court construed her complaint liberally and read it as making two claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See generally Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d). The first claim alleged that the police\u2019s refusal to make arrests based on Quire\u2019s police reports violated her federal rights. The second claim alleged that Quire was falsely imprisoned when the police arrested her for assault with a weapon. The district court concluded that neither claim could provide a basis for relief and dismissed the complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim. The court went on to find that, based on Quire\u2019s filings, there was no reason to believe that more careful drafting could cure the defects in her complaint. It therefore dismissed the complaint with prejudice on the ground that granting Quire leave to amend \u201cwould not serve the interests of justice but would simply prolong the inevitable dismissal of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0Hc\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). In doing so, we liberally construe Quire\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). Because the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend was based on futility, which is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>legal conclusion, we also review the denial <em>de novo. Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 1230, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Both of Quire\u2019s claims are squarely foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. As for her first claim, the Supreme Court has held that citizens in Quire\u2019s position do not have a constitutional right to have police officers arrest another citizen. <em>See Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 768, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 2810, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005) (\u201c[T]he benefit that a third party may receive from having someone else arrested for a crime generally does not trigger protections under the Due Process Clause____\u201d); <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989) (\u201c[N]othing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.\u201d); <em>see also Lovins v. Lee, </em>53 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has been particularly unreceptive to the [claim] that citizens of this country have a substantive due process right to be protected by government from the lawless among us.\u201d). Nor is there any federal statute guaranteeing that state police officers will make an arrest based on a reported assault. And if there is no federal right supporting the first claim, it cannot be a basis for relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Robertson v. Hecksel, </em>420 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[B]efore \u00a7 1983 ... can come into play, the plaintiff must still establish the existence of a federal right.\u201d). Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing the first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Quire\u2019s second claim fails for a different reason. Claims for false arrest and false imprisonment under \u00a7 1983 fail as a matter of law if there was probable cause for the arrest. <em>See Rankin v. Evans, </em>133 F.3d 1425, 1435-36 (11th Cir.1998). And where the plaintiff was convicted of the offense for which she was allegedly falsely arrested, that judgment of conviction \u201cconclusively established] that the arrest was made with probable cause, absent a showing of fraud, perjury or corrupt means.\u201d <em>Howell v. Tanner, </em>650 F.2d 610, 615 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the district court correctly pointed out, \u201cQuire claims only that \u2018Parks and her accomplices\u2019 lied,\u201d which \u201cdoes not negate the probable cause that the officers, in good faith, would have believed that they had.\u201d <em>See Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when an arrest is objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d). The district court therefore did not err in dismissing the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ArG\">Finally, the district court did not err in denying Quire leave to amend her complaint. As the district court correctly noted, the problem with Quire\u2019s complaint is not that she failed to include certain factual matter or relied on overly generalized allegations; instead, the problem is that both her claims rely on theories of recovery that are invalid as a matter of law. Thus, \u201ca more carefully drafted complaint could not state a claim [and] dismissal with prejudice is proper.\u201d <em>Ziemba v. Cascade Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1213 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-13\">.

We take the facts as alleged in the complaint, construing them in the light most favorable to Quire. <em>See Leal v. Ga.
