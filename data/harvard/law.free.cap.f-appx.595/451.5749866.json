Roe\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). On appeal, Roe argues that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) should consider his 10-year federal sentence to run fully concurrently with his 10-year state sentence for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. That state sentence ran concurrently with Roe\u2019s consecutive state sentences for burglary of a building and methamphetamine possession. The district court, however, ordered that Roe\u2019s federal sentence run consecutively to his state sentence for burglary of a building. If the federal sentence were to run fully concurrently with the 10-year state sentence, the BOP would necessarily be running the federal sentence concurrently with the two-year burglary sentence, which would be violative of the district court\u2019s judgment. Further, the record discloses that the time spent in state custody which Roe seeks to have credited towards his federal sentence was previously credited towards his state sentences. Because the period was credited against another undischarged sentence, it may not be applied toward his federal sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
