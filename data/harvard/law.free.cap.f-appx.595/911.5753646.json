At sentencing, the district court applied a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) for assaulting a law enforcement officer during the course of the offense or the immediate flight therefrom. On appeal, Gibson argues that: (1) the district court erred in applying the six-level increase because his altercation with the police officer occurred the day after the robbery; and (2) this error was not harmless because it resulted in a substantively unreasonable- sentence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 711 (11th Cir.2010). We will affirm a sentence based on harmless error if we know that the district court would have imposed the same sentenc\u00e9 regardless of its ruling on a guidelines issue, and the sentence is reasonable even if that issue was decided in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). The defendant has the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of the sentence had the district court decided the guidelines issue in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>See id. </em>at 1350. When reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we ask \u201cwhether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant is subject to a six-level increase if he assaulted a law enforcement officer \u201cduring the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom\u201d in a way that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l). In <em>Dougherty v. United States, </em>we held that a district court erred in applying a \u00a7 3A1.2(e)(l) enhancement to a law enforcement assault committed eight days after the defendants\u2019 bank robbery, but while the defendants were still fleeing from police and trying to evade capture. 754 F.3d 1353, 1359 (11th Cir.2014). We held that applying the enhancement to an assault occurring eight days after and thousands of miles away from the offense was inconsistent with the \u201cduring immediate flight\u201d requirement as the ordinary meaning of \u201cimmediate\u201d includes definitions such as \u201coccurring without delay,\u201d \u201cinstant,\u201d and \u201caccomplished without loss of time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">We consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). In imposing a sentence, a district court considers the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA district court abuses its discretion and imposes a substantively unreasonable sentence when it fails to afford consideration to relevant [\u00a7 3353(a) ] factors that were due significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or commits a clear error of judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted). But \u201cwe will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [court] accorded to a given [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted). Juvenile convictions not similar to the conviction and too remote to use in calculating the defendant\u2019s criminal history category can be properly considered by the district court in its consideration of the 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>289 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Here, the district court erred in applying the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) because the assault on the police officer did not occur during \u201cimmediate flight.\u201d Gibson\u2019s altercation with the police officer did not occur instantly, \u201cwithout delay,\u201d or \u201cwithout loss of time.\u201d <em>See Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1359. As the record reveals, Gibson was arrested at a hotel the day after the robbery, interviewed at a FBI office, and then transported to a local police station, at which point he faked an illness and, after being taken to the hospital, attacked the officer guarding him. He tried to wrestle away the officer\u2019s gun while yelling death threats and breaking the officer\u2019s thumb in the process. Thus, Gibson\u2019s assault was not \u201cimmediate,\u201d as enough time had passed that Gibson was able to spend the night at a hotel, be interviewed by the FBI, and be transferred to the local police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Had the district court ruled in Gibson\u2019s favor on the guidelines issue, the presentence investigation report would have yielded an advisory guideline range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, pt. A. Nonetheless, its error in ruling against Gibson on the guidelines issue was harmless because the district court indicated that it would have imposed the same sentence without the six-level increase. Furthermore, even without the increase, the ultimate sentence was substantively reasonable. As the record shows, the 39-month upward variance, though substantial, accomplished the needs for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense, take into account the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, and protect the public. Moreover, the district court properly considered Gibson\u2019s dangerous conduct and consistent criminal history even though these facts were not reflected in the guidelines range. Indeed, Gibson not only robbed a bank during which he made a death threat but engaged in an altercation with a police officer following his arrest that placed himself, the officer, and others in danger. He actively attempted to get the officer\u2019s gun and threatened to kill him during the assault. In addition, Gibson\u2019s criminal history category of I did not adequately reflect the 17 convictions he received as a juvenile and an adult. His criminal history and escalation to the instant crime of violence invoke the need to consider the public safety aspect of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">In short, because Gibson\u2019s resulting 96-month sentence was \u201cwithin the range of. reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case,\u201d the district court committed harmless error when it applied a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(e)(l). Accordingly, the court .did not clearly abuse its discretion in sentencing Gibson by an upward variance of 39 months from the top end of the appropriate guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-5\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
