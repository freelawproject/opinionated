Defendant-Appellee removed to federal district court and filed to dismiss Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 claims. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the action with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In July 2008, Plaintiffs-Appellants Walter Newell Ransom and Gale Elizabeth Ransom obtained a residential mortgage loan on real property located on 710 Lochness Lane, Garland, Texas (\u201cthe Property\u201d). In conjunction with the mortgage, the Ransoms signed a promissory note (\u201cthe Note\u201d) in the amount of $220,000 and a deed of trust (\u201cthe Deed\u201d) to secure the note. Approximately ten years later, the Ransoms breached the terms of the Note and Deed by failing to make timely payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Soon thereafter, Defendant-Appellee PNC Bank, N.A. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cPNC\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sought to conduct a judicial foreclosure on the Property. In response, the Ransoms filed suit <em>pro se </em>in Texas state court asserting causes of action for fraud, fraudulent inducement, fraudulent concealment, intentional misrepresentation, and suit to quiet title. PNC removed the suit to federal district court and filed a motion to dismiss in November 2013. In its motion to dismiss, PNC argued that the Ransoms\u2019 claims were subject to a four year statute of limitations which began to accrue when they executed the Note and the Deed, <em>ie., </em>July 2003. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.004(a)(4). Accordingly, the Ransoms were required to bring their claims no later than July 2007, but they failed to do so until June 2013. Additionally, PNC argued that the Ransoms failed to state a claim to quiet title because they failed to allege any facts showing that they held superior title to the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">The Ransoms responded in December 2013 with objections to PNC\u2019s notice of removal and also by filing a motion to remand. The matter was referred to a United States magistrate judge who issued in January 2014 a report and recommendation to grant PNC\u2019s motion to dismiss the Ransoms\u2019 claims with prejudice and to deny the motion to remand. In her report, the magistrate judge noted that the Ransoms\u2019 fraud claims were barred by the four year statute of limitations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that they had failed to state a claim for relief on an action to quiet title. <em>See Sadler v. Duvall, </em>815 S.W.2d 285, 293 n. 2 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1991). The magistrate judge also stated in her report that permitting leave to amend, although ordinarily granted in the case of <em>pro se </em>litigants, would be futile in this case because the Ransoms\u2019 claims of fraud against PNC were \u201cfatally infirm.\u201d <em>See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767-68 (5th Cir.2009). The Ransoms objected to the report with respect to: (1) the magistrate judge\u2019s authority; (2) the recommendation to deny their motion to remand; (3) \u201cthe legal standard for motion to dismiss\u201d; (4) the \u201cdismissal of [their] claims regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d; and, (5)' the dismissal of their \u201cclaims regarding petition to quiet title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In February 2014, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and issued a final judgment dismissing the Ransoms\u2019 claims in total.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On appeal, the Ransoms argue that the district court erred when it dismissed their claims with prejudice without permitting amendment of their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The Ransoms do not appeal the district court\u2019s application of the four year statute of limitations to their claims nor do they brief any argument with respect to its holding dismissing their claims to quiet title.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the Ransoms complain on appeal that the district court should have permitted them leave to amend their complaint, however, it appears from the record that the Ransoms did not seek leave to amend their complaint at any time before the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.\u201d <em>Bowlby v. City of Aberdeen, Miss., </em>681 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments as briefed on appeal, and after reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the district court\u2019s judgment and reasoning adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendation, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment and adopt its analysis in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
