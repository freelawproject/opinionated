He was sentenced to serve 180 months in prison and a ten-year term of supervised release. Now, he argues that the evidence does not suffice to support his conviction because the items found in his possession do not constitute child pornography. In the alternative, he argues that he did not knowingly possess child pornography because he believed that the materials that led to his conviction did not qualify as such. The Government argues that his knowledge argument is reviewed only for a manifest miscarriage of justice because he did not preserve it. Byrd responds that the issue was properly preserved and, if it was not, then counsel rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-22\">Typically, we conduct a \u201cde novo [review of] the district court\u2019s denial of a properly preserved motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>United States v. Fuchs, </em>467 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>889, 904 (5th Cir.2006). A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is conducted by analyzing \u201call evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>740 F.3d 956, 962 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 185 S.Ct. 54, 190 L.Ed.2d 56 (2014). When a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence has not been preserved with a motion for judgment of acquittal, we review only for a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 330-32 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We review both the direct and circumstantial evidence, as well as all reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Rose, </em>587 F.3d 695, 702 (5th Cir.2009). In determining whether there is sufficient evidence to support a verdict, \u201cthis court asks only whether the jury\u2019s decision was rational, not whether it was correct.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>553 F.3d 380, 389 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, we accept \u201call credibility choices and reasonable inferences made by the trier of fact which tend to support the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno-Gonzalez, </em>662 F.3d 369, 372 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>Fuchs, </em>467 F.3d at 904 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cJuries are free to use their common sense and apply common knowledge, observation, and experience gained in the ordinary affairs of life when giving effect to the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores-Chapa, </em>48 F.3d 156, 161 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Our review of the record in. light of these principles shows that the evidence suffices to uphold Byrd\u2019s convictions. Insofar as Byrd argues that the items underlying his conviction do not amount to child pornography, our review of the items in light of the Dost<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> factors refutes this assertion and shows no clear error in connection with the jury\u2019s apparent conclusion that these items contained a lascivious exhibition of children\u2019s genitalia. <em>See United States v. Steen, </em>634 F.3d 822, 826-27 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">To the extent that Byrd argues that the evidence did not suffice to show that he did not knowingly possess child pornography because he believed that the disputed materials did not qualify as such, this argument gains no traction. Because this claim is unavailing under both the de novo and manifest miscarriage of justice standards, we apply the former and decline to decide the issue whether it should be reviewed under the latter. Because Byrd\u2019s ineffective assistance claim comes into play only if the manifest miscarriage of justice standard is applied, it will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">While the jury did hear Byrd\u2019s explanation of why he thought the items at issue were not child pornography, they were not obligated to believe it. <em>See Moreno-Gonzalez, </em>662 F.3d at 372. The jury\u2019s decision to reject this explanation was rational, and we will not overturn its verdict. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>553 F.3d at 389. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
