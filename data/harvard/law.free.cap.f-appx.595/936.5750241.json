Lin argues that the IJ did not make a clean finding that she was not credible and that substantial evidence does not support an adverse-credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we will review the decision of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). Because the BIA issued its own opinion in this case, we review the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>See Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d at 765. However, because the BIA explicitly agreed with several findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>See Ayala, </em>605 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">We are without jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if a petitioner fails to exhaust all available administrative remedies. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Accordingly, if the petitioner failed to raise her claim before the BIA, we cannot consider the claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We review factual determinations, which include credibility determinations, under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). \u201c[W]e must affirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, in order for us to conclude that a finding of fact should be reversed, we must determine that the record compels reversal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). The INA defines a refugee as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, in order to meet the definition of a refugee, the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">The criteria for establishing eligibility for withholding of removal is substantially the same as, but more stringent than, that for asylum. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) (describing the standard for withholding of removal). The functional difference is that an alien seeking withholding of removal must demonstrate a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d probability of future persecution rather than the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d required for asylum. <em>See id.; Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Consequently, an alien generally cannot qualify for withholding of removal if he is unable to meet the lower standard of proof for asylum. <em>Al </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">\u201cTo establish eligibility for CAT relief, \u00e1n applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, government officials if returned to the designated country of removal.\u201d <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2010); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof, without corroborating evidence. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. Conversely, if the applicant relies solely on his testimony, an adverse-credibility determination may alone be sufficient to support the denial of an application. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). When the IJ makes an adverse-credibility finding, the applicant must demonstrate the decision was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255 (internal quotation marks omitted). Also, the IJ \u201cmust make clean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13 \u00a7 101, 119 Stat. 302, for applications filed after May 11, 2005, a credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence, including country reports. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Moreover, an adverse-credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>Even a tenable explanation for the falsehood or inconsistency may not compel us to reverse, taking into account the record as a whole. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>see also Xia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>608 F.3d 1233, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that an adverse-credibility determination was supported where the applicant\u2019s testimony included at least one internal inconsistency and one omission).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">In the context of airport interviews, we have cautioned that an IJ should not exclusively focus on interview omissions, keeping in mind that the alien is not represented by counsel and may be intimidated by official questioning. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1279 (11th Cir.2009). Nonetheless, we have drawn a distinction between hearing testimony that merely elaborates upon the earlier interview, and that which \u201c \u2018actually contradicts\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018cannot be squared with\u2019 \u201d that interview. <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1050 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Tang, </em>578 F.3d at 1280). Thus, we upheld reliance on inconsistencies between an applicant\u2019s hearing testimony and his earlier statements during airport and credible-fear interviews where the applicant did not merely give a less detailed version of the facts in the interview, but omitted entire incidents and other significant facts as well as directly contradicted his later testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 1050-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">A motion to reopen filed with the BIA shall not be granted unless the BIA determines that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Also, a motion to reopen filed while an appeal is pending before the BIA may be deemed a motion to remand for further proceedings before the IJ. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>As a preliminary matter, Lin failed to exhaust her argument that the IJ did not make a clean and explicit adverse-credibility finding because she did not make that argument before the BIA, and, in fact, explicitly challenged the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. As for the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility finding, it was supported by specific, cogent reasons and substantial evidence in the record, including Lin\u2019s inconsistent testimony about how she entered the United States, the number of arrests and the length of her detentions, whether her family paid for her release from both detentions or only the second one, and the implausibility as to her explanation concerning why she only mentioned the November 2012 arrest during her credible-fear interview but stated that she was detained for 15 days. Lin maintains that these are merely omissions upon which she later elaborated, not inconsistencies. <em>See Tang, </em>578 F.3d at 1279. However, the direct inconsistencies generally \u201ccannot be squared with\u201d one another, and the omissions leave out significant facts. <em>See Shkambi, </em>584 F.3d at 1050. We therefore cannot say that it was clear error to find Lin\u2019s testimony incredible based on them. <em>See id. </em>Finally, the BIA did not engage in impermissible factfinding regarding the inconsistencies in Lin\u2019s explanation for her missing passport because the IJ made specific findings regarding the passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Accordingly, upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
