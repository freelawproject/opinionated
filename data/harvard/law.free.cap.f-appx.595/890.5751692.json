Although the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Reeder\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint, the district court erred by entering summary judgment in favor of the officers based on qualified immunity. The district court impermissi-bly weighed the evidence in favor of the officers\u2019 accounts that they were invited into Reeder\u2019s home and discredited Reed-er\u2019s deposition testimony that he did not consent to the officers\u2019 entry. Because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Reeder, establishes that the officers entered his home in violation of the Fourth Amendment, we vacate the judgment in favor of the officers and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\">Reeder\u2019s amended complaint stemmed from an encounter two years earlier with the four police officers. The officers visited Reeder to investigate whether he had drugged and raped a woman inside his home the previous evening. Although the officers and Reeder agreed that he opened his front door to talk to the officers, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>stories about what then transpired differed substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Reeder\u2019s complaint alleged that, as he opened his door, Officers Harry Oakley and James S. Thomas rushed into his home brandishing taser guns and demanding that Reeder relinquish the sheets on his bed. When Reeder told the two officers to leave or produce a search warrant, they handcuffed him and placed him in a patrol vehicle so Officer Steve Yunick and other officers could search Reeder\u2019s home. Twenty minutes later, Sergeant Dennis Thomas arrived on the scene and walked quickly through Reeder\u2019s home. Sergeant Thomas asked Reeder to sign a form that stated he consented to the search of his home, but Reeder refused. Reeder was charged with possessing illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia, but those charges were later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">During his deposition, Reeder testified that he woke to a \u201creally loud banging,\u201d he ran to his kitchen after he heard the sound of glass breaking, and he opened a window through which he saw Officers Thomas and Oakley. Reeder, who knew Officer Thomas, agreed to open his front door to speak to the officers. As Reeder opened his door, he saw Officer Oakley wielding a taser gun, and Officer Thomas rushed inside Reeder\u2019s home and ordered him to \u201c[p]ut [his] hands up.\u201d Officer Thomas inquired where the victim had slept the previous evening and demanded that Reeder surrender his sheets. When Reed-er told the officers to \u201cget out of [his] house\u201d and asked them for a search warrant, Officer Oakley threatened to shoot Reeder with a taser gun and instructed Reeder to \u201cwalk back into [his] living room.\u201d Because Reeder continued to protest the officers\u2019 presence in his home, Officer Thomas handcuffed Reeder. In the meantime, Reeder heard something tapping on a sliding glass door in his living room and saw Officer Yunick remove a piece of wood that was wedged in the track of the door. Officer Thomas escorted Reeder to a patrol car, where he waited approximately 20 minutes while officers searched his home. Reeder objected to the officers\u2019 presence after Sergeant Thomas arrived at the scene, and Reeder later refused the Sergeant\u2019s offer to \u201cwork this out and get rid of [the drug] charges\u201d if Reeder signed a form consenting to the search of his home. Reeder also refused to sign a consent form when asked to do so by Officer Thomas. As Officer Thomas transported Reeder to the police station, Officer Thomas asked Reeder about a bottle of liquor handled by the victim, and they returned to Reeder\u2019s house to retrieve the item from a garbage can outside his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Reeder also testified that he did not see a crack pipe in his house before the police arrived, but he \u201csmell[ed]\u201d the victim smoking crack that morning and \u201ckiek[ed] her out.\u201d And Reeder insisted that, during his interview at the police station, he stated that he did not consent to the search of his home, but Officer Thomas interrupted him with the response, \u201c[w]e\u2019re not here to talk about that right now.\u201d Reeder denied that he consented to have his mouth swabbed for forensic testing during his interview and that a lady appeared at his home two to three weeks later with a warrant to collect the sample. Reeder also testified that he surrendered his clothes at the conclusion of his interview when asked to do so by Officer Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">The officers moved for summary judgment and to strike Reeder\u2019s deposition as a sham. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), (h). The officers argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity because Reeder consented to the search of his home, and in the alternative, because exigent circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>stances existed to justify their entry without a warrant. And the officers alleged that Reeder\u2019s deposition \u201cinherently contradict[ed] [his] statements [during his post-arrest interview] that he consented to the search\u201d of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The officers submitted a video recording of Reeder\u2019s interview. The video began by showing Reeder removing his pants and underwear and stacking them neatly on the interview table. When Officer Thomas entered the room, Reeder stated that he took \u201chis clothes off because [he] wanted to submit them ... for evidence.\u201d Thomas allowed Reeder to narrate the events of his evening with the victim because he had already \u201ctold [Thomas] everything in the world without [him] asking ... a question.\u201d Reeder described how the victim arrived at his home intoxicated, ingested alcohol and Xanax, and then accused him of rape when he failed to obtain crack cocaine as she requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The video showed that Reeder was aiding the officers in their investigation. Reeder maintained \u201cthat ... [he] had no problem when you knocked on the door this morning, opening the door at all because [he] really want to get this resolved and [he was] not trying to run from it.\u201d Reeder acknowledged that he had asked Thomas to \u201cturn [his patrol car] around\u201d and return to Reeder\u2019s home, to collect \u201ca liquor bottle\u201d that Reeder had disposed of in a garbage can outside his home. And Reeder explained that he overlooked the crack pipe that was sitting on the same table as the bottle because he was rushing to \u201cget all [the] alcoholic stuff out\u201d in case his \u201cprobation officer came around.\u201d Reeder also acknowledged that, after the officers \u201ctold [him] why [they] were there ... [he] said \u2018take the sheets,\u2019 \u201d and that there was \u201cone [sheet that he] brought out of the room\u201d for the officers. Reeder reiterated, \u201cyeah, I told you \u2018take the sheets\u2019 and here I\u2019m offering you my boxers, everything that I can possibly give y\u2019all.\u201d Reeder also consented to undergo a \u201cbuccal swab,\u201d and he insisted that the officers \u201c[could] do anything\u201d and that he would provide \u201c[a]nything else [the officers] need[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The officers submitted affidavits about their encounter with Reeder. Officers Thomas and Oakley averred that Reeder \u201cinvited [them] to enter\u201d his home; they \u201cproceeded into the living room area where [the officers] informed Mr. Reeder that [they] were there to investigate rape allegations against him\u201d; they saw illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia lying in plain view in Reeder\u2019s home; and Reeder denied any wrongdoing and agreed to \u201cfully cooperate in the investigation.\u201d Thomas stated that Oakley \u201crequested permission ... to search\u201d Reeder\u2019s home and \u201cReeder consented,\u201d and Oakley stated that \u201cReed-er invited [the officers] to take the bed sheets ... that the alleged victim slept on\u201d before consenting to a search of his apartment. Officer Thomas also stated that Reeder agreed to sign a consent to search form, but later he refused to do so. Officer Yunick averred that he saw Officers Thomas and Oakley inside Reeder\u2019s home, after which he entered the home through a sliding glass door that had been left unlocked, and that he learned later that Reeder had consented to the search. Sergeant Thomas stated that he was told Reeder had consented to the search by Officer Oakley or Thomas; he saw a crack pipe lying on a table in Reeder\u2019s living room; and Reeder verified that he had invited the officers to enter his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">In depositions, Officers Oakley and Thomas testified that Reeder admitted them to his home. Oakley testified that Thomas asked Reeder if they could \u201ccome inside and talk,\u201d he was \u201cnervous[ly] cooperative,\u201d and when they asked him to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>linquish the sheets on which the victim had been sleeping, he \u201cvolunteered his clothes\u201d and he \u201ct[ook] [them] to the living room where [her] sheets were on the couch.\u201d And Oakley verified that he and Officer Thomas obtained Reeder\u2019s consent before entering his home. Officer Thomas testified that Reeder \u201cinvit[ed] [them] into .his house ..., demanding [they] take the sheets____\u201d and that Reeder was \u201cmore than happy to comply with [the] request\u201d to enter and escorted the officers down the hallway to the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Reeder filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which the district court denied. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). The district court determined that Reeder could have included his claims of false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and violations of state law in his amended complaint and that he failed to give a reason to excuse filing his proposed amendment before the expiration of the deadline for discovery. The district court also determined that the proposed amendment would prejudice the officers, require additional discovery, and delay the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The district court denied the officers\u2019 motion to strike Reeder\u2019s testimony. Although the district court found \u201cvariations in [Reeder\u2019s] testimony [that affected] [its] weight ... as evidence,\u201d it determined that those \u201cinconsistencies [were] not explicit enough to strike the deposition as a sham.\u201d The district court explained that it was relying on Reeder\u2019s videotaped interview as \u201cthe best evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The district court initially denied the officers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, but later the district court vacated that decision and granted the motion. Based on Reeder\u2019s statements that he \u201chad no problem ... opening the door at all\u201d for the officers, willingly turned over evidence, and instructed an officer to return to his home to retrieve the bottle of liquor, and because Reeder \u201cnever hint[ed] that he did not voluntarily consent to the officers\u2019 entry ... or search\u201d and \u201cconfirm[ed] that he consented to the search, explaining that he was willing to do anything to clear his name,\u201d the district court found that Reed-er \u201cconsented to the [officers\u2019] search of his home.\u201d The district court determined that there was \u201cno constitutional error in entering the house or the subsequent search\u201d and that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">The district court also rejected what it perceived to be Reeder\u2019s attempt to \u201ccreate an issue of fact by providing testimony (almost three years after the incident)\u201d to contradict the officers\u2019 accounts of the incident and to satisfy \u201cthe threshold required to deprive the police officers, who were trying to do their duty, of qualified immunity.\u201d The district court explained that it had decided to \u201crely on [Reeder\u2019s] police interview as a more accurate portrayal of the facts\u201d because Reeder\u2019s \u201cdeposition testimony ... [was] inconsistent with his prior statements ... [and] [was] so self-serving that it lack[ed] credence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment based on qualified immunity. <em>Terrell v. Smith, </em>668 F.3d 1244, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). We are required to interpret the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences from that evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Terrell, </em>668 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Reeder challenges the summary judgment in favor of the officers on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>that a material dispute of fact exists about whether he consented to a search of his home. Reeder also challenges the denial of his request for leave to file a second amended complaint. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">\n<em>A. The District Court Erred By Entering Summary Judgment for the Officers Based on Qualified Immunity.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The district court erred by entering summary judgment in favor of the officers. Under the Fourth Amendment, police officers cannot enter a home without a warrant unless they obtain the voluntary consent of the person whose property is searched or consent from a third party who shares common authority over the premises. <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2797, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). The record reveals that a genuine factual dispute exists about whether the officers entered Reeder\u2019s home without his consent. On the one hand, the officers submitted affidavits and deposition testimony that Reeder invited them into his home. On the other hand, Reeder provided deposition testimony that the officers barged into his home, the officers disregarded his demands that they leave, and he refused to sign a consent to search form. Summary judgment was inappropriate because of the direct contradictions in the parties\u2019 evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Under Reeder\u2019s version of events, the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. Qualified immunity does not apply if an official violates a plaintiffs constitutional rights, and \u201c[a] warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a person\u2019s home, and any resulting search or seizure, violates the Fourth Amendment unless it is supported by both probable cause and exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, </em>707 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir.2013). The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Reeder, establishes that Officers Thomas, Oakley, and Yunick invaded and searched Reeder\u2019s home without his consent in violation of the Fourth Amendment. And Reeder\u2019s deposition testimony established that Sergeant Thomas joined the officers inside Reeder\u2019s house after being told by Reeder that he did not consent to the entry or search. The officers argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the alternative ground that exigent circumstances existed to justify their entry to Reeder\u2019s home without a warrant, but \u201c[w]e decline to address [that argument] here, preferring that the district court address it in the first instance.\u201d <em>Beavers v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>975 F.2d 792, 800 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The district court neglected its duty to credit Reeder\u2019s version of events. The district court inferred that Reeder consented to the search based on his willingness to cooperate \"with the officers, but we have cautioned that \u201cit is inappropriate to \u2018sanction entry into the home based upon inferred consent.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>71 F.3d 819, 830 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Shaibu, </em>920 F.2d 1423, 1426 (9th Cir.1990)). And while cooperation is a factor used to determine whether consent is voluntary, <em>see United States v. Chemaly, </em>741 F.2d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir.1984), it is not dispositive in ascertaining whether consent was given. <em>See United States v. Hidalgo, </em>7 F.3d 1566, 1571 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[C]onsent [is] not a function of acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority but rather [must be] given freely and voluntarily.\u201d). There is no doubt that Reeder\u2019s deposition testimony was inconsistent in many respects with his videotaped statement, but the district court could not discount the deposition testimony on that basis. \u201cEven if a district court believes that the evidence presented by one side is of doubtful veracity, it is not proper to grant summary judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>basis of credibility choices,\u201d <em>Feliciano, </em>707 F.3d at 1252 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), because \u201ccredibility determinations and the weighing of evidence \u2018are jury functions, not those of a judge,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). Although Reeder\u2019s deposition testimony that he protested the officers\u2019 presence in his home is in tension with his videotaped statement that he eagerly opened the door to speak to the officers and told them to take his sheets, the district court denied the officers\u2019 motion to strike Reeder\u2019s deposition testimony because the burden rested with \u201cthe jury [to] assess the credibility of [Reeder\u2019s] testimony.\u201d And the district court erred by rejecting Reeder\u2019s deposition testimony as self-serving because \u201cthat alone does not permit [a court] to disregard [testimony] at the summary judgment stage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The officers argue that Reeder\u2019s deposition testimony was \u201cutterly discredited\u201d by his videotaped statement, <em>see Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1776, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007), but we disagree. A party is entitled to have his testimony considered unless it is \u201cblatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Scott, </em>police officers produced a videotape recording of a high speed chase involving multiple violations of traffic laws that \u201cdirectly contradicted\u201d the plaintiffs complaint that he was a cautious and controlled driver whose civil rights were violated when officers rammed him to stop his vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 378-80, 127 S.Ct. at 1775-76. But the officers in this case do not possess the same type of objective, real-time evidence of their encounter with Reeder at his home to establish that his deposition testimony is false. Reeder\u2019s videotaped statement depicts his interview with the officers after his arrest and transportation to the police station. Reeder admits during his interview that he welcomed the officers\u2019 presence at his home and that he willingly identified and relinquished all evidence that he thought would exonerate him of the allegations of rape, but he does not state that he consented to the officers\u2019 entry or that he admitted them to his home. Unlike the videotape evidence in <em>Scott, </em>Reeder\u2019s videotaped statement does not unequivocally establish that he consented for the officers to enter his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">\n<em>B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Denying Reeder\u2019s Request to Amend His Complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Reeder to amend his complaint a second time. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) states that the district court \u201cshould freely give leave [to amend a complaint] when justice so requires,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2), and those principles give the district court leeway to deny a motion to amend when it determines that the amendment is intended to cause undue delay or would unduly prejudice the defendant. <em>See Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005). Reeder filed his motion more than one month after the close of discovery, which had been extended once at his request. The district court determined that the delay would prejudice the officers\u2019 ability to preserve evidence related to the new claims; would require additional discovery from the victim, Reeder, and potentially other persons; and would delay the disposition of Reeder\u2019s case. The district court reasonably decided to deny Reeder\u2019s request to further amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">We AFFIRM the denial of Reeder\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>complaint. We VACATE the summary judgment in favor of the officers based on qualified immunity, and we REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
