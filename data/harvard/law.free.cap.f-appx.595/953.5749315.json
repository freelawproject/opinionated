After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">In 2000, Aiken was convicted and sentenced for possession of ammunition as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and possession and use of a false non-immigrant visa and/or passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a). Because he had three prior violent felony convictions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was subject to the sentence enhancement provision of the ACCA, which mandated a minimum 15-year prison term. At sentencing, Aiken initially objected to the application of the ACCA enhancement and to the factual descriptions in the presentence investigation report (PSI) concerning the conduct underlying his prior state convictions. But Aiken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>later withdrew his objections after the government agreed to modify the contested sections of the PSI. The district court applied the ACCA enhancement without discussing the specific convictions that served as predicate offenses. The court then sentenced Aiken to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment for the felon-in-possession conviction and a concurrent 120-month term for the false-document conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aiken\u2019s convictions and total sentence were summarily affirmed by this court on appeal. <em>United States v. Aiken, </em>254 F.3d 74 (11th Cir.2001) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">In 2002, Aiken sought relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him, he was actually innocent of the charged violation of \u00a7 1546(a), and he was deprived of jail-time credit from a related offense. The district court denied Aiken\u2019s motion in 2003 and we declined to issue a certificate of appealability in June 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Aiken filed his instant \u00a7 2241 petition in September 2009, arguing that he was actually innocent of the ACCA enhancement because his prior state convictions did not qualify as \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d The district court dismissed Aiken\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Aiken had failed to establish the necessary conditions to satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), so that his claims might be considered in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Alternatively, the court noted that Aiken\u2019s claim would fail on the merits because he possessed the requisite number of predicate convictions to support the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">In his instant appeal, Aiken characterizes the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), as retroactive decisions sufficient to trigger the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) and allow his \u00a7 2241 petition to be decided on the merits. Relying on these decisions, he argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior state convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer, .robbery, and false imprisonment, were violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA. As a result, he maintains, he is \u201c[actually, [factually, and [ljegally\u201d innocent of his status as an armed career criminal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">We construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cWhether a prisoner may bring a[ ] \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a question of law we review <em>de novo.\u201d Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. April 8, 2014). Under \u00a7 2241(a) and (d), a district court has the power to grant a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner in custody in that district. This power is limited, however, by \u00a7 2255(e), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-14\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by [a \u00a7 2255 motion], shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>pears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The applicability of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue, which imposes a subject-matter jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337-38. Accordingly, before we may reach the substantive claims raised by Aiken, we must determine whether the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) permits him to seek relief through a \u00a7 2241 petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The restriction against second and successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, cannot render \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy inadequate or ineffective under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) <em>{en banc). </em>Rather, we have explained that a petitioner can use the savings clause to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 only where he shows that: (1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and original \u00a7 2255 proceeding, his claim was squarely foreclosed by our binding precedent; (2) his current claim is based on a Supreme Court decision that overturned the precedent that had foreclosed his claim; (3) that Supreme Court decision is retroactively applicable on collateral review; (4) as a result of the application of the new rule, his sentences exceed the applicable statutory maximum penalties; and (5) the savings clause reaches his pur <em>e-Begay </em>error claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty. <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262, 1274 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">In this case, Aiken fails to show that he can meet the requirements in <em>Bryant. </em>First, he cannot show that this Circuit\u2019s law foreclosed him from raising an objection to the treatment of his convictions as violent felonies under the ACCA during his direct appeal or initial \u00a7 2255 motion. No Eleventh Circuit precedent squarely held that battery on a law enforcement officer, as defined in Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03, 784.07, was a violent felony for ACCA purposes during Aiken\u2019s direct appeal and initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings. It was not until December 2005, in our decision in <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2005), that we held that a conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07 constituted a crime of violence under the elements clause of the career-offender guideline enhancement found at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1309 n. 16 (noting that this court uses the same analysis for determining whether a crime constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for the purposes of the ACCA enhancement as it does for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined under the \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Aiken\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196-98 (11th Cir.2007) also is unavailing, as it was decided in 2007, and its holding that Florida battery on a pregnant woman constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) is inapplicable here. <em>See United States v. Contreras, </em>739 F.3d 592, 598 (11th Cir.2014) (noting that \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cdefines \u2018crime of violence\u2019 very differently\u201d than the ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony,\u201d such that cases interpreting the ACCA were \u201cnot applicable\u201d in that context).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Aiken also fails to identify circuit precedent at the time of his direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion that squarely foreclosed his claim that his 1990 convictions for robbery and false imprisonment did not qualify as predicate offenses under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ACCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That said, with regard to Aiken\u2019s robbery conviction, prior to the conclusion of his \u00a7 2255 proceedings in June 2004, our caselaw treated Florida robbery as a violent felony .under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Wilkerson, </em>286 F.3d 1324, 1325 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201crobbery clearly constitutes a \u2018violent felony* within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u201d). In any event, Aiken fails to demonstrate that <em>Wilkerson </em>has been overturned by a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Aiken\u2019s reliance on <em>Begay, Chambers, </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>to argue that his robbery conviction did not qualify as a violent felony is misplaced. First, although <em>Begay </em>instructed courts to apply the \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d test to determine whether a given state offense qualifies as a violent felony, it did not abrogate all of this court\u2019s prior violent felony jurisprudence. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581; <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1347. Notably, subsequent to <em>Begay, </em>we reaffirmed that Florida\u2019s robbery statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(1), categorically qualifies as a crime of violence for the purposes of the analogous career-offender enhancement. <em>See United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1242-45 (11th Cir.2011); <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1309 n. 16. Second, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Chambers </em>\u2014 that Illinois\u2019s offense of failure to report to a penal institution was not an ACCA violent felony \u2014 did not affect <em>Wilkerson\u2019s </em>treatment of Florida robbery as an ACCA violent felony. <em>See Chambers, </em>555 U.S. at 123, 127-30, 129 S.Ct. 687. Third, <em>Johnson, </em>which held that one subdivision of Florida\u2019s battery statute did not qualify as a violent felony, also did not affect <em>Wilkerson\u2019s </em>discussion of a robbery offense. <em>See Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 136-37, 140-41, 145, 130 S.Ct. 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">To the extent that Aiken argues that his counsel was ineffective for withdrawing his objections to the application of the ACCA enhancement at sentencing, we need not address this issue because Aiken failed to present it to the district court. <em>See Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572-73 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that this court will not consider a habeas claim that was not raised before the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">In sum, we conclude that Aiken has failed to establish on appeal that binding circuit precedent \u201csquarely foreclosed\u201d him from raising his claim on direct appeal or in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion, or that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturned the relevant precedent. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. Accordingly, Aiken has not satisfied the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause requirements and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">. The criminal history that formed the basis of Aiken's ACCA enhancement included: (1) 1989 convictions for carrying a concealed firearm, battery on a law enforcement officer, and resisting an officer with violence to his person; (2) a 1990 conviction for aggravated battery; and (3) 1993 convictions for robbery and false imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\">. Aiken also is serving a 420-month sentence for conspiracy to engage in racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), to run concurrently to his other two sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b977-15\">. Following briefing, Aiken\u2019s appeal was held in abeyance pending our ruling in <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">. Because Aiken\u2019s 1990 false-imprisonment conviction arose out of the same incident as his robbery conviction, only one of the two convictions could have served as a predicate ACCA offense. <em>See United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that \u201d[i]n order for ACCA enhancement to be proper, the defendant must have been convicted of three violent felonies or serious drug crimes \u2018committed on occasions different from one another.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Here, as Aiken failed to demonstrate that his robbery conviction no longer qualifies as a violent felony, we have no need to address his false-imprisonment conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AxN\">. Following briefing, Aiken moved to remand the case in full, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), arguing that the Supreme Court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>sion in <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), established that the district court improperly referred to the facts underlying his prior convictions in determining that they qualified as ACCA violent felonies. Because <em>Descamps </em>has no bearing on whether Aiken can satisfy the test we set forth in <em>Bryant, </em>his motion to remand the case in full is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
