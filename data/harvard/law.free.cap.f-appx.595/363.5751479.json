Khalfani (\u201cKhalfani\u201d) levies two charges against his former employer, Balfour Beatty Communities, L.L.C. (\u201cBalfour\u201d): (1) unlawful retaliation, and (2) race and color discrimination. Balfour moved for summary judgment on both counts, which the district court granted. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">Khalfani was an African American employee of Balfour, which owns and operates military housing at Fort Bliss, Texas. During his tenure at the company, he raised several complaints about racially discriminatory behavior with his supervisor. At the time of his termination, Khalfani was a housing inspector who was responsible for \u201cchecking out\u201d rental property after the previous tenants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>left \u2014 in essence to determine what, if any, repairs needed to be conducted when a rental unit was transferred to a new tenant. In August 2011, Balfour received a complaint that, during a check out, Khal-fani had removed and disposed of certain personal items belonging to a former resident. Khalfani was terminated a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">We analyze this case pursuant to our Title VII jurisprudence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In general, that analysis follows in three parts: (1) the employee-plaintiff must make a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation or race/color discrimination, (2) the burden of production shifts to the employer-defendant, who must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action, and (B) if it does, the plaintiff can show that the defendant\u2019s stated reason is pre-textual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court concluded\u2014 and we agre\u00e9 \u2014 that Khalfani had met his burden of making a prima facie showing of retaliation and race/color discrimination, and then that Balfour had shown adequate neutral reasons for taking the job actions at issue. The court then held that Khalfa-ni had made an insufficient showing of pretext in both his race/color and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">While we agree with the district court\u2019s pretext analysis, Khalfani raises several arguments in his appellate briefing that were not addressed by the lower court, and which warrant consideration here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Turning first to the unlawful retaliation claim, Khalfani now focuses on two arguments to show pretext. First, he points to the behavior of his supervisor, and states that when he complained of mistreatment based on his race, the supervisor would turn \u201cred in the face\u201d and would get angry with him after he brought up reports that he had been racially discriminated against.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taking these statements about the supervisor\u2019s emotional reaction as true, as we must, they are not enough to show pretext. We have held that \u201c[a]n oral statement exhibiting discriminatory animus may be used to demonstrate pretext.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, there are no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>explicit oral statements, rather there are emotional reactions. We have never held that non-verbal evidence alone is sufficient to show pretext, though there is no logical reason why it could not be used under certain circumstances. The determining factor is the clarity of the evidence: we require such statements to clearly \u201cdemonstrate discriminatory animus,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and here, it is not clear, without more, that animus motivated the supervisor\u2019s emotional reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Second, Khalfani argues that the district court should have looked at the \u201ccourse of conduct [against him],\u201d including changes in his job responsibilities, increased scrutiny of his activities, and false discipline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have acknowledged that course of employer conduct can be relevant, and have held that \u201cthe combination of suspicious timing with other significant evidence of pretext\u201d can warrant denial of a summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>' This standard can be met when, for example, the plaintiff had highly positive performance reviews up until the complaint was leveled against the company, and then suffered a sharp decline in treatment immediately after the protected conduct occurred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is not met here. Rather, as the district court concluded, there was a lack of clear temporal proximity between the complaints and the negative job consequences, making it difficult to find the sharp decline in treatment we have previously used to infer causality, and with it, pretext.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent clarification that a plaintiff making a retaliation claim \u201cmust establish that his or her protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that Khalfani has adequately shown pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">Khalfani\u2019s second claim was for race and color discrimination. In his briefing, Khal-f\u00e1ni focuses on two arguments: (1) that he did not violate Balfour\u2019s policy when he threw out the tenant property, and (2) even if he did violate the policy, the policy was inconsistently applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">Turning to the first issue, there is evidence in the summary judgment record that there was no written documentation of a policy about not disposing of material left by tenants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even assuming this is true, as we do, it is of no moment. We have held that a good faith termination based on neutral reasons \u2014 even mistaken reasons \u2014 does not violate antidiscrimination law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The key inquiry is thus whether Khalfani\u2019s supervisor <em>believed </em>that Khalfani\u2019s actions violated procedure, not whether those actions actually violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>such a policy. And as the district court noted, there is no evidence in the record in support of that proposition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Next, Khalfani argues that the tenant property policy was inconsistently applied, and puts forth testimony from his deposition that other inspectors had thrown out resident property and had not been terminated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is not enough. Though we have held that differential treatment of similarly-situated employees can show pretext, we require that the contexts be \u201cnearly identical,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and here there is no evidence in the record about the relative contexts of employees who were responsible for the disposal of tenant property. As a consequence, Khalfani\u2019s second pretext argument falls short.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, as well as the reasons expressed in the district court opinion, we AFFIRM the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
