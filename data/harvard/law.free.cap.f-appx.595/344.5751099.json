Sanchez appeals his 33-month sentence. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cuyler, </em>298 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">Sanchez first challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) based on the finding that the presence of 34 total occupants in a vehicle rated for carrying a maximum of 15 passengers created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. Sanchez argues that, without some other aggravating circumstance, the overcrowding of passengers is insufficient to support the application of the enhancement. The pertinent issue, though, is whether there was \u201csubstantial\u201d overcrowding. <em>See United States v. Mateo Garza, </em>541 F.3d 290, 293-94 (5th Cir.2008). The district court implicitly found that the overcrowding here was substantial. That finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.; United States v. De Jesus-Ojeda, </em>515 F.3d 434, 442 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>enhancement. <em>See Mateo Garza, </em>541 F.3d at 293-94; \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6), comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Sanchez also challenges the application of a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) based on the finding that he played an aggravating role in the offense. The presentence report indicated that two of Sanchez\u2019s codefendants stated that Sanchez hired them to transport illegal aliens. Although Sanchez refutes these statements, he has not rebutted the reliability of the presentence report\u2019s recitation of the statements by the required showing that they are \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 320 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). After reviewing the record, we are not left with \u201ca definite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court was mistaken in its assessment of Sanchez\u2019s role in the offense, <em>see United States v. Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 590 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court did not err in applying this enhancement either.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
