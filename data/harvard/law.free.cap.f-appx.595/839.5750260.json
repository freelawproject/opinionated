After thorough review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). The applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue, and the savings clause imposes a subject matter jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. The petitioner bears the burden of showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention for purposes of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1262. We construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings liberally,' though issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Holland v. Gee, </em>677 F.3d 1047, 1066-67 (11th Cir.2012). We may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied on by the district court. <em>Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">A person convicted of knowingly violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) shall be imprisoned \u201cnot more than ten years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, the ACCA imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g) after sustaining three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e). A violent felony under the ACCA is a crime punishable by a prison term of one year that also: \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). In <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the Supreme Court held that, in determining whether a crime is a violent felony under the ACCA, it considers the offense \u201cgenerieally,\u201d that is to say, in terms of how the state statute defines the offense, and not in terms of how a particular offender committed it on a specific occasion. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">A district court has the power to grant a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner in custody in that district. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. This power, however, is limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by [a \u00a7 2255 motion], shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The last twenty words of \u00a7 2255(e) are commonly referred to as the \u201csavings clause.\u201d An application for a writ of habeas corpus includes a petition filed under \u00a7 2241. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">When a prisoner has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from a court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h). These restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1267. Consequently, a petitioner who filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied may not circumvent the restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions by simply filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause has developed over time. In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>we held that a petitioner could satisfy the savings clause if: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a non-existent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. 177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). Wofford\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, however, did not met these requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 1238, 1245. Then, in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>we said that a \u00a7 2241 petitioner could satisfy the savings clause if he was wrongly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, since his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon did not qualify as a crime of violence. 609 F.3d 1159, 1165-67 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(\u201cGilbert I\u201d), vacated on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(\u201cGilbert II\u201d). </em>We noted that Gilbert\u2019s career-offender enhancement, with only one prior predicate crime of violence, satisfied Wofford\u2019s requirement for a conviction for a \u201cnonexistent offense,\u201d since \u201cbeing a career offender is essentially a separate offense ... for which separate and additional punishment is provided.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">On rehearing en banc, however, we rejected Gilbert\u2019s assumption that he was convicted of the non-existent offense of being a career offender, explaining that \u201c[a] defendant who is convicted and then has the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement, or any other guidelines enhancement, applied in the calculation of his sentence has not been convicted of being guilty of the enhancement.\u201d <em>Gilbert II, </em>640 F.3d at 1320. We said that Guidelines enhancements are not crimes that have to be charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>As a result, we concluded that the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323. Because Gilbert was not sentenced in excess of his statutory maximum, we declined to \u201cdecide if the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) would permit a prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition claiming that he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Thereafter, in <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>we recognized the issue left open in <em>Gilbert II, </em>but declined to resolve it, instead holding that <em>Wofford </em>resolved the petitioner\u2019s appeal because he could not show that our caselaw foreclosed his objection to treating his two prior Florida burglary convictions as ACCA predicate violent felonies. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>1332, 1343-44 (11th Cir.2013). We said that <em>Wofford </em>established two necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, conditions for a sentencing claim to pass muster under the savings clause: (1) \u201cthe claim must be based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe Supreme Court decision must have overturned a circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>-at 1343. We held that, because there was no circuit precedent during the petitioner\u2019s direct and collateral attacks that \u201csquarely held\u201d his predicate Florida burglary conviction was a violent felony for ACCA purposes, his original \u00a7 2255 motion was not \u201can ineffective test of his claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1344^5. Rejecting the argument that <em>Begay </em>was the \u201ccircuit-law busting, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision\u201d required by <em>Wofford, </em>we clarified that the Supreme Court case must be \u201ccircuit-law busting\u201d in that it overturned circuit precedent that specifically addressed the claim the prisoner now asserted. <em>Id. </em>at 1346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In <em>Bryant, </em>we addressed the issue left open in <em>Gilbert II, </em>and held that, for a petitioner to bring a \u00a7 2241 challenge to the legality of his detention on the ground that a prior state conviction was not a predicate offense for purposes of the ACCA, he must make a five-part showing that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. First, a petitioner must show that, \u201cthroughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our Circuit\u2019s binding precedent had specifically addressed [his] distinct prior state conviction that triggered \u00a7 924(e) and had squarely foreclosed [his] \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the 10-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, a petitioner must identify a Supreme Court decision announced after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding that overturned our precedent \u201cthat had squarely foreclosed [his] \u00a7 924(e) claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, he must show that the Supreme Court\u2019s new rule applies retroactively on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>Fourth, he must show that, as a result of the new rule being retroactive, his current sentence exceeds \u00a7 924(a)\u2019s ten-year statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>Finally, he must show that \u201cthe savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his pure \u00a7 924(e)[] error claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Bryant, </em>we expressly declined to decide how to evaluate a \u00a7 2241 petition filed by a prisoner who originally was sentenced in another circuit, under that circuit\u2019s law, and who filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in that circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 1276 n. 16. However, in <em>Samak v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>we looked to whether Fifth Circuit precedent had squarely foreclosed the claim of a prisoner who was charged, convicted, and sentenced in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. 766 F.3d 1271, 1275 n. 3 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Here, we reject Campbell\u2019s claim that his sentence erroneously was enhanced based on convictions for child abuse or that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>record shows, Campbell\u2019s petition fails to satisfy the first two elements of the <em>Bryant </em>test. First, Campbell has failed to identify any binding Fourth Circuit precedent in existence at the time of his sentencing, direct appeal, or initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings \u2014 and we can find none \u2014 that specifically addressed whether a conviction for child abuse under \u00a7 827.03 qualified as an ACCA violent felony. Nor has he cited anything that \u201csquarely foreclose^]\u201d at that time his claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the ten-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a). As a result, Campbell could have argued that his child-abuse conviction did not qualify as an ACCA violent felony at his sentencing in February 2007, and when he filed his \u00a7 2255 petition in April 2009. Because Campbell was afforded multiple procedural opportunities to assert his \u00a7 924(e) claim, he cannot satisfy the first <em>Bryant </em>element.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Second, Campbell failed to identify a Supreme Court decision overturning any precedent from the Fourth Circuit that purportedly squarely foreclosed his claim. Because there was no binding precedent that foreclosed his \u00a7 924(e) argument, it follows that no Supreme Court ruling could have overturned precedent foreclosing his claim. In short, Campbell has failed to satisfy the first two elements of the <em>Bryant </em>test, and the remedy under \u00a7 2255 was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">. In addition, we GRANT Appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file his reply brief out of time, but DENY AS UNNECESSARY his motion for leave to file a reply brief exceeding 15 pages. His motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">. Because the record refutes Campbell\u2019s claim that his sentence was enhanced based on a drug-trafficking conviction, the only remaining offense at issue is his child abuse conviction. Further, although Campbell asserts that his child-abuse conviction was based on a violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.04(1) (1995), the district court noted in Campbell\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings that the child-abuse conviction was under \u00a7 827.03. Under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.03(l)(b), the offense of child abuse is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>1. Intentional infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQLB\">2. An intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACvD\">3. Active encouragement of any person to commit an act that results or could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\">. We\u2019ve not addressed the government's procedural default claim because the applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional question that we must decide first. We\u2019ve also not addressed Campbell's claims concerning <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), <em>Alleyne v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), or his plea of nolo contendere, since he raises these issues for the first time on appeal. Finally, we recognize that the district court erroneously held that because Campbell did not assert actual innocence of the underlying conviction, <em>Gilbert II </em>foreclosed him from pursuing his ACCA sentencing claim under \u00a7 2255(e)'s savings clause. Since <em>Gilbert II, </em>we clarified in <em>Bryant </em>that prisoners can raise ACCA sentencing claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition via \u00a7 2255(e)'s savings clause if they meet a five-part test. Nevertheless, we may affirm for any reason supported by the record, and as we've already held, Campbell failed to show that \u00a7 2255(e)'s savings clause permitted his \u00a7 2241 petition under <em>Bryant.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
