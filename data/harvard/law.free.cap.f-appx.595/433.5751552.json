Gomez challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that a grant of benefits under the Family Unit Program (FUP), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.12, does not constitute an \u201cadmission in any status\u201d for the purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-19\">The BIA\u2019s legal determination that Gomez is ineligible for cancellation of removal is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>to the extent its determination relies upon interpretation of ambiguous provisions in the Immigration and Naturalization Act, such interpretation is reviewed in accordance with <em>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Ruiz-Romero v. Reno, </em>205 F.3d 837, 838 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also, e.g., Diaz v. Ashcroft, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 972, 973 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">In 1983,, Gomez entered the United States without inspection. His application for voluntary departure and employment authorization under the Family Fairness Program, later the FUP, was approved in 1991. He was granted legal permanent residence in October 1995. After his guilty-plea conviction for possession of a controlled substance in July 2002, he was charged with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229, and, at his removal hearing, sought cancellation of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). The immigration judge deemed him ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to meet the seven-years\u2019 continuous-residence requirement. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). The BIA agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-21\">Aliens who have been granted legal permanent resident status may seek cancellation of removal if they have \u201cbeen an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years, ha[ve] resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been <em>admitted in any status, </em>and ha[ve] not been convicted of any aggravated felony\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (emphasis added). According to Gomez, he met the requirement of being continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ously present seven years in the United States because he was \u201cadmitted in any status\u201d in 1991 when he was accepted into the FUP benefit program. This claim has been rejected by both the BIA in a precedential decision and by this court in a nonprecedential (persuasive) opinion. <em>E.g., Matter of Reza-Murillo, </em>25 I &amp; N Dec. 296, 299-300 (BIA 2010); <em>Diaz, </em>108 Fed.Appx. at 973-75. Moreover, insofar as Gomez asserts the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cadmission\u201d in both this case and in <em>Matter of Rezar-Murillo </em>is arbitrary and capricious, and assuming <em>arguendo </em>the term is ambiguous, no compelling evidence shows the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect under <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See, e.g., Dhuka v. Holder, </em>716 F.3d 149, 157 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
