On appeal, he argues that he is not removable as an aggravated felon because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>was not sentenced to a qualifying \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and (a)(48)(B). After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including whether a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>Dixon v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>768 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2014). Under the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound by a prior panel\u2019s holding unless that holding is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting en banc. <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">An aggravated felony includes \u201ca theft offense ... for Which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). A \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d is defined to include \u201cthe period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). An alien convicted of an aggravated felony after the time of his admission is removable on that basis. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In Georgia, a judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">fixing the sentence shall prescribe a determinate sentence for a specific number of months or years which shall be within the minimum and maximum sentences prescribed by law as the punishment for the crime. The judge imposing the sentence is granted power and authority to suspend or probate all or any part of the entire sentence under such rules and regulations as the judge deems proper[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azs\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-1 (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">In <em>United States v. Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir.2001), an alien defendant was sentenced by a Georgia state court to five years\u2019 confinement, but, after giving eight months of credit for time already served, the court permitted him to serve the remainder on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 1316-17. After later being convicted for a federal offense of unlawfully re-entering the United States without permission, he objected to an enhanced base offense level under U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) as a defendant convicted of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>Id. </em>at 1317. Specifically, he argued that the probated remainder could not be counted because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) did not merge probation into the \u201cterm of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">In rejecting that argument, we considered the definition of a \u201csuspension\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). <em>Id. </em>at 1317-19. We noted that, although the pre-Sentenc-ing Guidelines federal system treated suspension as a mere procedural step in the process of permitting a defendant to serve his sentence on probation, Georgia law treated suspension and probation as \u201cdistinct\u201d mechanisms by which sentencing courts could excuse a defendant from confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 1317-18. Nevertheless, because \u201cfederal statutes reflect federal understandings\u201d absent a contrary statement, we concluded that the federal meaning of \u201csuspension,\u201d that is, \u201ca procedural act that precedes a court\u2019s authorization for a defendant to spend part or all of the imposed prison sentence outside of prison,\u201d was controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 1319. We held that a \u201cterm of imprisonment,\u201d as defined under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B), encompassed \u201call parts of a sentence of imprisonment from which the sentencing court excuses the defendant, even if the court itself follows state law usage and describes the excuse with a word other than \u2018suspend.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, in <em>United States v. Guzman-Bera, </em>216 F.3d 1019 (11th Cir.2000), we concluded that, \u201cwhen a court does not order a period of incarceration and then suspend it, but instead im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>poses probation directly,\u201d the conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1021 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Here, the BIA did not err by dismissing Amaya-Flores\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s order of his removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) based on his aggravated felony. As the record shows, Amaya-Flores was sentenced to a four-year confinement term, to be served on probation, for his Georgia felony theft by taking conviction. Thus, like the defendant in <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>Amaya-Flores was formally sentenced to a multi-year confinement term, but allowed to serve his sentence on probation. While the remaining probated portion of Ayala-Gomez\u2019s sentence after credit for time served was four years and four months out of a total five years\u2019 confinement, Amaya-Flores was allowed to serve all four years of his confinement sentence on probation. This timing distinction is immaterial, however, since a \u201cterm of imprisonment,\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B), includes \u201call parts of a sentence of imprisonment from which the sentencing court excuses the defendant,\u201d which here included the entirety of the four-year confinement term to which Amaya-Flores was sentenced. <em>See Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Although the Georgia conviction record itself does not reference the word \u201csuspend\u201d or use that terminology, <em>Ayala-Gomez </em>held that Georgia\u2019s distinct usage of \u201cprobation\u201d and \u201csuspension\u201d does not determine whether an alien\u2019s sentence in fact was suspended for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). <em>See Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319; O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-1(a)(1). Rather, the federal meaning ascribed to \u201csuspension\u201d controls, which means an alien\u2019s sentence was suspended if he in fact was \u201cexeuse[d]\u201d from serving his sentenced term of confinement. <em>See Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319. Because Ama-ya-Flores indisputably was excused from serving his four-year confinement term, the four-year probationary period he served for his sentence counts toward his \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of applying 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Thus, the BIA and IJ correctly found that he qualified as an aggravated felon, removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">As for Amaya-Flores\u2019s arguments regarding the plain meaning of the language of his conviction record, it is clear from the record\u2019s face that he was sentenced to a confinement term of four years. Specifically, the conviction record provides that he was \u201csentenced to confinement for a period of 4 years following any period of confinement set forth above.\u201d We reject his claim that the \u201cfollowing any period of confinement set forth above\u201d language is internally inconsistent with the stated confinement period in his conviction record. Indeed, there is no such preceding confinement period set out above, so the additional language is not operative in his case. Nor, moreover, does that language show that Amaya-Flores <em>in fact </em>was not sentenced to a four-year confinement term, since the stated sentence in his conviction record plainly reflects that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">As for Amaya-Flores\u2019s claim that he was sentenced to \u201cstraight probation,\u201d that interpretation directly contradicts the plain terms of his conviction record, which says that he was \u201csentenced to confinement for a period of 4 years____[which] may be served on probation\u201d under certain conditions. For this reason, his reliance on <em>Guzman-Bera </em>is misplaced \u2014 that holding concerned only a direct sentence of straight probation, which he never received. <em>See Guzman-Bera, </em>216 F.3d at 1021. Finally, we are unpersuaded by his argument that <em>Ayala-Gomez </em>was wrongly decided, since we are bound by that holding under the prior panel precedent rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>until that case is overturned by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc. <em>See Smith, </em>236 F.3d at 1300 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
