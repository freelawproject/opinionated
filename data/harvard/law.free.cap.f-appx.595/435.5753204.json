In this appeal, she raises two challenges to the district court\u2019s conclusion that her prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence (COV) for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes. As she con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>cedes, these claims are reviewed for plain error only due to her failure to raise them in the district court. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">To demonstrate plain error, Ledezma-Rodriguez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If she makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">First, Ledezma-Rodriguez notes that the Texas theft statute encompasses conduct broader than the generic, contemporary definition of theft because this statute includes theft by deception. Because this statute is implicated by her burglary conviction, she argues, her burglary conviction does not amount to a COV. We recently rejected the argument that Texas theft is not equivalent to a generic theft offense due to the theft by deception provision of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 31.03(a). <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014). This argument is thus unavailing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Next, Ledezma-Rodriguez argues that the Texas statutory definition of an \u201cowner,\u201d which includes a person who has \u201ca greater right to possession of the property than the actor,\u201d Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d As she concedes, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2374, 185 L.Ed.2d 1091 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
