Failure on the part of the railroad companies to comply with the require-' ments of this article shall be deemed an abuse of their rights and privileges and subject to the correction and regulation of the Bailroad Commission.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">\u201cThat under the provisions of said articles 4580 and 4494 of the Eevised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, as thus amended, it is the duty of this plaintiff to run one train a day (Sundays excepted) over its said line upon a regularly published schedule, which train shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>sufficient to accommodate those offering themselves for transportation at places regularly established for their reception within a reasonable time prior to the schedule time of departure, and that the Railroad Commission of Texas has no power, authority or jurisdiction to regulate such passenger train service other than to require plaintiff to run one train a day, sufficient as aforesaid, and to require all passenger .trains to stop for a sufficient time to receive and let off passengers at such sta- \u2022 tions as may be designated by the- Commission, and that further than this the Railroad Commission of Texas, and these defendants, as such, are absolutely without authority or jurisdiction in the premises. That subject to the limitations of said articles 4494 and 4580 of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas this plaintiff has the absolute right to conclusively determine the number of its own trains for the transportation of passengers, and the schedules upon which the same shall be run; that article 4484 of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\">\u201c\u2018Such corporation shall have the right to regulate the time and manner in which the passengers and property shall be transported and the compensation to be paid therefor, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of this or any other law that may be enacted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201cThat said order herein complained of compels this plaintiff, in plain violation of the statutes hereinabove referred to, to install and operate another 'and different, and an additional passenger train each way each day, between the cities of Houston and Victoria, as provided in said order, notwithstanding defendant has now, did have at the time said order was made, and has had at all times prior thereto, in operation under, and in accordance with, regularly filed and published schedules, one passenger train each way each day over that portion of its line covered by said order, which train was fully adequate for the reception, accommodation and transportation of all passengers offering themselves for transportation thereon, and this complainant was thereby fully complying with all laws of the State of Texas, and with all of its duties as a common carrier under its charter applicable in the premises. Plaintiff therefore says that defendants were, and are, without power, authority or jurisdiction to make said order, in that the same is in violation of said section 2, article 10, of the Constitution of the State of Texas, is unauthorized by and in violation of the Railroad Commission Act, approved April 3, 1891, and is in direct violation of articles 4494, 4580 and 4484 of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, and is, therefore, void and of no effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201c(3) That said order herein complained of is unjust and unreasonable, in this, that plaintiff has now, did have at the time said order was entered, and has had at all times hereinbefore mentioned, in operation between the cities of Houston and San Antonio,.via the city of Victoria, and upon that portion of its railway covered by said order, to wit, over its Victoria Division, one passenger train each way in every day of twenty-four hours; that said train furnishes, and did furnish, at each and all of said times, ample and adequate accommodations for the transportation of all passengers and property which are now offered, or have at any time heretofore been offered for transportation at the regularly established depots of plaintiff within a reasonable time prior to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of departure thereof in accordance with its regularly published schedules, and which said trains were operated in full compliance with all the laws of the State of Texas, and that it is now, and was at each and all the times above mentioned, unjust and unreasonable to require the installation of other and additional trains, and that it is an unjust and unreasonable interference with the business of this plaintiff to undertake to compel it to install and operate, as demanded by said order, another and an additional passenger train, as provided in said order, and that, therefore, said order is in all things unjust and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">\u201c(4) Plaintiff further says that said order, which compels it to install and operate one additional passenger train each way each day of twenty-four hours between San Antonio and Houston, via Victoria, is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which is as follows: 'Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law,\u2019 in this, that, as hereinbefore alleged, plaintiff has now, had at the time of making said order, and has at all times heretofore had in operation upon all its lines in the State of Texas, and especially upon that portion of same covered by said order, passenger trains as above set out, fully adequate to the reasonable accommodation of all persons and property offering themselves as above set out for transportation, which said passenger trains were installed, operated and conducted in full compliance with all the laws of the State of Texas, and in full compliance with the charter obligations of this plaintiff, and that thereby this plaintiff was, at the time of said order, has continuously since, and is now, fully and in all things discharging its duties to the public as a common carrier of passengers, and that said order, which seeks to impose upon this complainant the burden of installing, operating and conducting another and an additional passenger train, invades the private and individual rights of plaintiff to conduct and manage its private and individual affairs as it sees fit, and is an unwarranted invasion of its private and individual rights by governmental agency; and plaintiff alleges that, for the same reason, said order is violative of section 9, article 1, of the Constitution of the State of Texas, in that it is thereby deprived of its life, liberty, property, privileges and immunities without due course of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">''(5) Plaintiff further alleges that the several legislative Acts under and by virtue of which it was chartered to act as a common carrier of freight and passengers hereinabove set out, constitute and are a valid contract by and between the plaintiff and the State of Texas, under and by virtue of which it is permitted to conduct the business of a common carrier of freight and passengers subject only to the reasonable exercise of the police power of the State, and that, subject to such power, it has the right to conduct its private and individual business and affairs without interference by the Bailroad Commission of Texas or other governmental agency thereof; that the order complained of is an unreasonable, unjust and unwarranted interference with such rights, and deprives complainant of the right to manage its own business, and renders it unable to discharge its duties either to the public or its owners, and is, therefore, violative of paragraph 1 of section 10 of article <em>2 </em>of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>stitution of the United States, which provides that: \u2018No State shall pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts or granting any title of nobility.\u2019 And that, for the same reason, said order is violative of section 16, article 1, of the Constitution of the State of Texas, which provides that no bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-3\">IX. \u201cThat under the provisions of article 4576 of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, as amended, it is provided that: \u2018If any railway doing business in this State shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey any lawful requirement, order, judgment or decree made by the Railroad Commission of Texas, for every such act of violation it shall pay to the State of Texas a, penalty of not more than five thousand dollars.\u2019 That said penalty is so grossly excessive in amount, and so out of due, proportion to the offense denounced, as to constitute excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment, forbidden by section 13 of article 1 of the Constitution of the State of Texas, which provides that excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel nor unusual punishment inflicted, and deprives plaintiff of due process of law, and denies it the equal protection of the law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. That it is uncertain, from the terms of the order herein complained of, and from the terms of said article 4576 of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas, as amended, whether each day that plaintiffs fail to run two passenger trains provided thereby shall constitute a violation of said order punishable by said penalty of not more than five thousand dollars, or whether the State is entitled to recover but one penalty therefor; and it is further uncertain, from the terms of said order, when the same shall become effective\u2014whether immediately, or at such reasonable time as may be necessary to obtain equipment and publish the schedule demanded thereby; that for said reasons said order, as well as said statute 4576, is unjust, unreasonable, null and void. That under the provisions 6 and 7 of said Act of April 3, 1891, being articles 4565 and 4566 of the Revised Civil Statutes, a right of action is given to any railroad company dissatisfied with any order or regulation adopted by the Commission, to determine whether or not the same is reasonable or just by action filed against the same in any court of competent jurisdiction in Travis County, Texas, and that, under the provisions of said Acts of April 3, 1891, being article 4579 of the Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, it is made the duty of the Railroad Commission to enforce all orders made by it and report the same to the Attorney-General of the State of Texas, who will thereupon institute suit for the recovery of such penalties as may have accrued by reason of such violation; that unless the relief hereinafter prayed for is granted, plaintiff is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief charges that said Robert Vance Davidson, the Attorney-General of the State of Texas, and defendant herein, will, under instruction of his codefendants, undertake to prosecute successive suits for the collection of such penalty of five thousand dollars, claiming a violation of such order for each successive day that plaintiff fails to install and operate each train, as provided in said order herein sought to be enjoined, and that thereby this plaintiff will be subjected to a mul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tiplicity of suits and subjected to a great and needless annoyance and vexation, and that if the plaintiff awaits the action of the Attorney-General of the State of Texas herein it will subject itself to successive prosecutions for penalties under the statutes aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\">X. \u201cThat plaintiff\u2019s said original petition, in paragraph 10 thereof, prayed that defendants, and each of them, be cited according to law, and for immediate issuance of temporary writ of injunction restraining and enjoining the Eailroad Commission of Texas, and the said defendants, Mayfield, Storey and Colquitt, from putting in force or continuing in force the order hereinabove complained of, and enjoining and restraining them, and each of them, from instructing the said Eobert Vance Davidson, defendant, to institute, or cause to be instituted, against this plaintiff any suit or suits for the violation of said order, and restraining and enjoining them, and each of them, or their agents, from delivering to the said Eobert Vance Davidson, or any other person, any copy of said order, certified or otherwise, or from certifying to, or in any manner whatsoever reporting to, the Attorney-General or other officers of the State of Texas any evidence or facts showing that plaintiff, its officers or agents, have not observed, or do not observe, said order, and from restraining and enjoining the said Eobert Vance Davidson from instituting or causing to be instituted against plaintiff, its officers or agents, any suit, prosecution or proceeding of any character whatsoever for the collection of any penalty or penalties for the violation of said order, or compelling the performance thereof, and restraining and enjoining the said Eailroad Commission of Texas, the said Mayfield, Storey and Colquitt, from making any other order or doing any other act or thing in and about the matter embraced therein, pending the action of this Honorable Court; and that, upon final hearing herein, plaintiff have judgment perpetuating said injunction, and declaring said order hereinabove referred to to be unreasonable, void and of no effect, and for costs, and all such other relief, general and special, as it might be entitled to, either at law or in equity, for which see paragraph 10 of such original petition on file herein.

We find that on May 28, 1907, the said respondent railway company discontinued the operation of the double daily passenger train service between the stations above named, to wit, Houston and San Antonio, over the so-called Victoria Division, as above described, and beginning on said date the said Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Eailway Company installed and begun the operation, over said Victoria Division, of a single daily passenger train service, to wit, one daily passenger train only in each direction for the accommodation of the traveling public and passenger business arising at and destined to points on said Victoria Division, the said single daily service being comprised of trains Hos. 303 and 304, running between San Antonio and Victoria, and trains Hos. 301 and 302 between Victoria and Houston, all of said trains being operated in accordance with the published schedule, as contained in Employes\u2019 Time-Table Ho. 10, issued by said railway company, and filed by it with the Eailroad Commission of Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">\u201c3.

Thereupon the defendants announced in open court that they would decline to amend, and that they desired to make no further answer in the cause, and it appearing to the court that the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s petition are duly verified, and not denied by any pleading filed by the defendants, the court is of the opinion that judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201cIt is therefore by the court further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the order of defendant, the Eailroad Commission of Texas, of date July 20, 1907, directing the plaintiff, the Galveston, Harrisburg '&amp; San Antonio Eailroad Company, on or before the 1st day of August, 1907, to re-install and re-establish a double daily passenger train service between the cities of Houston and San Antonio, over the Victoria Division of its railway, via Victoria, as they supplied it prior to May 28, 1907, and that the Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Eailway Company arrange its schedule for said double daily passenger train service, and file a copy of same with the Eailroad Commission of Texas, said order to become effective August 1, 1907, be declared unjust, unreasonable, void and of no effect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\">\u201cIt is by the court further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the defendants, the Eailroad Commission of Texas, Allison Mayfield, Leonidas Jefferson Storey and Oscar Branch Colquitt, be perpetually enjoined from putting in force, or from continuing in force or effect, said order, this injunction to be effective as of date July 23, 1907; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that said defendants, and each of them, be and are hereby restrained from instructing defendant Eobert Vance Davidson, Attorney-General of the State of Texas, to institute or cause to be instituted against plaintiff any suit or suits for the violation of said order, and that they, and each of them, and their agents, be restrained and enjoined from delivering to the said defendant Eobert Vance Davidson, his agents or attorneys, or any other person, any copy of said order, whether certified or otherwise, and from certifying, or in any manner whatsoever reporting to the Attorney-General, or any officer of the State of Texas, any evidence or facts showing that plaintiff, its officers or agents, have not observed, or do not observe, said order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the defendant Eobert Vance Davidson, Attorney-General of the State of Texas, be and is hereby enjoined and restrained from instituting or causing to be instituted against plaintiff, its officers or agents, any suit, prosecution or- proceeding of any character whatsoever for the collection of any penalty or penalties for the violation of said order, or compelling the performance thereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that said defendants, the Eailroad Commission of Texas, Mayfield, Storey and Colquitt, be enjoined and restrained from making any other order, or doing any other act or thing in and about the matter embraced in said order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that defendants pay all costs of this suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cTo all of which judgment and to each and all of said orders the defendants in open court excepted, and gave notice of appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals for the Third Supreme Judicial District of Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Opinion.\u2014The plaintiff\u2019s petition, which is verified by affidavit, contains a distinct averment stating the facts upon which it is based\u2014that the rule or order of the Commission which requires the operation of more than one passenger train each way a day is unreasonable and un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>just. The defendants by answer did not see fit to deny this fact or controvert it in any manner, but were content with merely meeting the plaintiffs case with a general demurrer, and when the same was overruled declined, so the judgment states, to further answer. The general demurrer admits the truth of the facts well pleaded, and the petition being verified, the trial court, in accordance with the usual practice in such cases, properly rendered judgment against the defendants. Junction City School Incorporation v. Trustees of School District, 81 Texas, 148, <em>152.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">It is not believed that the law that announces, in effect, that the rules of the Commission are held to be prima facie correct, and that one attacking same shall only prevail when the evidence satisfactorily establishes the fact that such rules are unjust and unreasonable, was intended to control or abrogate the well-settled rules that prevail in cases of this kind, which entitle the plaintiff to judgment when no answer is filed and when the petition is verified and a general demurrer is overruled. Whatever other reasons may have influenced the court below to render judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, the one just discussed is sufficient upon which to base our affirmance; and but for the fact that the judgment below went a little too far we would not feel the necessity'of expressing any opinion as to the authority of the Railroad Commission to pass and promulgate the order in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The judgment restraining the defendants from putting into operation and effect an order requiring the operation of two trains a day each way seems to be perpetual, and if -this is its correct construction it went too far, provided the law authorized the Railroad Commission to pass and enter such an order. While the judgment rendered in this case is a bar to the enforcement of the order up to date, if the law authorized the passage of such an order it could be made and enforced hereafter, provided the public interests required it, and the circumstances exist that authorize that to be done. Thus it will be seen it becomes proper, if not necessary, to pass upon the question whether the Commission was authorized by law to make and pass such an order, or would be authorized in the future to make a like order if public necessities required it.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We have examined the Act of the Twenty-eighth Legislature on page 183 of the Session Laws of 1903, and conclude that one of its objects was to confer upon the Railroad Commission the power to require, if the circumstances and the demands of the public require it, the operation of more than one passenger train a day each way. As the jurisdiction of this case is not limited to this court, it would serve no useful purpose to enter upon a discussion of this question, or give the reasons that influence us in placing this construction upon the statute; but; however, we desire to emphasize the fact that we believe the Commission derives no power from the common law, but can find authority for the order in question in the statute referred to, and further exercise of this authority is a question to be determined hereafter by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We find it unnecessary to pass upon the objections to that part of the decree that seeks to restrain the Attorney-General from bringing suits to enforce the statute prescribing penalties for a breach of the orders and rules passed by the Commission; for, under the disposition made of the case, he certainly could not act to recover a penalty for the violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>of an order which the court below and this court has determined should not,'up to the final determination of this case, be \"enforced, on the ground, as above said, that as to the facts existing up to the time of this judgment the order has been judicially ascertained to be unreasonable and unjust. What may occur hereafter, if anything, looking to the making and enforcement of an order- based upon facts arising since this judgment, which, in the opinion of the Commission, may, in the public interest, require more than the operation of one train, is a question not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">Let the judgment be affirmed as modified by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\n<em>Modified and affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">OPINION ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the original opinion, in holding that the Commission could exercise only such authority as was expressly or impliedly conferred upon it by statute, we did not intend to hold that the State, in its sovereign capacity, acting through its proper channel, could not, by mandamus or other appropriate remedy, proceed against a railway corporation to require it to perform those duties for which it. was chartered, and to furnish those facilities for transportation that the needs of the public required. State v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 44 So. Rep., 213; s. c., 53 Fla., 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">, In the case before us we are not required to pass upon that question, as, in our opinion, it was not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">We are still of the opinion that the averments of the petition, when tested by the general demurrer, were sufficient. It is substantially alleged that the trains provided by the road were sufficient to transport all persons who applied for transportation, and to transport all property offered for transportation. This is about all that could be required of the road, and it certainly ought not to be required to operate trains for which there is no need. The case cited, quoting from Loraine v. Pittsburg, J. &amp; E. &amp; E. Ry. Co., 205 Pa., 132; s. c., 54 At., 580; 61 L. R. A., 502, uses this language:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u201cThere can be no doubt of the duty of a railway company to keep its road in a reasonable state of repair and in a safe condition; nor is there any doubt of its duty to so operate it as to afford adequate facilities for the transaction of such business as may be offered it, or at least reasonably to be expected. This is equally true with respect to passengers and freight. As to the extent or sufficiency of these facilities, including the number and frequency of trains, that is to be judged of and governed chiefly by the amount of business on the line of the road. The company, however, is given, as it should be, a very large discretion in determining all questions relating to the equipment and operation of its road.\u201d Ohio &amp; M. Ry. Co. v. People, 120 Ill., 200; 11 N. E. Rep., 347; 30 Am, &amp; Eng. Ry. Cases, 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">This, in our opinion, expresses the correct view upon that question, subject, however, to the authority of the State, or the Railroad Commission, in a proper case, to control such discretion when the interest of the public requires that this should be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
