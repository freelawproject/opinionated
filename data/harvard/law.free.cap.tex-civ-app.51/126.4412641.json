Again, under this charge a double recovery was permitted in that his recovery for permanent injury and diminished capacity to earn money is not limited to the future, but is permitted to embrace the time from the date of the injury down to the present time, and thus in this case has, under the charge of the court necessarily permitted the plaintiff to recover twice for his loss of time, and twice for his diminished capacity to earn money.

R. Johnson, as damages for personal injuries. On a former appeal a judgment adverse to appellee, in accordance with a peremptory instruction, was reversed, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>will fully appear from the opinion published in the 42 Texas Civ. App., 604. The record on the present appeal is very voluminous and the assignments of error numerous, and we do not feel very confident of our ability to satisfactorily dispose of all of the assignments within reasonable limit, but will make the effort to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">Appellee\u2019s case, as made by his pleadings and as supported by evidence in his behalf, in substance, is that about October 15, 1902, he was in appellant\u2019s employ at the town of Cisco, in Eastland County; that he received from appellant\u2019s master mechanic a telegram requiring him to go from Cisco to Waco; that in obedience thereto he proceeded upon one of appellant\u2019s passenger trains operated between the points named, and when a few miles out from Cisco the conductor of the train directed that he leave the train at Walnut Springs, some distance beyond in the direction of Waco, and there procure a formal pass authorizing his passage; that this direction was later also given by appellant\u2019s master mechanic, who later boarded the same train at an intermediate station; that pursuant to such order, upon the arrival of the train at Walnut Springs, he disembarked and proceeded to the proper office for obtaining passes, as directed, but that before he had been able to secure the same the train started and in his effort to retake passage, his foot slipped upon some rolling substance on the depot platform or approach and he was thrown under the train and injured, as alleged. Negligence was charged in respect to the construction of the depot platform, and in the failure of the conductor to stop the train at Walnut Springs a reasonable time within which appellee could procure the pass sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Appellee objects to a number of the assignments of error on the ground that the assignments themselves contain numerous reasons for the objection made, some of which are contradictory. The assignments, however, are mainly to specified clauses of the court\u2019s charge, which, without further specification, have been held sufficient to invoke consideration. We therefore conclude that the assignments should be considered, rejecting all reasons given in the assignments that have not been carried forward by appropriate proposition thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">So proceeding, it is to be noted that in appellant\u2019s first assignment objection is made to the court\u2019s definition of contributory negligence, and in the same connection to the tenth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge in applying that issue to the facts. The court defined contributory negligence as follows: \u201c \u2018Contributory negligence\u2019 means where the plaintiff does some negligent act or omits to perform some act which, co-operating with some negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant, contributes to and is the proximate cause of the injury.\u201d The tenth paragraph is as follows: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that plaintiff, in leaving said train to get said pass and in attempting to board said train under the circumstances and conditions then existing and surrounding him, did not act with that degree of care, discretion or prudence for his own safety that a person of ordinary care would have done under the circumstances, and further believe from the evidence that such acts on the part of the plaintiff were the cause of his injury, then he would be guilty of contributory negligence and can not recover, and you should find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The evidence clearly raises the issue of contributory negligence. That of appellee indicates experience on his part in boarding moving trains and that at the time he endeavored to get upon the train it was moving only four or five miles per hour. Other witnesses, however, who testified in behalf of appellant would have authorized an inference that it was traveling at a rate of from eight to twelve miles per hour, and the main contention on the part of appellant is that the charges quoted submitted the issue of proximate cause when it was not, under the evidence, in issue, contrary to the ruling of our Supreme Court in Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Rowland, 90 Texas, 365; Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. McCoy, 90 Texas, 264; Culpepper v. International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co., 90 Texas, 627; and of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District in Ry. Co. v. Hubbard, 70 S. W., 112. We do no.t feel prepared to extend the rulings of our Supreme Court in the cases cited from the 90 Texas to the extent that seems to have been done in Ry. Co. v. Hubbard, but whatever may be said of these cases and of the principle invoiced, we find that appellant is not in the attitude of being able to complain in this case. The court\u2019s definition of contributory negligence we think is in substantial compliance with approved forms. International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Garcia, 75 Texas, 591; Martin, Wise &amp; Fitzhugh v. Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co., 67 Texas, 121; Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Henning, 39 S. W., 302; International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Anchonda, 33 Texas Civ. App., 24; St. Louis &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. McClain, 80 Texas, 96; St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Casseday, 92 Texas, 525; 1 Thompson on Negligence, sec. 169. And the court, at appelIant\u2019s request, gave a special charge to the effect that even though the jury might find negligence on appellant\u2019s part, as alleged by appellee, yet if they should further find that appellee in attempting to board defendant\u2019s train at the time and place and under the circumstances that he did attempt to do so, \u201cand that in so doing he was guilty of contributory negligence, as that term has been defined in the court\u2019s charge,\u201d they should find for appellant. Appellant also requested special charge Ho. 16, which was refused. In this charge appellant\u2019s right to a verdict was among other things made expressly dependent upon a finding that appellee was guilty of negligence \u201cwhich proximaiely contributed to his injury.\u201d So that we think on the whole appellant invited the error of which it principally complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-37\">There would seem to be much force in the suggestion that the court in the tenth clause of the charge improperly placed the burden upon appellant to show that appellee\u2019s contributory negligence was \u201cthe cause of his injury.\u201d It would only have been necessary, of course, for appellant to show that the negligent acts of appellee, if any, proximaiely contributed to his injury. But this objection in principle seems to be treated by appellant as the same as that involved in the objection first discussed, and in view of the character of the proof and of the requested charge given, we do not feel prepared to hold that the inadvertent omission, as it would seem, of the court to use the term \u201cproximate\u201d immediately before the term \u201ccause,\u201d in the -tenth paragraph, requires a reversal. If the jury adopted the trend of appellant\u2019s evidence on this issue they could but believe that appellee\u2019s own negligence was not only the cause, but the proximate cause of his injury. On the contrary, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the jury credited appellee\u2019s testimony on the issue, as they evidently did, they could hardly find him guilty of contributory negligence. Besides, it is to be noted that the charge was one authorizing a verdict for defendant only, and correct, as, far as appellant can complain, and fairly within the rule applied by our Supreme Court in disposing of a charge submitting the issue of contributory negligence in the case of Chicago, R. I. &amp; G. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, 101 Texas, 422. We conclude that appellant\u2019s first assignment should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj4\">Under the second assignment it is insisted that the court submitted an erroneous measure of damages, the contention being that the court\u2019s charge authorized a double recovery. The charges objected to are as follows: <em>\u201c12. </em>If, under the foregoing instructions, you find for the plaintiff, you should allow him such sum in money as damages as, in your judgment, if paid to him in cash at the present time, would fairly compensate him for the injuries, if any, you find he has sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"AMR\"><em>\u201c13. </em>In estimating and arriving at the sum or amount of damages, if any, which you may allow plaintiff, you should fake into consideration the physical and mental suffering of the plaintiff, his loss of time, permanent injury, if any, his diminished capacity to earn money, if you find that his capacity to earn money has been diminished, resulting from the injuries, which you may find he has sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">We think the objection made to these clauses, which are treated together, should be overruled. The twelfth clause manifestly gave the proper rule, by which it was the duty of the jury to be guided in compensating appellee in the event they found for him, and we think the thirteenth paragraph, immediately following, amounted in substance but to a direction to the jury to consider all of the evidence on the issue. Unlike some of the charges condemned in the authorities cited by appellant, the jury were not expressly directed to find damage upon all grounds specified in the thirteenth paragraph, but merely, as before stated, to consider these elements of which proof had been made without objection in determining what would fairly compensate appellee. See Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Fink, 44 Texas Civ. App., 544; Missouri, K. <em>&amp; </em>T. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Hibbitts, 49 Texas Civ. App., 419.</p>\n<p id=\"ACW\">Under appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments numerous objections are made to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the court\u2019s charge, which are too voluminous for insertion. We deem it sufficient to say that the charges referred to were not erroneous, or, at least, not prejudicial in submitting the issue of whether appellee was a passenger. We think he was a passenger, as indicated in our opinion on a former appeal, but if not, the court nowhere in his charge required of appellant the exercise of that high degree of care applicable to passengers, Bor were the charges objectionable in requiring appellant to give plaintiff a reasonable time in which to procure passes, and return to and board the train, before putting it in motion. The authority of appellant\u2019s officers to direct him to get passes at Walnut Springs does not seem to be questioned. It seems to us that it must be assumed that they had such authority, and, if so, the least that could be required of appellant was to give appellee a reasonable time to accomplish the thing he had been directed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-52\">'Bor is it clear by any means that the record sustains appellant\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>tention that the court submitted the issue of whether the approaches and platforms to the train had been safely constructed and maintained in reasonable condition. It certainly was not done as a distinct ground of recovery. But, if submitted at all, the issue was invited by appellant\u2019s special charge Ho. 8. As we construe the charge, it on the whole only submitted the issue of negligence on appellant\u2019s part in failing to hold the train a reasonable time, the theory of the charge, as we construe it, being that, in the event of negligence on appellant\u2019s part in this respect, appellee would be entitled to recover in the absence of con-tributary negligence by him. We think this theory correct. In that event it is entirely immaterial whether the rolling substance, upon which appellee testifies he was caused to slip, had been negligently permitted to remain upon the platform or not. If it ivas there, the fact that it entered into the cause of the injury would in no way lessen the liability for appellant\u2019s failure to delay the train a reasonable time, and it seems certain that the jury could not have inferred, from the clauses of the court\u2019s charge under consideration, that negligence in respect to the platform was assumed, for in the sixth clause of the court\u2019s charge the jury were expressly instructed that this issue was for them alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Humerous other objections are made to various clauses of the court\u2019s charge, but we think none of the objections are well taken. The issues as a whole seem to have been fairly submitted to the jury, and, without further discussion of objections to the charges, we think all objections thereto should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-18\">Appellant relied upon, and offered in evidence, the following release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-19\">\u201cThe State of Texas<em>,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATC\">County of McLennan,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqN\">Know all men by these presents:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-22\">\u201cThat whereas, on the 15th day of October, 1902, I, D.

R. Johnson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>It was admitted that the recited consideration for this release was unpaid, and the consideration, as pleaded by appellant, was that \u201cappellee would be permitted to remain in the service of the company under the same terms of employment as existed before the accident to him, to wit, employment by the month, and subject to the right of the defendant to discontinue his services at any time for any cause.\u201d The release was clearly void under the decisions. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Smith, 98 Texas, 47; East Line &amp; R. R. R. Co. v. Scott, 72 Texas, 77. Eor was it aided by appellee\u2019s pleadings, conditionally stating a different consideration in answer to this defense. The court therefore did not err in.instructing the jury to disregard the release, nor in refusing appellant\u2019s special charges on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"AWPt\">The remaining assignment, that we deem necessary to specifically mention, rests upon the contention that \u201cthe evidence conclusively shows that the injuries of the plaintiff were due to his own contributory negligence in attempting to board the defendant\u2019s train at an unusual and dangerous place,\u201d etc. We think, however, that the evidence was such as made the issue one for the jury. As stated, appellee testified in substance that, upon his arrival at Walnut Springs, he forthwith repaired to the warehouse of appellant, in which the master mechanic had his office at which passes could be obtained, and that before the agent writing them out had completed them, appellee heard the bell ringing, and immediately started out and toward the approaching train, and before it had attained a rate of speed in excess of four or five miles an hour he secured hold upon the hand railings of the coach, when his foot slipped upon some rolling substance, and he was thrown under the revolving wheels. We do not think it can be said that this evidence conclusively shows contributory negligence on appellee\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"AiB\">All assignments are accordingly overruled, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3it\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
