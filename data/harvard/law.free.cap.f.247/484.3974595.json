The United States moved the District Court to annul its order admitting Antonio Morena to citizenship and to cancel his certificate of naturalization. The motion was denied and the United States took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">In view of conflicting decisions in several jurisdictions upon the question here in issue, and with the object of obtaining a ruling that \u2022would insure uniformity in the administration of the said act, this court certified several questions to the Supreme Court of the United Stales (Judicial Code [Act March 3, 1911, c. 231] \u00a7 239, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St. 1916, \u00a7 1216]), of which the one controlling the decision in this case is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cIs an alien who has made a declaration of intention before the act of 1906 required, to file his petition for citizenship at a time not more than, seven years after the date of the act?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Supreme Court has answered this question in the affirmative. 245 U. S. 392, 38 Sup. Ct. 151, 62 E. Ed. -\u2014. The decree of the District Court, dismissing the petition of the United States, is therefore reversed, with the direction that the order admitting Antonio Morena to citizenship be vacated, and the certificate of citizenship granted thereupon be canceled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
