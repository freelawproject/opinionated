The order was made in the \u2022 administration of the property of the defendant, which came first into \u25a0this court by a creditor\u2019s bill to sequester all the assets of the corporation and to prevent its dissipation by attachments, executions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>other legal process issued by its creditors. In May, 1912, the bill was filed and a decree entered on May 21, 1914, appointed temporary receivers for the corporation, followed on May 3\u00cd, 1914, by an order making permanent such receivers and directing them to conserve the assets of the company for its creditors. The assets of the corporation consisted for the most part of terms for years in real estate in the city of New York, among which was a lease to the corporation from certain individuals who were trustees under the will of William Barclay Parsons, deceased. The lease was made on January 21, 190S, and was at the yearly rent of \u00a333,500 a year. If had the usual covenants iu pay the taxes levied upon the property, rights o\u00a3 re-entry for defaults, and oilier clauses common in such cases. On June 3, 1912, the Parsons trustees applied to the District Court for leave to dispossess the receiver, who was in actual possession under the orders of May, 3912, and to take over the lease in accordance with the rights of re-entry therein provided, and this leave was given on July lit, 1912, and remained available to the lessors from that time on. At the time when the receiver was appointed the taxes were largely in arrears and the lessor had the right therefore to re-enter under its lease in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New York.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b660-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>&lt;\u00a73=&gt;For other cases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>On July 3, 3912, the. Equitable Trust Company, as trustee for bondholders under a mortgage executed on June 1, 1906, toy ancillary dependent bill began to foreclose that mortgage. The Empire Trust Company was a party defendant to this suit, as trustee under a junior mortgage of May <em>24, </em>1909, known as E-mortgage, which covered part of the assets of the defendant. On July 12, 1912, the receivership was divided, and one sec of receivers from that time forth took possession of and received the income from the property covered by the Equitable Trust Company mortgage which did not include the premises lea seal by the Parsons trustees. The third receiver, Joseph J. OThmolrae, continued as receiver of the rest of the property of the defendant, including the premises now in question. Finally, on November 20, 1912, the Empire Trust Company of New York, as trustee under the mortgage of May 2i, 1909, already mentioned, by ancillary dependent bill started to foreclose its mortgage (the B-mortgaga), and the receivership was extended to that property for the benefit of the Empire Trust Company as such trustee, and an order was signed on November 25, .1912, directing the disposition of the income from the properties to be made by the receiver.

In order to obtain the necessary money, which amounted to more than $30,000, on November 27, 1912, they petitioned the court for leave to issue receivers\u2019 certificates, the proceeds of which should go to pay these taxes, and relieve the term from the threat of re-entry, as well as to pay the interest due upon a mortgage of the term to the lessors. On the same day the court passed an order granting the prayer of this petition and authorizing the receiver to issue $30,000 of receivers\u2019 certificates.

On July second, 1915, the Parsons trustees filed certain objections to the account, of the receiver as so tiled, which matter stood over until April 13, 1916. Meanwhile, and on November 11, 1915, the Parsons trustees filed supplemental objections to the accounts, these latter seeking to raise the question whether the receivers\u2019 certificates had priority over their claims for rents which had arisen during the occupation of the receiver. The District Court on April 1, 1916, denied leave to the Parsons trustees to file the supplemental objections heretofore noticed, bnt referred the whole accounts as brought down by tlie revised summary of April 1, 1016, to a special master to take and state the same and to report on the proper allowances, claims and general distribution of the balance found due. \u2019This report the special master filed on June 13, 1916.

[1] Among the creditors of a receiver we see no reason why either the lessors or the certificate holders should enjoy a priority unless some such was established by the court. We are not dealing with a public service corporation (Texas Co. v. Int. &amp; G. North Co., 237 Fed. 921, 150 C. C. A. 571), and unless it appears that the court meant to postpone the certificate holders to the lessors, or vice versa, we can see no reason upon the hare origin of their claims why either should step ahead of the other. We recognize no difference in equity between the rent due, before the insolvency which was secured by the right of re-entry and which the certificates paid, and that due afterwards which was equally secured, and which the lessors forebore to assert by re-entry. Tt is true that under Durand &amp; Co. v. Howard &amp; Co., 216 Fed. 585, 132 C. C. A. 589, L. R. A. 1915B, 998, the claim for rent due before the insolvency was held not to he preferred in distribution, but that case rested upon the waiver of the existing forfeiture involved in asking the court to compel the receiver to exercise his option to affirm or reject. The lessors did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>not do ?o here, and theirs was a claim upon which they could have reentered. The supposition, therefore, that the certificates should be postponed, because their proceeds only went to pay an existing debt of the corporation, is not true in fact assuming it would in any case be a good distinction, which we do not decide. The consideration advanced by each class of creditors, the lessors and the certificate hold\u00e9rs, was for <em>the </em>essential preservation of the estate, since without it the best asset would have been lost. Each was a debt strictly within the powers of a court of equity which may pledge a part of the assets for the preservation of the rest; each was as much an operating expense as tire other.</p>\n<p id=\"AOs\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As in all such cases, the order authorizing the debt is the most conclusive evidence of the rank which the creditors should hold among other claims on the fund. This has been repeatedly used as the test in cases of receivers\u2019 certificates. Anderson v. Condict, 93 Fed. 349, 35 C. C. A. 335; In re John W. Farley Co., 227 Fed. 378, 142 C. C. A. 74; St. Louis Union Trust Co. v. Texas So. Ry. Co., 59 Tex. Civ. App. 157, 126 S. W. 297; Lewis v. Linden Steel Co., 183 Pa. 248, 38 Ath 606; In re J. B. &amp; J. M. Cornell (D. C.) 201 Fed. 381. The court having the fund in its custody may establish such priorities as it sees fit, at least as against such creditors, as take the credit of the receiver after the order authorizing the earlier debt had once been passed. Every one who deals with a receiver knows that he has the power to charge his estate only as the court may authorize him, and, if a prospective creditor fails to inquire how far the assets may be already incumbered, he takes the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We do not forget that the court is not absolutely bound to recognize the priorities fixed by the order, and that the matter is open to equitable readjustment, however conclusive a protection it may be to the receiver as to payments made under its terms. Louisville Ry. Co. v. Wilson, 138 U. S. 501, 506, 11 Sup. Ct. 405, 34 L. Ed. 1023. But, as we shall show, the orders in this case established no priorities as between the classes, and we are therefore relieved of the necessity of determining in what circumstances we should disregard them. All \u25a0we need assert is that, disregarding the orders, there is no inherent ground for priority between him who lends money to pay accrued rent which is secured and him who allows the use of his propert}'- upon the agreement that the accruing rent shall be paid. Just why it should be taken against the lessor that he thought it profitable to leave the pi-operty at the existing rent, or against the bondholders that they should have thought it profitable to assume the lease, does not appear obvious to us. We therefore proceed to consider the effect of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"AEP\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> The order of November 27, 1912, did not profess to give the certificates any priority except as against the mortgagees and the unsecured creditors. We pass the question whether those words were necessary in any event to give that priority if the order was granted after the mortgagees had become parties to the suit by asking to foreclose. Whether necessary or not, they meant to go no further in establishing priority than to put the certificates ahead of creditors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>secured and unsecured, of the corporation. As between themselves and other creditors of the receiver the certificate holders stood, so far as we can see, on a parity for tlie reasons given above. Hence it follows that the rule should apply of Lewis v. Linden Steel Co., 183 Pa. 248, 38 All. 606, and In re J. B. &amp; J. M. Cornell (D. C.) 201 Fed. 381, that the creditors of a receiver in the absence of some original marshaling to the contrary, or of some fundamental equity, shall share ratably. Therefore the fund should be brought in hotchpot with all the claims of receiver, and each should share pro rata. In so far as Perrin &amp; Smith Printing Co. v. Cook Hotel &amp; Excursion Co., 118 Mo. App. 44, 93 S. W. 337, gives the lessors greater rights merely as lessors, with deference, we do not follow it. It is to be noted in that ca.se that the lessors had a lien upon all the improvements erected on the locus in quo, which were the source of the fund. The contest seems therefore to have been between a prior lien of the lessor not a party and the lien of the certificates. We need not differ from the decision rendered upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><bracketnum>[0]</bracketnum> Nor under the order of November 25, 1912, should the certificate holders be preferred as falling,within the class secured by the ten per cent, reserve fund. V.erhally taken, the word \u201cobligations\u201d would, of course, cover them; but we read the phrase rather in its context, and, so read, we believe that it was meant to cover the ordinary expenses which the receiver might have to pay currently as he went and such as he might not have paid when he accounted. Paragraph (c) of the order, on the other hand, does not affirmatively give a priority to rent over such charges as the certificates, because the latter by virtue of their payment of past rent, secured, as we have said, by the right of re-entry, partake enough of those claims to fall within these words of the order, which was passed before the back rent had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><bracketnum>[7-9]</bracketnum> The only question remaining is of the allowances to the mortgage trustee and its solicitors. As between them and creditors of the receiver, they have no priority. The court must first pay its debts, the solicitors, must look to their client, and the trustee to its beneficiaries. Petersburg Savings &amp; Insurance Co. v. Dellatorre, 70 Fed. 643, 7 C. C. A. 310. Such services, when performed for the general preservation of the fund, as, for instance, the allowances to the receiver\u2019s attorneys, stand on a different' basis; but, when the solicitor of a party brings a fund into court for administration, he must look to the ultimate share of his client for payment for services rendered to that client, or to his retainer. This would, of course, free the share o'f the certificates as well, except for the language of the order of November 27, 1912, that the lien of the certificates shall be subject to \u201ccosts, counsel fees and disbursements.\u201d It is permissible to argue that this affects the lien only qua lien, but we think not. The purpose is pretty clear to give counsel fees priority as against the certificates, and among counsel fees we are disposed to include the allowances to the trustee\u2019s solicitors. The precise point was not argued, and we assume that the certificate holders in any case do not assert a priority over those charges, since they were allowed against them in the court below and no appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The net balance in the hands of the receiver will therefore be divided as follows: First, deduct the allowances to the receiver\u2019s attorney and the incidental charges of the receivership; next, divide the balance ratably between the lessors and the certificate holders; last, charge against the dividend of the certificate holders, the allowance to the solicitors of the trustee and to the trustee itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> We have, of course, assumed throughout that the claim for rent against the receiver was a proper debt of the receiver. This is not contrary to the doctrine of Stokes v. Hoffman House, 167 N. Y. 554, 60 N. E. 667, 53 L. R. A. 870. The very distinguished and learned judge who wrote the prevailing opinion in the case distinctly said that the rule did not apply to a claim by the lessor in the proceedings in which the receiver was appointed, and he specifically reserved such a right from the effect of the decree. .In the case at bar it is evident from the petition of the receiver of November 27, 1912, that his purpose was to preserve the lease for the purpose of assigning it to a corporation which the bondholders at that time expected to organize. This certainly could not have been supposed to be possible unless the fund was charged with the intervening rents.' We need not therefore decide what was the effect of the neutral occupation of the receiver after July 16, 1912, when the lessors were free to re-enter. Quincy, etc., R. Co. v. Humphreys, 145 U. S. 82, 12 Sup. Ct. 787, 36 L. Ed. 632; U. S. Trust Co. v. Wabash Ry. Co., 150 U. S. 287, 14 Sup. Ct. 86, 37 L. Ed. 1085. There can be no doubt that the receiver by his- petition and the order upon it and the payment of the back rents meant to abandon his earlier neutral position, and that he became liable during his subsequent occupation, for all ensuing charges. This is equally true whether or not he had finally elected to assume the lease for all purposes. Any other interpretation of tire proceedings resulting in the issuance of the certificates would make them a fraud upon the lessors, who continued to allow the receiver to remain in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The order is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
