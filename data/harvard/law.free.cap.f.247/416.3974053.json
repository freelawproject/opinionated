The ninth article of the contract upon which the ease turned was, so far as relevant, as follows: \u201cThe Pacific Coast [the plaintiff! agrees immediately upon their receipt to deliver i;o the General Accident [the defendant!, at its office in the city of Now York, all notices, summons, or other processes and any and all communication whatsoever that it may receive from or on behalf of any of its said policy holders in any way arising from or relating to accidents occurring after 12 o\u2019clock noon on ilxe 15th day of January, 1912.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-14\">Before January 15, 1912, the plaintiff had underwritten a liability insurance to one Adolph Schlessinger, under which after January 15, 1912, a loss occurred. Schlessinger was the landlord of a building in which a tenant was injured, and the tenant served him with two summonses in the City Court of New York about November 23, 1912. Schlessinger\u2019s son inclosed these summonses in a postpaid envelope and posted them to the plaintiff addressed to its office at 95 William street in the city o\u00ed New' York, which was the last office maintained by it in that city. The plaintiff had meanwhile discontinued its business in New York and abandoned the office before November 23, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-15\">The tenant recovered a judgment against Schlessinger, which he paid. Thereafter he sued both the parties hereto upon the liability insurance policy and recovered judgment against the plaintiff, having discontinued against the defendant. The plaintiff, having paid the judgment, brought this action to recover under the contract of reinsurance mentioned above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-16\">The plaintiff proved the recovery of Schlessinger\u2019s judgment against itself and its payment of the same, the contract of reinsurance, and the policy issued by it to Schlessinger. It then rested, and the defendant moved to dismiss. Upon denial of this motion the defendant proved the mailing of the summonses to the plaintiff as above set forth and called two attorneys at law, members of the firm of Tuttle &amp; Goughian, who had customarily represented the plaintiff in the defense of litigation brought against it, and who were designated under the insurance law of the state of New York as persons to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>whom all process should be sent which should be served upon the superintendent of insurance in that state. Upon the examination of Tuttle it appeared that he had not received the summonses, though he had received other mail of the plaintiff to some extent during the months of October and November, 1912. The firm of Tuttle &amp; Coughlan had been dissolved before November 23, 1912, but Coughlan received the summonses at some time not disclosed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b431-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>(gssFor other eases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>No evidence was produced to show that the plaintiff had directed the post office to send mail to- Tuttle &amp; Coughlan except the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">\u201cQ.

It also tried to prove that it had not received the summonses, but this, too, was excluded because of the failure of proof that the plaintiff had ever received them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-15\">Alfred W.

If it was upon the plaintiff, the evidence does not prove that it did not receive the summonses; but if it lay with the defendant, it, too, has failed, as we shall show later. The general rule reenforced by later decisions is, of course, to construe all performance due from the plaintiff and prior in time to the defendant\u2019s performance as a condition precedent to the latter\u2019s obligation. However, the plaintiff\u2019s performance here was to send on to the defendant all notices or process which it might receive. That obligation was contingent upon its own receipt of such documents, and in the absence of their receipt it was under no obligation, and there was no condition precedent. The plaintiff does not therefore approach the cause suing upon a conditional obligation; on the contrary, the defendant\u2019s obligation is prima facie absolute. It is only when the plaintiff\u2019s cross obligation, itself conditional, has been shown, to be absolute that its performance can become a condition upon the defendant\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-19\">Hence the proper course of proof is for the plaintiff to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>contract and the breach and rest. Then the defendant must prove that the condition upon the plaintiff\u2019s obligation arose so that it became absolute. We need not <em>go </em>further and hold that the plaintiff must then prove its performance in order to avoid the effect of the condition upon the defendant\u2019s obligation. It is enough here that there was no unconditional condition upon the defendant\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Nor is the point good that the recovery of the plaintiff in the action of Schlessinger v. Pacific Coast Insurance Company presupposed that the defendant there had received the summonses in the actions of the tenant against Schlessinger. How that point was dealt with on that trial we do not know, even supposing, and we do not mean so to hold, that every fact necessary to a recovery there is established by estoppel against the plaintiff here. We need not assume, however, that in that case Schlessinger proved the receipt by the. plaintiff here of the summonses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><bracketnum>[3-5]</bracketnum> We therefore come to the question whether the defendant-showed that the plaintiff had received the summonses. The only evidence is that, when Schlessinger sent the letter, the office of the plaintiff had been abandoned. Tuttle says that he does not know the exact date, but he thinks it was before November 23, 1912. This disposes of the presumption arising from the posting of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">'fhe only thing that remains is whether Coughlan, who in some way received the summonses, was then authorized to receive them by the plaintiff. Of course, as a member of the firm of Tuttle &amp; Coughlan, even if it had not then been dissolved, he would not have been so authorized. These gentlemen were merely attorneys at law who were particularly retained for each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It seems to'us that the sole ground for assuming that Coughlan was so authorized appears in the passage recited above in the statement of facts. In fact, the two orders which Tuttle speaks of may have been actually signed by the plaintiff, and Coughlan may have got the summonses as agent for the plaintiff, but we have no proof of it. Assuming that the proof, which was admitted without objection, stands for what it says, it can hardly serve in place of proof that the orders emanated from the plaintiff. It is perfectly clear that the defendant did not so regard it. Thus in the colloquy between the court and Mr. McDonnell the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u2018\u2022Yea have not here any proo\u00ed that instructions were given to the post office authorities to forward mail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">He answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cNo; hut I have proof here that I mailed a letter to your last-known address.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">We think 1liat the defendant failed to show that the plaintiff ever received the summonses, and that the direction of a verdict for the plaintiff was right. None of the exceptions to the exclusion of evidence seem to us to affect the result. Without the necessary keystone to the defense, nothing could support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The proof as to the amount of the verdict was vague. All that the defendant admitted was that the plaintiff had paid the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>We cannot find any proof of the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s expenses in defending the Schlessinger action, and we do not think the admission covered it. For this reason the plaintiff must abate from the judgment $106.68, with interest, or the judgment must be reversed. If it does, judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
