They were fined, and thereafter sued out writ of error. Many errors are assigned, but we need only consider one. When the case was being proceeded with for trial, and 7 jurors had been drawn from the box, the panel was exhausted. Thereupon the court ordered a special venire of 25 jurors returnable the following morning. Before the venire was issued counsel for defendants moved that a special officer be appointed to serve the venire about to issue for additional jurymen, on the ground that the United States marshal and his deputies wore not indifferent persons and were interested in the event of the cause. The motion was based upon the affidavit of George B. Grigsby. Esq., one of the counsel for defendants, who set forth: That on April 20, 1916, there had been a previous trial of 'the action in the same court in which it was then pending, which, had resulted In a disagreement of the jury; that on the previous trial one JST. V. Nelson testified that on December 30, 1915, he was employed by E. B. Jordan, United States marshal for the Western division, district of Alaska, to look for gambling in the town of Nome; that thereafter, pursuant to such employment, Nelson gambled for money in the Arctic Billiard Parlors, and that on January 5, 1916, he had gambled for money with certain of the defendants ; that during the progress of the game he had reported the existence of the gambling to Deputy Marshal Holland; that thereupon Nelson returned to the billiard parlor, and shortly thereafter Holland, with three other deputy-marshals, entered the place and arrested the defendants without a warrant; that at the former trial Jordan testified that he employed Nelson and paid him $65 for his services out of his personal funds; that on the former trial one Moore testified that before December 25, 1915, he heard Marshal Holland say to the defendant Johnson, \u201cI am coming after you and I am going to get you;\u201d that Jordan and all of his deputy marshals were witnesses on the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>trial, and with the exception of Nelson and the deputy marshals named there was no evidence tending to prove that defendants played the games mentioned in the indictment, nor any evidence that the games mentioned in the indictment were played for money, except the evidence of Nelson; that the prosecution originated in the marshal\u2019s office, without the complaint of any private citizens; that by reason of the foregoing facts the marshal and his deputies were unduly interested in securing a conviction. The court overruled the motion, and the marshal proceeded to serve the special venire. Exception was preserved, and error was assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\">Section 803 of the Revised Statutes of the United States is as follows: \u201cWrits of venire facias, when directed by the court, shall issue from the clerk\u2019s office, and shall be served and returned by the marshal in person, or by his deputy; or, in case the marshal or his deputy is not an indifferent person, or is interested in the event of the cause, by such fit person as may be specially appointed for that purpose by the court, who shall administer to him an oath that he will truly and impartially serve and return the writ.\u201d Comp.

But when a marshal, without authority of law or instructions from competent authority, hires a private individual to detect suspected violations of a particular law and pays such person out of his own private funds, and upon the information furnished by such person, who admits that he also participated in the offense under investigation, prosecution is instituted against certain persons, and the principal evidence relied on is to come from such employed detective, a situation is presented where, if on the trial a jury panel is exhausted, and it becomes necessary to draw jurymen from the bystanders, a defendant may well object to.the drawing of such jurymen by the marshal or his deputies, upon the ground that he is not an indifferent person, and, if there be no denial of the facts and circumstances shown, the duty of the court is to specially appoint a fit person as provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The question is not whether there is a personal malice or ill will on the part of the marshal, but whether his acts and the surrounding circumstances have been such that they impel the belief that he is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>longer indifferent in his official attitude as between the United States and the persons on trial, and for that reason is not a fit person to be intrusted with the power to return jurymen from bystanders to complete the panel for the immediate case. We are keeping in mind the presumption that the marshal will do his duty without favor; but, lest he may not do so, the particular statute quoted interposes, with the object of insuring that absolute fairness of procedure, which can best be had by not allowing one who is not indifferent to select jurors from bystanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is said that as the procedure in criminal cases in Alaska is statutory, and as there is no statute expressly authorizing the appointment of an elisor, the United States statutes (803 and 804) quoted are not applicable. It is undoubtedly correct, in a general way, to say that the Alaska Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure provide for nearly every step in criminal proceeding, including the method of drawing jurors. Summers v. United States, 231 U. S. 92, 34 Sup. Ct. 38, 58 L. Ed. 137. And as relating to the drawing of additional jurors we quote section 2229, Compiled Raws of Alaska:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cThe trial jury shall be formed as follows: When the action is called for trial the clerk shall draw from the trial jury box of the court, one by one, the ballots containing the names of the jurors until the jury is completed or the ballots are exhausted. If the ballots become exhausted before the jury is complete, the marshal, under the direction of the court, shall summons from the bystanders or the body of the district so many qualified persons as may be necessary to complete the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Certainly this statute must control as a rule. But, if it should come about that a showing is made of the manifest unfitness of the marshal to summon jurors, in the absence of local legislation directing how to proceed, the general law of the United States becomes wholly applicable and controlling. If this were not so, we would find that the guaranty that one accused shall have the right to trial by an impartial jury would mean less in Alaska than in the states. We are unable to assent to such a proposition. Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 18 Sup. Ct. 620, 42 L. Ed. 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
