If she was substantially where the libel alleged, she unnecessarily, and therefore negligently, impeded the fairway. The burden of proving such negligence was on libelant. Upon consideration of the evidence, we are as unable as was the trial judge to fix the steamer\u2019s position, further than to hold that she was not shown to be where the libel placed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Therefore the court below rightly dismissed the libel for lack of proof, and the decree is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
