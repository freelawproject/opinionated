The act was limited to cases of death or injury to employ\u00e9s in the mining- industry in the territory, and provided for a trial to be maintained and determined in and by the courts of the territory, and for a judgment creating a personal liability against the employer.- <em>Held </em>that, where an employ\u00e9\u2019s injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment were aggravated 'by insufficient medical attention furnished by the employer pursuant to an agreement with the employ\u00e9 to furnish competent medical and surgical attention in case of the employ\u00e9\u2019s illness or injury, the employes right to recover for such aggravation injuries did not fall within the act, not being an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b434-9\">2.

An Alaska mine employ\u00e9, alleging that he suffered injuries in the course of his employment, and also from defendant\u2019s failure to furnish competent surgical and medical attendance in pursuance of an agreement whereby deductions were made from his wages, joined the two causes of action. <em>Held, </em>that the joinder was proper, the Alaska; Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act governing the action for injuries arising in the course of employment being elective and having been adopted by tbe parties, for both causes of action were based on contract.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-12\">In Error to the District Court of the United States for the Third Division of the Territory of Alaska; Charles E.

The first was to recover compensation for injuries received by him in the course of his employment in the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>mins, and was brought under the provisions of chapter 71 of the Session Laws of Alaska 1915, known as tjie Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The second was to recover damages for the aggravation of his injuries aiid for his suffering by reason of the defendant\u2019s neglect to furnish him timely and sufficient surgical care and medical and hospital care; the plaintiff alleging that under the defendant\u2019s rules the sum of $1.50 per month had been deducted from his wages for hospital dues, which entitled him to care in a hospital and to competent surgical and medical attendance at the expense of the defendant, in case of his injury or illness arising in the course of his employment. The defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that, the causes of action had been improperly united, and on the further ground that under the first cause of action the plaintiff was entitled to recover all damages which he sustained for aggravation to his injuries through the lack of proper hospital treatment, and that to permit the maintenance of the second count would be to compel the defendant to answer twice in damages for the same cause of action. The demurrer was overruled. The jury by their verdict found for the plaintiff on the first cause of action in the sum of $1,308, and on the second cause of action in the sum of $1.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b434-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>&lt;\u00ae=For other cases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Section 1 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides that the employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the schedule therein adopted to each of his employ\u00e9s \u201cwho receives a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his or her employment.\u201d The act sets forth a schedule of compensation covering all ordinary and usual injuries arising from accidents in mines resulting in either temporary or permanent disability, and further makes provision for compensation for injuries and disabilities which do not come wholly within any of the specific cases for which provision is made.

Erickson Const. Co., 89 Wash. 634, 155 Pac. 153, L. R. A. 1916F, 319, a case in which it was held that the purpose of the Industrial Insurance Law of Washington (3 Rem. &amp; Bal. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 660-1\u20141 et seq.) was to remove from the courts personal injury actions by employes, and was intended to cover, not only injuries, but all aggravations through negligence of a physician engaged by the master and paid out of sums deducted from the wages oE employ\u00e9s. But the Industrial Insurance Law of Washington differs materially from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Alaska. The intention of the Washington law, as expressed in the terms thereof, was to withdraw from private controversy all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>phases of civil causes for personal injuries to employes, and to abolish the jurisdiction of, courts over such causes, and the Supreme Court in the case cited held that the purpose of the act was to end all litigation growing out of, incident to, or resulting from the primary injury, and in lieu thereof to give the workman one recovery in the way of certain compensation, and to make the charge upon the contributing industries alone. Support of that view of the law was found in the fact that provision was made that compensation allowed under the act might be readjusted if aggravation of the disability should take place or be discovered. Again, in Stertz v. Industrial Insurance Com., 91 Wash. 588, 158 Pac. 256, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">\u201cOurs is not an employer\u2019s liability act. It is not even an ordinary compensation act. It is an industrial insurance statute. Its administrative body is entitled tlie \u2018Industrial Insurance Commission.\u2019 All tlie features of an insurance act are present. Not only are all remedies between master and servant abolished, and, in the words of the statute, all phases of them withdrawn from private controversy, but the employe is no longer to look to the master even for the scheduled and mandatory compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The essential features of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Alaska are the limitation of its provisions to cases of death or injury to employ\u00e9s in the \u201cmining industry of the territory,\u201d the limitations and specifications of the amount recoverable in case of death or injury, and the specified disabilities, and the joinder in one action of all claimants injured from the same cause. It provides for a trial to be maintained and determined in and by the courts of the territory, and to be governed by the law of procedure applicable to other actions for the recovery of money. The judgment when rendered creates a personal liability against the employer, and not against a fund created by contributions from or assessments against other employers. We are of the opinion that under the act the plaintiff could not recover for aggravation to his injuries as pleaded in his second count. The act limits recovery thereunder to cases of death or injury arising \u201cout of and in the course of employment.\u201d That phrase is one that is commonly used in yyorkmen\u2019s compensation acts, and its meaning has been determined in numerous decisions. \u201cThis phrase embraces only those accidents which happen to a servant while he is engaged in the discharge of some function or duty which he is authorized to undertake, and which is calculated to further, directly or indirectly, the master\u2019s business.\u201d 5 Labatt\u2019s Master and Servant, \u00a7 1806. An injury arises out of the employment if there is a causal connection between the working conditions and the injury, and it must be possible to trace the injury to the nature of the employer\u2019s work, or to the risks to which the employer\u2019s business exposes the employ\u00e9. Coronado Beach Co. v. Pillsbury, 172 Cal. 682, 158 Pac. 212, L. R. A. 1916F, 1164; Kimbol v. Industrial Accident Commission, 173 Cal. 351, 160 Pac. 150, L. R. A. 1917B, 595. In Ruth v. Witherspoon-Englar Co., 98 Kan. 179, 157 Pac. 403, L. R. A. 1916E, 1201, construing the Compensation Act of Kansas (Laws 1911, c. 218), the court'held that recovery can be had only upon the basis of disability resulting from injury received in the course of employment, and that it cannot be augmented by the fact that the disabling effects of the injury are increased or prolonged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>incompetent or negligent surgical treatment, even where the employer is responsible therefor. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u201cSo much o\u00ed an employe\u2019s incapacity as is the direct result of unskillful medical treatment does not arise <em>\u2018out </em>of and in the course <em>of his employment\u2019 </em>within the meaning of that phrase as used in the statute. * \u00ae For that part of his injury his remedy is against the persons answerable therefor under the general law of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Of similar import is the decision of the Supreme Court of California in Pacific Coast Casualty Co. v. Pillsbury, 171 Cal. 319, 153 Pac. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Error is assigned to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the causes of action were properly joined. The Compiled Laws of Alaska, \u00a7 916, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff may unite several causes of action in the same complaint when they all arise out of: First, contract, express or implied; \u00ae * \u00ae second, injuries with or without force to the person. * \u00ae \u00ae But the causes of action so united must all belong to one only of these classes, and must affect all the parties to the action and not require different jtlaces of trial, and must be separately stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Passing by the question whether or not the two causes of action here pleaded are for injuries \u201cwith or without force to the person,\u201d we entertain no doubt that they come within the first clause, in that they arise out of \u201ccontract express or implied.\u201d The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Alaska is elective and not compulsory. It applies to those only who choose to avail themselves of its provisions, and agree to abide by its terms. All rights thereunder have their origin in the agreement of the parties. The plaintiff in his first cause of action does not recover on a liability arising out of the defendant\u2019s negligence, but on a liability arising out of contractual obligation, and which exists irrespective of the defendant\u2019s negligence. Winfield v. Erie R. Co., 88 N. J. Law, 619, 96 Atl. 394. In Madden\u2019s Case, 222 Mass. 487, 496, 111 N. E. 379, 383, L. R. A. 1916D, 1000, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">\u201cIt is plain and b&amp;s been said repeatedly tbat the act eliminates all consideration of tort, penalty, or negligence, save where there has been \u2018serious and willful misconduct.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Several assignments of error relate to exceptions to instructions given, and denial of instructions requested. They are all so plainly without merit as to require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
