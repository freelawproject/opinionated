Judge Witmer was right in dismissing the petition for the reason thus stated in his unreported opinion: \u201cThe premium commissions that came into possession of the [Securities Company] were not impressed with a lien other than that of debtor and creditor. The Securities Company was not required to set a portion of its funds apart as [Trabue\u2019s] individual property, and it did in fact not so regard the same. There is now <em>no </em>special fund here to award, or which the court could distinguish as a fund or property of the petitioner. The amount due, whatever it may be, is but regarded as a debt due the petitioner, and must be presented and proven against the Securities Company on the distribution of the assets.\u201d The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
