Harrison challenges his convictions and sentences imposed after he pled guilty to two counts of trafficking in illicit labels, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318. Specifically, Harrison was convicted of selling Microsoft labels, called certificates of authenticity (\u201cCOAs\u201d), that Microsoft packages with software to ensure that a particular copy of Microsoft\u2019s product is authentic. Each COA contains a 25-digit alphanumeric key that can be used to activate a Microsoft program. Harrison obtained stand-alone COAs from various sources and sold them to others, presumably allowing those others to activate pirated copies of Microsoft\u2019s programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-14\">On appeal, Harrison argues that the first-sale doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is applicable to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318, and that the district court erred in granting the Government\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude him from raising the doctrine as a defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Harrison\u2019s convictions and sentences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">Normally, we review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion <em>in limine </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>25 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir.1994). However, we review a district court\u2019s determination of whether a certain defense is available <em>de novo. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">Federal law criminalizes trafficking in \u201cillicit label[s] affixed to, enclosing, or accompanying, or designed to be affixed to, enclose, or accompany ... a copy of a computer program.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318(a)(1)(B). An \u201cillicit label\u201d is a \u201cgenuine certificate, licensing document, registration card, or similar labeling component,\u201d that meets two criteria. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2318(b)(4). First, the component must be \u201cused by the copyright owner to verify that a [copy of a work] is not counterfeit or infringing of any copyright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2318(b)(4)(A). Second, the component must either be \u201cdistributed or intended for distribution not in connection with the copy ... to which such labeling component was intended to be affixed by the respective copyright owner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2318(b)(4)(B)(l), or be \u201cknowingly falsified in order to designate a higher number of licensed users or copies than authorized by the copyright owner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2318(b)(4)(B)(2), without the copyright owner\u2019s authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">By pleading guilty, Harrison admitted that he trafficked in Microsoft COAs, that those COAs were \u201cillicit labels\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2318(b)(4), and that the COAs were \u201cdesigned to ... accompany ... a copy of a computer program.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318(a)(1)(B). The only issue on appeal is whether, despite those admissions, Harrison was entitled to raise an affirmative defense based on the first-sale doctrine. He essentially wished to argue that because he legitimately owned the COAs it did not violate federal law to distribute those COAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">We hold that the first-sale doctrine is not available to an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318 defendant. Though the criminal and civil penalties associated with the statutory scheme provide additional protection to copyrighted works, the statute defines a distinct crime; Harrison was not charged with copyright infringement. Congress could have easily incorporated the first-sale defense into \u00a7 2318, but chose not to. Nor would Congress choose to, for allowing a first-sale defense to a \u00a7 2318 prosecution would swallow the statutory scheme in its entirety. The statute targets the secondary market in authenticating labels; the first-sale doctrine eliminates restrictions on secondary markets. Therefore, to allow a first-sale defense would be to allow precisely the secondary market Congress intended to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err when it granted the Government\u2019s motion <em>in li-mine </em>precluding Harrison from raising the first-sale doctrine as a defense to \u00a7 2318. Accordingly, we affirm Harrison\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">. The first-sale doctrine limits a copyright holder\u2019s exclusive right to distribute its copyrighted material. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(a). If a person owns an individual copy of a copyrighted work, that person has authority \"to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord\u201d without interference by the copyright owner. <em>Id. </em>In short, a person does not violate copyright law by distributing copies of copyrighted works when he owns those copies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">. Harrison's arguments that the first-sale doctrine is relevant to the elements of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318 prosecution, such that even absent an affirmative defense to the crime it was error for the district court to exclude all first-sale evidence and argument, are rejected. In no way would the first-sale doctrine be relevant to whether the COAs are \"illicit labels\u201d \u2014 a term of art expressly defined in the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318(b)(4) \u2014 or whether Microsoft used the COAs solely for copyright verification. Furthermore, despite Harrison\u2019s contentions in his brief, it is far from clear that \u201cillicit labels\u201d are only those used <em>solely </em>for copyright verification. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318(b)(4)(A) (noting that an illicit label is one that is \"used by the copyright owner to verify that a [copy of a work] is not counterfeit or infringing of any copyright\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1390-16\">.With respect to his sentences, Harrison argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level at sentencing by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) based on his role in the offense. He argues that the government failed to meet its burden to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>that the enterprise involved five or more criminally responsible participants, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. He also argues that the district court abused its discretion by improperly calculating his guideline range. We find no merit to these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
