Code, \u00a7 11351; count 1), transportation of heroin for sale <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 11352; count 2), possession of methamphetamine for sale (id., \u00a7 11378; count 3), transportation of methamphetamine for sale (id., \u00a7 11379; count 4), possession of a firearm by a felon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of ammunition by a felon (\u00a7 30305, subd. (a)(1); count 6). The jury also found true the allegations defendant was armed during the commission of the four narcotics-related offenses (\u00a7 12022, subd. (c); counts 1, 3, 4), had a prior strike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12), and had served four prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). The trial court sentenced defendant to serve 32 years eight months in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) the trial court erroneously excluded from the evidence a signed statement by a person who claimed to own some of the drugs and drug paraphernalia, and the handgun that were found, (2) defendant\u2019s convictions for possession and transportation of heroin must be reversed because the police violated his rights under <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 479 [81 L.Ed.2d 413, 104 S.Ct. 2528] <em>(Trombetta) </em>by destroying exculpatory evidence when they mixed together the similar-looking contents of two bindles before detecting heroin in the combined mass, (3) the mixture of the contents of the two bindles rendered the evidence of his possession and transportation of heroin insufficient, (4) section 654 precludes multiple punishments for his simultaneous transportation of methamphetamine and heroin for sale, (5) section 654 also prevents multiple punishments for his possession of a firearm as a felon and being armed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Commission of the narcotics offenses, and (6) multiple sentence enhancements are precluded under section 654 for being armed in the simultaneous commission of the four narcotics-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On our own motion, we requested that the parties address three additional issues. First, whether section 654 applies to defendant\u2019s separate sentences for possession of heroin for sale and transportation of heroin for sale, as well as to his separate sentences for possession of methamphetamine for sale and transportation of methamphetamine for sale. Second, whether a conclusion section 654 applies to possession for sale and transportation for sale of the same substances would have any effect on the arming enhancements imposed under section 12022, subdivision (c), for each of defendant\u2019s narcotics convictions. Third, whether the California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>People v. Jones </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 350 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 561, 278 P.3d 821] <em>(Jones) </em>precludes separate sentences for being a felon in possession of a firearm and for the firearm enhancements attached to his narcotics offenses\u2014 all of which were based on defendant\u2019s possession of a single firearm on a single occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding a hearsay statement from the owner of the vehicle where the contraband was found because the defense did not demonstrate due diligence in attempting to secure the testimony of the proposed witness. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the mixed substance that tested positive for heroin. The police did not destroy the evidence by combining the similar-looking contents of the two bindles nor did they discard any of the packaging materials from which they originated. We reject defendant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence argument because it is undisputed that what the police found in defendant\u2019s possession was heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention the trial court erred in imposing separate sentences for defendant\u2019s methamphetamine and heroin-related offenses. These were different types of narcotics that increased defendant\u2019s potential customers. We accept the People\u2019s concession that section 654 applies to stay one of defendant\u2019s separate sentences for possession and transportation of heroin for sale, and also applies to stay one of defendant\u2019s sentences for possession and transportation of methamphetamine for sale. Finally, we conclude section 654 bars separate punishments for the defendant\u2019s possession of a single firearm on a single occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions but reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"ADE\">\n<em>Prosecution Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">At 3:15 a.m. on August 2, 2012, defendant was driving a minivan in an area of Stockton known for narcotics sales and prostitution. Stockton Police Department Officers Kenneth Welter and Ronald Zalunardo stopped the van after noticing one of the taillights was inoperable. The officers asked to see defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license but he said he did not have one. Officer Welter instructed defendant to get out of the van, patsearched him, and detained him in the back of their patrol vehicle. The officers looked into the van and saw a Bersa .380 semiautomatic handgun on the floor between the front seats. The gun turned out to be loaded with seven .380 hollow point bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Approximately five to six inches from the gun was a brown coin purse containing \u201ca very large golf-ball size\u201d piece of crystal methamphetamine weighing 11.3 grams, 125 small Ziploc baggies in two sizes, a one-inch Ziploc baggie containing tar heroin, and $117.05 in cash and coins. The police officers also found a pink purse on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat. The pink purse contained a digital scale and a package containing eight unused hypodermic needles. On the part of the digital scale where items are placed to be weighed there was a white crystalline substance consistent with methamphetamine. Brown tar consistent with tar heroin was found around the sides of the scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">After finding the handgun and narcotics in the minivan, the officers searched defendant and found a bindle of tar heroin inside his pants pocket. The bindle of heroin found inside defendant\u2019s pants pocket and the coin purse under the front seat had the same appearance: both had the same sticky brown substance, were wrapped in the same way, and seemingly contained the same amount. Defendant did not appeal' to be under the influence of any controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The officers looked up the van\u2019s registration based on its license plate and found it was registered to Jerry Haney. While the officers searched the van, Haney showed up at the scene riding a bike.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">During the booking process, the contents of the two bindles of sticky brown substance were combined. The combined net weight was 0.58 grams and tested positive for the presence of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Stockton Police Department Sergeant Matthew Garlick testified as a narcotics expert. Sergeant Garlick testified narcotics dealing is an extremely dangerous activity and dealers often carry guns to protect themselves during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>deals. He explained the amount of heroin under defendant\u2019s control would provide five to six doses and has an approximate street value of $60. Given the form of the heroin found at the scene, the hypodermic needles would be a delivery mechanism for the drug. Drug dealers commonly sell hypodermic needles along with heroin. The amount of methamphetamine found at the scene sufficed for 100 \u201chits\u201d or doses and would be worth approximately $200 to $300 on the street. In Sergeant Garlick\u2019s experience, that amount of methamphetamine was \u201cnot something that a user, someone on the street, would have the money to afford.\u201d The number of syringes found at the scene also indicated the heroin was possessed for purposes of sale. And the number of Ziploc bags was consistent with sale of usable amounts of methamphetamine. The fact no methamphetamine pipe or dirty needles were found further indicated defendant was selling narcotics rather than using them himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The parties stipulated defendant had a prior felony conviction that barred him from lawfully possessing a firearm or ammunition. The parties also stipulated the van was not registered to defendant, the van was towed, and it was not claimed by anyone thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\n<em>Defense Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf as follows: On August 2, 2012, he was living at the Capri Motel with his girlfriends, Lenora and Sarah. Lenora was sick due to heroin withdrawal. She had no heroin left because she had purchased a counterfeit substance that looked just like the narcotic. Defendant took the counterfeit substance and put it into his pants pocket. Early that evening, Haney\u2014-the owner of the minivan\u2014arrived at the motel with defendant\u2019s partner, Adam Cox. Around 3:00 a.m., defendant noticed Lenora was gone. Concerned about her, defendant took Haney\u2019s unlocked van because it did not require a key to start it. Defendant did not look around the van before he drove off because it would have made him look like a thief. As defendant was driving around and looking for Lenora, he was pulled over by the police. While defendant was detained in the backseat of the police car, he received a call from Haney. Haney rode over to the scene on one of defendant\u2019s bicycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Defendant stated the coin purse found in the car belonged to Cox. The baggie of heroin-like counterfeit substance found in defendant\u2019s pants pocket belonged to Lenora. The handgun in the van belonged to defendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Letricia Tyson.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Defendant denied selling drugs or having a job, explaining he did not support himself \u201ctoo good\u201d but instead \u201clive[d] off the land.\u201d He received support from his family members and eight women with whom he had children.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Defendant admitted convictions for robbery in 1988 as well as three felony crimes of moral turpitude in 1991, 1996, and 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Bernard Moore, an investigator for the public defender, testified that on the day before trial he went to the apartment listed as Haney\u2019s place of residence but found the apartment to be vacant. Moore gave Cox a subpoena the first time he met with Cox. But when Moore went back to talk to Cox, Cox\u2019s apartment was empty as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">I-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">\n<em>Section 654</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Defendant contends section 654 precludes multiple punishments for his transportation of methamphetamine and heroin for sale, multiple punishments for his possession of a firearm as a felon and being armed in the commission of the narcotics offenses, and multiple punishments for being armed in the simultaneous commission of the four narcotics-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">As noted in our introduction, this court on its own motion raised the issues (1) whether section 654 applies to the possession and transportation of heroin and also to the possession and transportation of methamphetamine, (2) whether a stay of either the possessory or transportation offenses also stays any attached arming enhancements, and (3) whether <em>Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th 350 prohibits sentence enhancements based on possession of the same firearm for which defendant was convicted and sentenced for being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">As we explain, section 654 applies to possession for sale and transportation for sale of the same substance. The California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th 350 precludes multiple sentences for defendant\u2019s possession of a single gun on a single occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>Transportation of Heroin and Methamphetamine for Sale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The trial court imposed consecutive sentences for defendant\u2019s convictions of count 2 for transportation of heroin for sale and count 4 for transportation of methamphetamine for sale. Defendant contends the trial court violated section 654 by imposing consecutive terms for counts 2 and 4 because his transportation of the two types of narcotics for sale was a \u201csingle\u201d and \u201csimultaneous\u201d act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Section 654, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.\u201d Section 654 bars multiple punishment for separate offenses arising out of a single occurrence when all of the offenses were incident to one objective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1203, 1208 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 144, 858 P.2d 611].) Whether section 654 applies is a question of fact for the trial court, and its finding will be upheld if there is substantial evidence to support the finding. <em>(People v. Kurtenbach </em>(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1289 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 637].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Nonetheless, \u201cCalifornia courts have uniformly held that section 654 does not preclude multiple punishment for simultaneous possession of various narcotic drugs.\u201d <em>(People v. Barger </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 662, 672 [115 Cal.Rptr. 298]; see also <em>People v. Monarrez </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 710, 714 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 247].) <em>Monarrez </em>illustrates this point. That case involved convictions based on the simultaneous possession of both heroin and cocaine for sale and for which the trial court imposed separate sentences. <em>(Monarrez, </em>at p. 712.) On appeal, the defendant argued both offenses involved \u201cessentially the same act,\u201d for which separate punishment was barred under section 654. <em>(Monarrez, </em>at p. 712.) The <em>Monarrez </em>court rejected the contention on grounds that \u201c \u2018[i]t would be absurd to hold that a criminal who deals in one contraband substance can expand the scope of his [or her] inventory without facing additional consequences\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[although the overall intent is always to make money, the objectives of selling cocaine and heroin are separate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 714-715.) Moreover, the \u201cevidence supported a finding that defendant had been engaged in multiple sales and intended to make multiple sales of the narcotics which he possessed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 715.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Here, the trial court properly imposed separate punishments for defendant\u2019s transportation for sale of heroin and methamphetamine. As the prosecution\u2019s narcotics expert testified, heroin and methamphetamine addicts constitute separate groups of drug users because the drugs themselves are very different. Methamphetamine is a stimulant, while heroin is a depressant. As the narcotics expert explained, methamphetamine and heroin are \u201ctwo different narcotics, something that the same person would not use commonly. I\u2019m not saying it hasn\u2019t been done, but it\u2019s not very common.\u201d In other words, defendant was transporting different drags for different types of drug abusers. Based on the different markets for the different drugs, defendant intended the transportation to serve different purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Defendant relies on section 654 and <em>In re Adams </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 629 [122 Cal.Rptr. 73, 536 P.2d 473] <em>(Adams) </em>to argue he should not have been separately sentenced for his two transportation of narcotics convictions. In <em>Adams, </em>the California Supreme Court struck the multiple punishments imposed on a defendant who had been apprehended transporting several types of contraband in his vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 637-638.) On grounds defendant had only the single objective of delivering the narcotics to a cohort, the <em>Adams </em>court determined transportation offenses constituted an \u201cindivisible course of conduct [that] results in the commission of a single punishable offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 635.) Defendant argues <em>Adams </em>applies to him and leads to the conclusion he harbored a single intent and objective in this case\u2014to transport illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>Adams, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 629 is inapposite because defendant in this case was not transporting a shipment of narcotics to a single recipient. Instead, defendant was set up to sell small amounts of drugs to different groups of users\u2014some addicted to a stimulant and some addicted to a depressant. By transporting separate types of drugs for separate groups of purchasers, defendant is subject to separate punishments. Consequently, the trial court did not err in imposing separate sentences for counts 2 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\n<em>Possession of Heroin and Transportation of Heroin; Possession of Methamphetamine and Transportation of Methamphetamine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In defendant\u2019s supplemental briefing on the issue of whether section 654 applies to his separate sentences for possession for sale and transportation for sale of the same narcotic, defendant adheres to his view he may not be separately sentenced for transportation of heroin for sale and transportation of methamphetamine for sale. However, the People concede section 654 applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to stay his separate sentences for possession of heroin for sale and transportation of heroin for sale. Likewise, the People concede the stay also applies to defendant\u2019s separate sentences for possession of methamphetamine for sale and transportation of methamphetamine for sale. We accept the concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">When police officers discover a defendant in an automobile in possession of a controlled substance, section 654 applies to preclude separate punishments for the same act of transporting for sale the controlled substance and possessing it for sale. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tinker </em>(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1506 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 869] [holding that \u00a7 654 applied to convictions for possession of heroin for sale and transportation of the same heroin for sale]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Avalos </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1583 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 450 [same]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Correa </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 331, 340 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 546, 278 P.3d 809], citing with approval <em>People v. Roberts </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 483, 491 [254 P.2d 501] [holding possession, sale, and attempt to transport heroin constitute only one act].) Here, the trial court erred in imposing separate sentences for defendant\u2019s possession for sale and transportation for sale of the same controlled substance on the same occasion. Under section 654, either the sentence for possession of heroin for sale or the sentence for transportation of heroin for sale must be stayed. So too on remand, either the sentence for possession of methamphetamine for sale or transportation of methamphetamine for sale must be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>Being Armed in the Commission of a Narcotics Offense on the Same Occasion as Being a Felon in Possession of a Firearm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Defendant next contends the trial court erred in imposing separate punishments for being a felon in possession of a firearm and the enhancements for being armed in the commission of a narcotics offense. As we explain, the contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">In <em>Jones, </em>the California Supreme court noted the fundamental principle that \u201c[s]ection 654 prohibits multiple punishment for a single physical act that violates different provisions of law.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 358.) The single physical act in <em>Jones </em>was the defendant\u2019s possession of a loaded .38-caliber revolver in a door panel of the car he was driving. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 352.) Based on possession of <em>the </em>single firearm, the defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, carrying a readily accessible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>concealed and unregistered firearm, and carrying an unregistered firearm in public. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court sentenced the defendant to serve separate terms for each of these three convictions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Jones </em>court, however, concluded section 654 applied to stay the sentences for all but one of the convictions. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In striking two of the three sentences for possession of the same firearm, the California Supreme Court acknowledged various firearm statutes address differing risks to the public. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 354.) For example, felons in possession of concealable firearms implicate \u201c \u2018the risk to public safety deriv[ing] from the type of person involved.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>People v. Harrison </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 115, 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 396].) By contrast, possession of a loaded firearm \u201c \u2018strikes at the hazard arising when any person carries a loaded firearm in public\u2019 \u201d because \u201c \u2018the mere fact the weapon is loaded is hazardous, irrespective of the person . . . carrying it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jones, </em>at p. 354, quoting <em>Harrison, </em>at p. 122.) However, both convictions may arise out of the same possession of a single firearm on the same occasion. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>Jones </em>considered an approach to section 654 for firearm convictions that relied on the \u201c \u2018intent and objective\u2019 test\u201d to determine whether the statutory stay on sentences applied. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 359.) The <em>Jones </em>court, however, rejected the proposition multiple intents or objectives could preclude section 654 from applying to possession of a firearm on a single occasion, explaining: \u201cFinding a single objective here might resolve this particular case. But what if the evidence also showed that the defendant wanted to intimidate rival gang members, or go hunting, or harbored any other of the myriad possible objectives for illegally possessing a firearm? Would multiple punishment be allowed in that case? Or what if the evidence does not show what the defendant\u2019s objective was? A defendant does not have to talk to the police. What is the court to do then? Rather than force the court to divine what objective or objectives the defendant might have had in possessing the firearm, we find it better to rely on section 654\u2019s actual language in resolving this single-act case. . . . Accordingly, we conclude this case should be decided on the basis that it involves a single act or omission that can be punished but once. [\u00b6] It might make sense to punish more severely a firearm possession that violates multiple penal provisions than a firearm possession that violates only one penal provision. Any time it wishes, the Legislature can change the law and permit multiple punishment in a situation like this. But we must interpret the statutes as they exist. Because defendant\u2019s convictions were based on a single act, section 654 prohibits multiple punishment.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th 350, 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>As the People point out, this case differs from <em>Jones </em>in that the separate sentences for the firearm possession in this case were not imposed for convictions of separate substantive offenses. Instead, the issue in this case is whether the enhancements imposed on another offense (i.e., to enhance the sentence for defendant\u2019s narcotics-related convictions) must be stayed due to the sentence imposed for defendant\u2019s conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The California Supreme Court addressed the application of section 654 to sentence enhancements in <em>People v. Ahmed </em>(2011) 53 Cal.4th 156 [133 Cal.Rptr.3d 856, 264 P.3d 822] <em>(Ahmed). </em>As this court has previously explained, \u201cThe <em>Ahmed </em>court concluded that section 654 may apply to sentence enhancements arising from the circumstances of the crime and not imposed based on the status of the offender. <em>(Ahmed, </em>at p. 161.) As our Supreme Court noted, sometimes separate enhancements apply to different aspects of the <em>same </em>substantive offense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 163.) Nonetheless, the high court noted that considerations of whether section 654 requires an enhancement to be stayed will generally be unnecessary because the sentence enhancement statutes themselves will more often indicate whether multiple punishments may be imposed. Thus, \u2018[o]nly if the specific statutes do not provide the answer should the court turn to section 654.\u2019 <em>(Ahmed, </em>at pp. 159-160.)\u201d <em>(People v. Wooten </em>(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 121, 129 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 684].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Here, defendant\u2019s sentence enhancements were imposed under section 12022, subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) of section 12022 provides; \u201cNotwithstanding the enhancement set forth in subdivision (a),[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] a person who is personally armed with a firearm in the commission of a violation or attempted violation of Section 11351, 11351.5, 11352, 11366.5, 11366.6, 11378, 11378.5, 11379, 11379.5, or 11379.6 of the Health and Safety Code shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for three, four, or five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The language of section 12022, subdivision (c), does not address whether the firearm enhancement for one of the enumerated narcotics offenses must be stayed if defendant also has a separate conviction for a firearm offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Consequently, under <em>Ahmed, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th 156, we proceed to consider whether section 654 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><em>Ahmed </em>involved multiple enhancements imposed for the same crime and yielded the holding that \u201cwhen applied to multiple enhancements <em>for a single crime, </em>section 654 bars multiple punishment for the same aspect of a criminal act.\u201d <em>(Ahmed, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 164, italics added &amp; omitted.) Nonetheless, the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision proves instructive where it explained: \u201cWhen [section 654] was enacted in 1872, sentence enhancements as we know them today did not exist. But on its face, its language applies to enhancements. Enhancements are \u2018provisions of law\u2019 under which an \u2018act or omission\u2019 is \u2018punishable.\u2019 Accordingly, as a default, section 654 does apply to enhancements when the specific statutes do not provide the answer. [\u00b6] But enhancements are different from substantive crimes, a difference that affects <em>how </em>section 654 applies to enhancements. Provisions describing substantive crimes, such as the assault with a firearm of this case, generally define criminal <em>acts. </em>But enhancement provisions do not define criminal acts; rather, they increase the punishment for those acts. They focus on <em>aspects </em>of the criminal act that are not always present and that warrant additional punishment.\u201d <em>(Ahmed, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 163.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Section 654 applies when the aspect of a sentence enhancement punishes the exact criminal conduct for which a defendant has been separately convicted and sentenced. <em>(People v. Wynn </em>(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1218-1221 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 457] <em>(Wynn); People </em>v. <em>Calles </em>(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1217, 1220, 1225 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 673] <em>(Calles); People v. Douglas </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1392-1396 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 534] <em>(Douglas).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The defendant in <em>Wynn </em>was convicted of, among other things, assault with a deadly weapon and was subject to a sentence enhancement for the same use of a deadly weapon that attached to his conviction for burglary. <em>(Wynn, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at p. 1218.) The <em>Wynn </em>court held section 654 applied. In so holding, <em>Wynn </em>noted the California Supreme Court has previously \u201cfound significance in the fact that section 654 uses the terminology \u2018act or omission\u2019 [citation] and thus \u2018prohibits multiple punishment per act\u2019 in contrast to section 12022.53 which \u2018do[es] so per crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wynn, </em>at p. 1220 fn. 10, italics omitted, quoting <em>People v. Palacios </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 720, 731 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 161 P.3d 519].) Thus, the <em>Wynn </em>court concluded, \u201cthe enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (b)(1) for personally using a deadly or dangerous weapon during the commission of the burglary is based on an <em>act or omission </em>performed by Wynn during the [burglary] offense, namely, using the nunchaku.\u201d <em>(Wynn, </em>at p. 1220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In <em>Calles, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.4th 1200, the appellate court held section 654 applied to bar imposition of both a prison term for leaving the scene of an accident and a sentence enhancement for leaving the scene of the same accident that attached to a gross vehicular manslaughter conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1215-1217.) As the <em>Calles </em>court explained, section 654 applies because \u201c[t]here was only one act of leaving the scene of an accident.\u201d (Calles, at p. 1217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The same reasoning was employed in <em>Douglas, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th 1385. <em>Douglas </em>involved sentences for kidnapping for purposes of robbery, a kidnapping enhancement for forcible oral copulation, and a kidnapping enhancement for rape\u2014all arising out of the same kidnapping. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1392.) The <em>People </em>conceded one of the sentences for the kidnapping enhancement had to be stayed under section 654 but argued the second kidnapping enhancement was proper because the defendant in that case formed a subsequent intent to commit sexual assault after the kidnapping began. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Douglas </em>court disagreed and explained that \u201c[t]here was only one kidnapping; the kidnapping for robbery was the same as the kidnapping which gave rise to the two enhancements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1395.) Consequently, \u201cthe trial court had no grounds to punish defendant again for the identical kidnapping. Although the kidnapping was committed with the independent and additional intent to commit sexual offenses, defendant was sentenced separately for each of those sexual offenses, which accounted for his culpability for those offenses. No additional punishment was warranted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1394-1395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Here, defendant was convicted of section 29800, subdivision (a)(1), based on the .38-caliber handgun found on the floor of the minivan he was driving when he was pulled over by the police. The four arming enhancements imposed under section 12022, subdivision (c), pertained to the same possession of the firearm on the same occasion. To paraphrase <em>Calles </em>and <em>Douglas: </em>there was only one gun lying on the floor of the van. <em>(Calles, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.4th at p. 1217; <em>Douglas, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th at p. 1395.) The criminal act for which defendant was convicted and the aspect of the enhancements attached to his sentence were identical, and therefore section 654 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The People contend separate sentences are warranted because \u201cthere was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s implied finding that [defendant\u2019s] possession of the firearm was antecedent to and separate from the primary offense of transporting methamphetamine.\u201d We disagree. At trial, the People\u2019s case focused exclusively on proving defendant\u2019s possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the firearm, controlled substances, and drug paraphernalia at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest. The People\u2019s evidence did not even address the possibility defendant possessed the firearm before the controlled substances. Although the People note defendant testified \u201che was in the hotel prior to getting into his vehicle and driving,\u201d this does not provide adequate support for an inference defendant possessed the gun separately from the controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We also reject the People\u2019s contention defendant had differing objectives for the singular possession of the firearm. Under the California Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Jones, </em>the possibility that multiple objectives can be inferred for a single instance of possessing a firearm does not allow for multiple punishments. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th 350, 360.) Here, section 654 applies to the arming enhancements that attach to the same conduct as formed the basis for his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm carries a potential term of three years in prison. (\u00a7\u00a7 18, 29800, subd. (a)(1).)  The longest potential term for the enhancement for being armed in the commission of a narcotics offense enumerated in section 12022, subdivision (c), is five years. Thus, the sentence for the armed commission of a narcotics crime enhancement is greater than the sentence for the being a felon in possession of a firearm offense. On remand, the trial court shall maintain the sentence enhancement of section 12022, subdivision (c), for one of the unstayed counts of defendant\u2019s narcotics-related convictions. (E.g., <em>Calles, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1217-1218.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Defendant\u2019s convictions are affirmed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing consistent with Penal Code section 654 and this opinion in order to stay either the sentence for defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of heroin for sale or transportation of heroin for sale. The trial court shall also stay the sentence either for defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of methamphetamine for sale or transportation of methamphetamine for sale. The trial court shall stay the sentence enhancements under Penal Code section 12022, subdivision (c), for all but one of the unstayed counts of defendant\u2019s narcotics-related convictions as well as the sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The clerk of the superior court is then directed to prepare a new abstract of judgment reflecting the changes in sentence and to forward a certified copy to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-5\">Raye, P.
