On appeal, he challenges his convictions and his sentences. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s challenge to his convictions. The trial court imposed a partially consecutive sentence on one of defendant\u2019s convictions over his objection, making findings pursuant to ORS 137.123(5). On appeal, defendant argues that the court erred in imposing that consecutive sentence based on judicial factfinding. The state acknowledges that defendant is correct under the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 260, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert </em>granted,_US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008).
