ORS 671.020(1) (2001), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2003, ch 763, \u00a7 2. Petitioner seeks judicial review. He argues that the board\u2019s interpretation of the statutory definition of the \u201c[p]ractice of architecture,\u201d <em>former </em>ORS 671.010(5) (2001), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 671.010(6) (2003),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is overly broad because it includes designing and planning for buildings that were never erected and that, under the correct interpretation, he committed no violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The board found the following facts, which, because they are uncontested on judicial review, we adopt. <em>Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995). Davis is the owner of Coast Drafting and Design. Neither Davis nor any other employee of Coast Drafting and Design is a licensed architect. In 1996, Kent Seida, the sole proprietor of Seida Construction, saw an advertisement for Coast Drafting and Design and contacted Davis to inquire about Davis providing designs for a strip mall that Seida was planning to build in Lincoln City. On July 9, 1996, a partner at Coast Drafting and Design entered into a \u201cProposal and Contract\u201d with Seida to create preliminary plans for this \u201cSeida Center.\u201d The agreement defined preliminary plans as sufficient to create \u201ca final floor plan and elevations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Pursuant to the \u201cProposal and Contract,\u201d petitioner\u2019s employee completed drawings for three proposals, and Seida selected one for the Seida Center. The other two were stamped, \u201cPreliminary Not For Construction.\u201d Shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>thereafter, in October of 1996, petitioner entered into another contract with Seida, in which petitioner agreed to provide the following services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">\u201c1. Provide permit ready drawings for a two (2) story, wood frame retail strip center on Hwy 101, Lincoln City, Oregon as per attached sketch * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Incorporate civil and structural drawings, done by others, into the working drawings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201c3. Periodic site visits and reports to Client during course of construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201c4. Provide reproductions of drawings as follows, 20 sets Preliminary Drawings for Site Plan Review, and 12 Sets Final Working Drawings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Petitioner\u2019s employee subsequently produced two floor plan drawings showing two levels of building units with square footage. Both drawings were stamped by petitioner. Later, petitioner\u2019s employee prepared six drawings incorporating the earlier drawings of the Seida Center. Two of the drawings included building elevations, and four of them included square foot measurements for the building. Petitioner and Seida then submitted the plans to the Lincoln City Planning Director, who approved them.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">In 1998 and 1999, petitioner drew more detailed plans of the proposed Seida Center, including framing plans and section details. These drawings were stamped by petitioner and the engineering firm with which petitioner had subcontracted. However, due to circumstances that are not part of the record in this case, the Seida Center project was abandoned; the buildings were never erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">On October 26, 2004, the board served a notice of intent to assess a civil penalty of $10,000 against petitioner on the ground that petitioner had practiced architecture without a license and had misrepresented himself as an architect. Petitioner filed an appeal. In an amended notice issued approximately one year later, the board dropped the allegation regarding misrepresentation and reduced the proposed penalty to $5,000. The notice alleged, in addition to the facts related above, that petitioner\u2019s \u201cconduct in the planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and design of the [Seida Center] at each stage of the project constitutes the practice of architecture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">A hearing was held, and an administrative law judge issued a proposed order concluding that petitioner had practiced architecture without a license and that he should be fined $5,000. Petitioner filed exceptions, which the board rejected in a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The relevant portion of ORS 671.020(1) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201cIn order to safeguard life, health and property and to eliminate unnecessary loss and waste in this state, no person shall practice the profession of architecture * * * without first qualifying before the State Board of Architect Examiners and obtaining a certificate of registration * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">ORS 671.010(5) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201c \u2018Practice of architecture\u2019 means any one or combination of the following practices by a person: The planning, designing or supervision of the erection, enlargement or alteration of any building or of any appurtenance thereto other than exempted buildings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u201cPractice of architecture\u201d is an inexact statutory term \u2014 that is, neither a term with such a precise definition that no interpretation is necessary nor a term (such as \u201cgood cause\u201d) indicating that the legislature intended to delegate the definition of that term to an agency charged with implementing the statute. <em>See Springfield Education Assn. v. School </em>Dist., 290 Or 217, 223, 621 P2d 547 (1980) (summarizing the categorization of statutory terms).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">\u201cWhen applying such statutory terms to specific facts, whether by order or by rule, the task of the agency, and ultimately of the court, is to determine whether the legislature intended the compass of the words to include those facts. The determination of the meaning of a statute is one of law, ultimately for the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Davis does not deny that he produced plans and designs for a proposed nonexempt building. He argues only that the statutory definition does not encompass planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and designing buildings that are never erected. We conclude that petitioner\u2019s proposed definition cannot be reconciled with the statute\u2019s text, which unambiguously provides that the practice of architecture includes \u201cplanning\u201d or \u201cdesigning\u201d the \u201cerection * * * of any building.\u201d One plans the erection of a building or executes designs for it regardless of whether the plans or designs ever come to fruition. The violation of ORS 671.020, therefore, occurs at the time of planning or designing, if the plans or designs are executed for the purpose of erecting a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In the present case, that purpose is clear. Petitioner agreed to provide \u201cpermit ready drawings\u201d; although that term is not defined in the final contract with Seida, it is defined in petitioner\u2019s proposal as drawings that \u201cwill be sufficient to obtain local building permits.\u201d The contract also provides that petitioner will incorporate into its plans civil and structural drawings done by others but adopted by petitioner, will perform \u201c[p]eriodic site visits and reports to Client during course of construction,\u201d and will provide \u201cFinal Working Drawings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Petitioner argues that defining the practice of architecture so as to include plans and designs that are not used in the construction of a building fails to implement the overarching purpose of the regulation of architects, that is, \u201cto safeguard life, health and property and to eliminate unnecessary loss and waste.\u201d ORS 671.020(1). We disagree. Public safety and prevention of waste can be safeguarded by prohibiting activities that are undertaken in contemplation of erecting buildings; the state logically need not wait until the erection actually occurs. Petitioner also argues that, under the board\u2019s interpretation of ORS 671.010(5), a client who meets with a contractor and sketches on a paper napkin the rough outline of a proposed home could be penalized for the \u201c[p]ractice of architecture.\u201d If the board decides to penalize a person for that activity, we will have the opportunity to evaluate petitioner\u2019s hypothesis. At this time, however, our task is only to apply the statutory term \u201cto specific facts\u201d before us and \u201cto determine whether the legislature intended the compass of the words to include those facts.\u201d <em>Springfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 224. We conclude that the legislature intended its definition of \u201c[p]ractice of architecture\u201d to encompass what petitioner did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> Hereafter all references to ORS 671.020(1) and ORS 671.010(5) are to the 2001 statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\"> Petitioner also assigns error to the board\u2019s use of findings of fact that, he argues, are not relevant to any issue specified in the \u201cAmended Notice of Intent to Impose Civil Penalty.\u201d The board, however, expressly stated that it \u201ccould and would impose the civil penalty * * * without reference\u201d to the specified findings and that the \u201cevidence establishes the unlicensed practice of architecture even without reference to\u201d those findings. The board\u2019s order did not rely on the findings, nor do we in our review of that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
