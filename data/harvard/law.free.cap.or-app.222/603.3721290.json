Ramirez, </em>219 Or App 598, 184 P3d 1138 (2008). We held that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to cross-examine his codefendant, Garcia, about whether defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine when they committed an armed robbery, which was pertinent to defendant\u2019s assertion that he was voluntarily intoxicated and thus could not form the intent to commit the offense. In support of its petition, the state makes several arguments asserting that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. We allow reconsideration to briefly address one of those arguments and reject the others without discussion. We adhere to our former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"> The state argues that any error in refusing to allow defendant to cross-examine Garcia was harmless because defendant could have called Garcia in his own case-in-chief and elicited the same information that he attempted to elicit through cross-examination. The state\u2019s argument is not well taken. A trial court error is harmless if there is little likelihood that it affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). The availability of mitigating measures to the party against whom an erroneous ruling was made does not mean that the ruling was unlikely to have affected the verdict. In other words, the fact that defendant could have taken measures that would have rendered the trial court\u2019s error harmless does not mean that the error <em>was </em>harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion adhered to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
