On appeal, defendant raises an unpreserved argument that the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences based on a judicial determination that the crimes occurred during separate criminal episodes violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert </em>granted,_US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008). Defendant argues that, notwithstanding the lack of preservation, this court should exercise its discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to correct the error. The state responds that any error is not apparent on the face of the record, given that the indictment alleged that the crimes occurred in different date ranges and were \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from one another. For the reasons that follow, even assuming that the asserted error is \u201cplain error\u201d in light of <em>State v. Hagberg, </em>345 Or 161, 190 P3d 1209 (2008),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we decline to exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A variety of factors can bear on our exercise of discretion under <em>Ailes. See </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Here, one is conclusive: the \u201ccompeting interests of the parties\u201d in whether resentencing should occur. In that regard, we note, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 513, 173 P3d 817 (2007), that the state has \u201ca significant interest in avoiding a second, unnecessary sentencing hearing.\u201d In weighing that interest, we evaluate whether \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d could have failed to find the fact used to enhance the sentence at issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In this case, the victim clearly stated that the crimes occurred on \u201cdifferent day[s].\u201d Given the victim\u2019s account of the events, the date ranges alleged in the indictment, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>lack of any evidence in the record to support an inference that the crimes occurred but did <em>not </em>occur in the date ranges alleged in the indictment, we conclude that no reasonable factfinder would have failed to conclude that the crimes occurred during separate criminal episodes. <em>Cf. State v. Calderon-Ortiz, </em>222 Or App 1, 191 P3d 808 (2008) (finding sentencing error under similar circumstances to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>State v. Bowen, </em>220 Or App 380, 185 P3d 1129 (2008) (same). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the asserted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\"> It is arguable that <em>Hagberg </em>is distinguishable from the present case, because <em>Hagberg </em>involved counts alleged to have occurred within the same range of dates, whereas the present case involves counts alleged to have occurred in different date ranges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
