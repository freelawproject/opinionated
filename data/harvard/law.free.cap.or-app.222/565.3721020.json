Plaintiff, as personal representative for Grigory Rogozhnikov\u2019s estate, filed a declaratory judgment action seeking uninsured motorist (UM) benefits under an automobile insurance policy issued by defendant Essex Insurance Company (Essex), and under which defendant Broadway Cab, LLC (Broadway) remained self-insured for the first portion of coverage. On appeal, the parties raise three arguments about the application and meaning of terms in the relevant UM statute. Because we hold that the passenger who shot Rogozhnikov was not an \u201coperator\u201d of the cab under the UM statutes, we do not reach the other two arguments. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The facts are undisputed. In the early morning of February 16, 2003, Grigory Rogozhnikov was driving his cab as an independent contractor for Broadway. He picked up a passenger, Barr, near the Justice Center in Portland and drove him to Barr\u2019s workplace in northeast Portland. Barr entered his workplace and returned to the cab with a bag. He got into the backseat of the cab and shot Rogozhnikov in the head. Rogozhnikov was able to get out of the cab, and Barr shot him again. Barr then drove off in Rogozhnikov\u2019s cab. Rogozhnikov died of the gunshot wounds. Barr pleaded guilty to several crimes arising from those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">At the time of the shooting, Rogozhnikov was insured under an automobile policy that Essex had issued to Broadway. By agreement with Essex, Broadway was self-insured for the first $200,000 of any UM benefits that it owed, with Essex providing excess coverage. Plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action seeking UM benefits under the Essex policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Each party moved for summary judgment, claiming, under the UM statutes, entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The applicable UM statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cThe insurer will pay all sums which the insured * * * shall be legally entitled to recover as general and special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>damages from the <em>owner or operator </em>of an <em>uninsured vehicle </em>because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by accident and arising out of the <em>ownership, maintenance or use </em>of such uninsured vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">ORS 742.504(1)(a)(2001) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The parties contested three issues at summary judgment: (1) whether Barr was an \u201coperator\u201d of the vehicle as required by the statute;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) whether Rogozhnikov\u2019s cab was an \u201cuninsured vehicle\u201d when \u201coperated\u201d by Barr; and (3) whether Rogozhnikov\u2019s death \u201car[ose] out of the * * * use\u201d of his cab. In order for plaintiff to be entitled to recover UM benefits under the statute, she had to establish that the answer to each of those questions was \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants on the ground that the cab was not an uninsured motor vehicle because it was insured under a policy issued by Essex. Plaintiff appealed. On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to the grant of defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and to the denial of her cross-motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff renews the arguments that she made below on the three issues that the parties contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, our task is to determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C; <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 420, 939 P2d 608 (1997); <em>Barber v. George, </em>144 Or App 370, 372-73, 927 P2d 140 (1996). When there are cross-motions for summary judgment and the grant of one and denial of the other are assigned as error, both rulings are subject to review. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Crutchfield, </em>200 Or App 146, 152-53, 113 P3d 972 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 609 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> On appeal, plaintiff argues that Barr became an \u201coperator\u201d of the cab when he put a gun to Rogozhnikov\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>head, thereby becoming a carjacker and exercising constructive control over the vehicle by directing Rogozhnikov\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff frames the question as, \u201cWhen does a carjacker become an \u2018operator\u2019?\u201d Defendants argue that Barr was not an \u201coperator\u201d because that term has been construed by the Supreme Court to be limited to a person in actual physical control of a vehicle, and Barr did not physically control the cab at the point at which he put the gun to Rogozhnikov\u2019s head and shot him. <em>See Schaffer v. Mill Owners Ins. Co., </em>242 Or 150, 153-55, 407 P2d 614 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Whether Barr was an \u201coperator\u201d of the cab is a question of statutory construction. The term \u201coperator\u201d was not defined in the UM statutes or the Motor Vehicle Code during the period applicable to this action. However, \u201coperator\u201d was defined in the Motor Vehicle Code when the UM statutes were enacted in 1967. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1967, ch 482, \u00a7 3(1)(a) (enacting the applicable UM statutes). <em>Former </em>ORS 483.008(2) (1967), <em>repealed by </em>Oregon Laws 1983, chapter 338, section 978, provided that, as used in the Motor Vehicle Code, \u201c [d]river\u2019 or \u2018operator\u2019 means any person, other than a chauffeur, who is in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the highways or streets of this state.\u201d Under that provision, \u201coperator\u201d was synonymous with \u201cdriver,\u201d and required \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a vehicle. While that definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201coperator\u201d does not apply to the UM statutes, it provides useful context, because the Motor Vehicle Code and the automobile insurance statutes both address the operation of motor vehicles. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (where the legislature uses the same term in related statutes, the court may infer that the term has the same meaning).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The term \u201coperator\u201d also was construed by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Schaffer, </em>242 Or at 155, a case involving an automobile insurance policy that was decided two years before the legislature enacted the UM statutes. In <em>Schaffer, </em>a father drove a car to the coast with his 17-year-old son. The father became ill and told his son to drive. While the son was driving, the car collided with another car. That car\u2019s driver filed an action against the father, was awarded damages, and sought to collect those damages from the father\u2019s automobile insurer. The insurer denied coverage based on an exclusion in the insurance policy for \u201caccidents which occur while any automobile is being operated by any male <em>operator </em>under 25 years of <em>age\u201d Id. </em>at 152 (emphasis modified). \u201cOperator\u201d was not defined in the policy, and plaintiff argued that the father was an \u201coperator\u201d because, although he was ill in the backseat of the car, he was present in the car and had the right to control the actions of his son. The court rejected that argument and held that \u201coperation\u201d of a vehicle requires \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the vehicle\u2019s movements. <em>Id. </em>at 154-55. \u201cWhen used in this context, we construe \u2018operator\u2019 to be synonymous with \u2018driver.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. \u201cIn enacting subsequent legislation, the legislature is considered to be aware of th[e Supreme] [C]ourt\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>State v. Clevenger, </em>297 Or 234, 244, 683 P2d 1360 (1984). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the legislature was aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the term \u201coperator\u201d in an automobile insurance policy to be synonymous with driver, and to mean a person who has actual physical control of a vehicle, when it used that term in the UM statutes that it enacted two years after <em>Schaffer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">That interpretation also is consistent with our previous understanding of the meaning of \u201coperator\u201d in an insurance policy. In <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. White, </em>60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Or App 666, 669, 655 P2d 599 (1982), we construed a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy that excluded coverage for \u201ca motor vehicle owned or <em>operated </em>by, rented or loaned to any insured.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In that case, the driver was driving a car with three passengers. One of the passengers was in the backseat and, while the car was traveling at 55 miles per hour on Interstate 5, she reached between the driver and a passenger in the front seat and grabbed and yanked the steering wheel, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get crazy.\u201d The driver lost control of the car, which struck a median barrier and overturned. The driver and two other passengers brought claims against the backseat passenger, who then tendered the claims to her parents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurer. The insurer denied coverage based on the policy\u2019s motor vehicle exclusion, arguing that the passenger was \u201coperating\u201d the vehicle when she grabbed and yanked the steering wheel. In a declaratory judgment action that the insurer brought to determine its duty to defend the claims, we held that the passenger did not \u201coperate\u201d the vehicle but, rather, interfered with its operation. As we said in that case, \u201c[t]he word \u2018operator\u2019 in an insurance policy involving automobiles refers to the driver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671 (citing <em>Schaffer, </em>242 Or 150).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In light of the foregoing consistent understanding of the term \u201coperator\u201d in the context of automobile insurance and statutes addressing the operation of motor vehicles, we conclude that the term \u201coperator\u201d in ORS 742.504(1)(a) means a person who exercises actual physical control over a vehicle. Here, Barr was not an \u201coperator,\u201d because he did not have actual physical control over the vehicle. Barr may have been trying to become an operator, or may have been in constructive control of the vehicle while holding a gun to Rogozhnikov\u2019s head, but he was not in actual physical control of the vehicle when he shot Rogozhnikov. Hence, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment for defendants because defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs claim for UM benefits. Likewise, the court did not err in denying summary judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"> ORS 742.504 has been amended a number of times since 2001. Because those amendments do not effect our analysis, we do not address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\"> The parties agree that Barr was not the \u201cowner\u201d of the cab and thus must be an \u201coperator\u201d for UM benefits to apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-5\"> The parties dispute whether our task is to construe the policy terms or the terms of the applicable UM statute. The policy issued by Essex provides, in part, that \u201c[w]e will pay all sums the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the <em>owner or driver </em>of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) The applicable UM statute, ORS 742.504(1)(a) (2001), provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he insurer will pay all sums which the insured * * * shall be legally entitled to recover as general and special damages from the <em>owner or operator </em>of an uninsured vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ORS 742.504(1) to (12) \u201cset[s] out a comprehensive model UM/UIM policy.\u201d <em>Vega v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>343 Or 291, 302, 918 P2d 95 (1996). Under the statute, \u201cEvery policy * * * shall provide uninsured motorist coverage which in each instance is no less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary than if the following provisions were set forth in the policy.\u201d ORS 742.504 (2001). Thus, plaintiff argues and Broadway concedes, that we should apply the statutory terms because \u201cdriver\u201d is a narrower and therefore less favorable term than \u201coperator.\u201d Essex argues that we should apply the policy terms, but that, at any rate, the result is the same regardless of which term we construe because, under <em>Schaffer v. Mill Owners Ins. Co., </em>242 Or 150, 407 P2d 614 (1965) (discussed below, 222 Or App at 570), \u201coperator\u201d is synonymous with \u201cdriver.\u201d Because the statutory term \u201coperator\u201d could be more favorable than the policy term \u201cdriver,\u201d we focus on the former in resolving this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
