J.</author>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Defendants lived on their sailboats at Eagle\u2019s Cove Marina, where they rented moorage slips from plaintiff, the owner of Eagle\u2019s Cove.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff served defendants with 30-day eviction notices under ORS 91.070. When defendants refused to vacate the slips, plaintiff filed Forcible Entry and Detainer (FED) actions under ORS chapter 91 to evict them. At trial, defendants defended on the ground that ORS chapter 91 was inapplicable because their sailboats qualified as \u201cfloating homes\u201d under the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (RLTA) in ORS chapter 90. The trial court entered FED judgments in favor of plaintiff and supplemental judgments for costs and disbursements, concluding that the RLTA did not apply. The cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal. On defendants\u2019 appeal, we reverse for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Because the facts are undisputed, we review for error of law. Eagle\u2019s Cove Marina is primarily populated with boats and is advertised as a live-aboard community. Eagle\u2019s Cove consists of a walkway connected to a wooden dock, which provides moorage slips for approximately 78 boats. At each end of the dock, there are laundry, shower, and bathroom facilities. Each individual slip has a storage shed as well as electricity, water, and sewage hook-ups.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">All defendants rented slips at Eagle\u2019s Cove on a month-to-month basis and lived on their sailboats, using them as their primary residences. Defendants attached their sailboats to the docks with ropes that are tied to dock cleats. The ropes are relatively easy to remove, and, according to defendant Woldridge, preparing to sail takes about 30 minutes. Defendant Woldridge sails his boat approximately 15 days out of the year. Defendant McCune\u2019s boat has never left its slip, and defendant Trevillyan has moved his boat only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>once since moving to Eagle\u2019s Cove, when it was towed from one slip to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The RLTA requires that tenants be given 180 days\u2019 notice before eviction can occur from a tenancy involving a \u201cfloating home\u201d under ORS 90.429.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In contrast, ORS 91.070 requires not less than 30 days\u2019 notice before an eviction can occur if a month-to-month tenancy does not involve a floating home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In these cases, plaintiff gave only a 30-day notice of eviction. The trial court ruled that only a 30-day notice was required, reasoning,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201cI rule that the 30-day notice given by the Plaintiff to the Defendants pursuant to ORS 91.070 was valid and properly served. Further, I rule that the boats are \u2018boats\u2019 as defined by ORS 830.700(1) and are not \u2018floating homes\u2019 as defined under ORS 830.700(4) and Chapter 90. The Defendants\u2019 tenancies were month-to-month tenancies and the Plaintiff lawfully terminated the tenancies. The Plaintiff is entitled to an immediate judgement of restitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In a separate document, entitled \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d the trial court made the following undisputed findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201c15. Mark MacCune lives aboard his boat moored at Eagle\u2019s Cove Marina and RV and uses it as his primary residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201c16. Rick Woldridge lives aboard his boat moored at Eagle\u2019s Cove Marina and RV and uses it as his primary residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201c17. Clifford Trevillyan lives aboard his boat moored at Eagle\u2019s Cove Marina and RV and uses it as his primary residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201c18. The boats of Mark MacCune, Rick Woldridge and Clifford Trevillyan are capable of being self-propelled and being used as a mode of transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Additionally, the trial court ruled that defendants\u2019 sailboats are not floating homes, reasoning that the sailboats are not \u201cstructures\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201c19. Under applicable Oregon laws and statutes, the Defendants\u2019 boats are considered \u201cboats\u2019 and not \u2018manufactured homes\u2019 or \u2018floating homes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c20. A \u2018boat\u2019 is a form of watercraft that is used or capable of being used as a means of transportation. ORS 830.700(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\u201c21. A \u2018floating home\u2019 is not capable of being used as a means of transportation. ORS 830.700(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">\u201c22. The boats of Mark MacCune, Rick Woldridge and Clifford Trevillyan are not considered structures within the texts and contexts of the statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\u201c23. ORS Chapter 91 * * * is the applicable law controlling in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">The trial court then entered general judgments in favor of plaintiff, but it stayed enforcement of those judgments, pending the outcome of this appeal. The trial court also entered supplemental judgments that denied plaintiffs request for attorney fees but awarded plaintiff costs and disbursements. While this appeal was pending, plaintiff sold Eagle\u2019s Cove, and the buyer has not been substituted as a party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">The threshold issue is whether these cases are moot because plaintiff no longer owns Eagle\u2019s Cove. Our review of the record indicates that defendants remain liable for the supplemental judgments for costs and disbursements even though plaintiff no longer has any interest in evicting them. Because the judgments for costs and disbursements are still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>in controversy and depend on a determination on the merits, we conclude that these cases are not moot. <em>See Bates v. Gordon, </em>212 Or App 336, 341-42, 157 P3d 1219 (2007) (\u201cBecause the filing fee award is still in controversy and because the award depends on the correctness of the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits, thus having a practical effect on the rights of the parties, we conclude that the case is not moot.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We turn to the merits. Essentially, defendants\u2019 assignments of error frame a single issue \u2014 whether their sailboats are \u201cfloating homes\u201d within the contemplation of the RLTA. If the sailboats are \u201cfloating homes,\u201d then 30 days\u2019 notice was not sufficient to lawfully evict them without cause. The RLTA applies only to the rental of a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cThis chapter applies to, regulates and determines rights, obligations and remedies under a rental agreement, wherever made, for a <em>dwelling unit </em>located within this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">ORS 90.115 (emphasis added). The definition of \u201cdwelling unit\u201d under the RLTA includes the rented moorage slip for a \u201cfloating home,\u201d but not the rented moorage slip for a \u201cboat.\u201d A \u201c \u2018[d]welling unit\u2019 means a structure or the part of a structure that is used as a home, residence or sleeping place by one person who maintains a household or by two or more persons who maintain a common household.\u201d ORS 90.100(9). With reference to \u201cmoorage space for a floating home as defined in ORS 830.700,\u201d a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d \u201cmeans the <em>space rented </em>and not the * * * <em>floating home itself.\u201d </em>ORS 90.100(9) (emphasis added). Thus, whether the spaces rented for the moorage of defendants\u2019 sailboats are subject to the RLTA depends on whether their sailboats are \u201cfloating homes\u201d within the meaning of ORS 830.700.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">ORS 830.700 provides definitions regarding how boats are titled and licensed under state law. For purposes of that statute, a \u201c [b]oat\u2019 means every description of watercraft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water, but does not include * * * floating homes[.]\u201d ORS 830.700(1). ORS 830.700(4) provides that a \u201c \u2018[floating home\u2019 means a moored structure that is secured to a pier or pilings and is used primarily as a domicile and not as a boat.\u201d ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>830.700 does not define the word \u201cstructure.\u201d We therefore give it its ordinarily understood definition. <em>State v. Murray, </em>340 Or 599, 604, 136 P3d 10 (2006) (\u201cAbsent a special definition, we ordinarily would resort to dictionary definitions, assuming that the legislature meant to use a word of common usage in its ordinary sense.\u201d). The word \u201cstructure\u201d is defined as \u201c2a : something constructed or built * * * b : something made up of more or less interdependent elements or parts : something having a definite or fixed pattern of organization * * *.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2267 (unabridged ed 2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that defendants\u2019 sailboats are structures because they are \u201csomething constructed or built\u201d and are \u201cmade up of more or less interdependent elements or parts * * * having a definite or fixed pattern of organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The final issue under ORS 830.700(4) in this case is whether defendants\u2019 sailboats are primarily used as their domiciles and not primarily used as boats.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The findings by the trial court (not contested by the parties) and the undisputed evidence that none of the defendants sails his boat more than 15 days a year establish that fact. <em>See </em>findings No. 15, 16, 17. It necessarily follows from the legislature\u2019s incorporation of ORS 830.700(4) into the RLTA and the trial court\u2019s findings, that the slips in which defendants\u2019 sailboats are moored are \u201cdwelling units\u201d for the purposes of the RLTA. Consequently, defendants are correct when they contend that 30 days\u2019 notice was not sufficient to lawfully evict them without cause, and it was error for the trial court to enter the FED judgments and the supplemental judgments for costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">General judgments and supplemental judgments for costs and disbursements reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> Although the property is named \u201cEagle\u2019s Cove Marina,\u201d neither party asserts on appeal that Eagle\u2019s Cove is a \u201cmarina\u201d as defined in ORS 90.100(25), and we express no opinion on that issue. If defendants\u2019 sailboats were moored at a \u201cmarina,\u201d the rights and obligations of the parties are different than as described in this opinion. <em>See </em>ORS 90.100(11), ORS 90.100(25), ORS 90.120, ORS 90.427(5), and ORS 90.429.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\"> ORS 90.429 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">\u201cIf a tenancy consists of rented space for a * * * floating home that is owned by the tenant, but the tenancy is not subject to ORS 90.505 to 90.840 because the space is not in a facility, the landlord may terminate a month-to-month tenancy without a cause specified in ORS 90.392, 90.394 or 90.396 only by delivering a written notice of termination to the tenant not less than 180 days before the termination date designated in that notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Additionally, ORS 90.100(11) provides that a \u201c \u2018[flacility\u2019 means * * * a marina.\u201d As noted above, 222 Or App at 112 n 1, the parties do not contend that Eagle\u2019s Cove is a \u201cmarina\u201d within the meaning of the RLTA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-11\"> ORS 91.070 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">\u201cOne who holds the lands or tenements of another, under the demise of the other, and no certain time has been mentioned, but a monthly rental has been reserved, is considered a tenant from month to month.
