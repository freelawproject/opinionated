J.</author>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission (EQC) and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) (respondents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) appeal from a supplemental judgment awarding petitioners, various environmental groups and individuals, a portion of the costs and attorney fees that they incurred in disputing the provisions of a hazardous waste permit authorizing the construction and operation of an incineration facility to dispose of chemical weapons stored at the Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility. Specifically, respondents challenge the award of fees on the alternative grounds that the circuit court did not find \u201cin favor of\u2019 petitioners, ORS 183.497, that an award of fees is not mandatory, ORS 183.497(1)(b), and that the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding petitioners\u2019 fees, ORS 183.497(1)(a); ORS 20.075(1), (3). Respondents also assert that petitioners cannot recover any costs because they were not \u201cprevailing part[ies].\u201d ORCP 68 B. As explained below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We begin, necessarily, by putting this dispute into uncontroverted context. These parties have a long history of disagreement concerning the conditions, if any, under which the construction and operation of chemical weapons disposal facilities should be permitted at the Umatilla Army Depot in northeastern Oregon. Indeed, this is the third time in which some aspect of that dispute has been presented for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In the first instance, in 1997, petitioners sought judicial review in circuit court under ORS 183.484<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of respondents\u2019 order granting a hazardous waste permit to the United States Army for the construction and operation of the disposal facility. Petitioners asserted that respondents had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>complied with state and federal laws that required respondents, before issuing the permit, to determine, among other criteria, that the facility would not have an adverse effect on public health and safety, on the environment, or on adjacent lands, and that it use the best available technology for treating and disposing of the hazardous waste. <em>See generally G.A.S.P. v. Environmental Quality Commission, </em>198 Or App 182, 185, 108 P3d 95, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) <em>(G.A.S.P. I) </em>(providing background); <em>see also </em>ORS 466.010(1)(a)(A) (purposes of hazardous waste permitting statutes include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[p]rotect[ing] the public health and safety and environment of Oregon to the maximum extent possible\u201d). The circuit court, after refusing petitioners\u2019 request to conduct discovery, cross-examine witnesses, and present additional evidence, reviewed the order based on the record before respondents and remanded one portion of the order to respondents for clarification. After respondents clarified the order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the circuit court entered a judgment affirming respondents\u2019 order in its entirety. <em>G.A.S.P. </em>I, 198 Or App at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">On appeal from that judgment, petitioners asserted, alternatively, that (1) they were entitled to a contested case hearing, and (2) the circuit court erred in not permitting them to introduce evidence in addition to that included in the record before respondents. In <em>G.A.S.P. I, </em>we held that petitioners were not entitled to a contested case hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 189-93. We also held, however, that, under <em>Norden v. Water Resources Dept., </em>329 Or 641, 996 P2d 958 (2000), the circuit court had erred in failing to permit the parties to supplement the record, including by giving them an opportunity to present evidence that was not available at the time respondents entered the challenged order. Consequently, we remanded the case to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing that complied with the requirements <em>o\u00edNorden. G.A.S.P. </em>I, 198 Or App at 194-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Meanwhile, following the circuit court\u2019s limited remand to respondents in <em>G.A.S.P. I </em>in 1998, petitioners requested that respondents reconsider or revoke the permit. In July 2000, respondents denied that request, determining that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to warrant modification or revocation. In September 2000, petitioners initiated this proceeding (G.A.S.P. <em>III) </em>by filing a petition for judicial review in circuit court under ORS 183.484 of respondents\u2019 denial of modification or revocation of the permit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Army intervened in light of its interests in disposing of the stockpile of chemical weapons at the Umatilla Depot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In the circuit court proceedings, petitioners reasserted the contentions they had made in <em>GA.S.P. I </em>and further contended that respondents\u2019 order rejecting modification or revocation of the permit was not supported by substantial evidence in the record and was contrary to law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>proceedings, petitioners attempted to elicit expert testimony from Cramer, an Army employee, concerning the Army\u2019s chemical warfare agent monitoring systems and techniques. The Army asserted that Army regulations, specifically 32 CFR sections 516.49, 516.52 \u2014 the so-called <em>\u201cTouhy </em>regulations\u201d \u2014 prohibited Army employees, such as Cramer, from providing expert or opinion testimony in litigation for a party other than the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel for the Army also made the comment that if Cramer testified \u201che does so at his own peril\u201d and questioned \u201cwhy [Cramer] would want to put his head on the block for testifying in this case * * The circuit court ultimately ruled that the federal whistle-blower statute, 42 USC section 6971, trumped any attempt by the Army to invoke the <em>Touhy </em>regulations to prevent an employee from testifying; nevertheless, Cramer declined to testify as an expert or to give his opinion, expressing concerns about putting his job in jeopardy and the \u201cthreat of reprisals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Petitioners moved for sanctions against the Army based on its intimidation of and threats of retaliation against Cramer, requesting, among other relief, revocation of the permit until the alleged deficiencies were cured. Respondents\u2014 who were not the target of the motion for sanctions \u2014 took no position on the merits of that motion. However, respondents <em>did </em>assert that the relief sought, including revocation, was inappropriate regardless of whether the Army\u2019s conduct was sanctionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The circuit court ultimately denied the motion for sanctions, finding no sanctionable misconduct. In so ruling, however, the court expressed profound concerns with the Army\u2019s \u201cinitial, repeated, and persisting assertion of a right to prevent testimony by any employee in these proceedings,\u201d which \u201craise[d] serious questions about the respondents\u2019 ability to ensure public safety during the proposed operation of the demilitarization incineration facility at Umatilla[.]\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>court also reiterated its conclusion that the <em>Touhy </em>regulations were trumped by the federal whistle-blower statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Notwithstanding its dismissal of sanctions against the Army \u2014 and in light of the dynamic that prompted petitioners\u2019 motion for sanctions and the Army\u2019s persistence in asserting the <em>Touhy </em>regulations \u2014 the circuit court asked the parties (including respondents) to address the following question in their post-trial briefing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cWhy would any rational agency in DEQ/EQC\u2019s role not require in the permit that the Army expressly and notoriously forgo any right or power to prohibit good faith testimony by employees concerning hazards in the operation of the facility, or otherwise restrict the operation of <em>Touhy </em>regulations in the service of safety oversight?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In reply, respondents first asserted that the Army was legally entitled to seek to prevent Cramer from offering opinion testimony against the Army and contended that the circuit court had agreed with that position in denying petitioners\u2019 motion for sanctions. In any event, respondents contended, the issue was \u201cnot whether the Army <em>should </em>allow its employees to offer opinion testimony\u201d or whether \u201cDEQ/ EQC\u2019s decision-making processes would be improved if the Army allowed such testimony.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Rather, in respondents\u2019 view, the proper question was whether the Army\u2019s alleged suppression of whistle-blower testimony <em>compelled </em>a finding of cause for revocation of the permit under applicable law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to respondents, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Respondents also asserted that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order modification of the permit to protect whistle-blower testimony because petitioners had neither requested such modification from respondents nor asserted the necessity of such a modification in their petition for judicial review. Finally, respondents argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that, even if permit modification was within the circuit court\u2019s purview, modification was \u201cunnecessary and unwarranted\u201d because (1) whistle-blowers are free to share information with respondents at any time; (2) the <em>Touhy </em>regulations prevent current Army employees only from offering opinion testimony in court and do not apply with respect to out-of-court statements; (3) the record before the agencies includes some whistle-blower statements; and (4) permit modification would not offer whistle-blowers any additional protection beyond what is provided under existing state and federal whistle-blower laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In sum, respondents vigorously opposed any modification of the permit to include explicit whistle-blower protections for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cgood faith testimony by employees concerning hazards in the operation of the [permitted] facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In July 2004, the circuit court issued a comprehensive and detailed \u201cOpinion and Order on Judicial Review,\u201d in which it again expressed profound concerns that respondents and the Army were continuing to assert that the <em>Touhy </em>regulations could be applied in the context of the Umatilla facility, notwithstanding federal statutory law to the contrary. In light of those concerns, the court determined that the permit must be modified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201c[Blecause the safe operation of this facility is critically dependent upon monitors whose fallibility is known to the agency, and whose accurate calibration and operation is monitored predominantly by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta \u2014 but neither regularly nor often; because a substantial minority of workers do not feel safe in approaching even their own supervisors with safety concerns, and because of incentives and opportunities to dismiss monitor malfunctions as \u2018false positives\u2019 before they would otherwise be of concern to the Respondents; because the Army as co-permittee has persisted in a pattern of minimal disclosure as to such basic issues as its intentions with respect to a major component of the facility, has continued to insist erroneously that it is lawful to prevent its employees from offering opinion testimony in court, and has arguably discouraged disclosure of safety concerns at other facilities in \u2018lessons learned\u2019 meetings; because Congress has recognized the critical importance of whistleblowers to the safe operation of such facilities; because the facility has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>real time monitors to alert operators and. the downwind community to releases of substantial quantities of chemical warfare agent from the facility in the event existing monitors fail to operate as designed; and because the permit and procedures contemplated for the operation of the facility contain no substantial alternative to the measure of safety afforded by a requirement that the permittees prominently encourage employees with good faith concerns related to the safety of the operation of the facility to voice those concerns to supervisors and to Respondents if concerns are not addressed, <em>I find that no reasonable agency would fail to require whistleblower protections and related provisions, and remand the permit for such a modification.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The court concomitantly concluded that the order denying petitioners\u2019 request for permit modification or revocation was not supported by substantial evidence in that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201c[w]ithout the addition of whistleblower functions, the permitted activity endangers human health and the environment and can only be regulated to acceptable levels by modification of the permit to require the permittees prominently a) to advise workers of their obligation to report good faith concerns regarding the safety of workers, the public, or the environment, and related noncompliance with permit requirements, b) to notify workers of their obligation to convey such concerns to Respondents if those concerns are not otherwise sufficiently resolved, and c) to assure all workers that they will not be disadvantaged in any way by communicating such concerns in good faith[.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In response to the circuit court\u2019s opinion and order, but before final judgment had been entered, respondents approved a permit modification to include the protections required by the court and then moved for entry of final judgment. The circuit court, after finding that respondents had modified the permit in accordance with its order and that those modifications had become final, entered a general judgment in favor of respondents (and intervenors) and against petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Petitioners then sought recovery of the full amount of attorney fees ($293,938) and costs ($117,337.63) that they had incurred in litigating the petition for judicial review. Petitioners asserted that they were entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs under, <em>inter alia, </em>ORS 183.497 and <em>Deras v. Myers, </em>272 Or 47, 65-67, 535 P2d 541 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The circuit court determined that attorney fees and costs were authorized under ORS 183.497(1)(a), which provides for a discretionary award of attorney fees and costs on judicial review of a final order under ORS. 183.484 \u201cif the court finds in favor of the petitioner.\u201d Applying the statutory factors governing a discretionary award of fees set forth in ORS 20.075(1), the court awarded petitioners $87,000 in attorney fees and $1,952 in costs. Specifically, as described in detail below, the court found that the factors detailed in paragraphs (a) to (g) of ORS 20.075(1) militated neither for nor against an award of fees, but concluded that petitioners were entitled to a partial award of fees and costs because of the application of paragraph (h) \u2014 \u201c[s]uch other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">On appeal, respondents argue, alternatively, that (1) the court lacked authority to award fees because the court did not \u201cfind in favor\u201d of petitioners as required by ORS 183.497(1)(a); (2) ORCP 68 B precludes an award of costs to petitioners because petitioners cannot be said to be \u201cprevailing part[ies]\u201d in the case; and (3) the court abused its discretion under ORS 20.075(1) in awarding fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Respondents contest only entitlement; they do not raise any challenge to the reasonableness of the amount of fees and costs awarded. We address, and reject, each of respondents\u2019 arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We begin with respondents\u2019 contention that petitioners were not entitled to fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a) because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the court did not \u201cfind[ ] in favor of the petitioner[s].\u201d ORS 183.497 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201c(1) In a judicial proceeding designated under subsection (2) of this section[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201c(a) May, in its discretion, allow a petitioner reasonable attorney fees and costs if the court <em>finds in favor of the petitioner.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201c(b) Shall allow a petitioner reasonable attorney fees and costs if the court finds in favor of the petitioner and determines that the state agency acted without a reasonable basis in fact or in law; but the court may withhold all or part of the attorney fees from any allowance to a petitioner if the court finds that the state agency has proved that its action was substantially justified or that special circumstances exist that make the allowance of all or part of the attorney fees unjust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">(Emphasis added.) Whether the circuit court \u201c[found] in favor of the petitioner\u201d is a question of law. <em>See Kusyk v. Water Resources Dept., </em>164 Or App 738, 743, 994 P2d 798 (2000). Because no party sought review of the circuit court\u2019s decision on the merits of the modification/revocation dispute, we accept as uncontroverted the court\u2019s findings as set out in its Opinion and Order on Judicial Review. <em>See id. </em>at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Respondents argue that a court \u201cfinds in favor of the petitioner\u201d for purposes of ORS 183.497(1)(a) only if the court enters a judgment granting one of the forms of relief authorized by ORS 183.484(5)(a). Here, no such judgment was entered \u2014 and, indeed, the final judgment was entered \u201cin favor of\u2019 respondents, not petitioners \u2014 albeit because respondents, in response to the \u201chandwriting on the wall\u201d of the circuit court\u2019s Opinion and Order on Judicial Review, modified the permit. Thus, respondents reason, petitioners have not satisfied the <em>sine qua non </em>of fee entitlement under ORS 183.497(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In a closely related sense, respondents also reject the notion that fees can be awarded on the basis that the circuit court\u2019s opinion and order \u201cserved as a catalyst for permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>modification.\u201d That is so, they assert, because \u201c[a]t the time that DEQ took action to modify the permits, it was under no affirmative legal obligation to do so; no judgment had entered, and the proposed remand to the agency had not yet occurred.\u201d Respondents suggest that the context of ORS 183.497 \u201csupports the position that attorney fees should not be awarded when an agency <em>voluntarily </em>undertakes beneficial activity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">We disagree. As an initial matter, respondents\u2019 characterization of their actions as \u201cvoluntar/\u2019 is specious. That is a harsh adjective \u2014 but the record here admits no other. As noted, 222 Or App at 534-35, when the circuit court asked respondents to address the issue in their post-trial briefing\u2014 which occurred after the facts giving rise to the potential need for permit modification had come to light \u2014 respondents explicitly and vigorously <em>opposed </em>modification of the permit to include whistle-blower protections. It was only after the circuit court issued its opinion, ordering remand for precisely such modification, that respondents undertook the action that they now describe as \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Indeed, in their motion for entry of judgment, respondents represented that they had modified the permit \u201cin response\u201d to the circuit court\u2019s opinion and order. To be sure, the final judgment had not yet been entered, but it was only a matter of time before the legal obligation to modify definitively attached \u2014 and respondents knew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In all events, respondents\u2019 asserted argument that the circuit court did not \u201cfind in favor of\u2019 petitioners because final judgment was entered for respondents is not well taken. As support for that contention, respondents invoke <em>Kaib\u2019s Roving R.Ph. Agency v. Employment Dept., </em>338 Or 433, 111 P3d 739 (2005). That reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In <em>Kaib\u2019s, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a decision of this court that vacated an administrative order and remanded for reconsideration without addressing the substantive merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim \u2014 that is, a decision that \u201caddresse[d] only procedural matters,\u201d 338 Or at 443 \u2014 was \u201cin favor of\u2019 the petitioner for purposes of ORS 183.497. The court held that it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cJudicial review can and often does result in findings for or against parties without addressing the ultimate merits of a claim. No wording in ORS 183.497 suggests that the legislature intended to limit attorney fee awards to judicial review of the <em>merits </em>of a claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">338 Or at 442-43 (emphasis in original). Thus, <em>Kaib\u2019s </em>focused on the \u201cprocedural\u201d versus \u201cmerits\u201d distinction, not on finality.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, <em>Kaib\u2019s </em>flatly rejected the suggestion that to recover fees pursuant to ORS 183.497, a party must be a \u201cprevailing part/\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cThe department asserts, based on its review of the legislative history, that a finding \u2018in favor of a party is equivalent to a finding that a party is a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 It also cites several cases supporting the proposition that only a party who obtains substantive relief on the claims asserted is a \u2018prevailing part/ for purposes of an award of attorney fees and costs. That argument is misplaced. ORS 183.497 does not use the phrase \u2018prevailing party,\u2019 but another part of ORS chapter 183 does. ORS 183.485(1) requires a court having judicial review of contested cases to direct its decision, including its judgment, to the agency that issued the order being reviewed, and permits the court to \u2018direct that its judgment be delivered to the circuit court for any county designated by the prevailing party for entry in the court\u2019s register.\u2019 Clearly, the legislature knew how to refer to a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 when that was what it intended. The fact that the legislature chose instead to refer in ORS 183.497(1) to a finding \u2018in favor of a party suggests that it intended something different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">338 Or at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In sum, the predicate for an award of attorney fees under ORS 183.497(1) is not that the petitioner be a prevailing party under the final judgment. Rather, it is that, during the course of the judicial review, the court has resolved a dispute so that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201csome significant portion of the order petitioner challenges [is] altered or invalidated in a manner which is (or appears ultimately likely to be) to the petitioner\u2019s benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>Johnson v. Employment Division, </em>64 Or App 276, 283, 668 P2d 416, <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 120 (1983) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Kusyk, </em>164 Or App at 746 (ruling was \u201c \u2018in favor\u2019 of petitioners\u201d where agency reassessment required by court\u2019s remand \u201cwill likely be beneficial to [the] petitioners\u2019 concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">That prerequisite was satisfied here. The circuit court concluded that, although petitioners fell short of their ultimate goal of revoking the permit, the addition of whistle-blower protections was \u201cno temporary or <em>de minimis </em>modification\u201d and represented a \u201csignificant form of relief on petitioners\u2019 claims.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">As the circuit court found, petitioners\u2019 objectives before respondents and on judicial review was to establish permit requirements, conditions, procedures, and safeguards adequate to protect public health and the environment. Further, the court found that workers are often in the best position to observe hazardous conditions; that information from workers, including whistle-blowers, about hazardous incidents has been helpful to respondents in the past; and that meaningfully encouraging workers to report safety concerns would \u201cprovide an incremental and substantial measure of protection that is presently absent from the permit and not afforded by the mere existence of a federal whistleblower statute.\u201d Finally, as the circuit court found, the whistle-blower protections mandated by the Opinion and Order on Judicial Review are \u201cpotentially of enormous value for the safe operation of the Umatilla facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Given those unchallenged findings, the circuit court\u2019s resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute regarding the inclusion of whistle-blower protections in the permit caused respondents to alter that permit \u2014 as they would not have done but for the court\u2019s order \u2014 \u201cin a manner which is (or appears ultimately likely to be) to the petitioners\u2019 benefit.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>64 Or App at 283. Accordingly, the circuit court found \u201cin favor of\u2019 petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Respondents next challenge the circuit court\u2019s award of costs to petitioners under ORS 183.497(1)(a). They reason as follows: (1) ORCP 68 B authorizes an award of costs to the \u201cprevailing party;\u201d (2) \u201cprevailing party\u201d is defined in ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>20.077(2) as the party \u201cwho receives a favorable judgment or arbitration award on the claim\u201d; and, therefore, (3) petitioners were not the prevailing party because judgment was ultimately entered in favor of respondents, not petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">That argument rests on a false first <em>premise </em>\u2014 viz., that petitioners cannot recover their costs unless they were a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d That premise, however, is inapposite to an award of costs under ORS 183.497(1)(a), which, as noted, gives the court discretion to \u201callow a petitioner reasonable attorney fees <em>and costs if the court finds in favor of the petitioner.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Further, as described above, <em>see </em>222 Or App at 539-40, in <em>Kaib\u2019s, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly rejected a conflation of the statutory \u201cin favor of\u2019 formulation with \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. We have already concluded that the circuit court\u2019s opinion and order was a finding \u201cin favor of\u2019 petitioners. <em>See </em>222 Or App at 541. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in awarding costs to petitioners under ORS 183.497(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We turn to respondents\u2019 final argument, namely, that the court erred in exercising its discretion to award attorney fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a). As noted, the court awarded petitioners $87,000 in attorney fees, roughly one-third of the amount they had requested. Again, respondents do not dispute the reasonableness of the amount of fees awarded. In particular, they do not assert that the amount of the award is not reasonably related to the circuit court\u2019s stated rationale for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Where, as here, an award of statutory attorney fees is discretionary, the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion is governed by ORS 20.075. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c(1) A court shall consider the following factors in determining whether to award attorney fees in any case in which an award of attorney fees is authorized by statute and in which the court has discretion to decide whether to award attorney fees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201c(a) The conduct of the parties in the transactions or occurrences that gave rise to the litigation, including any conduct of a party that was reckless, willful, malicious, in bad faith or illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201c(b) The objective reasonableness of the claims and defenses asserted by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201c(c) The extent to which an award of an attorney fee in the case would deter others from asserting good faith claims or defenses in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201c(d) The extent to which an award of an attorney fee in the case would deter others from asserting meritless claims and defenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201c(e) The objective reasonableness of the parties and the diligence of the parties and their attorneys during the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201c(f) The objective reasonableness of the parties and the diligence of the parties in pursuing settlement of the dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201c(g) The amount that the court has awarded as a prevailing party fee under ORS 20.190.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201c(h) Such other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Applying those criteria, the circuit court determined that the factors detailed in paragraphs (a) to (g) were essentially in equipoise, offering \u201cnothing of assistance to or to the detriment of petitioners\u2019 attorney fee claim.\u201d That determination was due, in part, to the circuit court\u2019s finding that respondents had not acted unreasonably in denying petitioners\u2019 request to revoke or modify the permit, based on the information available at the time of that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">However, the court determined that, with the totality of the other factors in balance, considerations cognizable under paragraph (h) \u2014 \u201c[s]uch other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case\u201d\u2014 ultimately and decisively militated in favor of a partial award of fees. Although the court found that \u201cthe absence of any culpable or unreasonable conduct on the part of the respondents\u201d and \u201cthe substantial gap between petitioners\u2019 objectives and their accomplishment in this litigation\u201d weighed against a <em>full </em>award of fees, on balance, the court concluded that \u201cthe skill, extent, and complexity of petitioners\u2019 efforts in establishing the record prerequisite to the whistleblower relief they ultimately accomplished, and the potential value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of that relief to the health and safety of operations at the Umatilla facility to workers, the downwind community, and the environment\u201d entitled petitioners to partial recovery of their attorney fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The court explained its decision in some detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201cWhat remains is subparagraph (h), \u2018Such other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case.\u2019 There are such factors present in my judgment. It is apparent that petitioners\u2019 participation in this long-pending matter was of great value to the integrity of the process and helped to ensure that the agencies confronted issues, science, and arguments they would not have confronted without the persistent, extensive and competent efforts of the petitioners. I think it more likely than not that petitioners\u2019 efforts necessarily improved the care with which respondents performed their obligations to protect health, safety, and the environment, and that at least workers and the downwind community are considerably safer due to petitioners\u2019 efforts than they would otherwise be. Petitioners expended an enormous amount of competent energy without substantial compensation (and with substantial risk that they would remain uncompensated), and assembled information of great value to the process before the agencies and before this court. And, unlike a situation in which a party happens to accomplish some public benefit in pursuit of some other \u2018predominately personal\u2019 primary objective <em>(Van Gordon </em>[v. <em>Ore. State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>63 Or App 561, 570 n 8, 666 P2d 276 (1983)]), here it was the public benefit that was the primary objective and sole victory of the petitioners. I note that even if consideration of petitioners\u2019 efforts before the agency were otherwise of no proper moment in the exercise of my discretion, their efforts before the agency obviously had a substantial impact on the record more fully developed here, and ultimately created the evidentiary context in which the Army\u2019s behavior here made the need for whistleblower protections patent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201cFinally, while petitioners fell far short of achieving their primary objective of defeating incineration in favor of alternative technologies, the whistleblower protections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>achieved only as a result of their massive efforts are potentially of enormous value for the safe operation of the Umatilla facility. It is not a question of rewarding petitioners\u2019 limited success here for their unrelated altruistic efforts before the agency. In a real sense, their remedy may have been far less than they hoped, but it is a remedy provided in response to the same complex and extreme danger that petitioners (and all parties) have been addressing throughout their efforts. What happened for the first time in court was that their efforts combined with the Army\u2019s demonstration of the inadequacy of existing safeguards\u2014 even under the stringent criteria of <em>Norden </em>and the applicable standard of review \u2014 so that petitioners finally established their right to a remedy for that danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We review the circuit court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. ORS 20.075(3) (\u201cIn any appeal from the award or denial of an attorney fee subject to this section, the court reviewing the award may not modify the decision of the court in making or denying an award, or the decision of the court as to the amount of the award, except upon a finding of an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>see also Niman and Niman, </em>206 Or App 400, 415-16, 421, 136 P3d 1186 (2006) (abuse of discretion can arise from a court\u2019s erroneous understanding of the scope and content of discretionary factors). As we explain, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Respondents first argue that the court abused its discretion \u201cbecause the actions of [respondents] were objectively reasonable.\u201d Specifically, respondents point to our observation in <em>Van Gordon </em>that fees will not generally be awarded \u201cwhen an agency has interpreted an ambiguous statute in a facially reasonable but erroneous manner.\u201d 63 Or App at 568.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Respondents\u2019 invocation of that aspect of <em>Van Gordon </em>is inapposite because that discussion pertained solely to cases in which an agency order has been reversed or remanded <em>based on an erroneous interpretation of law. </em>Here, however, the court expressly remanded the agency order denying petitioners\u2019 request for permit modification or revocation <em>based on lack of substantial evidence.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> See </em>222 Or App at 536. Thus, it is a different portion of our opinion in <em>Van Gordon </em>that is pertinent and consistent with the circuit court\u2019s award of discretionary attorney fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">\u201c[W]hen an order is * * * reversed <em>and remanded </em>because there was no substantial evidence to support some, but not all, of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, there is more room for exercise of discretion. Generally speaking, if the lack of substantial evidence relates to a substantial portion of the agency\u2019s case, or to a large proportion of the facts found, so that on remand the agency will be required to reassess its order in some fundamental way, we shall be inclined to grant a petition for an attorney fee, unless the subject agency persuades us to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Johnson[, </em>56 Or App 454]. On the other hand, if the erroneous findings are minor or seem unlikely to affect the eventual outcome of the case on remand, we shall rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 award a fee. <em>See, e.g., Polen v. State Bd. Higher Education, </em>[18 Or App 442, 525 P2d 1047 (1974)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">63 Or App at 567-68 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Respondents also point, in passing, to <em>McKean-Coffman v. Employment Div., </em>314 Or 645, 842 P2d 380 (1992), as contradicting a fee award here. In <em>McKean-Coffman, </em>the Supreme Court declined to award fees to the petitioner under either prong of ORS 183.497(1). Several factors influenced the court\u2019s decision not to exercise its discretion to award fees under paragraph (a), including its determination that the agency\u2019s position was wrong, but not unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 649-50. In that regard, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cWe doubtless have wide discretion to award an attorney fee under ORS 183.497(1)(a), but we rarely will exercise it in favor of an award when an agency has acted reasonably. To do so could easily make administrative agencies timorous about pursuing reasonable positions as to what the law is or ought to be. The public interest would be ill-served in such circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>McKean-Coffman, </em>which antedated <em>Kaib\u2019s, </em>did not hold that \u201cunreasonable\u201d agency conduct is an absolute prerequisite for a discretionary award of fees. Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged that fees could be recovered, albeit \u201crarely,\u201d in cases in which an agency had acted reasonably. <em>Id. </em>Even more fundamentally, in <em>Kaib\u2019s, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly held that, while the objective reasonableness of an agency\u2019s action is determinative of a mandatory award of fees under <em>paragraph (b) </em>of ORS 183.497(1) \u2014 that is, a court is <em>required </em>to award fees if an agency acted \u201cwithout a reasonable basis in fact or in law\u201d\u2014 the obverse is not so with respect to a discretionary award of fees under <em>paragraph (a) </em>of the statute. 338 Or at 444.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In sum, while the objective reasonableness of an agency\u2019s actions is a consideration that militates \u2014 and, indeed can severely militate \u2014 against an award of discretionary attorney fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a), it does not necessarily preclude such an award. Rather, as the circuit court fully appreciated, the exercise of its discretion depended on the totality of the criteria prescribed by ORS 20.075(1). We thus reject respondents\u2019 argument that the asserted reasonableness of their conduct, specifically with respect to the inclusion of whistle-blower protections, precluded any award of discretionary fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The parties\u2019 dispute over the circuit court\u2019s exercise of discretion thus narrows to the court\u2019s application of the \u201c[s]uch other factors as the court may consider appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>under the circumstances of the case\u201d \u201ccatch-all\u201d criterion. ORS 20.075(1)(h). As noted, the circuit court\u2019s fee award ultimately depended on that factor \u2014 and, specifically, on the significant public benefits realized from petitioners\u2019 efforts in the case. <em>Cfi Deras, </em>272 Or at 65-66 (courts of equity have the inherent power to award attorney fees in cases where the benefits of litigation inure to the public).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We emphasize that the circuit court\u2019s fee award was a statutory award, under ORS 183.497(1)(a), and not an equitable award under <em>Deras.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nevertheless, the circuit court determined, and we <em>agree, </em>that, given the purpose and function of ORS 183.497, an assessment of the public interest vindicated and the public benefit conferred is an appropriate consideration in determining whether to award discretionary fees under ORS 184.497(1)(a). That is, the substance of the statute giving rise to the entitlement is properly considered in applying the paragraph (h) catch-all.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Respondents, while not disputing the abstract cognizability under ORS 20.075(1)(h) of a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d consideration where a petitioner seeks fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a), argue that that consideration is inapplicable in this case. Specifically, respondents contend that, where an agency has acted reasonably throughout the litigation, \u201cincluding in changing its position as the facts shifted,\u201d an award of fees predicated on a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d rationale would create a disincentive for agencies to take similar corrective actions in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We are unpersuaded. Even if we accepted respondents\u2019 benign characterization of their conduct with respect to the inclusion of whistle-blower protections in the permit, <em>but see </em>222 Or App at 539, we fail to see how the possibility of liability for attorney fees and costs based on vindication of the broader public good will discourage agencies from taking corrective action when and if it is warranted rather than waiting for an adverse judgment and appealing that judgment. Agencies would gain nothing by doing so \u2014 and indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>would only <em>increase </em>their potential financial exposure. Taking corrective action as soon as the need becomes apparent would, on the other hand, mitigate that exposure. In short, respondents\u2019 argument proves too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The circuit court did not err in its application of ORS 20.075(1)(h). Nor did the court abuse its discretion in determining, after assessing all relevant factors under ORS 20.075(1)(a) to (h), that petitioners were entitled to a partial award of attorney fees under ORS 183.497(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> The record is indefinite in many instances as to whether DEQ or EQC acted individually or collectively with respect to various challenged actions.
