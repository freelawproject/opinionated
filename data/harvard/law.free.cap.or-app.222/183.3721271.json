We review a trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the permissibility of jury argument for an abuse of discretion and reverse only if any error is found to be prejudicial. <em>Atlas Copco Industrial v. Karn Repair Service, </em>172 Or App 317, 323-25, 18 P3d 1102 (2001). We affirm because plaintiffs have not shown that any improper jury argument was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to defendant. <em>See Miller v. C. C. Meisel Co., Inc., </em>183 Or App 148, 150, 51 P3d 650 (2002) (explaining that this court states the facts \u201cin the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the jury returned a verdict\u201d). In April 2002, Alan Cler was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of cancer. After consultation with his physician, Cler chose to undergo a chemotherapy treatment that required the periodic intravenous injection of four different drugs. One of those drugs was Adriamycin, a vesciant that can cause severe tissue damage if it leaks out of a vein while being administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On June 3, 2002, Cler reported to Oregon Hematology for his first chemotherapy session. An oncology nurse and employee of Oregon Hematology was assigned to administer Cler\u2019s chemotherapy. An Adriamycin leak occurred during the chemotherapy session and caused severe damage to Cler\u2019s arm and hand. As a result, the Clers filed an action against Oregon Hematology for personal injury and nursing negligence, alleging that the nurse\u2019s treatment fell below the standard of care for an oncology nurse. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were tried to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>During her opening statement at trial, defense counsel told the jury that she would be calling an oncology nurse to testify as an expert witness. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201cYou are going to hear from a number of experts in this case. We\u2019re going to bring three medical experts to you: * * * an oncology nurse, nurse manager at OHSU; [and two] oncologists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Counsel went on to explain what she expected the substance of the nurse expert\u2019s testimony to be. Apparently, because of scheduling difficulties, the nurse expert was never called to testify. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was aware of the problems in scheduling that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Nonetheless, in closing argument to the jury, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel questioned the reason that the defense had failed to call the nurse expert. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cCan you imagine this institution, Oregon Hematology Oncology, and they have not called an independent nurse expert to justify the care in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201cI mean, can you imagine? Now, there\u2019s a reason. It is probably because they couldn\u2019t get a nurse expert who would say that this was okay care. That\u2019s the conclusion that\u2019s easy to draw on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">* \u2021 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">\u201cRemember, we\u2019re supposed to decide cases on the evidence and the evidence alone. So I submit to you that if they had a chance to bring together, bring more information to you, that they did not. If they are making assertions that they do not follow through on, that tells you something about who really is telling you what is going on in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Defense counsel then sought to respond to that argument regarding the nurse expert. The following colloquy occurred during defense counsel\u2019s jury argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, one thing I just want to mention before I forget, [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] said that we didn\u2019t even call an oncology nurse. And I hope you remember that when I started my case, and I gave my opening statement, I told you that I had [two oncologists] and [an oncology nurse] who is the nurse manager at OHSU and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>has 20 years\u2019 of experience in oncology. I hope you remember that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\u201c[PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I hope counsel is not going to go someplace where she\u2019s testifying as opposed to addressing the evidence that was before the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201c[THE COURT]: I\u2019m going to let her continue * * * in the same vein that you addressed the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I hope you\u2019ll remember that on Wednesday afternoon, there were two witnesses in the courtroom: [a doctor] who came back yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201c[PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, respectfully, this is improper. I object to this argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\u201c[THE COURT]: Your objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [The oncology nurse] and [the doctor] were sitting in the courtroom. They were there from 1:30 after we came back from lunch until almost the end of the day\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">\u201c[PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014waiting to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">\u201c[PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s no evidence before the court that [the oncology nurse] was sitting in the courtroom waiting to testify, and I object to this. This is outside the scope of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">\u201c[THE COURT]: Let me see counsel in chambers, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">\u201c(Off-the-record conversation)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">\u201c[THE COURT]: We\u2019re ready to start again. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-16\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-17\">\u201c[The oncology nurse] was here on Wednesday, prepared to testify in the afternoon. She sat in the courtroom all afternoon, and she didn\u2019t get on because [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] was calling Mr. Cler in the afternoon. She had to leave on the following day. She got on a plane. She was scheduled to go on vacation. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t hear from [the oncology nurse]. She was prepared to be here. She sat in the courtroom all that afternoon, and again, she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>prepared to testify and would have testified in our case and supported our case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Thereafter, in his rebuttal argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cYou heard me object to the thing about the nurse expert. I feel pretty strongly about this. Look, anybody that tries these cases knows that you better get your most important and your best witness on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cNow, you guys sat through the testimony and you knew that we accommodated [defense counsel] by taking two witnesses out of turn. She had every, every opportunity to get a nurse expert in to testify in this case. If she didn\u2019t want to call that nurse at some particular time, there\u2019s another procedure that\u2019s available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201cYou can take a witness outside the bounds of the courtroom and you can do a videotape deposition and set up a camera and bring it in. You saw \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you saw there\u2019s a television in the courtroom for a couple of days. So you can play perpetuated testimony on a TV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cShe had every opportunity under the rules that we do these cases to get this witness in here, and she did not. So I think that you still have to conclude there\u2019s a reason that she did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">At the close of trial, the jury returned a verdict for defendant. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for a new trial on the grounds, among other things, that defense counsel\u2019s closing argument was improper. Plaintiffs argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted defense counsel to make an argument to the jury based on facts not in evidence. The trial court denied that motion for a number of reasons, including the lack of substantial prejudice to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u201cEven assuming that plaintiffs had timely objected to all of the facts not in evidence during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, the Court\u2019s failure to sustain those objections did not substantially affect plaintiffs\u2019 rights. The \u2018facts\u2019 defense counsel mentioned were not probative of the substantive factual issues in the case, nor did they raise an issue with respect to the credibility of a witness. * * * Consequently, the facts asserted were collateral to the evidence on liability issues * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cFinally, the Court notes that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was able to effectively rebut defendant\u2019s reasons why it did not call an oncology nurse expert, by explaining ways in which defendant could have preserved the expert\u2019s testimony for trial and by suggesting that defense counsel made choices regarding the order in which she called her experts. Given the totality of the circumstances, the Court does not find that plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that they were substantially prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for new trial is denied on this ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Plaintiffs assign error to the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding defense counsel\u2019s closing argument and to its denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial. The denial of a motion for a new trial based on the trial court\u2019s earlier rulings is not reviewable on appeal. ORS 19.205(3); <em>see also Martin Engineering v. Opton, </em>277 Or 291, 295, 560 P2d 617 (1977) (\u201cThe denial of this motion for a new trial cannot be assigned as error on appeal. As a matter of substance, such a ruling is not an appealable order.\u201d). We confine our review, then, to the trial court\u2019s rulings on defense counsel\u2019s closing argument as explained in its denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs present much of the same argument that they made below: (1) that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing improper argument by defense counsel; and (2) that they were prejudiced because defendant\u2019s failure to rebut testimony by plaintiffs\u2019 expert nurses with its own expert nurse witness was telling in an otherwise close case. In response, defendant contends that the argument was not improper and that, even if it were improper, allowing that argument did not substantially affect plaintiffs\u2019 rights and was not prejudicial. We agree with plaintiffs that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the improper argument. As we held in <em>Rieker v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, </em>194 Or App 708, 712, 96 P3d 833 (2004), \u201c|j]ury argument properly may include reference to matters that are within the scope of the issues and evidence, but evidence outside the record may not be suggested to the jury by any means. OEC 103(3).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that any error in allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s statements to the jury did not substantially affect plaintiffs\u2019 rights and, therefore, was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Regulation of jury argument is left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>If a trial court abuses its discretion in allowing improper jury argument, that error \u201cis not reversible, however, unless the losing party demonstrates that the error substantially affected his or her rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also </em>ORS 19.415(2) (\u201cNo judgment shall be reversed * * * except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\u201d). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Shoup v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>335 Or 164, 173, 61 P3d 928 (2003),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201can error \u2018affecting\u2019 a party\u2019s rights is an error that can be said to <em>\u2018produce </em>a material influence\u2019 or \u2018to <em>have </em>a detrimental influence\u2019 on those rights, and not merely one that \u2018might\u2019 have changed the outcome of the case. The use of the adverb \u2018substantially\u2019 further limits the type of error that can result in reversal of a judgment. \u2018Substantially\u2019 means \u2018in a substantial manner,\u2019 and the relevant definition of \u2018substantial\u2019 is \u201cbeing of moment: IMPORTANT, ESSENTIAL.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(Emphasis and uppercase in original.) Based on the above, the court concluded that \u201creversal of a judgment is the exception, not the rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The presentation of extra-record evidence on difficulties in scheduling the testimony of a nurse witness favorable to defendant, however, did not substantially affect plaintiffs\u2019 jury trial right for three reasons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, the trial court provided instruction to the jury, before and during trial, that opening and closing statements are not evidence. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>emphasized to the jury that opening statements and closing arguments \u201care simply intended to help you understand the evidence and the application of the law to that evidence\u201d and \u201c[y]ou and you alone are to decide the facts. You must decide how believable the evidence is and what weight or value you will give to that evidence.\u201d Those instructions would have helped to cure any impropriety in closing argument by ensuring that the jury did not take defense counsel\u2019s statements as evidence in the case. The jury is presumed to have followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>DeLong v. Yu Enterprises, Inc., </em>334 Or 166, 174, 47 P3d 8 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Second, whatever the strength or weakness of plaintiffs\u2019 inference, it was not even a forkful of the entire evidentiary pie. Both sides presented expert testimony in a week-long trial. Some of the testimony by plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was favorable to defendant. There was testimony from both sides that a leakage could occur even when an oncology nurse takes every precaution. An unencumbered argument about the absent nurse expert would still have been speculation and likely would not have affected the outcome of the case. <em>See Shoup, </em>335 Or at 172 (stating that, although not the test for determining prejudice, an outcome-related inquiry is useful in analyzing when trial court error is reversible).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Finally, we note that the trial court assessed the prejudice from any improper comment as minimal. The trial court is in the best position to evaluate the effect of attorney argument on the jury and whether that argument is prejudicial. <em>Amick v. Watson, </em>280 Or 641, 645, 572 P2d 317 (1977). Here, the court found that the inference to be drawn from a witness not called was weak and was collateral to the dispute about defendant\u2019s culpability that was presented to the jury. Plaintiffs relied on <em>Bohle v. Matson Navigation Co., </em>243 Or 196, 412 P2d 367 (1966), to establish the propriety of the inference they wished the jury to draw. In <em>Bohle, </em>the court held that it was proper jury argument for a plaintiff to comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to call a physician who had examined the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s request. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cIn such circumstances we think that comment by counsel for the plaintiff on the failure of the defendant to call the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>physician is allowable, since it is a natural inference that he would have been called if his testimony would help the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 198. In different circumstances, the inference may be less natural. Defense counsel announced her intent to call the nurse expert, implying that the expert\u2019s testimony would have been favorable. The failure to call an announced defense witness may create a more tenuous inference about the potential content of the expert witness\u2019s testimony than the failure to call an unannounced witness. As the trial court figured, speculation about what that witness might have said was somewhat beside the point and collateral to the issues of fact created by the witnesses who <em>did </em>testify. The court then determined that extra-record facts undercutting plaintiffs\u2019 inference were not prejudicial, given that the inference was not particularly strong and was tangential to issues of fact about defendant\u2019s negligence. We agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">For those reasons, we conclude that plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating that the claimed error was prejudicial. <em>See Shoup, </em>335 Or at 173-74 (the burden to make a record that demonstrates prejudicial error is on the party that loses in the trial court and then seeks reversal or modification of the judgment on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> All references to \u201cCler\u201d in this opinion refer to Alan Cler.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> Defendant Providence Health System-Oregon is not a party to this appeal. All references to \u201cdefendant\u201d refer only to defendant Oregon Hematology Oncology Associates, PC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> Generally speaking, evidence outside the record may not be suggested to the jury by any means. OEC 103(3) provides that, \u201c[i]n jury cases, proceedings shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\"> To whatever extent plaintiffs claim a right to present jury argument on inferences to be drawn from an absent witness, that right was not substantially affected by defense counsel\u2019s reference to facts outside the record. Plaintiffs\u2019jury arguments were fully made and were not censored by the trial court. Plaintiffs rebutted defense counsel\u2019s closing argument by proffering ways in which the defense could have brought the nurse expert to testify despite any scheduling difficulties. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was also able to reiterate his initial argument that it was reasonable for the jury to infer that there was a reason defendant did not call the nurse expert to testify: a reason plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attributed to the substance of the expert\u2019s testimony. Plaintiffs\u2019 right, then, to present that particular argument to the jury was not substantially affected by the court\u2019s ruling on defense counsel\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
