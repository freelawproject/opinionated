J.</author>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Petitioner was convicted of various offenses committed in 1985 and 1987, and he was sentenced as a dangerous offender to a maximum of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. ORS 161.725; ORS 161.735. On January 11, 2005, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision conducted a parole consideration hearing under ORS 144.228, providing for such hearings for dangerous offenders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the hearing, the board issued an order in which it found that the condition that made petitioner dangerous was not in remission and that he remained a danger to the community. The board set a new parole consideration date of February 28, 2007. Petitioner sought administrative review of the board\u2019s order, and the board denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Petitioner now seeks judicial review of the board\u2019s order, arguing that the board erred in failing to make express findings as to whether he can be adequately controlled in the community with supervision and mental health treatment and as to whether the necessary supervision and treatment resources are available. He further argues that the board\u2019s failure to make those findings renders its order insufficient for judicial review and that the order violates his rights under Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>We begin with petitioner\u2019s contention that the board\u2019s order is insufficient in form because of its lack of certain findings. ORS 144.335(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\">\u201cThe order of the board need not be in any special form, and the order is sufficient for purposes of judicial review if it appears that the board acted within the scope of the board\u2019s authority. The Court of Appeals may affirm, reverse or remand the order on the same basis as provided in ORS 183.482(8).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>See also </em>ORS 183.315(1) (providing that ORS 183.470, which sets out requirements for the form of administrative agency final orders in contested cases, does not apply to orders of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Petitioner acknowledges that ORS 144.335(3) generally governs the form of the board\u2019s orders. He argues, however, that OAR 255-036-0005 \u2014 the board\u2019s rule relating to parole release of persons sentenced as dangerous offenders for crimes committed before November 1,1989 \u2014 required the board to make findings regarding its inability to find the facts on which parole release of such offenders is predicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He further argues that the board\u2019s failure to make such findings deprives this court of the ability to determine whether the board \u201cacted within the scope of [its] authority\u201d as provided in ORS 144.335(3). The board responds that it is apparent from the board\u2019s order both that the board applied the standards relevant to parole release of dangerous offenders that are set out in ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005 and that, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, it determined that petitioner did not meet those standards. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>board argues that, because the order demonstrates that the board acted within the scope of its authority, its form is sufficient for this court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">We agree with the board. Again, under ORS 144.335(3), the board\u2019s order was not required to be in any particular form, but was \u201csufficient for purposes of judicial review if it appears that the board acted within the scope of the board\u2019s authority.\u201d On its face, the board\u2019s order indicates that petitioner was sentenced as a dangerous offender, that the board held a parole consideration hearing, that the board received a psychological evaluation of petitioner, that the board found that the condition that made petitioner dangerous was not in remission, and that the board therefore was deferring his parole consideration date for 24 additional months. That was sufficient to show that the board was acting within the scope of its authority pertaining to parole consideration for dangerous offenders, as provided in ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005. The <em>form </em>of the board\u2019s order was sufficient for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We turn to petitioner\u2019s challenge, again relying on ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005, to the substance of the board\u2019s decision. We review the substance of the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law. ORS 144.335(3); ORS 183.482(8). Here, petitioner does not argue that the board\u2019s order was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Rather, he argues that, as a matter of law, once the board found that he remained dangerous, it was required, in order to defer his consideration for parole for an additional 24 months, expressly to find that he could not be adequately controlled with supervision and mental health treatment and that the necessary resources for such supervision and treatment were not available. The board responds that, consistently with the text of ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005, it is required to make certain findings as a predicate to establishing a release date. However, if the board determines that it is \u201cunable to make such findings,\u201d ORS 144.228(1)(b), nothing in the statute or rule requires it to make findings to that effect or otherwise relating to the offender\u2019s lack of satisfaction of the criteria for establishment of a parole release date. Rather, it need only conduct another review within the required time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Again, we agree with the board. By its terms, the relevant statute and rule require the board to make specified findings to justify its establishment of a parole release date for a dangerous offender. The statute and rule do not require any findings when the board decides <em>not </em>to establish a release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We interpreted ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005 to the same effect in <em>Colby v. Thompson, </em>183 Or App 311, 52 P3d 1058 (2002). In that case, a dangerous offender who had been denied a parole release date sought habeas corpus relief. On appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ, he argued that the board had violated ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005 \u2014 the same statute and rule at issue here \u2014 by failing affirmatively to find not only that he remained dangerous, but also that he could not be adequately controlled in the community with supervision and treatment. <em>Colby, </em>183 Or App at 318. We concluded that neither the statute nor the rule requires the board to make findings as to whether a dangerous offender can be adequately controlled in the community if the board decides not to establish a parole release date; rather, such findings are required only when the board decides to establish a parole release date. <em>Id. </em>at 320. Nothing about the different context in which we analyze ORS 144.228 and OAR 255-036-0005 in this case requires a different result. The board\u2019s order was not legally deficient by reason of failing to make affirmative findings as to whether petitioner could be adequately controlled in the community with supervision and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We reject petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenges to the board\u2019s order without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\"> ORS 144.228 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201c(l)(a) Within six months after commitment to the custody of the Department of Corrections of any person sentenced under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 as a dangerous offender, the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall set a date for a parole consideration hearing instead of an initial release date as otherwise required under ORS 144.120 and 144.125. The parole consideration hearing date shall be the time the prisoner would otherwise be eligible for parole under the board\u2019s rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">\u201c(b) At the parole consideration hearing, the prisoner shall be given a release date in accordance with the rules of the board if the board finds the prisoner no longer dangerous or finds that the prisoner remains dangerous but can be adequately controlled with supervision and mental health treatment and that the necessary resources for supervision and treatment are available to the prisoner. If the hoard is unable to make such findings, reviews will be conducted at least once every two years until the hoard is able to make such findings, at which time release on parole shall he ordered if the prisoner is otherwise eligible under the rules. In no event shall the prisoner be held beyond the maximum sentence less good time credits imposed by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> OAR 255-036-0005 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201c(2) A person sentenced as a dangerous offender for felonies committed prior to November 1,1989, is eligible for parole release:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\u201c(a) After having served the Board ordered prison term; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">\u201c(b) The Board finds the inmate no longer dangerous; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANk\">\u201c(c) The Board finds the inmate remains dangerous but can be adequately controlled with supervision and mental health treatment and that the necessary resources for supervision and treatment are available to the inmate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201c(3) If the Board is unable to make the findings required by section (2) of this rule, the Board shall schedule reviews once every two (2) years until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\u201c(a) The Board is able to make the required findings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">\u201c(b) The maximum court ordered sentence, less good time, expires.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
