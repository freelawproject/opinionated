Defendants appeal from a general judgment that awarded plaintiffs damages and attorney fees against Jimenez for breach of contract, that declared defendant Guerrero\u2019s recorded interest in the home void, and that dismissed Jimenez\u2019s counterclaim for assault. Plaintiffs cross-appeal the denial of specific performance and an award of equitable compensation on their contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On appeal, we reverse the judgment on the breach of contract claim, reverse the dismissal of Jimenez\u2019s counterclaim for assault, and affirm the declaratory judgment. In light of our disposition of the appeal, we dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Some procedural background is helpful in this case. Plaintiffs Alt and Soliz, who are married, filed an action that alleged two claims \u2014 breach of contract and declaratory judgment. Under the breach of contract claim, plaintiffs included two counts: Count 1 for specific performance of the land sale contract and, in the alternative, Count 2 for damages. The declaratory judgment claim sought a declaration that the conveyance to Guerrero of an interest in the property that plaintiffs sought to purchase was void as against plaintiffs. Jimenez counterclaimed for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on Count 1 of their breach of contract claim for specific performance and on their declaratory judgment claim. Defendants moved for summary judgment on both counts of plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim. After a hearing, the trial court issued a letter opinion in which it made \u201cfindings of fact\u201d and concluded that, as a matter of law, Jimenez had breached the contract \u201cwhen he failed to participate in the closing on [the contract\u2019s specified closing date].\u201d However, the court denied plaintiffs an award of specific performance for the breach, concluding that the appropriate remedy was an award of damages and attorney fees. The court further granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on their declaratory judgment claim and dismissed Jimenez\u2019s assault claim. The general judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>reflected the court\u2019s letter opinion, awarding damages to plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim, entering the declaration sought by plaintiffs on their declaratory judgment claim, and dismissing Jimenez\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Defendants\u2019 first and third assignments of error pertain, respectively, to the granting of summary judgment for plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim and to the denial of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on that claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 sole assignment of error on cross-appeal is that the trial court erred in denying them specific performance and an award of equitable compensation for Jimenez\u2019s breach of the land sale contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Plaintiffs argue on appeal that an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not appealable and, therefore, that defendants\u2019 third assignment of error is not reviewable. However, as in this case, when cross-motions for summary judgment are made on a claim and the parties have assigned error to the granting of the adverse parties\u2019 motion and the denial of their own motion, both of those rulings are subject to review. <em>Ellis v. Ferrellgas, L.P., </em>211 Or App 648, 652, 156 P3d 136 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate if, after reviewing the evidence in the record \u201cin a manner most favorable to the adverse party,\u201d the court concludes that \u201cno objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party.\u201d ORCP 47 C. We therefore review the record on each motion in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Ellis, </em>211 Or App at 653; <em>see also Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP, </em>336 Or 329, 332, 83 P3d 322 (2004). Because we will be considering both the granting and the denial of motions for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, for ease of organization we recite at this point all of the pertinent evidence, disputed and undisputed, favorable and unfavorable to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">On May 12, 2005, plaintiffs and Jimenez entered into an agreement entitled \u201cContract for Purchase of Residence or Other Real Estate,\u201d in which Jimenez agreed to sell his home to plaintiffs. Guerrero, not a party to the contract, was Jimenez\u2019s domestic partner and lived with him in the home. The written agreement provided that plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>would purchase the home for $155,900 and pay $1,000 into an escrow account as a deposit on the contract, and further provided that closing would take place on May 31,2005. Soliz arranged for the title company at which she worked to handle the escrow account and closing. On May 25, plaintiffs signed all of the documents for closing, having obtained the financing necessary to close the transaction. Because the title company wanted to ensure that the loan was funded and the deed was recorded by May 31, the title company scheduled Friday, May 27, as the date to close the transaction at the title office, notwithstanding that the contract specified May 31 as the closing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">On the evening of May 26, plaintiffs went to defendants\u2019 home. Defendants spoke only Spanish, and Alt did not speak Spanish, so Soliz spoke with defendants in Spanish and then interpreted the conversation for Alt. Soliz explained to Jimenez that she wanted him to \u201csign one paper tomorrow, because we are not going to close the deal\u201d on May 31. Jimenez, understanding the request as one to extend the May 31 closing deadline, initially refused, but then agreed to review the document with Guerrero. He told Soliz that she could bring the paper over to his house during lunchtime the next day. Soliz agreed and told Alt about the understanding that she had reached with Jimenez. Alt reacted angrily, insisting that Jimenez sign the paper the next morning and offering to bring the paper to Jimenez\u2019s workplace. When Jimenez refused to sign the paper anywhere but at his home at lunchtime, Alt said, \u201cI am going to sue you and make sure you lose your job.\u201d In his affidavit, Jimenez stated that Alt then \u201cadvanced toward me in a threatening manner and pushed me with his chest.\u201d Guerrero intervened between the two men, and both women told Alt to calm down. When Alt continued to advance toward Jimenez, Guerrero ordered both plaintiffs to leave the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">A representative for the title company, Jeanne Ayala, stated in an affidavit that the title company had \u201cmade arrangements for Mr. Jimenez on three (3) occasions to have one of our courtesy signers go to his location. * * * However, Mr. Jimenez failed or refused to sign the documents * * In his affidavit, Jimenez stated that no one came to the house the day after the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>On May 28, Jimenez received a letter from an attorney, dated May 27, 2005, indicating that she represented plaintiffs and stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cAlthough you signed the Contract, and agreed to be bound thereby, my clients are informed that you are now refusing to complete the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cWhile my clients could file an action seeking, among other things, an injunction from the court requiring you to specifically perform your agreement to sell your property, they are willing to agree to rescind the Contract provided that you execute any paper work required to refund their deposit money in the amount of $1,000.00 and reimburse them for the amounts they have spent to have the property inspected and appraised ($675.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cDemand is hereby made that you respond to this letter within ten (10) days, indicating whether you will agree to either perform the Contract or to arrange to refund the deposit and reimburse the costs described above. Please address your response to me at the above address. If you are represented by legal counsel in this matter, please direct any communications to this office through your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cIf you are unwilling to either perform the Contract or to refund the deposit and reimburse the costs described above, my clients intend to initiate legal proceedings against you seeking specific performance or damages and the recovery of attorney fees pursuant to ORS 20.082.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">\u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing, my clients reserve all rights under the Contract, at law and in equity. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">On May 31, Jimenez contacted an attorney for assistance with the matter, and Jimenez\u2019s attorney sent a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney on June 2, advising her that Jimenez was willing to refund plaintiffs\u2019 deposit but not to reimburse plaintiffs for the inspection and appraisal costs. On June 4, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney spoke to Jimenez\u2019s attorney, explaining that she had not yet spoken to plaintiffs, but that she felt both sides could settle the dispute because they \u201cwere only $675 apart.\u201d Jimenez\u2019s attorney stated in his affidavit that both attorneys agreed not to \u201ctake any action against the other without notice, as long as negotiations were pending.\u201d On June 7, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney left a phone message with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Jimenez\u2019s attorney reporting that she had forwarded his letter to plaintiffs and that she would be in touch. Neither Jimenez nor his attorney heard anything more from plaintiffs until plaintiffs filed this action on June 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In granting summary judgment for plaintiffs, the trial court concluded that Jimenez had breached the contract when he failed to participate in the closing on May 31. Jimenez argues that the court\u2019s decision was erroneous because it made findings of fact not supported by the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s findings of fact include, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs became concerned that the closing [might] be complicated by the Memorial Day weekend and sought to accelerate the closing date, but Defendant did not agree to sign the papers early. Defendant\u2019s testimony and the testimony of his domestic partner that they thought Plaintiffs wanted to delay the closing date is not credible. Had the Plaintiffs wanted to delay the closing, they would not have asked Defendant to sign the papers in advance of the scheduled closing date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Although we question whether some of those findings are supported by the record, the trial court\u2019s most significant error was in failing to review the evidence in the light most favorable to Jimenez. Jimenez stated in his affidavit that Soliz wanted him to sign a paper. Given that closing documents consist of more than one paper, and giving Jimenez all favorable inferences from the evidence, a factfinder could find that Jimenez did not understand that he was being asked to sign the closing documents early, and consequently, that he had not refused to sign the closing documents. It is also reasonable for a factfinder to infer from that evidence that the \u201cpaper\u201d that Soliz wanted him to sign was, in fact, a document to delay the closing date. The trial court simply believed plaintiffs\u2019 version of events over defendants\u2019 version. In <em>Taal v. Union Pacific R. Co., </em>106 Or App 488, 494, 809 P2d 104 (1991), we said that credibility questions \u201care not for the court to resolve in dealing with contradictory evidence in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>summary judgment setting.\u201d The trial court\u2019s sole responsibility was to determine whether, based on the evidence in the record, \u201cno objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict [in favor of]\u201d of Jimenez. ORCP 47 C. The trial court erred in its review of the evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Nevertheless, our review of the trial court\u2019s letter opinion leads us to believe that the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion had more to do with its treatment of plaintiffs\u2019 May 27 letter to Jimenez than with impermissible credibility determinations. With regard to the letter\u2019s effect, defendants argued to the trial court that the May 27 letter waived performance of the contract until after May 31, and once that date passed, the contract \u201cexpired by its own terms.\u201d In its letter opinion, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s ability to ignore the closing date was conditioned on his acceptance of the offer to rescind. While Defendant was given the opportunity to rescind the contract by the payment of $1,675 by June 6, the closing date was never changed. He ignored that date at his peril when he neither attended the closing on May 31, 2005 nor accepted the alternative offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">On appeal, defendants again argue, in a somewhat different manner, that the letter constituted a waiver of all of plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the contract. Plaintiffs counter that the letter\u2019s intent was to offer terms for rescission and to confirm to Jimenez that they intended to enforce their contractual rights against him if he did not agree to the terms set forth in their offer to rescind. Plaintiffs argue that in no way did their letter indicate an intentional relinquishment of their rights under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">None of those arguments is entirely correct. We agree with plaintiffs that the May 27 letter acted as an offer to rescind. <em>See Phillips v. </em>Gibson, 133 Or App 760, 764, 893 P2d 574 (1995). However, that letter also demanded that Jimenez respond to their new offer or <em>agree to perform under the contract </em>by a date that would occur <em>after </em>the May 31 closing date. We conclude that, based on the undisputed facts in the record, including plaintiffs\u2019 statement in their letter that Jimenez must respond by a date past the May 31 closing date, and including the actions that plaintiffs thereafter took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>through their attorney to negotiate a settlement, plaintiffs waived their right to have the contract performed by May 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Under contract law, \u201c[a] party to a contract may waive performance of any provision of the contract that is for its benefit.\u201d <em>South Lake Center v. Waker Assocs., </em>Inc., 129 Or App 581, 589, 879 P2d 1342 (1994). Even though a contract may require all modifications to the contract to be in writing, a waiver of a provision in the contract need not be in writing. <em>Bennett v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>332 Or 138, 156, 26 P3d 785 (2001); <em>Moore v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>317 Or 235, 241, 855 P2d 626 (1993). A waiver may be inferred from the partys conduct, provided that the conduct is clear, unequivocal, and decisive in manifesting an intention to waive a right to performance. <em>Cusick v. Meyer, </em>124 Or App 515, 522, 863 P2d 486 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 661 (1994). A waiver can also occur if the party acts \u201cso as to justifiably induce the other party to believe that the party will not assert or exercise the right [to performance] and to permit the first party to insist upon the right would prejudice the second party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The time of a partys performance may be waived by the parties. <em>Walker v. Feiring, </em>53 Or App 433, 437, 632 P2d 1270 (1981). In <em>Alk v. Lanini, </em>61 Or App 158, 161, 656 P2d 367 (1982), <em>rev den, </em>294 Or 613 (1983), we held that a time of the essence clause, which was included in an earnest money agreement for the benefit of both buyers and sellers, could \u2018Tie waived by either party with regard to the timing of the other partys performance\u201d (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In this case, the letter\u2019s demand was clear and unequivocal \u2014 Jimenez was given ten days to respond to plaintiffs\u2019 demand by either agreeing to perform the contract or agreeing to the proposed rescission terms. As written in the letter, the ten days would lapse on a date past May 31. According to plaintiffs, the fact that they told Jimenez that he could respond <em>after </em>May 31, by agreeing either to perform the contract or to accept the rescission terms, had no effect on Jimenez\u2019s obligation to close on the contract by May 31, because their letter also said that they were reserving all of their rights under the contract. We fail to see how a general reservation of rights prevails over a clear demand giving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>new date by which to agree to perform or to rescind the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The trial court focused on what occurred <em>before </em>plaintiffs\u2019 May 27 letter as evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions and expectations regarding the contract. However, the letter altered plaintiffs\u2019 and Jimenez\u2019s expectations under the contract. There is nothing that occurred after plaintiffs sent their letter that could have led Jimenez to believe that he should ignore the letter\u2019s demands and sign closing papers by May 31.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 conduct, through their attorneys negotiations and assurances that plaintiffs would consider Jimenez\u2019s offer to refund the earnest money and would get back to Jimenez, further confirmed to Jimenez that plaintiffs had waived the May 31 date of performance. We conclude, therefore, that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs\u2019 letter waived Jimenez\u2019s obligation to close the sale of the house by May 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"> That conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry. Contrary to defendants\u2019 arguments, waiver of the time of performance does not constitute waiver of an entire contract; it simply waives the time of performance. <em>Alderman v. Davidson, </em>326 Or 508, 513-14, 954 P2d 779 (1998). According to the evidence in the summary judgment record, plaintiffs had signed the closing documents and done everything required of them under the contract. Hence, they were not in breach of the contract, which continued to exist after May 31. Therefore, in order not to breach the contract, Jimenez would still need to perform his contractual obligations. The only question is when Jimenez was required to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In cases involving land sale contracts, Oregon courts have consistently held that, once a seller waives a time of the essence clause, a buyer, <em>inter alia, </em>must be afforded \u201ca reasonable time within which to perform [on the contract].\u201d <em>Peck v. Security Bank of Oregon, </em>276 Or 61, 67, 554 P2d 505 (1976); <em>see also Legg v. Allen, </em>72 Or App 351, 355, 696 P2d 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(1985); <em>Iversen v. Kiger, </em>48 Or App 873, 879, 617 P2d 1386 (1980). That principle also applies when a buyer is the party who waives the time of the essence clause. <em>See Contracts, </em>17A Am Jur 2d \u00a7 467 (2004) <em>(\u201cA </em>reasonable time to perform is implied where the agreed time for performance of a contract is waived.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Here, there is evidence that plaintiffs, by their demand letter, gave Jimenez at least ten days from the letter\u2019s date to agree to perform the contract. Were that the only evidence, a reasonable time to perform the contract might be within that time period. However, there is evidence that the parties engaged in discussions intended to resolve the disputes between them raised by the demand letter during the ten-day period and continuing thereafter, and that plaintiffs assured Jimenez that they would take no action against him until they had responded to Jimenez\u2019s alternative offer to refund the earnest money.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In light of that evidence, there are factual issues as to whether Jimenez breached the land sale contract by failing to close the sale within a reasonable time. It therefore follows that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim but did not err in denying defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on the claim. Because we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s decision to deny specific performance and an award of equitable compensation on the land sale contract is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Defendants\u2019 second assignment of error is that the trial court erred in declaring that Jimenez\u2019s conveyance to Guerrero of a one-half interest in the property, recorded on September 30, 2005, was void. In their original complaint filed on June 20, 2005, plaintiffs named Jimenez as the sole defendant. That same day, plaintiffs also filed a notice of pendency of an action regarding the property, pursuant to ORS 93.740. On September 30, 2005, Jimenez and Guerrero recorded a bargain and sale deed that conveyed a one-half interest in the property to Guerrero. Thereafter, and pursuant to a stipulated motion to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint listing two claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>breach of contract and declaratory judgment, and naming two defendants, Jimenez and Guerrero. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment claim, arguing that, under the provisions of ORS 93.740, the conveyance to Guerrero was void as to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">ORS 93.740 provides the method by which a party to a lawsuit that pertains to an interest in real property can record a notice of the pendency of an action to give notice to purchasers and encumbrancers of the pending lawsuit and the party\u2019s interest in the property. ORS 93.740(2) provides that a \u201cconveyance or encumbrance that is not recorded in the manner provided by law before the filing of a notice of pendency that affects all or part of the same real property is void as to the person recording the notice of pendency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Defendants do not dispute that the notice of a pending action on the property was filed on June 20 and that they recorded the deed conveying an interest in the property to Guerrero thereafter. However, they argue that the facts of this case fall within an exception in ORS 93.740(3) to the general rule established in ORS 93.740(2). ORS 93.740(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201cA conveyance or encumbrance is not void under subsection (2) of this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201c(a) The person who records a notice of pendency under this section has notice of the conveyance or encumbrance at the time the notice of pendency is recorded or otherwise does not act in good faith in recording the notice of pendency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201c(b) Pursuant to ORCP 33, the court allows a person claiming an interest in real property under the conveyance or encumbrance to intervene in the suit for the purpose of seeking adjudication of the person\u2019s interest or priority in the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Defendants argue that subsection (3)(b) applies to this case because the court, by allowing plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add Guerrero as a party, effectively made Guerrero an intervenor under ORCP 33 A. Although defendants appear to acknowledge that Guerrero did not fulfill the procedural requirements for intervention under ORCP 33, they argue that it would exalt form over substance to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Guerrero the benefit of ORS 93.740(3)(b) on the ground that she became a party by stipulation rather than intervention. Plaintiffs counter that the exception in ORS 93.740(3)(b) clearly states that it applies to a person intervening \u201c[p]ursuant to ORCP 33,\u201d and Guerrero did not intervene under that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">ORCP 33 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201cA Definition. Intervention takes place when a third person is permitted to become a party to an action between other persons, either by joining the plaintiff in claiming what is sought by the complaint, by uniting with the defendant in resisting the claims of the plaintiff, or by demanding something adversely to both the plaintiff and defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cB Intervention of right. At any time before trial, any person shall be permitted to intervene in an action when a statute of this state, these rules, or the common law, confers an unconditional right to intervene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u201cC Permissive intervention. At any time before trial, any person who has an interest in the matter in litigation may, by leave of court, intervene. In exercising its discretion, the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u201cD Procedure. A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene upon the parties as provided in Rule 9. The motion shall state the grounds therefor and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. If the court allows the intervention, parties shall, within 10 days, file \u2019 those responsive pleadings which are permitted or required by these rules for such pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">ORCP 33 applies to people who are not parties to an action who wish to become parties. Thus, under ORCP 33 D, the \u201cperson desiring to intervene\u201d must serve a motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The procedural history of this case indicates that it was plaintiffs, not Guerrero, who sought to make Guerrero a party to the action. The second amended complaint added one new claim against one new defendant \u2014 a claim for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>declaratory judgment declaring the conveyance to Guerrero to be void. ORS 28.110 requires that, \u201c[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d In other words, plaintiffs added Guerrero to the lawsuit because they brought a new claim for declaratory relief in the action and were required by ORS 28.110 to make Guerrero a party to the action. There is nothing in the procedural history of this case to indicate that Guerrero moved to intervene in the case, and there is no evidence that she acted within the procedural requirements of ORCP 33. Thus, contrary to defendants\u2019 arguments, there is nothing to suggest that the addition of Guerrero as a party in the action was accomplished pursuant to ORCP 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Defendants also argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment declaring the conveyance to be void, because the evidence shows that Guerrero actually held an interest in the property before plaintiffs and Jimenez entered into their land sale contract, and that the recorded conveyance simply confirmed the existence of that interest. The evidence on which defendants rely appears to be Guerrero\u2019s affidavit, in which she states that she \u201centered into a domestic partnership [with Jimenez] * * * to pool our resources for our mutual benefit and to own property jointly.\u201d In other words, defendants contend that an unwritten agreement between Jimenez and Guerrero to own property jointly is sufficient to create a legal interest in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Regardless of whether Guerrero had an interest in the property before plaintiffs and Jimenez entered the land sale contract for the property, the fact remains that the interest was not recorded until after plaintiffs filed their ORS 93.740 notice. The text of ORS 93.740 is clear in that regard: any conveyance <em>recorded after </em>that notice is void as to plaintiffs. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Defendants\u2019 fourth assignment of error concerns the award of attorney fees. The general judgment awarded attorney fees based on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>we reverse the judgment for plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim, we reverse the award of attorney fees as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Defendants\u2019 final assignment of error is that the court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing Jimenez\u2019s counterclaim for assault. Plaintiffs acknowledge that no motion for summary judgment was filed on the counterclaim. Nonetheless, plaintiffs argue that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal because there was no evidence to support the claim and therefore the trial court was correct to dismiss it. In its order dismissing the claim, the trial court offered no basis for its decision, other than finding that the parties \u201cexchanged words over an apparent disagreement * * * but [Guerrero] stepped in and [defused] the situation\u201d and that \u201c[n]o complaint to law enforcement was made.\u201d It appears, then, that the trial court dismissed the claim on the basis of its own determination that the summary judgment record did not contain facts sufficient to support Jimenez\u2019s counterclaim of assault. The court lacked authority to dismiss a claim on summary judgment for which no motion for summary judgment had been made. <em>Hendgen v. Forest Grove Community Hosital, </em>98 Or App 675, 677, 780 P2d 779 (1989). It therefore erred in dismissing the assault counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On appeal, judgment for plaintiffs on breach of contract claim reversed, award of attorney fees reversed, dismissal of defendant Jimenez\u2019s assault counterclaim reversed, otherwise affirmed; cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Defendants also argue that the affidavits on which plaintiffs relied for their summary judgment motion did not comply with ORCP 47 D. We conclude that the affidavits sufficiently complied with ORCP 47 D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> Although there is evidence in the summary judgment record that the title company attempted on three occasions to have a courtesy signer go to Jimenez to have him sign closing documents, the evidence does not indicate when those attempts were made. Consequently, the title company\u2019s actions do not alter the effect of plaintiffs\u2019 May 27 letter and subsequent conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
