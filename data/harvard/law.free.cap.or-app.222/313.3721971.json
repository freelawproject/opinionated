On appeal, he raises numerous challenges to his convictions and his sentences. We reject his challenges to his convictions without discussion. Regarding his sentences, defendant argues that the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences based on a judicial determination that more than one criminal episode was involved violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert granted, </em>_US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008). Defendant acknowledges that he did not preserve that contention but argues that the matter is nevertheless cognizable as plain error. The state asserts that any error is not apparent on the face of the record, given that the indictment alleged that the crimes were not committed as \u201cpart of the same criminal episode.\u201d In light of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Hagberg, </em>345 Or 161, 171, 190 P3d 1209 (2008), which rejected a similar argument, we conclude that the asserted error is apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> The question remains whether this court should exercise its discretion to correct the error. <em>See generally Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). For two reasons, we conclude that an exercise of our discretion is proper. The first is the gravity of the error: The consecutive sentence in the present case is 75 months. Second, the competing interests of the parties militate in favor of correction of the error. As the court recognized in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 513, 173 P3d 817 (2007), the state has \u201ca significant interest in avoiding a second, unnecessary sentencing hearing.\u201d There, the court remarked that \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d could have failed to find the fact used to enhance the sentence at issue in that case. <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, the child victim testified that she could not specifically remember how many times the abuse had occurred. Although she did testify that abuse had occurred \u201cmore than one time,\u201d she identified only one location, and only one time frame, for the abuse. On this record, we cannot say that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>reasonable factfinder could have failed to find multiple criminal episodes. <em>See, e.g., State v. Banks, </em>218 Or App 593, 598, 180 P3d 726 (2008) (in similar circumstances, remanding for resentencing where evidence in support of consecutive sentencing was not clear). Hence, in this case, defendant\u2019s interest in resentencing predominates.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
