The trial court decided this question in the negative, and in accordance with this answer gave judgment for plaintiff, although plaintiff had filed no such claim. The answer given by the trial court to the question was incorrect and the judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\"><em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Jurian, </em>35 Cal.
