The court permitted, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, testimony as to oral negotiations relative to the transaction prior to the date of the letters which contained the terms of the contract, limiting its admission, however, to the purpose of enabling the court to determine whether or not the contract was contained in the letters. The defendants made no objection to the court\u2019s ruling at that time, but urge for the first time upon appeal that the-testimony should have been admitted generally. Inasmuch as the evidence showed that the letters dated October 12 and October 16, 1912, constituted the contract between the parties, it was not error, we think, to admit the testimony as to oral negotiations prior to the written contract for the limited purpose of showing the circumstances and situation of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 1856, 1860.) But however this may be, since the defendants raised no objection to the limited purpose for which the testimony in question was admitted, they cannot now be heard to complain. <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Hugg, </em>5 Cal. 409; <em>Mott </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Cal. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The only other point attempted to be made by appellant is that plaintiff\u2019s case has not been made out by a preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of the evidence. Were this true, it would not be a sufficient reason for disturbance of the judgment. If the judgment is supported by any substantial evidence\u2014and in the instant case there is abundant evidence\u2014the judgment must he upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on August 8, 1918.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
