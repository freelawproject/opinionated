The evidence discloses that the assault was committed on the wife of the accused at their home in the town of Hood, in Sacramento County, in the month of July, 1917, the motive for the crime being that the wife\u2014the victim of the assault\u2014 had threatened and was about to leave the defendant because of his alleged ill treatment of her and refused to heed his repeated demands that she remain with him. The evidence clearly shows the guilt of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">We have found no errors in the rulings admitting and excluding evidence, while the charge of the court is in clear language, pertinent to the issues and otherwise unobjectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
