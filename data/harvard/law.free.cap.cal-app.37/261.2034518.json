The trial court gave judgment against Trapani for $520.05, and from this judgment he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">The appeal presents nothing but the disputed question of fact whether the collision was due to the negligence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s driver or the defendant Trapani. The evidence, as is usual in such cases, is conflicting and contradictory. The trial court accepted the statements of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. We have examined the record with care and find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Complaint is made that the damages awarded were too large, but on this subject also the testimony was conflicting, and it was a question for the trial court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"AhS\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on June 15,1918.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
