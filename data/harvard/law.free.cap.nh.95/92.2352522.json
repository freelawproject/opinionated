The defendant\u2019s exceptions present the sole issue of whether there was evidence to warrant a finding of causal negligence on the part of the defendant. In our opinion there was such evidence. The accident occurred at about eight thirty or nine o\u2019clock in the evening, when the parties were returning to Derry from Nashua, in the defendant\u2019s automobile. The plaintiff was seated on the rear seat, directly behind the defendant, with two minor children to her right. Her husband was seated to the right of her father, on the forward seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">At a point some seven or eight miles from Nashua, as the automobile rounded a curve to the right, the defendant was taken with a coughing spell which the plaintiff described as \u201cnot severe, just a natural cough.\u201d The defendant testified that it was \u201cnot just a little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>cough.\u201d The automobile was then on the right hand side of the road, moving in a normal fashion at a speed of between thirty-five and forty miles an hour. There were no other vehicles immediately ahead or behind. \u201cAs soon as\u201d the defendant \u201chad this . . . coughing spell,\u201d the automobile suddenly traveled toward the left of the highway, and as it reached some stones at the side of the road, the plaintiff \u201chollered\u201d at the defendant to ask him where he was going, but received no response. There was then nothing unusual about his appearance; \u201che was sitting up,\u201d and his head did not drop down. The plaintiff turned to protect her small daughter, as the automobile continued on its course into a gully seven or eight feet from the paved way, coming to a stop against a tree about twelve feet off the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The tree was approximately five hundred feet beyond the curve. The plaintiff estimated that the automobile traveled a hundred feet along the pavement after she noticed that it was veering to the left, and another hundred feet after it left the paved way until it struck the tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Before the accident, the defendant had been in good health, and had never had such coughing spells while driving. He had not been drinking, and was not sleepy. He was engaged in conversation with the plaintiff shortly before he coughed. He first explained the accident by saying that he coughed \u201cand when I cough, I don\u2019t know what happened after that . . . Must have lose control or something happened, I don\u2019t know.\u201d His counsel then injected the first suggestion of possible unconsciousness in the question, \u201cWhat was the next thing you knew when you did come to or regained consciousness?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cAll I know I was on the tree, I could see the lights there shining on the tree.\u201d From his further testimony it appeared that he started to cough \u201cright in the bend\u201d of the curve, that he then \u201ckept the wheel straight,\u201d that he heard his daughter \u201choller,\u201d and that although the coughing spell \u201clast long enough I went off the road,\u201d he \u201cheld [the] car and [the] wheel.\u201d He also testified that after hearing his daughter call, he remembered nothing further. \u201cDon\u2019t know if I fainted or what it is. I don\u2019t remember nothing after that.\u201d To the query, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t become unconscious did you when you coughed?\u201d he replied, \u201cWell, I do afterwards . . . After I through coughing sometimes I come right to right away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Upon the evidence, the accident was due to one of two things: the defendant\u2019s carelessness, or his momentary loss of consciousness. Neither cause was conclusively established. The fact that the defendant showed no signs of unconsciousness at any time before the auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>mobile left the highway, and that he recalled having heard his daughter\u2019s exclamation when it did so, tended to establish consciousness up to' that time, at least. His failure to reply to his daughter might reasonably be attributed either to an inability to speak because of the coughing spell, or to his sudden absorption in management of the automobile following the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">At no time did the defendant testify positively that he fainted or became unconscious before the automobile left the road, and whether he did so at all was a matter of uncertainty. His testimony that he recalled the -lights on the tree tended to show retention of his faculties to the time of collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">If the defendant was found to have been in possession of his faculties, a finding of negligence was warranted, without resort to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>There was direct evidence from which it could be found that he failed to act when prudence reasonably called for action. \u201cThese facts make superfluous any discussion of the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>From all the evidence, the jury could properly infer that the driver was negligent \u2018either in failing to observe or in failing to stop or in driving too fast.\u2019 . . . The plaintiffs assumed no greater burden than that of making it a little more probable than otherwise that the collision was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. They were not bound to disprove the existence of all other possible causes.\u201d <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Company, </em>88 N. H. 273, 275. The evidence did not require a belief that the defendant\u2019s coughing so far incapacitated him as to prevent him from slowing down or stopping until he was able to proceed in a normal way. It warranted a finding that when it occurred, he failed or was unable to keep a suitable lookout, and that reasonable care under the circumstances required that he reduce his speed or take some suitable precaution to keep the vehicle on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The case is distinguishable from authorities such as <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Petty, </em>65 Fed. (2d) 820, and <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>250 Mich. 180, cited by the defendant, where the evidence of the operator\u2019s sudden unconsciousness was uncontradicted or undisputed. The evidence in this case warranted the inference, without resort to presumption (cf. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>19 Tenn. App. 615), that the defendant was conscious during the time when saving action should have been taken. If his ambiguous testimony warranted the opposite conclusion, it did not compel it. The issue was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the automobile traveled two hundred feet after it started to the left of the road cannot be held to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>consideration of the curve as a factor in the accident. There was evidence that the curve was five hundred feet from the pole with which the car collided. The defendant conceded that his coughing commenced \u201cin the bend,\u201d and there is nothing to indicate that the vehicle did not thereafter travel three hundred feet before the plaintiff realized that it was leaving the road. Moreover, the circumstances under which her observations of distances were made were not sufficiently favorable to obviate the possibility of mistake. See <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>93 N. H. 250; <em>Keck </em>v. <em>Hinkley, </em>90 N. H. 181, 185. The issue of the defendant\u2019s fault was for the jury to determine upon all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
