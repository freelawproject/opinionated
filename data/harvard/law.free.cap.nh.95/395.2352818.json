H. 107; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>49 N. H. 265. Whether they were discharged by the giving of the note and mortgage of January 5, 1948 depends upon the intention of the parties to that transaction. See <em>Laconia Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Vittum, </em>71 N. H. 465. The agreed statement throws no light upon this question, except as it may be inferred from the fact that no discharges were given, that none were intended. 2 Jones on Mortgages (8th <em>ed.) s. </em>1187; and see 36 Am. Jur. 921, s. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">There being no evidence that the later note and mortgage were given or accepted in satisfaction of the prior notes and mortgages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Marcy, supra, </em>268), or that anything more was intended than additional or collateral security for a continuing indebtedness <em>(Cutting </em>v. <em>Whittemore, supra; Ladd </em>v. <em>Wiggin, 35 </em>N.
