The state airways system consists of all air navigation facilities \u201c . . . available for public use . . . whether publicly or privately owned\u201d for which the \u201c . . . expenditure of state funds . . . serves a useful public purpose.\u201d R. L., c. 306, <em>s. </em>12 as amended by Laws 1947, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>281, s. 3. Such legislation was considered valid in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N. H. 513, 515. The public aspects of licensed private airports which \u201chave facilities available for public use and are necessary . . . for the maintenance of an effective aii-way system in the state\u201d are equally evident in Laws 1949, c. 53. Such an airport \u201cshall be deemed to be a publicly-owned airport for the purposes of airport zoning ...\u201d Laws 1949, c. 53, s. 2. The history of aviation in the last quarter of a century here and elsewhere indicates that it is considered as being a public use serving a public purpose. R. L., <em>c. </em>306, ss. 13, 14; <em>Hesse </em>v. <em>Rath, </em>249 N. Y. 436, 438; <em>C. &amp; S Air Lines </em>v. <em>Waterman Corp., </em>333 U. S. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">If the proposed bill is a general exemption from property taxes as stated in the title, there is no question as to its validity. \u201cThere is no doubt that the legislature may provide, by general laws, for the exemption of certain classes of property from taxation, as well as exempt it, in fact, by omitting it in the description of property required to be taxed.\u201d <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Hough, </em>10 N. H. 138, 142. This principle of classification of property to be taxed made exactly one hundred years ago has never \u201cbeen questioned.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>76 N. H. 609, 611. \u201cInequality of taxes laid is forbidden, but inequality caused by taxing some property and not taxing other is permitted.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N. H. 561, 574. In the selective process of classifying certain property for taxation and exempting other property the Legislature has a wide discretion which will be sustained \u201cprovided just reasons exist for the selection made.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N. H. 506, 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">If the proposed bill in fact is a special exemption, it is unlike the one in <em>Eyers Woolen Co. </em>v. <em>Gilsum, </em>84 N. H. 1, which applied to one party in one town resulting only in indirect public benefit. Considering the bill to be one creating a special exemption in a limited sense, it is valid because it advances a public purpose within the admitted scope of the police power. Other exemptions no more public have been sustained. R. L., c. 73, s. 15; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>87 N. H. 490; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>88 N. H. 500, 510, 511; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N. H. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In the present case the benefit to the public is not only considered by the Legislature to be direct but the private airport owner is required in effect to dedicate his property to public use as a condition to receiving the tax exemption whether it is general or special. These factors further distinguish the invalid tax exemption considered in <em>Eyers Woolen Co. </em>v. <em>Gilsum, </em>84 N. H. 1, 27.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad2O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Frank W. Peyser </em>for New Hampshire Aviation Trades Association, Inc., <em>amicus curiae </em>(by brief), for the bill.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The proposed exemption is not proscribed by the provisions of Article 5 of the Constitution which were added by the amendment of 1877. The limitation thereby imposed is upon legislative power to authorize gifts by towns to corporations organized for profit. It does not extend to the authority of the Legislature by its own act to provide a uniform exemption of state-wide application such as is proposed by this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The greater extent to which the Legislature allows tax exemptions must necessarily result in a greater burden on those who do pay taxes. While such inequality presents no constitutional question if \u201cit reasonably promotes a matter of the general welfare\u201d <em>(Rosenblum </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>89 N. H. 314, 321), it does involve a delicate problem for the Legislature in its efforts to obtain needed revenues upon a broad tax base that operates fairly on most of the public. That the problem has been considered, if not solved, appears from Laws 1947, c. 328 and Laws 1947, c. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">While we do not pass on the wisdom or advisability of the proposed bill, it may be helpful to note that the bill as drafted is unnecessarily ambiguous. It may not be clear to either the taxpayer or the tax collector whether (1) the exemption is limited to the \u201clanding area\u201d with or without buildings thereon and (2) whether such area is available for public use upon payment of fees or is to be \u201cfree\u201d as provided in Maine Laws 1947, c. 241. Such confusion is \u201cnot helpful either to property owners or taxing officials\u201d <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Coulombe, </em>95 N. H. 266, 269) and should be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Your inquiry concerning House Bill 164 is answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-8\">Oliver W.
