J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABP\">Section 23 of the Revised Laws, chapter 216, under which the plaintiff was awarded compensation, entitled \u201cPermanent Partial Disability\u201d provides a schedule of specific payments for the loss of various parts of the body. Section 27 of the same statute, entitled \u201cLimit of Compensation\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">\u201c27. Limit of Compensation. In no event shall any compensation paid under this subdivision exceed the damage suffered, nor shall any weekly payment in any event, exceed eighteen dollars, or extend over more than three hundred weeks from the date of the accident. Such payment shall continue for such period of three hundred weeks, if total or partial disability continues during such period. No such payment shall be due or payable for any time prior to the giving of the notice required by section 16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">It is argued by the plaintiff that she should have been granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>compensation in accordance with the provisions of section <em>27, </em>rather than section 23. Clearly she was entitled to have her compensation determined under the section of the statute which would be most beneficial to her. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>93 N. H. 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff is 75% disabled but only 25% of her disability is due to the accident, cannot be sustained. Here reference was obviously made to the medical testimony that the plaintiff was suffering from hypertension and arteriosclerosis, and that \u201cthe percentage of disability that is caused by these diseases, outside of the hand . . . amounted to 75%.\u201d The doctor further testified as follows, however: \u201cBut if she didn\u2019t have the accident and she had all these other things you say are 75%, still she would be able to work in the mill and get her $30 a week, is that right? A. Yes.\u201d Further he testified: \u201cWould you say that, without this accident, regardless of her condition of high blood pressure, she would be able to work? A. Yes. Q. And would probably be working? A. Probably.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">It appears to be the law everywhere that where accidental personal injury, under a workmen\u2019s compensation act, aggravates a pre-existing physical condition, the injured employee is nevertheless entitled to compensation. Am. Dig. System, Title: Workmen\u2019s Compensation, s. 552; <em>Valle\u00e9 </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N. H. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The accident happened upon May 31, 1946. The hearing took place March 24, 1947, the Court\u2019s decree being dated April 15, 1947, eleven months after the accident took place. The plaintiff was alive and testified at the time of the hearing. It is, therefore, obvious that at that time she was entitled to some compensation under section 27 of the statute, which if awarded in the maximum amount allowable for total disability would exceed the award under section 23. It is therefore evident that the ruling of the' court that \u201cdue to the state of the evidence on the question of the plaintiff\u2019s expectancy of life, the Court rules that compensation must be awarded plaintiff in accordance with the provisions of R. L., c. 216, <em>s. </em>23, \u201d was erroneous and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">For the reasons indicated above, there must be a</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
