It assigns among other grounds for the appeal, the \u201cfailure of Commission to make findings as to the fair value of the Company\u2019s property devoted to intrastate telephone service ... or as to the intrastate base . . . ,\u201d and the \u201cfailure of Commission to make findings as to the rate of return the Company is entitled to earn on a reasonable rate base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The Commission\u2019s investigation of the rates of the appellant company was instituted \u201cto enable the commission to pass upon the reasonableness of the rates and charges\u201d of the company. R. L., c. 287, s. 37. Its statutory duty, both on petition by the utility for the determination of rates, and after hearing upon its own motion, is to determine and establish the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d to be thereafter observed by the utility. R. L., c. 287, s. 5; c. 292, s. 7. Under established practice, rates have customarily been fixed by determining a proper rate base upon which the utility should be entitled to a return,- a rate of return which it should reasonably be entitled to earn thereon, and the amount of revenue required to produce the resulting return, and hence to be translated into rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hampton Water Works Company, </em>91 N. H. 278, this court last had occasion to review commission findings as to the fair value of a utility, and there undertook to lay down principles complying with requirements of the Federal Constitution, as established by a long line of decisions of the United States Supreme Court beginning with <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>169 U. S. 466. No occasion is presented to trace from that decision the rise and fall of the doctrine of \u201cfair value.\u201d It has been sufficiently reviewed by recent decisions and articles. See <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, </em>107 Utah 155; Scope of Judicial Review of Rate Regulation, 39 Ill. L. Rev. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>With the decision of <em>Federal Power Commission </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., </em>320 U. S. 591, and cases since decided by the same court, concepts of the constitutional requirements which produced the \u201cfair value\u201d formula have been abandoned, and the principles which furnished a foundation for much which was said in the <em>Hampton </em>case have been discarded. No longer are the provisions of the Constitution considered to require determination of fair value, or consideration of reproduction cost, or disregard of \u201cprudent investment.\u201d The court said in the <em>Hope </em>case: \u201cWe held in <em>Federal Power Commission </em>v. <em>Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>[315 U. S. 575] that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates. . . . And when the Commission\u2019s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order \u2018viewed in its entirety\u2019 meets the requirement of the Act. <em>Id., </em>586. Under the statutory standard of \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 it is the result reached, not the method employed which is controlling.\u201d <em>Federal Power Commission </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., supra, </em>602.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In support of the order of the Commission in this case, the State points to the <em>Hope </em>case as authority for the proposition that the Commission is \u201cfreed . . . from all formulae,\u201d and asserts that the Commission\u2019s findings are adequate to permit determination by this court that \u201cthe total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Federal Power Commission </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., supra, </em>602. With this contention we cannot agree. So far as the issues before us are controlled by Federal law, it is plain that restrictions formerly imposed by the \u201cfair value\u201d doctrine have been swept away. But if the Commission may be said to be no longer \u201cbound to the use of any single formula,\u201d we do not understand that it is thereby relieved from the duty to disclose the \u201cmethod employed\u201d to reach the prescribed rates, so that the validity of its conclusions may be tested upon judicial review. It may be noted that in the <em>Hope </em>case, as in subsequent decisions called to our attention, the findings of the regulatory body whose orders were sustained disclosed a rational process by which a rate base and a rate of return were determined and applied, to produce the return translated into rates <em>(Colorado Interstate Co. </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019n, </em>324 U. S. 581; <em>Panhandle Co. </em>v. <em>Power Comm\u2019n, </em>324 U. S. 635, 648), or in default thereof, the case was remanded for further findings. <em>Colorado-Wyoming Co. </em>v. <em>Power Comm\u2019n, </em>324 U. S. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In determining the validity of the order before us, primary consideration must be given to the requirements of our own statutes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We do not consider that the statutory requirement that rates shall be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d was an enactment into law of the fair value doctrine of <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Ames. </em>As the court said in <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, supra, </em>190, 191: \u201cIt must be assumed that the legislature contemplated that the concept of that which is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 might change with social trends. . . . The term ... is not an absolute. The legislature need not amend the statute to permit the Commission to apply the present judicial interpretation of what is \u2018just and reasonable.\u2019 \u201d The Commission in that case prescribed rates determined upon a prudent investment base. In <em>Commonwealth Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, </em>252 Wis. 481, however, the Commission, in mistaken reliance upon the <em>Hope </em>case, undertook to fix rates without determining a base. Holding this to be arbitrary and unlawful, the court directed that specific findings be made of essential facts which would determine a rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Some indication of the maimer in which the Legislature intended rates to be fixed is found in the portion of the provisions of statute relating to temporary rates here quoted: \u201cSuch temporary rates shall be sufficient to yield not less than a reasonable return on the cost of the property of the utility used and useful in the public service less accrued depreciation' ...\u201d R. L., c. 292, s. 28. We do not say that the method so described necessarily extends to the fixing of permanent rates; but at least it serves to illustrate the legislative view that rates should be determined with reference to the investment upon which they are to provide a return. In this case, a definite finding by the Commission of the base upon which the company is entitled to a return is required by New Hampshire law:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The report of the Commission contains findings both as to net investment and a rate of return thereon which \u201cwould be considered reasonable ... if [the Commission] were to be concerned solely with the viewpoint of the Company\u201d and that of its investors. It suggests that total expenditures indicate \u201cmore than a mere possibility of wastefulness in construction and reconstruction,\u201d and fixes a smaller return, apparently prompted in part by consideration that the company\u2019s \u201creasonable needs for expansion and the acquisition of new capital\u201d are less than the company contends. The rates so fixed without disclosure of base or rate of return, the Commission finds will \u201cwith proper economies in management,\u201d be just and reasonable both to the company and the public. By what method, by the disallowance of what expense or items of investment, or according to what standard the return found otherwise reasonable is reduced, is not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>closed. To quote the company\u2019s brief, \u201cwhat return on what is never stated.\u201d The kind of vague suspicion of wastefulness suggested by the report will not do as a justification for denying the company the relief sought, although apparently regarded as sufficient by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In our opinion, the relief furnished by the <em>Hope </em>case from the constitutional restrictions of a formula, do not operate to relieve the Commission of the duty to make findings of facts essential to permit review of its conclusions. This is fairly apparent from the statements of the court in <em>Cobrado-Wyoming Co. </em>v. <em>Power Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>634, decided since the <em>Hope </em>case: \u201cThe review which Congress has provided for these rate orders is limited. Sec. 19 (b) says that the \u2018finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u2019 But we must first know what the \u2018finding\u2019 is before we can give it that conclusive weight. We have repeatedly emphasized the need for clarity and completeness in the basic or essential findings on which administrative orders rest.\u201d See also, <em>Commonwealth Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, supra; Mississippi River Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>163 F. (2d) 433; <em>Monroe Gaslight &amp; Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>292 Fed. 139. By a parity of reasoning, before this court can deem \u201cfindings of the commission upon all questions of fact properly before it ... to be <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable\u201d (R. L., c. 414, s. 13), the findings must be disclosed. Nor can the validity of Commission orders be determined, unless the findings upon which they rest can be measured against the evidence from which they are made. \u201cThe discretion and judgment confided in the Commission must be exercised upon facts and reason. The duty of review imposed upon the courts requires that facts be found and the reasons stated. Otherwise, the courts cannot determine whether a given action is or is not arbitrary.\u201d <em>Mississippi River Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>F. P. C., supra, </em>439. We see no reason for departure from the principles established by our cases, that the commission is under a duty \u201cto find all facts . . . essential to the presentation of all questions of law raised by . . . [their] order.\u201d <em>Grafton &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>77 N. H. 490, 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">It is argued on behalf of the State that the Commission has \u201cendeavored in this case to make a complete disclosure of the factual background upon which its decision rested,\u201d and that having found unduly burdensome to consumers a return derived from specified components and described as reasonable from the standpoint of the company, the Commission has properly fixed a lesser return. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>recognize that \u201cthe public cannot properly be subjected to unreasonable rates in order simply that stockholders may earn dividends\u201d <em>(Covington &amp;c. Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Sandford, </em>164 U. S. 578, 596), and that \u201cregulation does not insure that the business shall produce net revenues.\u201d <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., supra, </em>603. We think it equally plain that rates may not be held unreasonable without reference to evidence from which their unreasonableness is considered to appear. If, as the report of the Commission implies, construction undertaken by the company is \u201cwasteful,\u201d or its expense is unwarranted by the demand probable at the necessary price for service produced by it, or if \u201cproper economies in management are lacking\u201d so that operating expenditures are shown to be excessive or overestimated, unwarranted investments may be excluded from rate base, and unjustified expenditures from the determination of a reasonable return. Such exclusions call for findings, the accuracy of which may be reviewed. The primary responsibility for the making of such findings rests with the Commission. Because of its specialized assistance, and its consistent experience in regulation, its findings are accorded a legislative presumption of reasonableness. R. L., c. 414, s. 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">It is not for the court to search voluminous records for evidence which might be thought to support findings which are undisclosed. \u201cPrimarily it has the duty of determining the validity upon the evidence of the commission\u2019s findings of the evidentiary facts upon which the justice and reasonableness of the order appealed from may depend.\u201d <em>Parker-Young Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>83 N. H. 551, 559. Since essential findings have not been made, we are unable to determine whether the order is or is not \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d Accordingly the case must be remanded for such findings. <em>Parker-Young Co. </em>v. <em>State, supra; Grafton &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>498.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The record appears to afford no basis for determination of a proper return by any process other than the usual rate base method. The Commission undertook to find the company\u2019s net book cost investment as of December 31, 1947. There is no dispute that in doing so, it inadvertently made use of a net average figure for the year. With the error corrected, the finding intended by the Commission should have been $15,627,882. To what extent if any the error affected the final rate determination made by the Commission cannot be determined from this record. While the Commission is free to use average investment figures, they are to be distinguished from year-end figures. The result reached by the Commission indicates little reliance upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201ccurrent cost\u201d figures. Since they were entitled only to such weight as the Commission saw fit to give them, no error of law can be predicated upon their rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">There appears to be no reason why the Commission in formulating its findings upon remand, should depart from the procedure originally contemplated, that of determining a rate base for 1947, and bringing it forward through 1948. Since actual figures for 1948 may now be substituted for estimates, this can be done with greater certainty than has heretofore been possible. In so far as disputed issues arising out of the determination of net investment are likely to recur upon remand, they are considered elsewhere in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The question of fixing a rate of return to be applied to the rate base is peculiarly within the discretion of the Commission. Whether it should rely upon the expert testimony presented by the State in preference to that offered by the company cannot be decided as a matter of law. The proper rate of return is a matter for the judgment of the Commission, based upon the evidence before it. In fixing the rate the cost of capital may not be ignored; but what that cost may be is also a matter for determination by the Commission upon the evidence. To the extent that it represents an opinion, the evidentiary basis for it should appear. Once determined, it marks the minimum rate of return to which the company is lawfully entitled. Whether more shall be allowed depends upon the Commission\u2019s determination of what is a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d return.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The \u201cend result\u201d is to be reached by a \u201cbalancing of the investor and the consumer interests.\u201d <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., </em>320 U. S. 591, 603. From the investor point of view this requires that there be enough revenue for the capital costs of the business including service on the debt and dividends on the stock: a return \u201ccommensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks,\u201d and \u201csufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to maintain its credit and attract capital.\u201d <em>Colorado Interstate Co. </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>324 U. S. 581, 605; <em>Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., supra, </em>603. As the Commission has recognized, a return fair to investors is not necessarily fair to consumers. <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Pipeline Co., </em>315 U. S. 575, 608. The \u201cmeasure of a prudent outlay\u201d may be determined by the Commission in fixing the base upon which the investor is entitled to a return, if the evidence is found to disclose inefficiency or improvidence. See <em>West Ohio Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019n, </em>(No. 1) 294 U. S. 63, 72. While the good faith of management has not been seriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>questioned, a finding of improvidence is not for that reason foreclosed, and might on proper evidence be taken to warrant denial of return upon investment found to be imprudent.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The company has protested vigorously the use made by the Commission of evidence relating to rates in effect, or sought by the company, in other jurisdictions. Its motion that the evidential effect of these rates be limited to the question of \u201cfairness and reasonableness of basic monthly rates in New Hampshire <em>inter se\u201d </em>was denied. Consideration of the evidence is assigned as a ground of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The Commission is not bound by technical rules of evidence <em>(R. </em>L., c. 287, s. 10), and the evidence was properly received without the requested limitation. It was offered primarily for the purpose of casting doubt upon the reasonableness of the proposed New Hampshire rates, and the \u201ccredibility of the case presented in New Hampshire.\u201d Because of the liberal rule regarding the admissibility of evidence before the Commission, however, it is important that only proper use shall be made of it. See <em>Interstate Commerce Comm. </em>v. <em>Louis. &amp; Nash. R. R., </em>227 U. S. 88, 93. Although the evidence was frequently referred to in the Commission\u2019s report, no impropriety of use is evident. The Commission found that the company\u2019s action with respect to rate schedules elsewhere recognized that the interests of subscribers \u201crequire a lower rate of return\u201d than those to which the witnesses testified in these proceedings. It pointed out that the rates sought would subject New Hampshire subscribers to higher charges than those proposed for comparable service in the Massachusetts portion of the same company district. It found no proof of a difference in the value of the services, and stated that it was not satisfied that there was any reasonable basis why New Hampshire service should cost more. It noted that New Hampshire-filed rates are higher than those filed in any other state for a similar service.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The significance of some of these observations is somewhat dulled by the company\u2019s assertion that it now seeks rates to yield a comparable return in the other states in question. However the evidence did not for this reason become incompetent. While the jurisdiction of the Commission is confined to New Hampshire intrastate rates, it is not required to fix them in a vacuum, or to close its eyes to the company\u2019s conduct of its affairs in neighboring states where comparable conditions are to be anticipated. This is not to say that rates in New Hampshire may be fixed according to a standard of rates effective elsewhere. New Hampshire rates must reflect the proper and reasonable costs of business here. But a comparison of rates which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>reveals a differential not reasonably to be expected under conditions commonly regarded as comparable may be thought to make suspect the reasonableness of the various components relied upon to sustain the higher rates. No exposition of factors which might account for the apparent differential was undertaken by the company. It contented itself with its counsel\u2019s description of pending rate applications in the states in question. In this situation, the evidence was pertinent in considering whether the company had sustained its burden of establishing the reasonableness of the rates requested in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Of itself, the evidence relating to rates elsewhere has no conclusive probative force. Its affirmative effect depends upon other evidence to which it may lead. Thus if the sudden and high cost increase in New Hampshire investment and operating expense is related to the circumstance that New Hampshire is \u201cat the bottom of the . . . list in the matter of utilization of modern telephone equipment and apparatus,\u201d and shown to result from injudicious or discriminatory management, the company may not expect the consumer to be required to pay a return thereon. If accrued depreciation fails to take into account the obsolescence of antiquated equipment, its proper value for purposes of rate making may be determined. If new construction should have been undertaken upon a smaller scale or was unjustifiably postponed to an unpropitious time, a return based upon present construction cost is not required. Purchases made of affiliates at higher than normal or reasonable profit margins need not be accepted as a measure of allowable expense. See <em>United Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>303 U. S. 123, 150, 151. In brief, costs inflated by improper charges or injudicious expenditures are not conclusive (see <em>San Diego Land &amp; Town Co. </em>v. <em>Jasper, </em>189 U. S. 439, 442) and mere actuality of expense does not establish its \u201creasonableness . . . propriety or necessity.\u201d <em>Stanilaus County </em>v. <em>San Joaquin C. &amp; I. Co., </em>192 U. S. 201, 214. As was said in <em>Mississippi River Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>F. P. C., </em>163 F. (2d) 433, 451. \u201cThe \u2018end result\u2019 is the ability of the rate to meet the sum of the costs required to conduct the operation in fairness to the consumer and the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">It should be borne in mind that disallowances in investment base or expense of operation may not be arbitrarily made. Not only must their extent be fixed by findings, but the reason for disallowance must appear. In other words, they require disclosure of some rational process by which the consequences of any established impropriety are determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The briefs of <em>amicus curiae </em>focus attention upon the question of whether the proposed rates, and in particular the monthly base rates established according to exchange groupings, would produce an equitable distribution of the increased revenue burden among the rate payers. Rates are required to be just and reasonable <em>inter se, </em>as well as <em>in toto. </em>Discrimination may be made the basis of complaint by municipalities (R. L., c. 287, s. 5), and preferences are forbidden (R. L., <em>c. </em>292, s. 11). The company recognizes that an important step in rate making is \u201cthe adjustment of a rate schedule conforming to [the general revenue] level so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness from its details.\u201d <em>Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Pipeline Co., </em>315 U. S. 575, 584. In view of what was said by the Commission in its former report <em>(New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>29 N. H. P. S. C. 163, 187, 188, 190) the issue has presumably received consideration. Whether it should be considered further in the light of the argument made before us is for the Commission to decide, having in mind that continued use of the service furnished by the company will be encouraged only if increases are equitably distributed among consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The appellant has assigned as a ground of the appeal the action of the Commission in excluding from evidence a comparison between estimates made by the witness Hill in proceedings relating to rates of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company, and actual results of subsequent operations as disclosed by the annual report of that company. The offer was made on the question of the credibility and weight of the witness\u2019 testimony, and excluded as remote. The probability of injection of collateral issues was apparent, and no error is perceived in the exclusion of the evidence. <em>Gerry </em>v. <em>Neugebauer, </em>83 N. H. 23, 26; <em>Amoskeag Co. </em>v. <em>Head, </em>59 N. H. 332, 337, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\"><em>Net Book Investment. </em>In arriving at a figure for net intrastate investment as of December 31, 1947, the Commission excluded from consideration items of telephone plant under construction, amounting to $488,534, and property held for future telephone use, totalling $10,493, \u201cbecause of the fact that they represent investment not yet used or useful in the public service.\u201d With this exclusion the company takes issue. The items were excluded from consideration by the State\u2019s expert witness for similar reasons, and because the effect upon return would be offset by increases in earnings when the plant should be placed in service. The company attacks his'reasoning by reference to the testimony of its vice-president that new construction would furnish no commensurate increase because designed primarily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>effect improvements in existing service. The issue presented is essentially one of fact for the Commission\u2019s determination. The same company official testified that <em>\u201ca </em>great deal of the gross new construction\u201d for the years 1946-1948 \u201cis in addition to and not replacing former plant, and is adding to the total useable facilities in the state.\u201d There was evidence of substantial demand for better grades of service which when satisfied would produce increased revenue, off-setting the loss of return resulting from exclusion of construction from the rate base. It also appeared that interest upon unfinished construction is capitalized by the company. In this situation, by almost universal rule, exclusion from the base is held proper to prevent a double return. See <em>Northern States Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Com., </em>73 N. D. 211, 230; <em>Ohio Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com., </em>131 Oh. St. 539, 582; <em>Public Service Com. </em>v. <em>Mountain Fuel Supply Co., </em>(Utah), 73 P. U. R. (n. s.) 428, 436; <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., (F. P. C.), </em>45 P. U. R. (n. s.) 203, 214; <em>Re Commonwealth Telephone Co., </em>(Wis.) 41 P. U. R. (n. s.) 78, 86. The Commission was at liberty to determine the effect which should be given to the items in question in fixing rates for a period of two years without giving conclusive weight to views advanced by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Related to these items is the Commission\u2019s suggestion that the magnitude of expenditure indicates \u201cwastefulness in construction,\u201d and that the unprecedented program may exceed \u201creasonable needs\u201d for expansion. These comments, and the query whether \u201cthe additional intrastate business demands the large increases in capital investment\u201d can hardly be accorded the status of \u201cessential findings\u201d supporting the order made. <em>Grafton &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>State, supra. </em>If they play a part in the conclusions of the Commission, specific findings should be made to indicate their use; and the Commission is entitled in dealing with these as well as other matters to take into account the burden resting upon the company to justify its figures. In its earlier report, made in granting temporary rates in 1947, the Commission emphasized the low percentage of dial telephone in New Hampshire, and the resulting \u201cwage penalty.\u201d 29 N. H. P. S. C., 163, 184. As previously noted, the report now before us states that \u201cNew Hampshire appears to be at the bottom ... in the matter of . . . modern telephone equipment and apparatus.\u201d Although considerable testimony bearing upon this feature of the case was received in the course of the rate hearings, no finding indicates its effect upon the result reached. If it is cohsidered by the Commission to have a bearing upon the propriety of charging consumers with a return upon con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>struction at current costs, or with current costs of operations, findings are essential to permit review of the use made of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In the usual case, absent considerations of double return, whether investments not presently used or useful in the public service shall be included in the base depends upon whether they are to be placed in such service within the period for which the rates are fixed. \u201cThere will be no need in the computation of the rate base to include the . . . value of [assets] not presently in use, unless the time for using them is so near that they may be said, at least by analogy, to have the quality of working capital. . . . Postponement of . . . profit until the stage of imminent or present use is not an act of confiscation, but a legitimate exercise of legislative judgment.\u201d <em>Columbus Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019n, </em>292 U. S. 398, 406, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\"><em>The Effective Period of Two Years. </em>For such bearing as it may have upon the last considered issue, notice may be taken of the company\u2019s objection to the provision of the order making the rates effective for two years. It is asserted that the provision operates to \u201cfreeze\u201d the rates without provision for modification which might otherwise be open in case of future unfavorable changes in economic conditions. The pertinent statute provides that \u201cthe rates . . . fixed and allowed by the commission . . . shall be the rates ... to be charged ... for such period of time, not exceeding two years, as shall be prescribed in the order . . . \u201d R. L., c. 287, <em>s. </em>24. The Commission is not required to investigate rate matters more frequently than once in five years (R. L., c. 287, s. 5), but may do so in its discretion. We perceive no abuse of discretion in fixing two years as the effective period of the rate order, particularly since consideration was given in this case to forseeable conditions during a longer period.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\"><em>Estimated investment and operating figures for 1948. </em>While the report of the Commission compares the estimated average net investment figures for 1948 presented by the company and the State, no reported finding with respect thereto was made by the Commission. Upon remand, consideration should be given to the actual figures and appropriate findings made, so far as the company establishes that they are entitled to consideration in the determination of a fair return.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Findings were made by the Commission as to estimated revenues and expenses for 1948, in determining the estimated loss of $616,200 from intrastate operations for the year. The estimate of revenues, not substantially different from that of the company, is not seriously questioned. Objection is voiced, however, to adoption by the Commission of testimony of the witness Hill which excluded from operat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing expense substantial items of estimated depreciation and maintenance claimed by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Depreciation. </em>The figures adopted by the Commission in estimating depreciation for 1948 were $121,000 less than those advanced by the company. The company\u2019s brief concedes that the methods used by the witnesses who testified on the subject were the same, and that the difference in results reached \u201carises in the application of judgment to the known data.\u201d The argument presents no question of law; nor are we satisfied that the presumption of the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s finding is overcome by evidence to the contrary. No disposition was shown to question the amount of the accumulated reserve for prior years. It does not follow that in estimating depreciation for the immediate future the company\u2019s estimates must be given the same recognition. The high proportion of depreciation and maintenance expense to total operating expense may be thought indicative of \u201cprovision for capital additions, over and above the amount required to cover capital consumption.\u201d <em>Lindheimer </em>v. <em>Illinois Tel. Co., </em>292 U. S. 151, 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Maintenance. </em>Much the same answer might be made to the objection to adoption of an estimated maintenance expense figure which was $141,000 less than that of the company. Since these expenses have now become actual, the items involved should be reconsidered from the standpoint of propriety of allowance, and the objection becomes moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Attention is called by <em>amicus curiae </em>to the possibility that charges to maintenance, and in particular items classified as \u201crearrangements and changes\u201d result in large part from new construction and do not represent recurring costs of operation. While the company asserts that \u201cit by no means follows that the expense item will disappear or be materially reduced by completion of construction,\u201d the issue is not thus easily resolved. See <em>Public Utilities Commission </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>(Me. P. U. C.) <em>F. C. No. 1275 </em>(July 20, <em>1948); Re Wisconsin Telephone Company, </em>13 P. U. R. (n. s.) 224, 240. Whether it should be further explored is for the Commission to determine. Certainly it may be considered in determining probable future operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\"><em>Other operating expense. </em>In the estimates of operating expenses for 1948, neither the State\u2019s witnesses nor the Commission made allowance for the expenses of the rate case. This was clearly error. The statute expressly provides that such expenses shall be charged to operating expenses, and \u201camortized over such period as the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>sion may deem proper.\u201d R. L., <em>c. </em>287, s. 37. While the company has proposed three years as a suitable period, it was suggested in the <em>Hampton </em>case that \u201cin the lack of substantial evidence that another investigation will transpire within the quinquennial period, it should be employed as the only reasonable one to take for the amortization.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Company, </em>91 N. H. 278, 297. The period of amortization should be fixed by the Commission in the light of the consideration advanced by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Whether federal income taxes should be allowed as an operating expense is a matter in issue between the parties. The Commission estimated that the rates which it established would provide $681,360 \u201cafter Federal Income Taxes.\u201d Since there was in fact no tax upon income for combined New Hampshire operations for the year 1947 because operations showed a loss, reference to that year would furnish no justification for omission of the expense in estimating for 1948. Certain of the testimony appears to suggest that because of allowable deductions against combined income, the actual tax would be less than one computed upon intrastate income alone. Obviously no more than the estimated actual tax need be taken into account. An expense not in fact to be incurred may not be used to demonstrate an expected loss. On the other hand the State\u2019s argument that the tax should not be considered finds no support in the authorities. The proportion of the actual tax properly attributable to intrastate operations should be classified as an allowable expense of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">For reasons hereinbefore indicated, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
