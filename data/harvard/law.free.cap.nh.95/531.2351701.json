In ordering the investigation, the Commission prescribed temporary or emergency rate increases, effective from August 1, 1947 to December 31, 1948. On December 8, 1947, the company filed with the Commission a petition for general and emergency relief, seeking to make effective the emergency rates filed therewith. From the order of the Commission number 5242 denying emergency relief the appeal to this court was taken in aid of which this motion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The motion raises numerous difficult questions as to the rights of the company and the powers of this court, which it is deemed inadvisable to pass upon in advance of a hearing upon the appeal. The court recognizes the importance of the time element to the company in securing a determination of its appeal, but inasmuch as an immediate hearing can be had upon said appeal, it is ordered that no decision upon the motion be made at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The appeal is set for hearing at ten o\u2019clock Wednesday, February 4, 1948.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
