It thus appears that more than sixty days from May 24,1948, the day upon which the notice was served upon the defendant, had elapsed before the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>mencement of the present suit and <em>a fortiori </em>before judgment therein. The local statute (R. L., <em>c. </em>413, s. 12) authorizes this form of action only against a \u201clessee, occupant, mortgagor, or other person in possession, holding it [the tenement] without right, after notice in writing to quit the same as herein prescribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The requirements of the notice to quit are prescribed by R. L., c. 413, <em>s. </em>3, where it is provided that \u201cA notice equal to the rent period shall be sufficient, and three months\u2019 notice shall be sufficient in all cases.\u201d The Federal Statute now under consideration does not purport to state what sort of a notice to quit shall be given. Any notice given in accordance with the local law is sufficient. The provision that \u201cNo tenant shall be obliged to surrender possession of any housing accommodations . . . until the expiration of at least sixty days after written notice from the landlord that he desires to recover possession of such housing accommodations\u201d merely requires that sixty days after a written notice to quit shall have expired before a tenant shall be \u201cobliged\u201d to surrender possession of any housing accommodations. It has no reference to the requirements for maintaining an action, but merely prescribes the time within which a writ of possession or other process designed to \u201coblige\u201d the tenant to surrender possession of his housing accommodations shall not issue. This is the view of the Federal law taken by the Court of Appeals of Louisiana in <em>Porea </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>35 S. (2d) 152, and by the Court of Appeals of Ohio, 8th District, Cuyahoga County, in <em>Lupi </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>83 N. E. (2d) 247. This is also understood to be the administrative interpretation of the act followed by the office of the Housing Expediter who is charged with the administration of the law. With these conclusions we are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action \u201con the ground that the notice given to the defendant was insufficient as a matter of law\u201d was properly denied. As pointed out above, our statute provides that \u201ca notice equal to the rent period shall be sufficient,\u201d and in the agreed statement of facts it appears that the premises \u201cwere occupied by the defendant at a monthly rental of $20 per month.\u201d The notice to quit dated May 24, and requiring the defendant to vacate the premises on or before July 1, 1948, was, therefore, sufficient under our statute. After July 1, the defendant was \u201cin possession without right after notice in writing to quit\u201d and the Trial Court properly ordered judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
