Chapter 84 of the Revised Laws was apparently enacted in strict conformity to the <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>82 N. H. 561 and 84 N. H. 559, and imposes a property or estate tax upon franchises at \u201cthe average rate of taxation at that time upon other property throughout the state.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The proposed bill would tax electric utilities at the rate of one-quarter of a mill for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced within the state during the prior taxable year over and above the electricity, consumed by the utility in connection with such production.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AnD\"><em>Elwin L. Page </em>(by brief and orally), for the Interim Committee on Overall Taxation, for the bill.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOH\"><em>Sulloway, Piper, Jones, Hollis &amp; Godfrey (Mr. Alvah W. Sulloway) </em>orally), opposed.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A \u201cfranchise or privilege to do certain things may be granted to a corporation ... or an individual,\u201d but \u201ca tax laid upon it is subject to the constitutional rules of proportionality and reasonableness which apply to all taxes.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N. H. 561, 565. The proposal of House Bill No. 188 would change the character of the tax from an estate tax to a privilege tax, which is not permitted by our Constitution. <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>82 N. H. 561, 565; 84 N. H. 559, 567-568, 576.</p>\n<judges id=\"b620-6\">Oliver W. Branch.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b620-7\">Francis W. Johnston.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b620-8\">Frank R.
