The act authorizing this to be done provided that if fradulent indorsements of bonds should be obtained, or if the bonds should be sold for less than ninety cents on the. dollar, then the railroad should be sold, and those stockholders who could not prove either ignorance of the fraud or .opposition to it, should be individually liable for the payment of the bonds fraudulently indorsed, and for all other losses that might fall upon the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>by reason of any other frauds committed by the company. The State brought suit at law in this court against certain persons alleged in the declaration to be \u201c the majority and controlling incorporators, officers, directors, and stockholders as well as the actual managers'and controllers \u201d of the company. The declaration alleged that the defendants had (1) made fraudulent misrepresentations by reason of which the indorsement of an over-issue of bonds had been obtained; (2) made fraudulent misrepresentations by reason of which indorsements were obtained before the several sections of the road were fully finished, completed and equipped; and (8) that they had made unlawful and improper use of some of the bonds, or their proceeds, after they got into the hands of the company. On demurrer: <em>Held, </em>That the liability of the officers and stockholders to the State, was statutory only,'and that the \u2022 facts stated in the declaration were not such as to bring the defendants within the liability clause- in the statute ; (1) because the suit was not brought to recover the payment of bonds the indorsement of which had been fraud uently obtained ; and (2) because the declaration did not show that the losses sued for were the immediate consequences of the frauds alleged.

The declaration stated, in substance, that, under the operation- of certain statutes of Alabama, the governor was authorized and required to indorse, on the part of the State, the first mortgage bonds of the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad Company, a corporation having power to construct a railroad from Meridian, in the State of Mississippi, through the States of Alabama and Georgia to Chattanooga, in the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>of Tennessee, a distance-of two hundred and ninety-five miles, to the extent of $16,000 per mile, on the whole length of its road, as fast as sections of twenty continuous miles each were \u201c finished, completed and equipped.\u201d The bonds, when issued and indorsed, were to have \u201c priority in favor of the State over any and ail other liens whatever.\u201d Sections 5 and 6 of an act of February 19, 1867, on which liability of the defendants to a large extent depended, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">\u201c Sec. 5. <em>Be it further </em>enacted, That the bonds before specified shall not be used by said company for any other purpose than the construction and equipment of said road; and the governor shall not indorse the same unless on the affidavit of the president of said company, and a resolution of a majority of its directory for the time being, that said bonds shall not be used for any other purpose than the construction and equipment of said road, or sold or disposed of for a less sum than ninety cents in the dollar; nor shall said bonds be indorsed until the president and chief engineer of said company shall, upon oath, show that the conditions of this act have been complied with in all respects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">\u201c Sec. 6. <em>Be it further </em>enacted, That it shall be the duty of the governor, from time to time, when there shall be reliable information given to him that any railroad company shall have fraudulently obtained the indorsement of its bonds by the governor on the part of the State, or shall have obtained the indorsement contrary to the provisions of this act, or shall have sold or disposed of the bonds indorsed by the governor for a less sum than ninety cents in the dollar, he shall notify .the attorney-general of the State, whose duty it shall be forthwith to institute, in the name of the State, a suit in the Circuit or Chancery Court of the county of the place of business of the company, setting forth the facts; and when the fact shall satisfactorily appear'to the court that the indorsement of any of said bonds shall have been fraudulently obtained, or obtained contrary to the true intent, meaning and provisions of this act, or that said bonds shall have been sold or disposed of for a less sum than ninety cents in the dollar, then, and in such case, the court shall order, adjudge and decree that said road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>lying in the State, with all the property and assets of said company, \u00f3r a sufficiency thereof, shall be sold, and the, proceeds thereof shall be.paid into the treasury of the State;\u25a0 and.it shall.be the duty of the comptroller immediately to invest the same in State bonds, or the bonds indorsed by the. governor, under the provisions of this act creating a sinking fund as pro- \u25a0 vided for in the eleventh section of this act; and said company shall forfeit- all rights and privileges under the provisions of this act..

The bonds were only to be issued in such sums as it- should be shown by sufficient evidence' had been expended by the company in the construction and equipment of its road, \u201c in addition to and besides the proceeds of the bonds indorsed by the State which the said railroad company shall have received under the laws of the said \u2019 State now in force.\u201d The act also provided that these bonds should not be sold at less than ninety cents on the dollar, and \u201c that the directors or other officers and incorporators and stockholders of said railroad company, who shall knowingly violate, or permit the violation without objection, of any provision of this act, or of the act under which \u25a0 said company is now receiving the indorsement of \u2022 the State upon its bonds, of $16,000 per mile, shall be held personally liable- to the State for any loss incurred thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The declaration', after setting forth the various statutes relied on, proceeded as follows: \u201c The defendants were at the time last mentioned, and from thence continuously, until, and at and after the time' of the occurrence of the several and respective wrongs and injuries and losses to the plaintiff hereinafter stated, the majority and controlling incorpoi\u2019ators, officers, directors, and stockholders, as well as the actual managers and controllers of the said Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad Company; \u201d and, after stating that the company issued twelve hundred and fifty thousand of its first mortgage bonds in excess of that authorized by the statutes, aversyjfchat such over-issue was made \u201c with the intent fraudulently to procure the indorsement of each of its said bonds by the governor of plaintiff as if the indorsement of each of them by said governor was authorized by said acts, and with intent to deceive the governor of the plaintiff, and to defraud the plaintiff to the-extent of an amount equal to so many of said bonds and indorsements thereof as were not authorized by said acts to be indorsed by the governor of plaintiff; and said last-named com- \u25a0 pany, with such fraudulent intent, did, by false and fraudulent representations and pretences, some of which were to the effect that said company was presenting to the governor of plaintiff, for indorsement by him, only so many of its bonds as said acts authorized him to indorse, and was claiming of him indorsement of only so many of its bonds as said acts authorized him to indorse, fraudulently procure from said governor his indorsement of each and all of its bonds issued as aforesaid, and the redelivery to that company of all its said bonds indorsed as aforesaid. In procuring said indorsement by said governor of Alabama of each and of all the said bonds of said last-mentioned company, that company made to said governor the following, among other, false and fraudulent pretences: That this last-mentioned company, at the time it applied for and procured said indorsements, had twenty continuous miles of its railroad finished, equipped, and completed, outside of the State of Alabama, and in the State of Mississippi, and extending in a northeasterly direction towards Alabama; that said last-mentioned company, at the time it applied for and procured said - indorsements, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>twenty continuous miles of its railroad finished, equipped, and completed from Chattanooga, in the State of Tennessee, in a southwesterly direction towards Alabama, but outside of Alabama.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">'\u201c The governor of plaintiff was induced to make said indorsements by believing and acting upon said several false and fraudulent representations and pretences; and otherwise-would not have made any of said indorsements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">\u201c The said representations and pretences were false in the following, among other, respects and particulars:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">\u201c First.

illegally and fraudulently permitted the defendants to misapply, misap-propriate and convert to improper us\u00e9s a further large sum, to wit, four hundred thousand dollars, which had accrued to and

a coal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>mine, and that these bonds were wholly lost to the company and to the plaintiff, and were never applied in any way to its

ignorant of each of said wrongful and illegal acts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">The declaration concluded as follows: \u201cAnd the plaintiff, says that by reason of the aforesaid wrongful, illegal and fraudulent acts of the said Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad Company, permitted and participated in by the defendants, who were the actual managers and controllers of said Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad Company as aforesaid, the said corporation last named became a bankrupt in the year 1871, and was rendered wholly unable to pay its indebtedness existing on and prior to the first day of September, 1871, and' especially the interest on said indorsed bonds,\u201d which became due on the first days of January and July a.d. 1871, and that on the State bonds, which became due oh the first days of March and September in the same yearj amounting in the aggregate to five hundred and thirty-seven thousand six hundred dollars, all of

Whereby, and by force of the said acts of the general assembly of the plaintiff, approved February 19,1867, September 22,1868, November 17, 1868, February 11,1870, respectively, an action hath accrued to the plaintiff to recover against the said defendants full compensation for the aforesaid respective losses and damages to plaintiff sustained as aforesaid, yet the said defendants, although requested so-to do, have not, nor hath either or any of them, at any- time hitherto, yielded any compensation, or made any satisfaction or amends, to the plaintiff for the said loss so by the plaintiff sustained as aforesaid, but to do this the said defendants have hitherto altogether neglected and refused, and still do refuse, to the damage of the plaintiff, the sum of three million dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">To this declaration the defendants demurred generally.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-6\"><em>Mr. W.

There is no necessity for setting forth successive counts. It would be impossible and not'in accordance with the facts, admitted by the demurrers to be true, so far as they are well pleaded, to have separate counts set forth the statutory provisions relied upon, and aver one particular trespass or one violation of the obligations imposed upon and accepted by the defendants^ and conclude' that such single trespass, or such particular act in violation of their obligations, caused the loss for which the State .seeks redress. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>appears from the declaration that it was the various acts (and not one particular act) of the defendants, as therein specified (and with all the particularity of specification at the command of the plaintiff), in violation of the obligations imposed upon and accepted by them, that caused the company to become bankrupt, its property and franchise to be sold, its inability to pay the $537,600 interest on the indorsed and State bonds, and the payment of that precise sum by the State. <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Appleton, 8 </em>Mass. 472. In that case the declaration was in case. By an act of the State of New Hampshire creating a banking coi\u2019poration, it was provided that if the corporation should refuse or neglect to pay their bills on demand, the original stockholders, their successors, assigns and the members of the corporation in their private capacities, should be liable to the holder. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>18 Ala. 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\">Where, from a 'given state of facts, the law raises a legal obligation to do a particular act, and there is a breach of that obligation, and a consequential damage, an action on the case is the proper form of action, in which the plaintiff in his declaration states the facts out of which the legal obligation arises, the obligation itself, the breach of it, and the damage resulting from that breach; for that is the most accurate description of the real cause of action; and that form of action in which the real cause of action is most accurately described is. ime best adapted to every case. <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>5 B. &amp; C. 589; 1 Saunders on Pl. &amp; Ev. 715; 1 Chit.

After stating the facts in the language above reported, he continued :</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The demurrer presents the question whether the facts stated in the declaration are sufficient to support the action. \u2019 The liar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>bility of the officers and stockholders of the company to the State is statutory only, and there can be no recovery unless the facts stated in the declaration are such as to bring the defendants within the operation of the liability clause in one or the other of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">1. As to the act- of 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Under this act, guilty stockholders, are made liable, 1, for the payment of \u2018all bonds, the indorsement of which was fraudulently obtained by the company, or which were sold at less than ninety cents on the dollar ;\u2022 and, 2, for all <em>other </em>losses that fell on the State in consequence of any <em>other </em>fraud of the company. For frauds in obtaining indorsements the obligation is to pay the bonds indorsed; for all <em>other </em>frauds, to pay the losses of the State in consequence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">This suit is not brought to enforce a liability of the defendants . for the payment of the bonds. That was conceded in argument. With the alleged frauds in obtaining indorsements, therefore, we have nothing to do, because the liability of stockholders for the payment of <em>losses </em>depends entirely on other frauds than' these.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The office of a declaration is, to state the essential facts on which the liability of the defendant in the action depends. In this case, it must show, 1, the particular fraud of which the company has been guilty; and, 2, that the loss which has fallen on the State resulted- directly therefrom. The frauds alleged are, 1, misrepresentations, by reason of which the indorsement of an over-issue of bonds was obtained; 2, misrepresentations, by reason of which indorsements were obtained before the several sections of the road were fully \u201cfinished, completed and equipped; \u201d and, 3, the unlawful and improper use of some of the bonds, or their proceeds, after they got into the hands of the company.-</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">As to the first and second of these classes of allegations, it is sufficient to say that they relate only to the manner in which the indorsements were obtained, and for frauds of that character the liability is, as has been seen, only for the payment of the bonds the indorsement of which was got in that way. The other allegations are in effect that, at different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>times, the company used indorsed bon\u2019ds, or their proceeds, for dishonest purposes, and paid them out without consideration and in fraud of the rights of innocent stockholders. In some instances, they were given to the defendants without consideration, or for an unauthorized purpose,, and in other's to other persons who were not entitled to them. If the averments are true, they show gross frauds by the company and the defendants, as its officers and agents, upon innocent stockholders, but they fail entirely to connect the losses which have since fallen on the State with what was thus wrongfully done. Upon such allegations, if proven, the comparty might, perhaps, recover from the defendants and others the bonds and moneys they had fraudul\u00e9ntly obtained, but it by no means follows that the State has, also, a right of' action against the defendants on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The declaration does indeed allege that, <em>\u201c </em>by, reason of the-aforesaid wrongful, illegal and fraudulent acts of the said . . . company, permitted and participated in by the defendants,\u201d the corporation became bankrupt and was rendered wholly unable to pay its debts, and especially the interest on its bonds; and that the State had been compelled to make certain payments on that account \u201c which she would not have been compelled to pay but for the wrongful, illegal and fraudulent acts of the defendants and said corporation; \u201d and that, \u201c by reason of the aforesaid wrongful, illegal and fraudulent acts of the said . . . company and of the defendants, the said plaintiff - has been further damnified and injured to the additional extent of one million of dollars in settling her liability created and evidenced by her aforesaid indorsement of said indorsed bonds ; \u201d but this is not enough, unless the facts from which this conclusion is drawn are such as to show that the loss was both the natural and immediate consequence of the wrongful and fraudulent acts referred to. Pleadings must state facts, and not conclusions of law merely, and the allegation in this case-that the loss arose from-the fraud is only a conclusion of law. If the facts from which the conclusion is drawn are not sufficient to show that in law the loss was attributable to the fraud, the declaration is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The facts are, that the State was to indorse certain bonds of the company upon certain security; It made the indorsement and got the security. The obligation of the- company to use the bonds to build and equip the road was satisfied, if the road was actually completed and equipped in accordance with the requirements of the statute at a <em>bona fide </em>cost to the company of more than the amount of the bonds. The object of this requirement was to insure the creation of the security which the State was entitled to have. If the security was actually perfected, all claim of the State upon the'indorsed bonds was satisfied. There is no pretence that the road cost less than the value of the bonds. Consequently, if the bonds were not used to build the road, other funds belonging to the company must have been, \u00e1nd it was proper to treat the bonds as a substitute for the other funds in the treasury of the company. This being so, it was not a fraud on the State for the company to do with the bonds as it might have done with the other funds, if they had not been used in building the road. As the State had no direct lien on the bonds for its security, a fraudulent use of the bonds was not a fraudulent diversion of the. State\u2019s securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The loss of the State is directly attributable to the deficiency in the value of its original security, and the fraudulent use of the bonds had no effect on that. The company, if the allegations are true, has wasted its property and made itself insolvent, but it has not in this way incre\u00e1sed its obligations to, or changed, its relations with, the State. Both the debt to and the security held by the State were the same after the frauds as before: The injury to innocent stockholders - by the wrongful acts of the company and the defendants was direct, and immediate, because their property was taken and fraudulently converted to the use of the defendants or the other wrongdoers. To the State, however, the injury, if- any, was both indirect and remote, because the State had no direct claim upon, or interest in, the property which was misappropriated. The law will not imply that, if the company had kept the bonds, the. same loss would, not have fallen on the State. There was no imperative obligation on the company to use the bonds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>pay the debts for which the State was liable rather than others, and, consequently, it dannot be said that, as a matter of law, if the misappropriations had not been made, the State would have suffered no loss. To our . minds it is clear, therefore, that, upon the facts as they are set forth in the declaration, there is no liability on the part of the defendants for the alleged frauds of the company, other than those connected with over-issues, or sales of the bonds at less than ninety cents on the dollar, and for these the suit is not brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">2. As to the act of 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Under this act all officers and stockholders who knowingly violate or permit without objection the violation of any of its provisions, or the provisions of the act of 1867, are made personally liable to the State for any loss incurred thereby. There is also a prohibition against a sale of the State bonds, the issue of which to the company was authorized, at less than ninety cents on the dollar; but there is no provision for the liability of the stockholders for the payment of the bonds, in case they are so sold, as there is in the act of 1867. The only liability under this act, for such a violation of its provisions, is for the losses which the State sustains on that account. The declaration alleges that seven hundred and seventy-one of these bonds were sold at less than ninety cents on the dollar, but it fails entirely to show how the State was injured thereby. Stockholders are liable under this act for violations of the act of 1S67, only when such violations occur after this act took effect, which was February 11, 1870, and it nowhere affirmatively appears that any of the wrongs complained of were committed after that date, except in the sale of the State bonds at less than ninety cents on the dollar. It is also as much incumbent on the State to show, under this act, that the losses for which it geeks to recover were the direct and immediate consequence of the wrongful conduct complained of, as it was under the act of 1867. What has been said, therefore, as to the insufficiency of the allegations to charge the defendants under that act, is equally applicable to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">It was contended'in argument that the remedy of the State to enforce the liability of the defendants.under the statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>exclusively in equity. This question we do not decide, as there is not entire unanimity of opinion amongst us in reference to it. There were other objections to the declaration also mentioned in the argument,.but we deem it unnecessary to refer to them, as what has already been said is sufficient to dispose of the case. Being unanimously of opinion that the -facts stated in the declaration are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants,</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>We sustain the demurrer.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
