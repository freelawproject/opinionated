But he contended that he was entitled to transport certain Indian stores and supplies, which were delivered, against his protest, to the Northwest Transportation Company for transportation to posts and agencies included in his contract.' The supplies and stores last named were transported under a written contract made, without advertisement, by. the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in September, 1870, at higher rates than those allowed the claimant. If they had been transported by him, under his contract, he would have realized-a large profit, after deducting what it would have cost to do the work, and also a reasonable sum for being relieved from the care, trouble, responsibility, and risk attending such service. Although fully prepared, and offering, to transport them, the officers of the Indian Bureau refused to turn them over to him. \u2022 This, he contended, was a breach of his contract. The court below adjudged that- the law was with the government, and dismissed the petition, from which judgment the claimant appealed. He now insists that the judgment proceeded upon an erroneous construction of his contract, and was also inconsistent with the practical interpretation given to its provisions by officers of the government immediately charged with its execution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-6\"><em>Mr. Theodore H.

The legal intention of the contracting parties is to be ascertained and determined not \"only by reference to the contract and the subject-matter of the contract, but also to the surrounding circumstances. <em>Merriam, </em>v. <em>United States, </em>107 U. S. 437; <em>Wash </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>5 Wall. 689; <em>Barreda </em>v. <em>Silsbee, </em>21 How. 146; <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>9 Cl. &amp; Fin. 355; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Long-bottom, </em>1 El. &amp; El. 977; <em>Oa/rr </em>v. <em>Montefiore, </em>5 B. \u00abfe S. 407; <em>Brawley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 U. S. 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-4\">Now what were the surrounding circumstances, and the light which the parties possessed when this contract was made ? The quartermaster-genera,!, who has charge of army transportation, and is familiar with the wants and demands of the government in this respect, advertised that proposals would be received at his office, Chicago, Ill., till 12 m. Tuesday, February 1, 1870, for the transportation of government troops, military, government and Indian stores, supplies, \u00abfee., between certain points named on the Missouri River, during the time from March 20, 1870, and October 31, 1870. The claimant submitted proposals iff answer to said advertisement, which were accepted, and the contract was made to include all such military, Indian, and government stores, supplies, \u00abfee., as may be offered or turned over to him for transportation. The quartermaster-general- for the year 1869 made a contract for the transportation of <em>\u201c </em>all the military stores, supplies, \u00abfee.,\u201d over the same route, and during the same period, in which the Indian supplies were not named, and notwithstanding this the contractor was required by the Indian Bureau and the quartermaster-general to transport\u2019 the Indian supplies for that year. In view of this fact the quartermaster-general took the precautionary steps, when he made the contract with the claimant for the year following, 1870, and specifically named the Indian supplies, and designated with great particularity the Indian posts and agencies where they were to be transported. The claimant, believing, as he had a right to, that the government was acting in good faith, and intended to turn over all the stores and supplies named in the said advertisement for proposals, and being an experienced steamboat man and entirely familiar with the extent and character of the government trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>portations on the Missouri River, and the number of pounds usually transported, made his bid correspondingly low, expecting to receive all the stores, supplies, &amp;c-., specified in the advertisement which the government required to have transported, and his bid was accepted and the contract made. It is manifest that it was -the purpose of both parties that the plaimant was to transport all military, Indian, and government stores and supplies over his route during the life of his contract. The employment of other parties by the government to dorany part of this work during the contract term made the government responsible in damages. <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>19 Wall. 264, 270. It is. true that there is not in the contract any express covenant or agreement on the part of the United States to offer the claimant for transportation any of the said stores or supplies whatever; but where a contract in terms binds a contractor to transport all the freight which the government may offer him, and involves on his part a large preparatory expenditure, and a continual readiness to perform, the law implies a mutual obligation upon the government to give to him all the freight for which it may require transportation by contract. <em>Speed </em>v. <em>United States, </em>8 Wall. 77.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">III. The United States -as principal are- bound by the acts and contracts of their agent, done with their consent or by their authority, or adopted by their ratification. The officers and agents of the defendants represented that they had authority to contract with the appellant for the transportation of the Indian supplies, and he in good faith entered into the contract, under the belief that, the terms of the contract would be complied with by the defendants; that he would have \u201cany number of pounds of stores and supplies, from and between one hundred thousand pounds and twenty millions pounds in the aggregate, of \u201c all such military, Indian, and government stores, supplies, &amp;c.,\u201d which the defendants required to have transported; the appellant accordingly made the necessary preparations to execute his part of the agreement, and did execute it according to its terms, and it was ratified by the defendants, with the exception that they refused to deliver to the appellant all of the Indian supplies for transportation, after they had delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>part of them according to.contract. 'The rules of law, that a subsequent ratification of an act done as agent is equal to a prior authority, are so well understood as to require no more than a mere statement. The government having derived the benefit of the appellant\u2019s low bid as incorporated in the contract, it constitutes a ratification and an adoption thereof. And it is equally well settled that the law upon this subject applies to the act of the sovereign ratifying the acts of its officers. In <em>Baron </em>v. Denman, 2 Exch. 188, Baron Parke, in giving the opinion, after stating the rule as between individuals, adds: \u201cSuch being the law between private individuals, the question is, whether the act of the sovereign ratifying the act of one of its officers can be distinguished. On that subject I have conferred with my learned brethren, and they are decidedly of opinion that the ratification of the crown, communicated as it has been in the present case, is equivalent to a prior command.\u201d See also <em>Secretary of State </em>v. <em>Sahaba, </em>13 Moore P. C. Sections 219 and 220 Rev. Stat. authorize the Secretary of War to prescribe the general regulations for 'the trans portation of military stores and supplies, &amp;c., for the army, &amp;c. Where a public officer is held out as having authority to do an act, or is 'empowered in his capacity as a public officer to make the declaration or representation for the government, which is relied. on as the substantial ground of relief, the government is bound by the acts and declarations of the agent. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>7 Cranch, 366, 368, <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 U. S. 247.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-4\"><em>Mr. Solicitor-General </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-5\">Mr. Justice Harlan</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">delivered the opinion of the court. He stated\u2019ihe facts in the language above reported, except so much thereof as is contained between brackets, and continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We are of the opinion that the claimant has no cause of action against the United .States. The contract did not obligate the government to .deliver to him, nor did it bind him to receive, for transportation, during the-period designated, <em>all </em>Indian sup- \u25a0 plies, or stores, in ' the hands of its agents or officers, of what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ever department or branch of .the'public service. It was made with the claimant by an officer of the quartermaster\u2019s department under directions from the quartermaster-general of the army. By its first article he became bound to furnish all the steamboat transportation required by the United States for officers and soldiers on the Missouri River between certain named places, and for posts or Indian agencies between certain other named places, at any time from March 20,1870, to October 31, 1870. He agreed to \u201c receive, at any time during that period, from the officers or agents of the quartermaster\u2019s department, at St. Louis, or any point between St. Louis and Fort Benton,\u201d mentioned in the tabular statement annexed to the written contract, \u201c all siich military, Indian, and government stores, supplies, wagons, and stock as may be offered or turned over to him for transportation, in good order and condition, by said officers or agents of the quartermaster\u2019s, department, and transport the same with dispatch, and deliver them in like good order and condition to the officer or agent of the quartermaster\u2019s department designated to receive them,\u201d &amp;c. These words define the nature aud extent of the obligations assumed by the contractor. It was entirely competent for the quartermaster\u2019s department to enter into an agreement whereby the contractor became bound to receive from its officers or agents all such military, Indian or government supplies as <em>the-y- </em>might deliver to him for transportation: But. it had' no authority, without reference to the views of the Interior Department, and of the officers having special connection with Indian affairs, to control the transportation of Indian supplies or stores of every kind. Nor did the quartermaster\u2019s department assume to exercise such authority; for it only stipulated with claimant that he should receive and transport such supplies and stores as were turned over to him by its officers and agents. As, therefore, the claimant was not bound to receive Indian supplies or stores turned over to him for transportation -by the Indian Bureau, ' the employment by the Commissioner of. Indian Affairs of others to effect the transportation of Indian stores and supplies \u25a0 \u2014 -which were never, so far as the record discloses, in charge of the quartermaster\u2019s department for transportation \u2014 was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>an infringement of Ms legal rights. 'There is no escape from -this conclusion, unless it be that the quartermaster\u2019s depart- ' ment had, under the law, the sole power of making contracts for the transportation of Indian supplies and stores. But that proposition cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">It is, also, contended, that the government, in view of the conduct of its agents, subsequent to the making of the contract With claimant, cannot now be permitted to dispute the proposition, that, he was entitled, by his contract, to receive for transportation, during the period designated, all Indian supplies and stores, by whatever department held, which were to be sent to the several Indian posts or agencies designated in that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">This proposition arises out of the following facts found by the Court of Claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">\u2018i It does not appear that either the Commissioner of Indian Affairs or the Secretary of the Interior had actual knowledge of the fact that the contract in suit existed with the claimant -relating to the transportation of Indian stores and supplies by or through the officers of the quartermaster\u2019s department, nor did they expressly authorize General Rucker to enter into a contract for the transportation of Indian stores or supplies, nor did they ratify such contract, unless its ratification be implied from the following facts and circumstances: The Indian Bureau directed that two lots of Indian supplies be forwarded in April and May, 1870, amounting to 221,242 pounds, which was accordingly done by Quartermasters Gillis and Fury, at Sioux Citjq Iowa, turning them' over to the claimant for transportation, and they were by him transported (under his contract with the quartermaster\u2019s department to include the transportation of the Indian supplies) to Whetstone and Big Oheyenne agencies, and the Indian .Bureau reimbursed the War Department for this transportation. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior directed the Secretary of War, June -21,1870, to turn over the army subsistence stores collected at the'instance of the Commissioner of Indian AfEairs for the Indians at,Forts Rice, Stevenson, Buford, and Shaw to the Indian agents at the Grand River'and Fort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Berthold agencies, and that the cost of transporting the stores from the forts to the. agencies would be paid by the Indian Bureau. The claimant transported, September 27,1870, 82,720 pounds of Indian stores and supplies from Fort Bice to Grand Biver agency, for which he was paid accordingly. The contract in suit was duly filed in the returns office of the Depart-, ment of the Interior the 12th March, 1870.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">These facts, give no support to the suggestion that the government recognized claimant\u2019s right to transport all Indian supplies.for the posts or agencies named in his contract. That contract did not forbid the quartermaster\u2019s department from receiving Indian supplies, in the first instance, from the Indian Bureau, and delivering them to the claimant for transportation under his contract. And that which was done in respect of the Indian supplies forwarded in April and May, 1870, and of those transported in September, 1870, to Grand Biver agency, so far from implying authority- in the quartermaster\u2019s department to control the whole matter of the transportation of Indian supplies, was a recognition of the authority of the officers, having special charge of Indian affairs, to provide for the transportation of any Indian supplies in their hands. For, the cost -incurred in transporting Indian supplies to the Whetstone, Big' Cheyenne and Grand Biver agencies was borne by the Indian Bureau. If the Indian Bureau chose to make arrangements with the War Department for the transportation of certain Indian .supplies, under the' contract made with the claimant, that fact falls short of proving that the purpose was to grant him the right to transport all Indian supplies, by whatever department or officers held, to. the posts or agencies designated in his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We perceive no error in the judgment, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
