B. French <em>&amp; </em>Co., and by the respondents. The libellant complied in all things with his contract. The Highbury arrived at the port of New Orleans on or before September 11. On that day, she being in that port and ready to receive cargo, her master notified that fact to the respondents, tendered her to them, and demanded of them a full cargo of wheat in bulk, according to the terms of the charter-party. On the next day, the' respondents in writing refused to accept the ship, or to furnish the cargo, for the reason that her tonnage was greater than that expressed in the charter-party. Thereafter, during the lay days, various negotiations were pending between the parties, until September 30, when the master caused public protest to be made before a notary and witnesses of the respondents\u2019 refusal.. On October 19, the master obtained at the same port a full- cargo of cotton and oil cake, the freight of. which exceeded in value by $532.10 that of the cargo of wheat which the respondents had contracted to furnish.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">The actual tonnage of the Highbury was 1203 tons, registered measurement. Her actual carrying capacity \u2022 for grain was about 11,500 quarters of wheat, depending upon the length of voyage between coaling stations. The estimated amount of freight, the penalty stipulated in the charter-party, was $20,872.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">At the date of the charter-party, the Highbury was.a new ship, and neither of the contracting parties in New Orleans knew her exact registered measurement or tonnage or carrying capacity. All the negotiations between them, preliminary to the contract, were with reference to her carrying capacity, which, under the custom among merchants and shippers of grain, might run not exceeding ten per cent, over or under the cargo stipulated <em>for.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">By reason of the respondents\u2019 failure to accept the ship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>furnish a cargo, and comply with their contract, the libellant suffered damages to the amount of $5693.15 (consisting \u25a0 of $611.15 for expenses incurred in fitting up the Highbury to receive a cargo of wheat; and $5082 for the delay, after the expiration of the fifteen lay days, of twenty-one days, at the rate of \u00a350 a day, in obtaining and loading .another cargo), with interest from the date of the libel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">The Circuit Court stated, as conclusions of law, that the libel should be maintained, and the libellant recover from the respondents the sum of $5693.15, with interest and costs, and entered a decree accordingly; and each party appealed to this court., The opinion of the Circuit Court upon the merits is reported in 10 Fed. Rep. 145.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\"><em>Mr. J. B. </em>Beckwith, for Watts,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au4\">argued upon the construction of the contract of charter, and also as to the amount of the damages. On the latter point he said : The court erred in not decreeing the full sum of $28,872.50. This charter-p'arty was made in Louisiana, the ship was loaded there, and the law of Louisiana is part of the contract. This is the rule both at common and civil law. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Alliance Ins. Co., </em>9 Allen, 311; <em>Haviland </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>34 N. Y. 643; <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>16 Johns. 233; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ketcham, </em>8 Johns. 189; <em>Jewell </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>30 N.

Y. 1, 227. If this contract had. been executed, neither vessel nor cargo would at any time during performance have passed from the dominion of the civil law. The laws of Louisiana governed it. The following article from the Code relates to the interpretation of contracts: <em>\u201c </em>Art. 1945. Legal agreements, having the effect of law upon the parties, none but the parties can abrogate or modify them, Upon this principle are established the following rules: 1st. That no general or special legislative act can be so construed as to avoid or modify a legal contract previously made. 2d. That courts are bound to give legal effect to all such contracts, according to the true intent of all parties. 3d. That the intent is to be determined by the words of the contract when these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>are clear and explicit, and lead to no absurd consequences.\u201d The character and effect of a penal clause in contracts is regulated by several articles. \u201cA penal clause is a secondary obligation, entered into for the purpose of enforcing the performance of a primary obligation.\u201d Art. 2117. It supposes two distinct contracts: one to do or give a particular thing: the other to do or give something in the event that the principal agreement is not carried into effect. Art. 2118. The penalty is due only on condition that the primary agreement is not performed. Art. 2119. The creditor may elect whether he will sue for the penalty or for the performance of the principal obligation. Art. 2124. The penal clause is compensation for damages. The creditor cannot demand both the penalty and the principal obligation. Art. 2125. Courts are given power to modify the penalty only when the principal obligation has been partly executed. Articles 2117 to 2129 inclusive. Thus we are free in this case from the subtlety of the common law as to penalties and liquidated damages. Partial performance \u2014 the only condition that could vest the courts with power to modify the penalty \u2014 is negatived by the pleadings and findings. In Louisiana penalty is liquidated damages whenever there has been absolute default on the principal obligation. <em>Barrow </em>v. Bloom, 18 La. Ann. 276; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Zuntz, </em>28 La. Ann. 500.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-5\"><em>Mr. J. Ward </em>Gurley, <em>Jr., </em>for Camors <em>&amp; </em>Another.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIHo\">The tonnage of a vessel p's an essentialpart of its description. Name and tonnage are the two most distinctive parts of the description. There are often many vessels of the same nationality and name: but it is scarcely probable that two would be found of the same name and identical tonnage. The tonnage is fixed by official measurement, is part of the official record of the vessel, and is indispensable to it..</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\">This charter-party describes the vessel as of the burthen of 1100 tons, or thereabouts, registered measurement, and the charterers engage to provide and furnish the vessel a full and complete cargo, say, about 11,500 quarters of wheat in bulk. As a vessel of 1100 tons cannot carry over 9500 to 10,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>quarters of wheat, the obligation of the charter-party and the object and purpose of the parties clearly was that a vessel of 1100 tons should be filled with wheat in bulk, not that charterers should furnish 11,500 quarters of wheat, and that a vessel capable of carrying that quantity should be furnished. With respect' to statements, in a contract, descriptive of the subject-matter of it,'the doctrine is that if such descriptive statement was intended to be a substantive part of the contract .it is to be regarded as a warranty, that is to say, a condition, on the failure or non-performance of which the other party may, if he be so minded, repudiate the contract <em>in toto, </em>and be so relieved from performing his part of it, provided it has not been partially executed in his favor. Maclachlan, Law of Merchant Shipping, 343. ' A court must be influenced in the construction, not only by the language of the instrument, but also by the circumstances under which and the purposes for which the charter-party was entered into. Evidence of the usages of the trade in which the vessel is to be used is admissible. 2 Phillipps Ev. 415. In this case the charter-party expresses the object of the chartering and the particular trade and cargo contemplated, viz.: \u201cFor a voyage from New Orleans to Havre, St. Nazaire, Antwerp, Bordeaux, or Bremen, orders on signing bills of lading . . . wheat in bulk.\u201d The usages of that trade are well known and undisputed. When a vessel is so chartered it is for the purpose of filling a contract for the sale of American wheat and its delivery on the other side. The invariable requirements of the custom and usages governing such transactions are that the wheat delivered must be a'fuil and complete cargo for the vessel transporting the same, and that the cargo must not vary more than 10 per cent, either over or under the quantity named in the contract of sale. Any deviation from these rules warrants the purchaser of the wheat in rejecting the tender and claiming damages. Owners failed to tender a vessel of 1100 .tons \u201c registered measurement,\u201d and instead tendered a vessel of 1203 tons \u201cregistered measurement,\u201d with a much greater carrying capacity than a vessel of 1100 tons, and demanded therefor a full cargo of, wheat in bulk. Charterers and their assigns, Gordon &amp; Gomila, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>fore rejected the tender, and Gordon &amp; Gomila were compelled, because of the failure of the owners to furnish a vessel of 1100 tons, to charter another vessel, the Ber Yorleck, at a higher rate, 'to fulfil their contract to deliver a cargo of not less than 8000 nor more than 10,000 quarters of wheat, and for which purpose-they had taken from Oamors <em>&amp; </em>Co., the said charter-party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">Mr. Gurley also contended that the penal clause in the charter-party should be construed as a penalty and not as liquidated damages; and that being a maritime contract, its construction was not affected by the local law of Louisiana.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-6\">Mr. Justice Grat</author>\n<p id=\"Ahk\">delivered the opinion1 of the court. He stated the facts in the language reported above, and continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">In this case, as brought before us by the appeal and the cross-appeal, three questions have been argued, which 'may naturally and conveniently be considered in the following' order-:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">1st. Is the statement of the registered tonnage of the High-bury in the charter-party a warranty or condition precedent ?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">2d. If it is not, is the owner of the ship entitled to recover the estimated amount of freight, that is to say, the sum of $20,-872.50, as liquidated damages ?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u25a0 3d. If both these questions are answered in the negative, have the charterers shown any error in law in the amount of damages for which a decree was rendered against them in the Circuit Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">1. In the charter-party, the ship is described as the \u201c Steamship Highbury, of the burthen of 1100 tons, or thereabouts,. registered measurement; \u201d and the owner agrees to receive on board, and the charterer engages to provide, \u201c a full and complete cargo, say, about .11,500 quarters of wheat in bulk.\u201d In fact, her registered tonnage was 1203 tons, a little more than nine per cent, above that stated in the charter*; hut this 'was not known to either party at the time of entering Into the contract, and her actual carrying capacity corresponded to the cargo which the charterers engaged to furnish, and the owner agreed to receive on board.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The statement in. the charter-party, concerning the registered tonnage of the ship, clearly does not constitute a warranty or condition precedent that she is of 1100 tons registered measurement. The intention and the agreement of the parties, as apparent upon the face of their written contract, were that the steamship Highbury should receive and carry a full and complete cargo of about 11,500 quarters of wheat in bulk. There being no Avilful or fraudulent misrepresentation, the description, \u201c of the burthen of 1100 tons, or thereabouts, registered-measurement \u201d (if it could under other circumstances be held a warranty), is controlled by the designation of the ship by name, and by the unequivocal stipulations regarding the cargo to be carried. <em>Brawlcy </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 96 U. S. 168; <em>Norrington </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>115 U. S. 188, 204; <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Windle, </em>6 E. <em>&amp; </em>B. 675 ; <em>Ashburner </em>v. <em>Balchen, </em>7 N. Y. 262; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Levison, </em>1 C. <em>P. </em>D. 155. The refusal of the charterers to accept her cannot therefore be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">2. The concluding clause of the charter-party, by which <em>\u201c to </em>the true and faithful performance of all and every of the foregoing agreements \u201d the parties bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and also the vessel and freight; and the merchandise to be laden on board, each to the other, \u201cin the penal sum of estimated amount of freight,\u201d is clearly not a stipulation fQr liquidated damages, but a penalty to secure the payment of the amount of damage that either party may actually suffer from any breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The principal object of this clause appears to be to pledge the ship and freight as security for the performance of the agreements of the owner, on the one hand; and the merchandise to be laden on board, as security for the performance of the agreements of the charterer, on the other. It is in the form of a penalty ; it covers alike an entire refusal to perform the contract, and a failure to perform it in any particular, however slight; and for any breach, whether total or partial, a just compensation can be estimated in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">.At the common laAV, indeed, before the statute of 8 &amp; 9 \"W. III. chi 11, \u00a7 8, judgment might.have been rendered for the full amount of\"the penalty. But in a case like this, a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>equity would, stay proceedings at law, upon payment of the damages actually suffered. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>108 U. S. 436, 453 <em>&amp; seq.; Sloman </em>v. Walter, 1 Bro. Ch. 418; <em>In re Newman, </em>4 Ch. D. 724. And at the present day, even a court of law would regard such a clause in such a contract as a penalty only, and not' as liquidating the damages. <em>Tayloe </em>v. Sandiford, 7 Wheat. 13; <em>Van Buren </em>v. <em>Digges, </em>11 How. 461, 477; <em>Higginson </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>14 Gray, 165; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>13 East, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In Abbott on Shipping (Shee\u2019s ed.) pt. 4, ch. 2, \u00a7 2, speaking of charter-parties, it is said that \u201c it is usual for each of the parties to these contracts to bind himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, and the owner or master to bind the ship and her freight, and the merchant the cargo to be laden, in a pecuniary penalty for the true performance of their respective covenants; this is commonly done by a clause at the end of the instrument. Such a clause is not the absolute limit of damages on either side ; the party may, if he thinks fit, ground his action upon the other clauses or covenants, and may in such action recover damages beyond the amount of the penalty, if in justice they shall be found to exceed it. On the other hand, if the party sue on such a penal clause, he cannot in effect recover more than the damage actually sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In such cases, accordingly, the courts of the United States, sitting in admiralty, award the damages actually suffered, whether they exceed or fall short of the amount of the penalty. <em>The Salem\u2019s </em>Cargo, 1 Sprague, 389 ; <em>The </em>Marcella, 1 Woods, 302. In England and in this country, a court of admiralty, within the scope of its powers, acts upon equitable principles; and when the facts before it, in a matter within its jurisdiction, are such that a court of equity would relieve, and a court of law could not, it is the duty of the court of admiralty to grant relief. \u2019 <em>The Juliana, </em>2 Dodson, 504, 521; <em>The Harriett, </em>1 W. Rob. 182, 192; <em>The Virgin, 8 </em>Pet. 538, 550; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lull, </em>2 Sumner, 443 ; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hurlbert, </em>Taney, 589, 600; <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>New Bedford Cordage Co., </em>2 Lowell, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The provisions of the Civil Code of Louisiana, and the decisions of her Supreme Court, tend to show that in the courts of that State, in case of a total breach of the contract by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>party, the other might have judgment <em>for </em>the <em>full </em>amount of the penalty stipulated by the parties, although for a partial breach he could only recover his actual damages. Louisiana Civil Code of 1870, Arts. 1945, 2117, 2124, 2125, 2127 ; <em>M\u2019Nair </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>5 Martin La. 525, 563, 564; <em>English </em>v. <em>Latham, 3 </em>Martin La. (N. S.) 88 ; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>16 Louisiana, 188, 196 ; <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>18 La. Ann. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">But the law of Louisiana does not govern this question, whether it is treated as a question of. construction of the contract of the parties or as a question of judicial remedy ' If it is considered as depending upon the intent of the parties as manifested by their written contract, the performance of that contract is to be regulated by the law which they must be presumed to have had in view when they executed it. <em>Wayman </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>10 Wheat. 1, 48; <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>106 U. S. 124. Americans and Englishmen, entering into a charter-party of an English ship for an ocean voyage, must be presumed to look to the general maritime law of the two countries, and.not. to the local law of the State in which the contract is signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">If it is considered as a question of the remedy and relief to be judicially administered, .the equity and admiralty jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, under the national Constitution and laws, is uniform throughout the Union, and cannot be limited in its extent, or controlled in' its exercise, by the laws of the several States. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>4 Wheat. 108; <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Story, </em>9 Pet. 632 ; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>12 How. 139 ; <em>Neves </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>13 How. 268 ; <em>The Chusan, </em>2 Story, 455 ; <em>The St. Lawrence, </em>1 Black, 522 ; <em>The Lottawamna, </em>21 Wall. 558 ; Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 913, 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The Circuit Court, therefore, rightly held that the charterers were liable only for the amount of damages which their breach of the contract had actually caused to the owner of the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">3. It is contended, in behalf of the charterers, that as the ship was tendered on September 11, and refused in writing on the next day, it was the duty of the master and the owner at once to seek another cargo, and thus prevent any damage that might follow,\"instead of lying idle until the lay days had ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>pired; and therefore, within the rule laid down in <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>105 U. S. 224, no damages should have been decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">But the Circuit Court having found, as facts, that various negotiations were pending between the parties, after the first refusal until September 30, and that it was by reason of the failure of the charterers to accept the ship, furnish a cargo, and comply with their contract, that the owner'suffered damages to the amount decreed, no error in law is shown in \u00bfhe decree; and it is not open to revision by this court in matter of fact.
