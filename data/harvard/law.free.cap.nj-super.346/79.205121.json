Klagholz, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 181-84, 771 A.2d 603 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>84, 784 A.2d 717 (2001); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-1.1 to 10.1. <em>See also R. </em>2:11-4(a); <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(8) (permitting counsel fees \u201cwhere counsel fees are permitted by statute\u201d). The motion has been fully briefed and was argued telephonically. We conclude that counsel fees are available under the governing statute to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in a regulatory action such as this case; that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>598, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), applies to preclude counsel fees for the fifteen amendments the State Board made without a court judgment or consent order; and that appellants may recover as the \u201cprevailing party,\u201d because they prevailed in their attack upon eight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>sixty regulations they challenged. <em>Baer v. Klagholz, supra, </em>339, <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194-96, 227-28, 771 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Appellants\u2019 challenge was premised on the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1400 to 1487, <em>see Baer v. Klagholz, supra, </em>at 190, 771 A.2d 603, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">In any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">[20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Although neither party nor the court can find any case directly on point, we conclude that -the statute applies to a regulatory challenge as well as an action seeking specific relief under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">There is no dispute parents who bring suit on behalf of their children can be \u201cprevailing parties\u201d eligible to recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See, e.g., John T. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>258 F.3d 860, 863-64 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Lucht v. Molalla River School Dist., </em>225 F.3d 1023, 1026 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B),(E) (referring to parents as the recipients of the award). We believe that a successful challenge to the regulations can also be a basis for the award of fees since the statute was designed to protect children covered by IDEA and \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) relates to actions under \u00a7 1415. <em>See J.H.R. v. Bd. of Educ. of Tp. of E. Brunswick, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 111, 705 A.2d 766 (App.Div.1998); <em>see also Lucht, supra, </em>225 F.3d at 1027; <em>Beth V. v. Carroll, </em>87 F.3d 80, 88 (3d Cir.1996) (decided under earlier version of \u00a7 1415). Section 1415(i)(3)(B) authorizes fee awards \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding\u201d brought under \u00a7 1415, and appellants\u2019 challenge was brought under that section, which requires participating states to \u201cestablish and maintain procedures in accordance with [that] section.\u201d <em>See </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">Appellants claim that <em>Buckhannon </em>does not apply because the IDEA promotes settlements, the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d applies, and a contrary ruling would render 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(I)(3) meaningless. We agree with respondents, however, that <em>Buckhannon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>applies to this federal statute which gives rise to this application. Accordingly, we make no award for time spent that ultimately resulted in the Board making the fifteen amendments to the regulations without court order or consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>Buckhannon </em>held \u201cthat the \u2018catalyst theory is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the [Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA)], 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3613(c)(2), and [the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)], 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12205.\u201d 532 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1843, 149 L.Ed.2d at 866-67. The Court concluded that counsel fees may be awarded only on the basis of judgments on the merits and settlement agreements enforced through consent decrees. 532 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1840, 149 L.Ed.2d at 862-63; see <em>also J.S. v. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>165 <em>F.Supp. </em>2d 570, 574-77 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (settlement agreement absent a consent decree could not confer \u201cprevailing party\u201d status warranting the award of fees and expenses under the IDEA \u2014 applying <em>Buckhannon </em>retroactively); <em>Jose Luis R. v. Joliet Tp. H.S. Dist. 204, </em>No. 01-C-4798, 2001 <em>WL </em>1000734, at *1 (N.D.Ill. Aug.29, 2001) (an IDEA case in which the court found \u201cno language in <em>Buckhannon </em>suggesting the opinion is limited to ADA and FHAA cases\u201d as opposed to fee-shifting statutes in general, but concluding counsel fees were appropriate because the mediation agreement was like a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree). <em>Compare, e.g., Singer v. State, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>487, 492-95, 472 A.2d 138 (1984) (considering 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>832, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>121, 83 L.Ed.2d 64 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">We award counsel fees to appellants as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for the challenge to the eight regulations on which they prevailed before this court. In doing so, we must also consider the time and expenses devoted to both the successful and unsuccessful claims. We do not read <em>Buckhannon </em>as changing the criteria for an award which can be made when the claimant is partially successful. <em>See, e.g., John T., supra, </em>258 F.3d at 864-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">In <em>Y.O. v. New Britain Bd. of Educ., </em>1 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>133, 138 (D.Conn.1998), the court summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The legal standard for determining \u201cprevailing party\u201d status in an attorney fee action under the IDEA is the same as that governing the award of attorney fees in civil rights litigation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. <em>See Angela L. v. Pasadena Indep. School District, </em>918 F.2d 1188, 1193 (5th Cir.1990) (citing the legislative history of IDEA); <em>Barbara R. v. Tirozzi, </em>665 F.Supp. 141, 145 (D.Conn.1987). Under this standard, a party may be deemed \u201cprevailing\u201d if the party succeeds on \u201cany significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>accord Heldman v. Sobol, </em>846 F.Supp. 285, 288 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). The Supreme Court has explained that, in making this determination, a court must consider whether the plaintiff (1) obtained relief on a significant claim in litigation, (2) that effected a material alteration in the parties\u2019 legal relationship and (3) that is not merely technical or <em>de minimis </em>in nature. <em>Texas Teacher\u2019s Assoc. v. Garland Indep. School District, </em>489 U.S. 782, 791-93, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Blakey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>2 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>598 (D.N.J.1998), in which the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">In these types of cases where the claims are interrelated, a court should not attempt to identify specific hours spent on related, but unsuccessful claims and exclude them from the lodestar. <em>Johnson v. Orr, </em>897 F.2d 128, 132 (3d Cir.1990) (Becker, J., concurring). A court should instead focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation. <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435[, 103 S.Ct. 1933]. A reduced fee is appropriate if the relief, however significant, is limited in comparison to the scope of litigation as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 440[, 103 S.Ct. 1933]; <em>Rendine </em>[v. <em>Pantzer], </em>141 N.J. [292,] 337, 661 A.2d 1202 [(1995)]. \u201cA court must reduce the fee award if \u2018it concludes the benefits of the litigation were not substantial enough to merit the full amount of the lodestar.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonnell v. United States, </em>870 F.Supp. 576, 587 (D.N.J.1994) <em>(quoting Poston v. Fox, </em>577 F.Supp. 915, 921 (D.N.J.1984)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-0\">Continental\u2019s attempt to automatically exclude every expenditure on which Blakey was ultimately unsuccessful must be rejected. Hours may be reasonably expended on a reasonable strategy that simply does not succeed. \u201cThe mere failure of certain motions or the failure to use depositions is insufficient to warrant a fee reduction under <em>Hensley.\u2019\u2019 Blum v. Witco Chem. Corp., </em>829 F.2d 367, 378 (3d Cir.1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">[2 F.Supp.2d at 606-07.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The <em>Blakey </em>court concluded that given limited success, a thirty percent reduction in the lodestar figure was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">In <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>424, 440, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1933, 1943, 76 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 40, 52 (1983), the United States Supreme Court, in addressing counsel fees under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney\u2019s fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised. But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">[461 <em>U.S. </em>at 440, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1943, 76 L.Ed.2d at 54-55.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\"><em>See also Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 316, 336-37, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995) (permitting enhancement of \u201cthe lodestar fee\u201d determined by multiplying the hours \u201creasonably expended\u201d by the \u201creasonable hourly rate\u201d \u201cin cases in which the prevailing party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee arrangement was predominately contingent on a successful result,\u201d or contingent fee, but stating \u201ca trial court should reduce the lodestar fee if the level of success achieved in the litigation is limited as compared to the relief sought\u201d); <em>Public Interest Research Group of N.J., Inc. v. Windall, </em>51 F.3d 1179, 1189-1190 (3d Cir.1995) (requiring reduction of \u201clodestar\u201d for excessive and unnecessary work and then a qualitative evaluation of fee for public interest group including exclusion of \u201csome or all of the time spent on unsuccessful claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">There is no challenge to the hourly rate or total hours worked by appellants\u2019 counsel, or to their stated expenses. Nor is there a contest to the fact that \u201c[t]he lodestar in this case is $339,887.25.\u201d Respondents acknowledge that \u201c[a]ppellants were prevailing parties on eight of the sixty, or 13.33% of the regulations they challenged.\u201d Further, \u201c[r]espondents submit that, given the difficulty of identifying which time entries relate to which regulations, using the- proportion of appellants\u2019 success is a reasonable means of adjusting the fee request to exclude time spent on unsuccessful claims.\u201d Considering that no counsel fees may be awarded for the fifteen amendments that were made without court order or for the unsuccessful challenges, we award appellants $45,000 in counsel fees, plus the requested $7,137.12 in incurred expenses. As to the latter, <em>see B.K. v. Toms River Bd. of Educ., </em>998 <em>F.Supp. </em>462, 476 (D.N.J.1998), permitting recovery of expenses necessary for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>entire ease, in order to prevail on the issues involving the eight amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We grant counsel fees to plaintiffs in the amount of $45,000 and costs in the amount of $7,137.12.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
