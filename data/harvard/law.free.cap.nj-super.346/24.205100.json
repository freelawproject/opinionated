He is serving a term of twenty-three years pursuant to convictions for aggravated manslaughter and possession and distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. On July 7, 2000, Smith was transferred from Southern State Correctional Facility to South Woods State Prison as a result of a \u201ckeep separate\u201d order in his folder in relation to another inmate at Southern State Correctional Facility. Prior to his transfer, he qualified for and received \u201cfull minimum custody status.\u201d <em>See N.J.AC. 10A:9-4.3(e).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After his transfer to South Woods State Prison, the prison\u2019s Institutional Classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Committee reviewed Smith\u2019s status, and as a result, he was \u201creverted\u201d to \u201cgang minimum custody status.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.3(d). Stanley Nunn, the administrator of the facility, reviewed the determination, concluding that Smith was not eligible for \u201cfull minimum custody status\u201d at South Woods State Prison because his conviction was for aggravated manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">After this appeal was filed, James Finger, Assistant Superintendent assigned to Facility 2 of South Woods State Prison, submitted an affidavit in which he amplifies the reasons for increasing Smith\u2019s custody status. There, Finger states that Smith \u201cwas reviewed by the Facility 2 Classification Committee and reverted to Gang Minimum Custody from Full Minimum Custody in accordance with established guidelines, due to the nature of his present offense.\u201d Finger explains that because the prison is within a residential area of the City of Bridgeport, \u201cit would be a threat to the safety and security of the community to have inmates convicted of Aggravated Manslaughter residing outside the secure perimeter of the institution.\u201d In contrast, Southern State Correctional Facility is in a rural area.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On appeal, Smith makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">THE INCREASE IN APPELLANT\u2019S CUSTODY LEVEL IS CONTRARY TO <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9\u20144.5(e), 10A:4-3.1(a), AS WELL AS THIS STATE\u2019S FAIRNESS &amp; RIGHTNESS DOCTRINE, THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, AND RESULTS IN VIOLATIONS OF APPELLANT\u2019S SUBSTANTIVE &amp; PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMEND. XIV, <em>N.J. CONST. </em>ART. I, \u00b6 1. (Partially raised below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">THE APPELLANT HAS A LIBERTY INTEREST IN MAINTAINING FULL MINIMUM STATUS AND THE ACTIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS VIOLATED APPELLANTS\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE <em>U.S. CONST. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>AMEND. XIV, <em>N.J. CONST. </em>ART. I, \u00b6 1, AND N.J. FAIRNESS &amp; RIGHTNESS DOCTRINE. (Raised below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">It is well-settled that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution does not give prisoners a liberty interest in remaining free from transfers to more restrictive facilities. <em>See, e.g., Jenkins v. Fauver, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>239, 249, 528 A.2d 563 (1987) (citing <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>215, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976) and <em>Montanye v. Haymes, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>236, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2543, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>466 (1976)). Applying this principle to Smith\u2019s transfer, we are satisfied that Smith had no liberty interest in remaining at Southern State Correctional Facility. Likewise, Smith had no liberty interest in retaining \u201cfull minimum custody status.\u201d Nonetheless, Smith contends that the transfer was fundamentally unfair because, although he is permitted to work outside the prison facility, the increase in custody status requires him to reside within its perimeters. He admits, however, that he has not lost any work credit as a result of the increased custody status.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>472, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), the United States Supreme Court held that a change in a prisoner\u2019s conditions of confinement does not trigger the need for due process safeguards unless the change imposes \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d 515 <em>U.S. </em>at 484, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2300, 132 L.Ed.2d at 430. \u201cNew Jersey follows the <em>Sandin </em>test in circumstances involving a change in custody status.\u201d <em>Muhammad v. Balicki, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 372, 743 A.2d 376 (App.Div.2000). We agree with the Department of Corrections that the residential restriction does not constitute \u201ca significant hardship,\u201d triggering safeguards under the Due Process Clause. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In addition, under State law, the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections has complete discretion in determining an inmate\u2019s place of confinement, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-91.2. <em>See Hluchan v. Fauver, </em>480 <em>F.Supp. </em>103, 108 (D.N.J.1979) (observing that inmates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>have no liberty right to be assigned to any particular custody level); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-10a (sentences of one year or longer are \u201cto the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections\u201d). Indeed, under New Jersey law, a reduction in custody status is a matter of privilege, not of right. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.2. Classification of prisoners and the decision as to what privileges they will receive rests solely within the discretion of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:1B-6; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-91.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In its brief, the Department of Corrections relies on <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.5(e)(5) to support its decision to \u201crevert\u201d Smith to \u201cgang minimum custody status\u201d from \u201cfull minimum custody status.\u201d That regulation provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">[a]n inmate who has been granted reduced custody status may have his or her custody status increased for ... [a]ny reason which, in the opinion of the Superintendent and Institutional Classification Committee, relates to the best interests of the inmate or the safe, orderly operation of the correctional facility or the safety of the community or public at large.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">As previously noted, upon his transfer to South Woods State Prison, according to Assistant Superintendent Finger, Smith was denied reduced status because of public safety concerns arising out of the nature of his aggravated manslaughter conviction and the location of the prison within a residential community. In contrast, Administrator Nunn attributed the denial solely to his homicide<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The Department\u2019s regulation establishing categories of inmates excluded from eligibility for reduced custodial status does not include inmates serving sentences for \u201chomicide,\u201d <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9\u20144.8; <em>see also Jenkins, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 254-55, 528 A.2d 563 (observing that only sex offenders, arsonists, and escapees are excluded from consideration for reduced custody status and recognizing that the regulations do not disqualify an inmate convicted of homicide from such consideration). Hence, Smith could not be disqualified under the regulations for consideration for \u201cfull mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>mum custody status\u201d solely because of his conviction for aggravated manslaughter. Indeed, in rejecting Smith\u2019s appeal from the Institutional Classification Committee\u2019s decision denying him \u201cfull minimum custody status,\u201d the administrator indicated that Smith might achieve such status through participation in a program referred to as NuWay, and that he had referred Smith\u2019s name \u201cto Social Services to conduct an ASI scoring on [him] to determine [his] eligibility for that program.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, Nunn commended Smith for his past \u201cpositive institutional adjustment\u201d and encouraged him to continue to \u201cmake progress that can be considered at your next classification review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">From these remarks, we understand that the Institutional Classification Committee does not view Smith as permanently disqualified from consideration for reduced custody status by virtue of his homicide conviction which apparently triggered its public, safety concerns as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.5(e)(5). Indeed, the Department of Corrections\u2019s brief on appeal indicates as much. It explains that \u201ccustody status\u201d decisions are made by the Institutional Classification Committee \u201cpursuant to its consideration of a list of 21 factors including correctional facility adjustment, drug dependency and/or involvement, or any other factor pertinent to the inmate\u2019s case [citing <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.3(a) which lists twenty-one factors with respect to assignments pertaining to custody status, among other assignments].\u201d We also note that the regulations mandate review dates \u201cno more than 12 months from the date of initial classification,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.5(a), and that an inmate may submit a request for reassignment in the area of custody status at that time, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We make these observations to clarify the basis for our affirmance. First, we do not view the Assistant Superintendent\u2019s decision as denying Smith\u2019s application for \u201cfull minimum custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>status\u201d as a final, immutable determination due to his aggravated manslaughter conviction and/or the location of the prison with a residential area. Indeed, we read the record and the regulations as envisioning continuous review of an inmate\u2019s custody status except in those limited circumstances we previously noted. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.8. Second, we are convinced that the Institutional Classification Committee did not abuse its discretion in initially withholding \u201cfull minimum custody status\u201d from Smith upon his transfer to South Woods State Prison based on the nature of his conviction and the safety concerns that his conviction initially generated, pending assessment of his adjustment and other factors pertinent to incarceration at South Woods State Prison. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.3(a)(6) (in making determinations on transfers or assignments to custody status, the Institutional Classification Committee shall consider \u201c[cjorrectional facility adjustment\u201d). Nor, as we previously observed, did the decision to increase his custody status violate due process of law or offend notions of administrative fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">However, in future reviews of Smith\u2019s custody status, the Superintendent and the Institutional Classification Committee must consider all of the factors pertinent to Smith\u2019s status in making its decision to maintain him at a reduced custody status. Although the Attorney General\u2019s brief claims that was done, the Administrator\u2019s decision and the affidavit of the Assistant Superintendent suggest otherwise. Neither the nature of an inmate\u2019s conviction, except for those offenses specifically excluded for eligibility in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.8, nor the location of a correctional facility within a residential area alone, may permanently disqualify an inmate from consideration for \u201cfull minimum custody status.\u201d We believe that by adopting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.5(e)(5), which allows the Superintendent and the Institutional Classification Committee to increase the custody of an inmate who has been granted reduced custody status, \u201cfor any reason which, in the opinion of the Superintendent and Institutional Classification Committee relates to ... the safety of the community or public at large,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Department of Corrections did not intend to give the Superintendent and Institutional Classification Committee unbridled discretion to make that determination. That discretion must be circumscribed by the twenty-one factors found in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-3.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision to increase Smith\u2019s custody status to \u201cgang minimum\u201d following his transfer from Southern State Correctional Facility to South Woods State Prison. We offer no view concerning Smith\u2019s qualification for reduced custody status resulting from any future reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-13\"> Inmates classified as \"full minimum custody status\u201d are those assigned to work details, jobs or programs outside the main correctional facility with minimal supervision, and/or a satellite unit or minimum security trailer unit. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.3(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-11\"> Inmates classified as \"gang minimum custody status\" may be assigned to activities or jobs that require them to move outside the security of the correctional facility but are under continuous supervision of a correction officer. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-4.3(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\"> Aggravated manslaughter is a criminal homicide. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 11-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\"> The record does not contain any reliable information with respect to this program.
