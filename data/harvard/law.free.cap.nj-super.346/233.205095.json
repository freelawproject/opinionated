For sentencing purposes, the two third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>degree offenses merged into the second-degree offense. Defendant was sentenced to a ten-year term and appropriate fees and penalties were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">POINT I IT WAS ERROR FOR THE COURT TO CONDUCT THE TRIAL IN DEFENDANT\u2019S ABSENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">POINT II TESTIMONY OF POLICE OFFICER RAMOS AND INVESTIGATOR NICHOLAS WAS IMPROPER AND DEPRIVED THE DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">POINT III IT WAS ERROR FOR THE COURT TO COMPEL THE ONLY DEFENSE WITNESS, KIM HOUSTON TO TESTIFY IN HANDCUFFS[.] (Not raised below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">POINT IV IT WAS ERROR FOR THE COURT TO REFUSE DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUEST TO INSTRUCT THE JURY REGARDING PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS OF A WITNESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">POINT V THE DEFENDANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO MOVE FOR A NEW TRIAL PURSUANT TO <em>R. </em>3:20-2. (Not raised below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">POINT VI THE SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON THE DEFENDANT WAS EXCESSIVE AND SHOULD BE REDUCED. (Not raised below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The first issue raised is meritorious and requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. Defendant\u2019s trial was originally scheduled to begin on January 25, 2000. Defendant was aware of that and had apparently received appropriate notice. <em>See State v. Hudson, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>165, 574 A.2d 434 (1990). He had not, however, been told what would occur in the event of an adjournment or cancellation. As it turned out, the courts were closed on January 25 because of a snow storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">On the morning of January 26, defendant was not in court and the trial judge decided to go forward without him. The judge acknowledged that defendant had no actual notice that a trial postponed from the 25th would begin on the 26th, but she believed defendant should have assumed that or, at least, should have inquired about how the court planned to proceed. Defense counsel had not attempted to reach defendant because, based on what she knew of the judge\u2019s schedule, she thought the trial would not start on the 26th. She also said that typically it took her about twenty-four hours to get in touch with the defendant. The judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>staff attempted to locate defendant, but to no avail. Over the objection of defense counsel, jury selection began without the defendant being present.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">After most of the jurors had been selected, defense counsel told the court at sidebar that she had been able to contact defendant and he would be in court at around 1:30 p.m., the end of the court\u2019s lunch break. Jury selection continued and was completed without defendant being present. He apparently arrived just as opening statements began, although the precise time of his arrival is not indicated in the record. The record also does not reflect any inquiry by the trial judge as to what def\u00e9ndant knew or assumed concerning a postponed or canceled start of trial or, indeed, why he was not present earlier on the 26th.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The law in this area was recently set forth by Justice LaVecehia in <em>State v. Whaley, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>94, 99-100, 773 A.2d 61 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">The United States and New Jersey Constitutions guarantee criminal defendants the right to confront witnesses against them. <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1, \u00a7 10. An essential element of that guarantee is the right of the accused to be present in the courtroom at every stage of the trial. <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>337, 338, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353, 356 (1970) (citing <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>146 <em>U.S. </em>370, 13 <em>S.Ct </em>136, 36 <em>L.Ed. </em>1011 (1892)); <em>State v. Hudson, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>165, 171, 574 A.2d 434 (1990); <em>State v. Smith, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>561, 578, 150 A.2d 769, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 <em>U.S. </em>861, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>120, 4 L.Ed.2d 103 (1959). A criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial also is a condition of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that a defendant\u2019s absence would hinder a fair and just hearing. <em>Hudson, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 574 A.2d 434 (citing <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 <em>U.S. </em>97, 107-08, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 333, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>674, 679 (1934), <em>overruled on other grounds, Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>145, 88 <em>S.Ct </em>1444, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>491 (1968)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">We have held, consistent with the federal courts, that the right to be present at trial includes the right to be present during the impaneling of the jury. <em>State v. Dishon, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 687 A.2d 1074 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>144, 693 A.2d 112 (1997); <em>accord State v. Lomax, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 709 A.2d 277 (App.Div.1998) (defendant had right to be present when trial judge interviewed prospective jurors at sidebar).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\"><em>Rule </em>3:16 reflects the principles established in our case law. It states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The defendant shall he present at every stage of the trial, including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, unless otherwise provided by Rule. Nothing in this Rule, however, shall prevent a defendant from waiving the right to be present at trial. A waiver may be found either from (a) the defendant\u2019s express written or oral waiver placed on the record, or (b) the defendant\u2019s conduct evidencing a knowing, voluntary, and unjustified absence after (1) the defendant has received actual notice in court of the trial date, or (2) trial has commenced in defendant\u2019s presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\"><em>[R. </em>3:16(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In <em>Whaley, </em>the Court said that <em>R. </em>3:16(b), applied literally, requires in-court notification to defendant of the trial date to ensure actual notice before an inference may be drawn that there has been a knowing waiver. <em>Whaley, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 102, 773 A.2d 61. Here, there was no actual notice and no basis in our view to proceed with jury selection without the defendant. Moreover, there can be no credible argument for a finding of waiver. In addition to having no actual notice of the trial date, no inquiry was made as to why defendant was not timely present. <em>State v. Davis, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 416, 658 A.2d 303 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>376, 678 A.2d 716 (1996) (stating that the \u201ctrial judge should attempt to learn where the defendant is and why he is absent and make appropriate factual findings\u201d). Contrary to the trial court\u2019s statements, defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present during trial is not governed by a reasonable-person standard. As the Court said in <em>Hudson, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 182, 574 A.2d 434, and repeated in <em>Whaley, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 773 A.2d 61, \u201c[ajdequate notice to the defendant is an essential element of a knowing waiver of the right to attend trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In <em>State v. Sellars, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 121-122, 751 A.2d 151 (App.Div.2000), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">The right to be present should not be impaired as a form of punishment for disruption of the court\u2019s calendar or in the interest of moving old cases. Implementation of <em>R. </em>3:16(b) must be done carefully, in strict adherence to its terms and with sensitivity to the importance of the right being denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">These comments were noted with approval in <em>Whaley, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 773 A.2d 61. In our view, the absence of actual notice to defendant is conclusive and the judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Defendant\u2019s contention that it was error for the court to allow a defense witness to testify in handcuffs is also meritorious. The State\u2019s case was essentially that police officers had witnessed a hand-to-hand drug transaction with defendant as the seller. Just prior to defendant\u2019s arrest at the scene, he allegedly discarded a bag of drugs, but when searched he had no money on his person except some small change. At trial, defendant testified that he and his girlfriend, Kim Houston, had been in the neighborhood only to visit defendant\u2019s childhood friend. Houston was the only other defense witness. Essentially, she attempted to corroborate defendant\u2019s testimony, although she was not in the immediate vicinity when the alleged drug sale occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The problem is that Houston testified in handcuffs. The only explanation to the jury came in response to defense counsel\u2019s request that Houston explain why she was \u201cincarcerated in the Camden County Correctional Facility.\u201d Houston responded, \u201c[cjhild support. I was just released.\u201d She then added, \u201cI went to court just before I came here.\u201d There was no intervention, inquiry or cautionary instruction from the trial judge. There can be no doubt of the potential prejudice to a defendant when the only witness besides himself takes the stand in handcuffs and acknowledges a charge against her concerning \u201cchild support.\u201d The jury may even have assumed some sort of criminal conviction. Before Houston ever gave any substantive testimony, her credibility was improperly impugned.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The law on defendants being shackled in court is well-settled. <em>State v. Damon, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 669 A.2d 860 (App.Div.1996); <em>State v. Roberts, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 206 A.2d 200 (App.Div.1965). As a general rule, a defendant in a criminal case has the right to appear before the jury free from shackles or other physical restraints. <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>337, 344, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1057, 1061, 25 L.Ed.2d 353, 359 (1970). \u201cA defendant\u2019s freedom from handcuffs or shackles is important to his right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Damon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498, 669 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>860 (citing <em>State v. Jones, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>596, 599, 328 A.2d 41 (Law Div.1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">While shackling a defense witness is not the exact equivalent of shackling the defendant, in some circumstances, such as those presented here, the resulting prejudice can be equally detrimental. We have found no case law in New Jersey dealing with a shackled witness. The State in its brief candidly acknowledges that there are federal decisions holding that the prohibition on the use of physical restraints applies to defense witnesses as well as defendants. Thus, in <em>Harrell v. Israel, </em>672 F.2d 632 (7th Cir.1982), the Court held, \u201c[ejoncomitant to the defendant\u2019s right to appear before the jury without physical restraints is his right to have his witness appear that way also.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. And while the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that shackling defense witnesses may be less prejudicial to the accused than shackling defendants, because it does not directly affect a presumption of innocence, it nevertheless has the potential to harm the defendant by detracting from the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Ibid. </em>While there is some debate among the cases as to whether a due process consideration is involved when a witness is shackled, there is agreement regarding the potential prejudice inherent in such an appearance. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>1 <em>F.3d </em>1566, 1584 (11th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>1198, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1310, 127 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>660, and <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>1206, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1330, 127 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>677 (1994); Woods <em>v. Thieret, 5 </em>F.3d 244, 246-247 (7th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>522 <em>F.2d </em>666, 677 (D.C.Cir.1975); <em>People v. Ceniceros, </em>26 Cal.App.4th 266, 275-278, 31 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>303, 309-310 (1994); <em>State ex rel. McMannis v. Mohn, </em>163 <em>W.Va. </em>129, 254 <em>S.E.2d </em>805, 811 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>831, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>110, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>112 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In addition, the American Bar Association (ABA) has promulgated the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">(b) The court should not permit a defendant or <em>witness </em>to appear at trial in the distinctive attire of a prisoner, unless waived by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>(c) No defendant should be removed from the courtroom, nor should defendants and <em>witnesses </em>be subject to physical restraint while in court unless the court has found such restraint necessary to maintain order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">(d) ... Whenever physical restraint or removal of a defendant <em>or witness </em>occurs in the presence of jurors trying the ease, the court should instruct those jurors that such restraint or removal is not to be considered in assessing the proof and determining guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\"><em>[Control, Restraint or Removal of Defendants and Witnesses, </em>A.B.A. Standards for Criminal Justice 15-3.2 (3d ed.1996) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>See also State v. Jones, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 600, 328 A.2d 41 (citing tentative draft of this ABA standard for guidance, <em>Custody and Restraint of Defendants and Witnesses, </em>A.B.A. Projection Standards for Criminal Justice 4.1 (tentative draft 1968)); <em>State v. Jamaal W., </em>209 <em>W.Va. </em>1, 6, 543 S.E.2d 282, 287 (2000) (citing earlier version of this ABA standard, Standard 15-3.1 (2d ed.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">A trial court certainly has discretion to require or allow a defendant or witness to be shackled, but that determination must be made by balancing the need for courtroom security against the potential prejudice of the restraints. In <em>Damon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499, 669 A.2d 860, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">The trial judge\u2019s discretion to keep a defendant restrained is \u201csharply limited.\u201d <em>State v. Roberts, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 164, 206 A.2d 200 (App.Div.1965). There must be \u201csound reason\u201d for the exercise of this discretion and a \u201cstrong case of necessity.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge must hold a hearing, however informal, and state on the record out of the jury\u2019s presence his or her reasons for shackling the defendant, whether they are based on evidence from trial, information obtained from criminal records, or statements made by law enforcement officers. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 206 A.2d 200. Additionally, \u201c[i]n any case where the trial judge, in the exercise of sound discretion determines that the defendant must be handcuffed or shackled, it is of the <em>essence </em>that he instruct the jury in the clearest and most emphatic terms that it give such restraint no consideration whatever in assessing the proofs and determining guilt.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 168, 206 A.2d 200 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\"><em>See also United States v. Theriault, </em>531 F.2d 281, 285 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>898, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>262, 50 L.Ed.2d 182 (1976); <em>Harrell, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 636, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">In our view, a similar procedure should be used when the prospect arises that a defense witness will appear before the jury in physical restraints. We can hypothesize circumstances where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the defense witness is so peripheral to the defense that giving testimony while handcuffed would not constitute reversible error. <em>See Adams, supra, </em>1 <em>F.</em>3d at 1584; <em>United States v. Esquer, </em>459 F.2d 431, 433 (7th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>1006, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>366, 38 L.Ed.2d 243 (1973). However, such is not the situation in the present case. Here, defendant\u2019s only defense was that he was in the neighborhood for an innocent purpose. His only corroborating witness was his girlfriend. Although defense counsel did not object to the witness testifying in restraints, we find the potential prejudice to defendant so great that the trial court, absent a record demonstrating a threat of violence or other exceptional circumstances, should have sua sponte had the restraints removed. At the very least, the jury should have been instructed that such restraints have no bearing on the witness\u2019s credibility or the determination of defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>See People v. Duran, </em>16 Cal.3d 282, 291-292, 127 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>618, 545 P.2d 1322, 1328 (1976). The improper impairment of the witness\u2019s credibility by allowing her to testify in handcuffs constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The issues raised by defendant\u2019s contentions that police officers improperly gave expert testimony and that the court erroneously refused to give a jury instruction concerning prior inconsistent statements of a witness, do not have sufficient merit to rise to the level of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In light of our disposition, we do not reach defendant\u2019s contentions that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of a failure to move for a new trial or that his sentence was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
