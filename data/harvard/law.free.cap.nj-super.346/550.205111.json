We conclude that the UIM carrier should have been permitted to remain as a party to protect its liability exposure to the plaintiff. Because the judge prevented the UIM carrier from participating, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Plaintiff Mary Scheer commenced a personal injury automobile negligence action alleging that she was injured in a three car chain reaction collision on November 7, 1995. She contends she was waiting to make a left turn when her vehicle was struck in the rear by defendant Amy DiBenedetto\u2019s vehicle. Defendant DiBenedetto claims she was stopped behind plaintiffs vehicle when defendant Hugh P. Heagney\u2019s vehicle suddenly struck her vehicle forcing it into the rear of plaintiffs vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Defendant Heagney\u2019s automobile was covered by a liability policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company in the mandatory minimum amount of $15,000. .Plaintiff had liability and underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage of $1 million under a policy issued by the Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers). Defendant DiBenedetto also had liability coverage of $1 million under an automobile insurance policy issued by Providence Washington Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On December 16, 1999, the matter was submitted to court-sponsored non-binding arbitration. Plaintiff rejected the award and filed a demand for a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On January 13, 2000, plaintiff informed Travelers of her intention to pursue a UIM claim under the arbitration clause of her automobile liability insurance policy. A short time later, defendant Heagney offered to settle plaintiffs claims against him for the $15,000 coverage available under his insurance policy. Meanwhile, the court granted Travelers motion for leave to intervene in the personal injury action instituted by plaintiff. On June 2, 2000, Travelers advised plaintiff it did not oppose plaintiffs settlement with defendant Heagney for the $15,000 maximum coverage avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>able under his policy, and plaintiff accepted the settlement offer from Heagney, releasing him from further liability for the accident. Thereafter, a date was scheduled for trial on the issue of liability only.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On the trial date, plaintiff and defendant DiBenedetto moved informally to bar Travelers\u2019 continued participation in the liability trial. Plaintiff argued that Travelers had relinquished its right to proceed in defendant Heagney\u2019s shoes to prove defendant DiBenedetto\u2019s fault because it had not opposed plaintiffs settlement with defendant Heagney as it could have under <em>Longworth v. Van Houten, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 538 A.2d 414 (App.Div.1988). Plaintiff further argued that if Travelers were permitted to proceed in defendant Heagney\u2019s place, it would amount to an unfair \u201cdouble-team[ing]\u201d of two defense lawyers against her when she had anticipated that, by settling with defendant Heagney, she would only have one adversary at trial. Therefore, plaintiff maintained that had she known that Travelers would be asserting defendant Heagney\u2019s position against defendant DiBenedetto, she would not have settled her claims against Heagney. Defendant DiBenedetto also objected to Travelers participation in the trial claiming that it was plaintiff and Travelers that were \u201cdoubling-teaming\u201d against her and that plaintiffs interests were sufficiently protected by her attorney without Travelers\u2019 participation in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Citing <em>Zirger v. General Accident, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 341, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996), which recognized intervention as the appropriate vehicle for a UIM carrier to protect its interests at a damages trial, Travelers countered that the issues of liability and damages were so \u201cinterrelated, it would be totally inequitable\u201d not to allow it to participate in the liability portion of the case. Travelers explained that it \u201cwas not going to ... step into the shoes of the plaintiff and ... go after [the] third defendant [Heagney] for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>excess money, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d According to Travelers, its sole purpose in intervening was to try to reduce its liability exposure to plaintiff by establishing that defendant DiBenedetto was also at fault in the accident. Travelers further asserted that if it were permitted to continue in the case, plaintiff would not be prejudiced because she would still recover 100% of her damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Travelers explained that if the jury determined that defendant DiBenedetto had contributed to the accident, the percentage of fault attributed to DiBenedetto would be used to calculate the amount of damages her liability insurer would pay, thus reducing the underinsured portion of the damages for which Travelers would be responsible. That remaining percentage, of course, would be paid by Travelers in accordance with plaintiffs UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In sum, Travelers argued that it did not intervene in the case to establish defendant Heagney\u2019s liability in order to pursue his personal assets, because those were insulated from any further proceedings under the general release plaintiff had given Heagney. Rather, Travelers simply sought to protect its own liability exposure by seeking to demonstrate the co-defendant\u2019s negligent contribution to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Travelers also urged the court to devise a method by which it could participate in the trial which would not disclose its identity as an insurance carrier, but which would allow it to protect its liability exposure, suggesting the model offered by this court in <em>Wenz v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>570, 580, 720 A.2d 989 (App.Div.1998). In <em>Wenz, </em>we suggested that the carrier might be addressed as either \u201cdefendant,\u201d without further description, or by substituting the defendant\u2019s name. <em>Ibid. </em>In that way, Travelers maintained, the jury would not learn that it was an insurance company, a circumstance interdicted by our holding in <em>Wenz. Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The trial judge rejected Travelers\u2019 arguments and granted plaintiffs application to preclude Travelers from participating in the trial. The judge noted that there was no precedent for allowing a UIM carrier to participate in a liability trial after it had allowed a plaintiff to settle with one of the tortfeasors in a personal injury ease. He determined that allowing Travelers to step into the settled defendant\u2019s shoes would be against Travelers\u2019 own insured\u2019s interests, and would mislead the jury. He, therefore, concluded that Travelers \u201cgave up [its] right to represent the third car ... when [it] allowed the settlement to go through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">At trial, plaintiff first called defendant DiBenedetto as a witness who testified as to the happening of the accident. She stated that she was hit in the rear by defendant Heagney\u2019s vehicle and was catapulted into plaintiffs vehicle. Plaintiffs version was similar. Hence, the jury did not learn of the version of plaintiffs testimony at depositions which Travelers maintains was different from her trial testimony. At the end of plaintiffs case, defendant Dr .Benedetto moved for \u201ca directed verdict based upon the weight of the evidence [that] clearly shows that Mr. Heagney\u2019s vehicle was at fault and [defendant DiBenedetto] was at a complete stop when the accident occurred.\u201d When asked whether he opposed the motion, plaintiffs counsel stated only that plaintiff \u201ccan only defer to the evidence which Your Honor heard and let Your Honor make a decision.\u201d Thereafter the judge granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">On appeal, Travelers makes the same arguments it made to the motion judge. We agree with Travelers, reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial. Travelers was entitled to continue in the action to attempt to establish defendant DiBenedetto\u2019s liability for the happening of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 676 A.2d 1065, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[s]ubject to the discretionary authority of trial courts to resolve specific motions for intervention, ... [UIM] carriers ordinarily may intervene in their insured\u2019s actions against the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d In that case, the Court held the failure to do so would bar the UIM carrier from relitigating the issue in a different forum. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 676 A.2d 1065. Indeed, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>this case, a different judge had already granted Travelers\u2019 motion to intervene in plaintiffs personal injury action against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Defendant DiBenedetto had $1 million in liability coverage and plaintiff had $1 million in UIM coverage. Hence, DiBenedetto was not underinsured with respect to plaintiff because DiBenedetto\u2019s liability coverage was not less than plaintiffs UIM coverage. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(e). Only Heagney was underinsured with respect to plaintiff because his coverage did not exceed the mandatory minimum $15,000 in liability coverage. If it could be demonstrated that defendant DiBenedetto also had been negligent in operating her vehicle, her liability insurance would be \u201cavailable\u201d to plaintiff, <em>see Hreshko v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>104, 111, 766 A.2d 776 (App.Div.2001), and Travelers\u2019 UIM liability would be reduced. It was for that reason Travelers intervened in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The fact that plaintiff settled with defendant Heagney without Travelers opposing the settlement or seeking to become subrogated to plaintiffs rights against defendant Heagney is immaterial to the question whether Travelers should have been allowed to remain in the action. Travelers sought to pursue and establish defendant DiBenedetto\u2019s, not defendant Heagney\u2019s, liability. Indeed, Heagney\u2019s personal assets are insulated by the release given to him by plaintiff. That release, however, did not guarantee that plaintiff would have an unobstructed field in which to establish defendant Heagney as the <em>sole </em>responsible cause of the accident. When Travelers did not oppose plaintiffs settlement with defendant Heagney, that simply meant Travelers would not seek to be subrogated to plaintiffs rights against Heagney; it did not mean that Travelers was giving up its right to try to reduce its liability exposure to plaintiff for UIM damages with respect to defendant DiBenedetto\u2019s contributory negligence in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Indeed, plaintiff had little, if any, incentive to act vigorously to establish fault on the part of defendant DiBenedetto because plaintiff stood to recover 100% of the value of her claim for damages from Travelers under her $1 million UIM coverage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Further, by holding in DiBenedetto, plaintiff would be required to prove her damages through expert testimony, a more costly procedure in the Law Division than it is in UIM arbitration. That may be why plaintiff never mentioned at trial the fact that there actually had been two impacts during the accident. Nonetheless, we assume at some point in time plaintiff believed DiBenedetto had been at fault in the accident; otherwise, she would not have named DiBenedetto as a defendant. <em>See Hreshko, supra, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 766 A.2d 776 (noting that \u201ca claim must be filed in good faith and have an evidentiary and legal basis\u201d). In these circumstances, at least, Travelers was entitled to try to demonstrate defendant DiBenedetto\u2019s contributory fault, if any, to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Moreover, we agree with Travelers that plaintiff will not suffer any prejudice if Travelers is successful in reducing its liability exposure to plaintiff. If Travelers establishes that DiBenedetto was also at fault for the accident, then plaintiff will recover damages represented by that percentage of DiBenedetto\u2019s liability in the accident from DiBenedetto\u2019s liability carrier, with the remainder of her claim for damages to be paid by Travelers under plaintiffs UIM endorsement. On the other hand, there is potential for harm to Travelers if it is barred from trying to establish DiBenedetto\u2019s fault in the accident because it would not be able to relitigate the issue of liability in any future UIM arbitration proceeding. We assume it is for that reason that the other judge permitted Travelers to intervene in the first instance. <em>See Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 676 A.2d 1065 (noting that a UIM carrier may be barred from enforcing its arbitration clause if it does not exercise its right to intervene when given adequate notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Accordingly, we disagree that Travelers\u2019 participation is improperly adverse to its insured\u2019s interests. Nor do we perceive any unfairness in \u201ctwo lawyers ... [proceeding] against the middle car [DiBenedetto]\u201d in this case. Finally, we do not agree with the motion judge\u2019s concern that permitting Travelers to stand in defendant Heagney\u2019s shoes would improperly mislead the jury. Indeed, we suggested a similar resolution in <em>Wenz, supra, </em>316 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580, 720 A.2d 989. We continue to adhere to that suggestion as an appropriate mechanism for resolving Travelers\u2019 status at trial, especially where there appears to be disparate views as to the manner in which the accident occurred, and little incentive for plaintiff to pursue liability against defendant DiBenedetto. As the events suggest, neither the judge nor the jury heard the evidence concerning the number of impacts plaintiff\u2019s vehicle sustained during the accident. Without Travelers\u2019 participation in the trial, we cannot be certain that the liability question was properly resolved through a truly adversarial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial. The trial judge shall try the case on liability first. In the event defendant DiBenedetto is exonerated of any liability, plaintiff shall proceed to have the value of her damage claim against Travelers determined in a UIM arbitration proceeding. If, on the other hand, defendant DiBenedetto is found liable, to any extent, the case shall proceed forthwith to a trial on damages. Any UIM arbitration that has been scheduled shall be stayed pending further proceedings not inconsistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> According to the UIM carrier, the discovery conducted in the matter presented a disparate version of the accident than that presented by either plaintiff or DiBenedetto at trial. At trial, plaintiff testified as follows: \"Q: So all you know is you heard some screeching and you got hit? A: Correct.\u201d However, at plaintiff's deposition, she stated that there were two impacts: the first was with the DiBenedetto vehicle which was more severe than the second impact which was with the Heagney vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> The record is silent on the issue, but we assume the matter was bifurcated because plaintiff sought to avoid the expense of producing a damage expert or experts, anticipating a dismissal in favor of DiBenedetto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> It is undisputed that plaintiff was not at fault in the happening of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
