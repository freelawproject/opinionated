FISHER, Jr., J.S.C.</author>\n<p id=\"AZr\">(temporarily assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">One month after entry of the divorce judgment, Lynn Mamolen (\u201cLynn\u201d) applied for permission to relocate to Lutherville, Maryland with the three children of her marriage to Lon Mamolen (\u201cLon\u201d). After a seven-day hearing, the trial court rejected that application, finding the parties were in a joint custody relationship which avoided the traditional standards applied in such matters. Because the evidential record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding of a joint custodial relationship, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with the methodology for considering removal of children from the jurisdiction as outlined in <em>Baures v. Lewis, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>91, 770 A.2d 214 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Supreme Court recently analyzed, once again, the proper approach to be taken when a divorced parent seeks to permanently remove the children of the marriage from the State. In <em>Baures v. Lewis, </em>the Court recognized that the seminal question is whether \u201cit is a removal case or whether by virtue of the arrangement between the parties, it is actually a motion for a change in custody.\u201d If the parties\u2019 situation presents a true shared custodial relationship, then the right to remove a child, or children, from the jurisdiction requires a determination of whether there should be a change in the custodial arrangement. If, however, the custodial relationship is of the type more commonly found in most post-divorce situations \u2014 where one parent has the larger share of physical custody of the children \u2014 then the right to remove follows the process which has evolved from <em>Cooper v. Cooper, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>42, 491 A.2d 606 (1984), to <em>Holder v. Polanski, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>344, 544 A.2d 852 (1988), and lastly to <em>Baures v. Lewis.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In essence, the right to remove when there is a true joint custody relationship turns on the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child, or children. When, however, there is some lesser shared relationship, then the right is governed by the \u201ctemplate\u201d and the numerous factors set forth in <em>Baures. </em>This latter process includes the moving party\u2019s demonstration of a \u201cgood faith reason for the move and that the child will not suffer from it,\u201d and then a demonstration by the opposing party that the move is \u201ceither not in good faith or inimical to the child\u2019s interest.\u201d 167 <em>N.J. </em>at 118-19, 770 A.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Experience informs that the ultimate outcome of such matters often turns on the placing of the burden of persuasion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the question of whether a parenting relationship is truly shared has a significant impact on whether a parent will be permitted to remove a child from the jurisdiction. In recognizing that the <em>Cooper/Holder </em>analysis is inapplicable to a true shared custodial relationship, in <em>Baures </em>our Supreme Court expressly stated its agreement with <em>Voit v. Voit, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 721 A.2d 317 (Ch.Div.1998), where the parties\u2019 parenting relationship negated the relevance of the \u201csincere, good faith reasons\u201d of the parent seeking removal and permission to remove turned on the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children. 167 <em>N.J. </em>at 114-15, 770 A.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Because the trial court determined that the present situation is similar to <em>Voit </em>and the <em>Cooper/Holder </em>analysis inapplicable, our review of the trial court\u2019s denial of removal must initially focus on whether the Mamolens\u2019 relationship to each other and their children constitutes a true joint custodial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In considering the nature of the custodial relationship in this case, it is helpful but not conclusive to examine how the relationship was fixed by the judgment of divorce. In this case, the parties settled their custodial disputes by way of a separation agreement. The Mamolens agreed they would have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">joint custody of the children bom of the marriage with the Wife designated as the Parent of Primary Residence (PPR). The Husband shall be designated as the Parent of Alternate Residence (PAR). The children will spend alternate weekends with the Husband with the beginning and ending of the weekend to be agreed upon by the parties. Weekend parenting time shall consist of three (3) consecutive overnights, either Friday, Saturday and Sunday, or Thursday, Friday and Saturday. In addition to weekend parenting, the children may spend one (1) over-night every other week with the Husband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The parties also agreed to alternate significant holidays and \u201cgrant[ed] the other a right of first refusal of additional parenting with the children in the event that either parent, or a member of his/her immediate family (e.g. the children\u2019s grandparent or future stepparent) is unable to personally provide care to the children for 12 hours or more during the normal parenting schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Their separation agreement also states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">The Husband and Wife shall keep open communications between themselves and the children to share information concerning the health and educational progress of each of the children, and to permit the children to communicate freely with the other parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In short, the parties agreed to an arrangement whereby the children would spend alternating weekends and one overnight every other week \u2014 approximately 29% of their time \u2014 with Lon.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The findings of the trial judge do not suggest that this arrangement changed through any subsequent course of conduct. The only change observed by the trial judge related to an improvement in the quality of the relationship between Lon and the children. We understand the trial judge\u2019s findings as being more aligned with Dr. Fred Gross, Lon\u2019s expert, than Dr. Jane Rittmayer, Lynn\u2019s expert.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since Dr. Gross recognized Lynn as the \u201cprimary caretaker\u201d of the two younger children, the trial court\u2019s finding of a joint custodial relationship is inconsistent, at least with regard to the two younger children, with the trial judge\u2019s other findings. Notwithstanding this internal inconsistency, the trial judge\u2019s other findings of fact do not support the ultimate determination that this case presents a joint custodial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We initially state our agreement with the trial judge that defining the true essence of a custodial relationship does not turn on the labels utilized by the parties. It has long been de rigueur for divorcing parents to recite in their separation agreements that they will share \u201cjoint custody\u201d of their children. Such was the case here. However, such labels do not provide conclusive proof of the relationship\u2019s inherent nature. Our family courts are courts of equity and are bound not by the form of agreements, only substance. <em>See, e.g., Applestein v. United Bd. &amp; Carton Corp., </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 348, 159 A.2d 146 (Ch.Div.) (\u201cThe courts of equity in New Jersey, and elsewhere, have never hesitated to look behind the form of a particular ... transaction\u201d and determine that it is something else \u201cregardless of its deceptive outward appearance\u201d), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>72, 161 A2d 474 (1960). In short, while the terms of the parties\u2019 separation agreement might be probative of their intentions, a court of equity is not only freed from but obligated to determine the true nature of the relationship regardless of labels and artificial descriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In fact, in the landmark decision of <em>Pascale v. Pascale, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>583, 660 A.2d 485 (1995), the parties also entered into an agreement to share joint legal custody of their children. The Court found it not to be so. Redefining the terms then utilized commonly in our family courts, the <em>Pascale </em>Court \u201cdiscard[ed]\u201d the term \u201cjoint custody\u201d and \u201crecommend[ed] that in the future parties differentiate between the terms \u2018legal custody\u2019 and \u2018physical custody\u2019 in defining their status and the forms of relief that they are seeking from the court.\u201d 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 595, 660 A.2d 485. Notwithstanding, the term \u201cjoint custody\u201d continues to be used at times without differentiating from \u201clegal custody\u201d and \u201cphysical custody.\u201d Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In providing guidance for such undefined situations, the <em>Pascale </em>Court reiterated its earlier decision in <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>480, 487, 432 A.2d 63 (1981), declaring that the concept of \u201cjoint custody\u201d encompasses both legal and physical custody. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>defined joint \u201clegal\u201d custody as meaning the \u201cauthority and responsibility for making \u2018major\u2019 decisions regarding the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d Joint \u201cphysical\u201d custody was defined as constituting joint responsibility for minor day-to-day decisions and \u201cthe exertion of continuous physical custody by both parents over a child for significant periods of time.\u201d 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 596, 660 A.2d 485. Recognizing also that joint legal custody is common but joint physical custody rare, it is important to focus on the physical custody aspect of the arrangement. In this case, the trial judge found it to be \u201can artificial analysis\u201d which merely counts the days the children are with each parent. While we recognize that it is both impractical and undesirable to attempt to create a bright-line rule, we find the trial court\u2019s disregard for this factor to\u2019 be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In <em>Pasc\u00f3le, </em>the Court described joint physical custody by referring to typical examples such as \u201cspending three entire days with one parent and four entire days with another parent or alternating weeks or even years with each parent.\u201d 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 596-97, 660 A.2d 485. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">the import from the voluminous literature on the subject is that \u201cjoint physical custody\u201d means that the child lives day in and day out with both parents on a rotating basis. Numerous \u201cparenting times\u201d with a child do not constitute joint physical custody; to constitute joint custody, each parent must exert joint legal and physical custody over the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">[140 <em>N.J. </em>at 597, 660 A.2d 485.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Accordingly, while a court may look past labels and imprecise language utilized to describe a custodial arrangement, the element of time is of critical importance in determining the presence of joint physical custody. The trial judge\u2019s rejection of the importance of the parties\u2019 division of time with their children was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">As noted earlier, the parties\u2019 agreement called for the children to be with Lon only for three \u201covernights\u201d every other weekend and one other \u201covernight\u201d every fortnight. That is, the children are overnight in Lon\u2019s home four nights out of every fourteen, <em>i.e., </em>approximately 29% of the time. We, too, reject the notion that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>particular custodial arrangement includes joint physical custody once it passes a particular time line. But we must embrace what <em>Pasc\u00f3le </em>has said; that joint physical custody means something far closer to 50% than what is presented here. Since <em>Baures </em>found the example of <em>Voit </em>to be an acceptable paradigm of the exceptional case which avoids <em>Cooper/Holder, </em>a closer examination of the facts and the thoughtful opinion of Judge Michael Brooke Fisher in <em>Voit </em>is helpful in understanding the importance of the time element in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The Voits were well traveled. They met while both attended the University of Rochester in New York. They married while Dr. Voit was in medical school in Rochester and, after his internship, they moved to Oregon where Dr. Voit secured a surgical residency in general orthopaedies. Their only child, Garet, was born in Oregon. A few years later, they moved to New Mexico so Dr. Voit could pursue a one-year fellowship in hand and micro-vascular surgery. By this time, however, their marriage was on shaky ground. While in New Mexico, Mrs. Voit obtained a separate residence. Notwithstanding, from the beginning of their separation they both attempted to maximize the time Garet spent with the other as opposed to third-party caretakers. Their separation agreement provided for \u201cjoint legal and physical custody\u201d and imposed an obligation that they \u201cmutually consult and agree on major matters including living arrangements.\u201d 317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 109, 721 A.2d 317. The agreement also provided that Dr. Voit would have Garet in his care each week from Thursday evening at 6 p.m. through Monday morning at 9 a.m., <em>i.e., </em>50% of the time. The parties also acknowledged they \u201cconsistently deviated from any set schedule so as to maximize Garet\u2019s time with each party,\u201d but \u201calways maintained a close parity in the time that they spen[t] with Garet.\u201d 317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 109-110, 721 A.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The Voits thereafter moved to New Jersey in 1996 where Dr. Voit joined a medical office engaged in orthopaedics. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>though they were still finalizing their divorce at that time, the Voits cooperated with respect to the move to New Jersey; in fact, Mrs. Voit visited New Jersey in advance and helped select both parties\u2019 future residences. In 1999, Dr. Voit decided he was unhappy with his career and sought employment with a teaching hospital. Eventually, he located what he viewed as a superior job opportunity at the University of Arizona, thus giving rise to his application for permission to remove Garet from New Jersey to Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Voits had continued their shared parental relationship throughout their separation. At their hearing, it was stipulated that both Voits \u201chave equal parenting skills and that the child is bonded equally well to both\u201d; Judge Fisher also \u201cwas impressed with the ability of the parties in the past to cooperate to a remarkable degree in order to achieve the best for their child\u201d and \u201c[a]s a result of that cooperation, each is intimately and equally involved with their child on virtually a daily basis and the child is ... \u2018thriving, well-adjusted and happy.\u2019 \u201d 317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 114\u2014 15, 721 A.2d 317. As a result, it was determined that \u201clegal and physical custody\u201d of Garet was \u201ctruly shared\u201d and because of the \u201cunique facts\u201d presenting this \u201ctotally shared-parenting arrangment,\u201d <em>Voit </em>was found to present a situation which avoided the traditional <em>Cooper/Holder </em>approach. 317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106, 721 A.2d 317. <em>See also, Chen v. Heller, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 759 A.2d 873 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">As we have observed, the trial judge appropriately discarded the impact of the labels used by the parties, but erroneously neglected the importance of the division of time in the custodial arrangement. The trial judge focused on the emotional relationship as being critical. While this factor has importance, we find the trial judge\u2019s sole reliance on this factor to be erroneous. Indeed, if an emotional tie between the children and the parent seeking to prevent their removal from the State was the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>critical factor in ascertaining the true nature of the custodial relationship \u2014 which is what we understand the trial court concluded \u2014 the <em>Voit </em>exception would expand to most every custodial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We also find the trial court\u2019s failure to consider the nature of the relationship between these divorced parents erroneous. As we emphasized recently, \u201cthe allocation of the amount of time each parent spends with the child is not the sole basis for determining whether the parties should share \u2018joint legal custody of their child.\u201d <em>Nufrio v. Nufrio, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 549-50, 775 A.2d 637 (App.Div.2001). Rather, along with a consideration of the elements of joint legal and physical custody, we emphasized in <em>Nufrio </em>that \u201cthe prime criteria for establishing a joint legal custodial relationship ... centers on the ability of those parents to agree, communicate and cooperate in matters relating to the health, safety and welfare of the child notwithstanding animosity or acrimony they may harbor towards each other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 775 A.2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The trial judge centered his findings almost entirely upon the advances made by Lon in his parenting skills, his increased involvement in the school and extra-curricular activities of the children, and the close relationship and bonds that exist among Lon and the children. The trial judge\u2019s findings do not suggest the existence of joint decision-making and cooperation between Lon and Lynn regarding the welfare of the children. The record, in fact, demonstrates a particular lack of any sharing by both Lon and Lynn in decision-making concerning the children. The absence of such evidence further demonstrates the absence of a <em>Voit</em>like custodial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Further error can be found in the conclusions of the trial judge in over-emphasizing the relationship between parent and child which has a lesser, different role in removal actions than in custody disputes. As the Court said in <em>Baures:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">When initial custody is decided, either by judicial ruling or by settlement, the ultimate judgment is squarely dependent on what is in the child\u2019s best interests. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Whoever can better advance the child\u2019s interests will be awarded the status of custodial parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">Removal is quite different. In a removal case, the parents\u2019 interests take on importance. However, although the parties often do not seem to realize it, the conflict in a removal ease is not purely between the parents\u2019 needs and desires. Rather, it is a conflict based on the extent to which those needs and desires can be viewed as intertwined with the child\u2019s interests. <em>Copper, </em>and more particularly, <em>Holder, </em>recognize that subtlety by according special respect to the liberty interests of the custodial parent to seek happiness and fulfillment because that parent\u2019s happiness and fulfillment enure to the child\u2019s benefit in the new family unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">[167 <em>N.J. </em>at 115-16, 770 A.2d 214 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion mistakenly found the relationship between Lon and the children pivotal, whereas, as the Court in <em>Baures </em>observed, the parents\u2019 interests, and the relationship of those interests to the children, take on greater importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">It is abundantly clear that <em>Voit </em>presents a rare instance of \u201cjoint legal custody.\u201d Six years ago in <em>Pascale, </em>the Court examined empirical evidence which demonstrated the uniqueness of \u201cjoint legal custody.\u201d The Court noted that a true shared custodial relationship was found to exist in only ten percent of custody agreements in Massachusetts and was \u201crare both in Vermont and New Hampshire.\u201d 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 596, 660 A.2d 485. The Court also concluded that its \u201creview of New Jersey cases leads us to believe that \u2018joint physical custody\u2019 is as rare here as it is in other states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 660 A.2d 485. Indeed, our experience similarly informs us that the type of custody arrangement described in <em>Voit </em>is rare and that the Mamolens\u2019 custodial relationship, wherein Lynn is clearly the primary physical caretaker, is quite common and represents the large majority of custody relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">We therefore find the trial court\u2019s attempt to squeeze this custodial relationship into the narrow <em>Voit </em>exception additionally mistaken for the reason that it would, if upheld, utterly eviscerate <em>Cooper/Holder/Baures. We </em>cannot imagine the Supreme Court intended the removal procedures it has repeatedly declared would only be applied in such a small subset of cases or that the <em>Voit </em>exception (which the Court expressly embraced in Baures) would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>be allowed to swallow the procedures so carefully honed from <em>Cooper </em>to <em>Holder </em>to <em>Baures. </em>Accordingly, we reverse the order of May 2, 2001 which denied Lynn\u2019s application for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We remand the matter to the trial court to reconsider the evidence that was previously adduced and to also provide the parties with the opportunity to submit such additional evidence as may be warranted in light of our opinion and in light of the passage of time. Because the evidence does not support a finding of a joint custody relationship, the' matter of removal must be considered against the \u201ctemplate\u201d set forth by the Court in <em>Baures. </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 116-23, 770 A.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The order of May 2, 2001 is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\"> The restriction on a parent removing a child of divorce from the jurisdiction comes from the Legislature. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-2 states, \"When the Superior Court has jurisdiction over the custody and maintenance of the minor children of parents divorced, separated or living separate, and such children are natives of this State, or have resided five years within its limits, they shall not be removed out of its jurisdiction against their own consent, if of suitable age to signify the same, nor while under that age without the consent of both parents, unless the court, upon cause shown, shall otherwise order.\u201d What constitutes sufficient cause for removal was left to be defined by the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> The <em>Baures </em>Court recognized that the burden on a custodial parent in seeking to remove a child from the jurisdiction is not \"particularly onerous.\" 167 <em>N.J. </em>at 118, 770 A.2d 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\"> The trial judge's written findings consist of an outline of the testimony of the lay and expert witnesses and then concluded: \"Therefore, the court rejects Dr. Rittmayer's description as Mr. Mamolen being merely a visiting parent.' <em>In light of all of the above, </em>the court concludes that Mr. Mamolen is a true joint custodial parent\u201d (emphasis added).
