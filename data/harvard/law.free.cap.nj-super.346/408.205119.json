Based upon her prior convictions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5, she was sentenced to the presumptive extended term of four years along with a mandatory eighteen-month parole ineligibility term. Appropriate fines and penalties also were imposed. Defendant\u2019s only argument on appeal is that her motion to suppress should have been granted because her parole officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Defendant was on parole as a result of a prior sentence on a school zone drug offense, and her parole officer made a routine home visit. While they were discussing defendant\u2019s next court appearance, a question arose as to the scheduled date of that appearance. Defendant volunteered to go into her bedroom to get the paperwork that would confirm the date. The parole officer began to follow defendant to her bedroom and noticed that defendant appeared nervous. The officer inquired about the whereabouts of defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s baby, who apparently lived in the same home. When defendant denied that the baby was in her bedroom, despite the fact that the officer could see the child there, the officer\u2019s suspicions were aroused. She then noticed a crumpled brown paper bag, open at the top. Recognizing that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>bag frequently was used as a container for drugs, and knowing defendant\u2019s history, the parole officer picked up the bag, looked inside, and saw nineteen baggies of suspected marijuana. A laboratory test confirmed that the baggies contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:26-6.3(a) permits a parole officer to conduct a search of a parolee\u2019s residence when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">1. There is a reasonable suspicion to believe that evidence of a violation of a condition of parole would be found in the residence or contraband which includes any item that the parolee cannot possess under the conditions of parole is located in the residence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">2. The search is approved by the parole officer\u2019s supervisor or circumstances exist which require immediate action without prior approval from the supervisor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d has been defined by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:26-1.3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d means a belief that an action is necessary based upon specific and articulable facts that, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably support a conclusion such as that a condition of parole has been or is being violated by a parolee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">A parolee is required to sign a promise \u201cto abide by specific conditions of parole ... [which] shall include ... a requirement that the parolee ... [comply] with all laws and refrain from committing any crime....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-123.59b. The record does not include a copy of defendant\u2019s signed agreement to the conditions of parole. However, we infer that she would not have been released on parole had she not agreed to those conditions. There can be no dispute that possession of marijuana, like all criminal conduct, constitutes a violation of the conditions of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">In <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>868, 107 <em>S.Ct </em>3164, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>709 (1987), the Supreme Court held that probation officers\u2019 warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s home, based upon a tip from police, and pursuant to a Wisconsin administrative regulation allowing a warrantless search where \u201creasonable grounds\u201d exist to believe in the presence of contraband, satisfied the Fourth Amendment. In reaching its decision, the Court compared \u201c[a] State\u2019s operation of a probation system [to] its operation of a school, government office or prison, or its supervision of a regulated industry [in that] \u2018special needs\u2019 beyond normal law enforcement ... may justify departures from the usual warrant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>probable-cause requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 873-74, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3168, 97 L.Ed.2d at 717. Such \u201cspecial needs\u201d arise out of the twin goals of rehabilitating the previously convicted individual and protecting the community to which the individual has been released. <em>Id. </em>at 875, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">To a greater or lesser degree, it is always true of probationers (as we have said it to be true of parolees) that they do not enjoy \u201cthe absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only ... conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restriction.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 480, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, <em>2600, </em>33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">... Supervision [of probationers], then, is a \u201cspecial need\u201d of the State permitting a degree of impingement upon privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the public at large. That permissible degree is not unlimited, however, so we next turn to whether it has been exceeded here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 874-75, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3168, 97 L.Ed.2d at 718 (first alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Finally, the <em>Griffin </em>Court concluded that a warrant requirement would be \u201cimpracticable\u201d and that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for suspicion was a justifiable substitute for probable cause in the context of probation. <em>Id. </em>at 876, 878, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3170, 3171, 97 L.Ed.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">In <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>112, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), a unanimous Supreme Court recently followed <em>Griffin </em>and held that the Fourth Amendment permits police officers who have \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of a probationer\u2019s criminal behavior to conduct a warrantless search of the probationer\u2019s home pursuant to a written condition of his probation authorizing such searches. The Court applied the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to find the search reasonable, citing <em>Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>33, 39, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>417, 421, 136 L.Ed.2d 347, 354 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">As in the search of a probationer\u2019s quarters, a search of a parolee\u2019s home will satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement if the parole agent carried out the search pursuant to a state law which itself satisfies that Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ment reasonableness requirement. <em>E.g., United States v. Lewis, </em>71 <em>F.3d </em>358, 361 (10th Cir.1995) (under Utah parole law).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In the context of the warrantless search of a parolee, \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d requires specific and articulable facts sufficient to justify a belief that the conditions of parole have been violated. <em>Compare United States v. Baker, </em>221 <em>F.3d </em>438, 444 (3d Cir.2000) (parole officers did not have the required reasonable suspicion to justify warrantless search of parolee\u2019s trunk), <em>with United States v. Hill, </em>967 <em>F.2d </em>902, 908-09 (3d Cir.1992) <em>(\u201cGriffin\u2019s </em>reasoning applies equally to the parole system,\u201d but \u201cno specific statutory or regulatory provision [under Pennsylvania law] authorized Hill\u2019s parole agents to conduct the warrantless search of his store.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[T]here is \u201cno constitutional difference between probation and parole for purposes of the fourth amendment.\u201d In fact, parole may be an even more severe restriction on liberty because the parolee has already been adjudged in need of incarceration. For this reason, the \u201cspecial needs\u201d of probation would appear to be heightened for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\"><em>[Id. </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>See also United States v. Payne, </em>181 <em>F.3d </em>781, 786-87 (6th Cir.1999) (Kentucky law meets <em>Griffin </em>standard, but search without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">As one commentator explained after <em>Griffin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">In all ... categories of administrative search cases, the [Supreme] Court has emphasized the need to limit the field officer\u2019s discretion. Either a warrant, neutral criteria, or regulatory limits on the scope of the search must limit the officer\u2019s power and discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">[Sunny A.M. Koshy, Note, <em>The Right of [All] the People to be Secure: Extending Fundamental Fourth Amendment Rights to Probationers and Parolees, </em>39 <em>Hastings L.J., </em>449, 460 (1988) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-12\"><em>\u201cGriffin </em>stands for the proposition that reasonableness for probationary [and, presumably also parole] searches may be established by statute, rather than by warrant.\u201d <em>United States v. Schoenrock, </em>868 <em>F.2d </em>289, 292 (8th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Cantley, </em>130 <em>F.3d </em>1371, 1375 (10th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>1137, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>1098, <em>140 L.Ed.2d </em>153 (1998) (warrantless search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>parolee\u2019s home valid to the extent that it complied with procedure set forth in Oklahoma Probation and Parole Manual).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Perhaps the most well-known commentator on search-and-seizure law has summarized the appropriate rationale for applying the' <em>Chiffin </em>standard to warrantless searches of a parolee\u2019s home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">[T]he Fourth Amendment rights of parolees and probationers are [not] in all respects identical to those guaranteed to others. A realistic appraisal of the functions and goals of the probation and parole systems justifies the conclusion that some \u201cspecial\u201d Fourth Amendment rules are essential in this area, just as is true of certain other administrative or regulatory systems____But these rules must strike a fair balance between the needs of the probation and parole systems and the privacy interests of those persons on parole and probation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">[Wayne R. LaFave, 4 <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 10.10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Consistent with <em>Griffin, </em>LaFave explains the reduced level of Fourth Amendment protection for an administrative search, as a reflection of the balance between an individual parolee\u2019s or probationer\u2019s right to be free of unreasonable search or seizure, and the government\u2019s interest in effective supervision of such persons. The parolee\u2019s or probationer\u2019s reduced expectation of privacy makes reasonable a certain degree of governmental intrusion that would be unreasonable in relation to an ordinary citizen. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">LaFave recognizes that <em>Griffin </em>does not entirely resolve the extent of the statutory or regulatory standard that justifies a warrantless search of a parolee or probationer on the basis of reasonable suspicion. New Jersey\u2019s administrative regulation, requiring that a parole officer have both \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of unlawful activity and either prior approval of a supervisor or exigent circumstances, satisfies the <em>Griffin </em>standard as we see it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Both the federal and New Jersey Constitutions guarantee all citizens the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>U.S. Const., </em>amend. IV; <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. I, para. 7. In some circumstances, the \u201cprotection of personal privacy extends beyond that embraced by the federal constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Mollica, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>329, 344, 554 A.2d 1315 (1989) (defendant\u2019s hotel telephone records are protected by State Constitutional limits); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>e.g., State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>657, 671, 751 A.2d 92 (2000) (exigent circumstances as well as probable cause required to justify a warrantless search under the automobile exception); <em>State v. Hempele, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>182, 196, 576 A.2d 793 (1990) (State Constitution requires warrant before searching garbage left at curb, although no warrant is required to seize and hold such garbage temporarily); <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 144-45, 519 A.2d 820 (1987) (New Jersey Constitution does not permit good faith exception to the exclusionary rule). However, we find no reason to conclude that the New Jersey Constitution requires any greater limitation upon a parole officer\u2019s right to search, and any greater protection to a parolee, than does federal law as enunciated in <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin </em>and <em>United States v. Hill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Ms. Murphy described several conditions that together aroused her suspicions respecting the brown paper bag: defendant\u2019s nervousness as the officer approached her bedroom; defendant\u2019s lie that the baby was not in the bedroom, supporting the inference that defendant had something to hide in that room; and the crumpled brown paper bag, which Ms. Murphy knew as a common container for illegal drugs. While defendant contends that such bags are most frequently found in school lunchrooms, this bag was neither in a school lunchroom nor a kitchen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The judge had clearly applied the wrong legal standard when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">But there is absolutely no question in my mind that her entry into \u2014 she was then on what would be characterized as nothing less or nothing more than a routine <em>home </em>visit in the course of her duties in supervising Lisa Maples at her home. It isn\u2019t really incumbent upon the State to prove that there was probable cause. <em>It\u2019s not incumbent upon the State as far as I am concerned to prove there was reasonable suspicion. </em>I don\u2019t think the situation, quite frankly, on a stretch is any different, really, than ISP [Intensive Supervision Program] under the circumstances. You\u2019re released from prison onto ISP, but you\u2019re told they can search you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>any time, do it from a phone that could be tapped, so on, so forth, (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Moreover, the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact are far less complete than we might wish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">She\u2019s got the right to look, go into the house, look at it, and her actions here were absolutely reasonable under the circumstances. I want to make that finding. In addition, she says, and I believe her, that she acted nervous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Nevertheless, we affirm or reverse judgments and orders, not reasons. <em>Isko v. Planning Bd. of Tp. of Livingston, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>162, 175, 238 A.2d 457 (1968); <em>Walker v. Briarwood Condo Ass\u2019n, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 426, 644 A.2d 634 (App.Div.1994). We are satisfied in the end that the judge reached the correct conclusion respecting Ms. Murphy\u2019s seizure of the marijuana. While defendant testified that she did not invite Ms. Murphy into her bedroom, it was defendant herself, not Ms. Murphy, who suggested retrieving the court documents from her bedroom. We deem that suggestion, when combined with defendant\u2019s immediate walk to that room, to constitute an implied consent for Ms. Murphy to follow. Indeed, defendant does not argue that Ms. Murphy\u2019s walk to the bedroom door violated her constitutional rights, but only that the officer had no right to seize and look inside the brown paper bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Under the totality of the circumstances presented, we are satisfied that Ms. Murphy had a reasonable suspicion that there was contraband in the plainly visible brown paper bag in defendant\u2019s bedroom, and that looking inside the bag and seizing its contents did not violate defendant\u2019s federal or state constitutional right to be free of unreasonable search or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> There is no reason to consider whether defendant\u2019s conduct that created Ms. Murphy\u2019s \u2019\u2019reasonable suspicion\" that there was contraband in defendant\u2019s bedroom would have permitted a more far-reaching search, e.g., inside defendant\u2019s bureau drawers, or elsewhere in defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
