Following an election ordered by the Public Employment Relations Commission, the Association of Government Attorneys was certified as the employees\u2019 representative. The City appeals, contending: (1) the Commission erred in ordering the election, (2) the Rules of Professional Conduct bar municipal attorneys from joining a union, (3) the Commission\u2019s decision intrudes upon the Supreme Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the practice of law, (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>collective negotiations conflict \"with statutes and ordinances providing that the City\u2019s lawyers serve at the pleasure of corporation \u2022 counsel, and (5) as managerial and confidential employees, the attorneys\u2019 overriding duty of loyalty to the City precludes them from organizing for the purpose of collective negotiations. We reject these arguments and affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On September 3, 1999, the Association filed a petition with the Commission requesting certification to represent twenty-eight attorneys employed by the City. The petition was accompanied by a document signed by over thirty percent of the employees expressing their agreement to have the Association \u201cexclusively represent them in the collective bargaining process.\u201d <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-1.2(a)(9) (petition for certification shall be accompanied by a \u201cshowing of interest ... of not less than [thirty] percent of the employees in the unit alleged to be appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On September 10, 1999, twelve of the attorneys who had signed the \u201cshowing of interest\u201d requested the Commission to withdraw the petition, claiming that it had been submitted without their knowledge or approval. They asserted that Salvador Simas, an assistant corporation counsel, had misrepresented the nature of the document. In response, the Association filed an unfair practice charge against the City, accusing Newark\u2019s corporation counsel of intimidating members of her staff in an attempt to \u201cdissuade\u201d them from joining the union. The unfair practice charge was held in abeyance pending the Commission\u2019s disposition of the Association\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Following his investigation of the City\u2019s protest, the Commission\u2019s Director of Representation advised the parties that he had found no defect in the petition and that he intended to order an election. The Director further apprised the parties of his preliminary decisions respecting the structure of the proposed negotiating unit. After inviting and receiving the parties\u2019 responses, the Director issued his formal decision on April 18, 2000, rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>City\u2019s claims that the petition was defective and that the attorneys had no right to organize because they were managerial executives or confidential employees. With regard to the proposed unit, the Director excluded the two first assistant corporation counsel on the ground that they were managerial and supervisory employees, and the seven section chiefs for the same reason. In addition, the Director excluded the four attorneys assigned to the labor department and one lawyer assigned to the development section, finding that they were confidential employees. The negotiating unit was thus confined to lower level attorneys with essentially no supervisory authority over other lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The election was conducted on May 17, 2000. Thirteen of the seventeen eligible voters cast ballots, eleven in favor and two against the Association. On May 25, 2000, the Director certified the Association as the unit\u2019s representative. The Commission denied the City\u2019s request for review the next day. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Initially, we reject the City\u2019s procedural argument that the Association\u2019s \u201cshowing of interest\u201d was defective. When an organization seeks to represent a group of employees, its petition must be accompanied by a \u201cshowing of interest\u201d of not less than thirty percent of the employees. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11\u20141.2(a)(9). The showing of interest is confidential and may not be furnished to the parties. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-2.1. This cloak of secrecy is designed to protect the employees against retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The point to be stressed is that the petition and the requisite \u201cshowing of interest\u201d are preliminary, procedural mechanisms designed to ascertain whether there is sufficient support for the selection of an organization to represent the employees for the purpose of collective negotiations. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-2.1 provides that the Director shall determine the adequacy of interest and that his determination shall not be collaterally attacked. Once the Director finds that the \u201cshowing of interest\u201d is sufficient and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>it meets the regulatory requirements, any question concerning the adequacy of the employees\u2019 support for the designated union must be determined by secret ballot election, rather than litigation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Any error made in determining a \u201cshowing of interest\u201d will be remedied by the election itself. In this case, for example, the election result \u2014 certification of the Association \u2014 discloses a strong likelihood that there was sufficient support for the union at the time the petition was filed. We acknowledge, of course, that this is not inevitably true and that employees who cast their ballots in favor of the Association may have been against the union when first confronted by the question. But measured by the election result, any error in the preliminary proceedings would be considered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We emphasize the limited contours of our holding. There may be instances in which a party\u2019s conduct in obtaining or filing a petition is so egregious as to justify judicial intervention notwithstanding the otherwise cleansing results of the election. Our endorsement of the Commission\u2019s longstanding practice may not be transmogrified into an open sesame for egregious acts of intimidation or fraud. We, nonetheless, are content to decide the case before us. So posited, we perceive no sound basis to disturb the Director\u2019s preliminary decision accepting the Association\u2019s petition and ordering an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We turn to the City\u2019s argument that the Rules of Professional Conduct preclude its lawyers from unionizing for the purpose of collective negotiations. The City contends that the interjection of a union will seriously impair the attorney-client relationship by creating dual loyalties. The City further claims that unionization of municipal attorneys creates an appearance of impropriety. In advancing these contentions, the City heavily relies on <em>RPC </em>1.7(b) and (c)(2). These rules bar an attorney from representing a client if such representation may be \u201cmaterially limited by the lawyer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests,\u201d or if such \u201cmultiple representation\u201d might create a perception of impropriety in an \u201cordinary knowledgeable citizen acquainted with the facts.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We find no merit in this contention. There is nothing fundamentally incompatible between the constitutional right of government employees to organize for the purpose of collective negotiations, <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. I, \u00b6 19., and the duty of loyalty owed by a municipal attorney to his client. In earlier days, the legal profession harbored a strong bias against governmental attorneys joining unions or other employee organizations. <em>See, e.g., ABA Informal Ethics Opns., </em>No. 917 (Jan. 25, 1966) (a government lawyer owes undivided loyalty to the agency for which he or she works and may not join a labor union). However, the American Bar Association subsequently discarded that position and recognized the right of government attorneys and corporate lawyers to organize \u201cfor the purpose of negotiating wages, hours, and working conditions\u201d so long as they perform their duties in accordance with ... the Canons of Ethics. 2 <em>ABA Informal Ethics Opns., </em>No. 986 (July 3, 1967). The American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Model Code of Professional Responsibility, </em>EC 5-13 states in pertinent part that \u201c[although it is not necessarily improper for a lawyer employed by a corporation or similar entity to be a member of an organization of employees, he should be vigilant to safeguard his fidelity as a lawyer to his employer, free from outside influences.\u201d Although in 1983 the American Bar Association replaced the Model Code of Professional Responsibility with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which is silent on the question, the bar association\u2019s current position appears to be that unionization is permitted as long as the attorney conducts himself in accordance with ethical rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We adopt this pragmatic approach. The number of lawyers who represent single employer clients, such as governmental agencies, has increased substantially in recent years. The relationship between a government lawyer and his client in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>compensation and working conditions is different from that of the attorney who represents a number of different clients in his daily practice. Government lawyers have only one client, do not charge fees for their individual work, and their compensation generally is not related to a particular assignment but instead is related to the overall duties they perform. This does not diminish their duty of loyalty owed to their client or their obligation to conduct themselves in accordance with accepted ethical standards. However, the impersonality of the relationship might well weigh heavily in the need to organize for the purpose of collective negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We perceive no blanket, per <em>se </em>violation of the duty of loyalty owed by a lawyer to his client when government attorneys exercise their constitutional and statutory rights to organize for the purpose of collective negotiations. The growing phenomenon of single client lawyers requires a realistic accommodation between an attorney\u2019s professional obligation and the rights he or she may have as an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">There is an inherent tension in the attorney-client relationship, just as there is an inherent tension in the employer-employee relationship. In that context, it is important to note that an attorney\u2019s personal interests in securing equitable compensation and benefits are the same whether they are advanced by the attorney individually or by a union. In both cases, the attorney\u2019s stringent ethical obligations trump his personal interests. That cardinal principle must prevail in determining whether an attorney, in pursuit of an employee organization\u2019s objectives, oversteps ethical boundaries. That determination must rest on the application of specific ethical and disciplinary rules, most particularly the principles adopted by our Supreme Court, to insure the attorney\u2019s unfettered duty to represent the client faithfully, competently, and fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In its attempt to avoid application of these principles, the City conjures up a myriad of hypothetical, potential conflicts of interest that could result from collective negotiations. It asserts, for example, that an attorney who is a member of a union may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>consider how the outcome of a case will impact on his personal interests. He might take advantage of the City\u2019s confidential legal strategies. An attorney may be temporarily assigned to a labor department task, forcing him to advance a position that is inconsistent with his own interests and those of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">There is no reason to believe, however, that these types of situations are more likely to arise when an attorney is a member of a union. As we have noted, a non-union attorney may have personal interests that, to some extent, collide with an argument he is required to advance or a position he must advocate on behalf of his client. For example, a municipal attorney might be required to oppose the advance of employee benefits even though he would personally gain were he to adopt a contrary position. He might be required by his duty of loyalty to the City to oppose the implementation of personnel policies that either directly or indirectly would ultimately serve his personal interests. He may even be required to seek the incarceration of employees for engaging in an illegal strike even though a work stoppage would benefit him personally. The simple and overriding fact is that these conflicts would exist to the same extent whether or not the municipal attorney is a member of a union. In these and a host of other situations, the attorney\u2019s duty to his client must be accorded paramountcy and must prevail whether or not he is represented by a labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Candor requires us to add that not all of the concerns expressed by the City are fanciful. We recognize that the course we have taken is not free of obstacles. Public employees may not engage in a strike, and so we need not concern ourselves with that issue. But difficult questions will undoubtedly be raised in the future, such as whether a union representing municipal attorneys may sue the City or seek redress for labor law violations in other forums. So too, difficult questions may arise as to whether the City could punish an attorney-employee because of his union activities. We are also mindful of the possibility that unionization may put a strain on the attorney-client relationship, and may tend to dimin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ish the client\u2019s confidence in the attorney\u2019s loyalty. Moreover, the action of the union or that of the municipality may create lasting antagonism. Such antagonism in the labor relations context is unfortunately commonplace. We do not underestimate the difficulty of providing solutions to these problems. But the constitutional and statutory rights to organize for the purpose of collective negotiations were not established for the ease and comfort of the judiciary. We are confident in the capacity of the parties, and ultimately the ability of judges, to resolve these and other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We reject the City\u2019s argument that the Rules of Professional Conduct prohibiting multiple representation are applicable to the issues raised. These rules do not bar union membership. When an attorney joins a union and designates the union as his representative for collective negotiations, he does not by virtue of that act undertake legal representation of the union. Independent counsel will undoubtedly represent the Association. The relationship between the City\u2019s attorneys and the Association is not one of attorney-client.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We also disagree with the City\u2019s contention that unionization of the City\u2019s attorneys creates a perception of impropriety. <em>RPC </em>1.7(c)(2). We acknowledge that \u201cthe \u2018appearance\u2019 doctrine is intended not to prevent any actual conflicts of interest but to bolster the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the legal profession.\u201d <em>In re Opinion No. 569, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>325, 330, 511 A.2d 119 (1986) (citing <em>In re Cipriano, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>398, 398, 346 A.2d 393 (1975); <em>In re Opinion No. 415, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>318, 323, 407 A.2d 1197 (1979)). \u201cThus, it is that sometimes an attorney, guiltless in any actual sense, nevertheless is required to stand aside for the sake of public confidence in the probity of the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Perillo v. Advisory Committee on Prof'l Ethics, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>366, 373, 416 A.2d 801 (1980) (quoting <em>State v. Rizzo, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>28, 30, 350 A.2d 225 (1975)). Undoubtedly, the need to dispel all appearances of impropriety becomes even more compelling and acute when the attorney is a government lawyer. <em>In re Opinion No. 415, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>at 323, 407 A.2d 1197. When representation of public bodies is involved, our Supreme Court has recognized that the appearance of impropriety assumes an added dimension because \u201cgovernment attorneys ... are more visible to the public.\u201d <em>In re Opinion No. 569, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 330, 511 A.2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The Court has also said that \u201cthe \u2018appearance\u2019 of impropriety must be something more than a fanciful possibility.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIt must have some reasonable basis.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Higgins v. Advisory Committee on Prof'l Ethics, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>123, 373 A.2d 372 (1977)). Applying that principle, we are satisfied that ordinary, knowledgeable citizens acquainted with the facts would see nothing amiss in extending the organizational rights and benefits afforded by our Constitution and statutes to the City\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">For the sake of completeness, we add that our holding is supported by other jurisdictions that have considered the question. <em>See Santa Clara County Counsel Attorneys Ass\u2019n v. Woodside, </em>7 <em>Cal. </em>4th 525, 553, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 869 P.2d 1142, 1157-58 (Cal.1994) (en banc) (attorneys in the public sector may organize and sue employer for labor law violations); <em>Chiles v. State Employees Attorneys Guild, </em>734 So.2d 1030, 1036 (Fla.1999) (government lawyer \u201cdoes not violate ethical standards simply by being a member of a union\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Chiles v. Public Employees Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>630 So.2d 1093, 1095 (Fla.1994) (Commission statutory certification process does not infringe upon [Supreme Court\u2019s] jurisdiction over attorneys); <em>City of Philadelphia v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd., </em>163 <em>Pa. Commw. </em>628, 633, 641 A.2d 709, 712 (Pa.Commw.1994) (\u201cThere is nothing in the Rules of Professional Conduct which prohibits an attorney from being a member of a union\u201d). These decisions stand for the proposition that government lawyers have an interest in dealing with their employer concerning compensation, benefits and other core working conditions, but this interest is inherent in every employment relationship, that all attorneys have an interest in addressing these issues whether or not they organize for the purpose of collective negotiations, and that interjection of a union does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>alter this interest, but instead changes the method of communicating it to the employer. We agree with these observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We next consider the City\u2019s argument that the Commission infringed upon the power of the Supreme Court over the practice of law. The nature and extent of the Court\u2019s authority and obligation are set forth in the 1947 constitution, which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction over the admission to the practice of law and the discipline of persons admitted,\u201d and \u201cshall make rules governing the administration of all courts in the State and ... the practice and procedures in all such courts.\u201d <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. VI, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u201c \u2018The intent of the 1947 Constitutional Convention was to vest the Supreme Court with the broadest possible administrative authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Passaic County Probation Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. County of Passaic, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>247, 251, 374 A.2d 449 (1977) (quoting <em>Lichter v. County of Monmouth, </em>114 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 349, 276 A.2d 382 (App.Div.1971)). As expressed by Chief Justice Weintraub, the Constitution confers upon the Court \u201cplenary responsibility for the administration of all courts [of this state],\u201d <em>State v. De Stasio, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>247, 253, 229 A.2d 636 (1967), and such responsibility \u201cimplies power reasonably necessary\u201d for achieving that mission, <em>In re Mattera, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>259, 272, 168 A.2d 38 (1961). The constitutional mandate given to the Court transcends the power of the other branches to enact statutes or promulgate regulations inconsistent with the authority so granted. <em>See Passaic County Probation Officers\u2019Ass\u2019n v. County of Passaic, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 255, 374 A.2d 449. Resolution of the ethical propriety of an attorney\u2019s conduct is thus \u201cwithin the exclusive province of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Pickett v. Harris, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. 253, 260, 530 </em>A.2d 319 (App.Div.1987), <em>appeal dismissed by </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>471, 555 A.2d 598 (1989). \u201c[I]t is safe to say that generally, almost without exception, no branch of government has the power to authorize either explicitly or implicitly, conduct by attorneys that violates the ethical stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>dards imposed by the judiciary.\u201d <em>In re Opinion No. 621, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>577, 590, 608 A.2d 880 (1992). \u201cNeither the Legislature nor the Executive has any power to overrule attorney ethical standards promulgated by [the] Court.\u201d <em>In re Opinion No. 621, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 591, 608 A.2d 880 (citing <em>In re Genser, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>600, 607, 105 A.2d 829 (1954)). Clearly, the Commission has no authority to override the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional power.</p>\n<p id=\"AoL\">This much conceded, the Commission\u2019s decision did not authorize any conduct barred by an ethical standard adopted by the Court. The Commission\u2019s determination did not insulate the City\u2019s attorneys from the Court\u2019s authority. The pivotal issue is whether the Commission\u2019s statutory certification process intrudes upon the court\u2019s jurisdiction over attorneys. We find that collective negotiations by the City\u2019s attorneys does not encroach upon the Court\u2019s authority in the absence of any action by the Court to the contrary. As a matter of comity and respect for the other branches of government, we accord deference to the Commission\u2019s decision. We again add that our holding comports with decisions of other jurisdictions. <em>See Chiles v. Public Employees Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>630 So.2d at 1095; <em>City of Philadelphia v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd., </em>163 <em>Pa. Commw. </em>at 633, 641 A.2d at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-139 requires every municipality to adopt an ordinance providing for the appointment of a municipal attorney. The City implemented that statute by enacting <em>Newark Ordinance </em>\u00a7 2.6-7(a), which provides that the corporation counsel may appoint legal assistants, and that \u201c[a]U said persons [are to] serve at the pleasure of the corporation counsel.\u201d The City argues that unionization of its attorneys unlawfully burdens the corporation counsel\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">In support of this contention, the City heavily relies upon <em>Golden v. County of Union, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>420, 749 A.2d 842 (2000) and <em>Walsh v. State, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 13, 674 A.2d 988 (App.Div.1996) (Skillman, J.A.D., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d on dissent, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>595, 689 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>A.2d 131 (1997). In <em>Golden, </em>the plaintiff, an assistant prosecutor, was fired when he complained about a work assignment. <em>Golden v. County of Union, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 423-24, 749 A.2d 842. He asserted that his termination was unlawful because he was not presented with formal, written charges or granted a hearing, as required by an employment manual. <em>Id, </em>at 424-26, 749 A.2d 842. The defendants argued that the rights conferred by the employees\u2019 manual were inconsistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158-15, which provides that assistant prosecutors \u201chold their appointments at the pleasure of the respective prosecutors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 749 A.2d 842. The Court held that \u201c[t]he statute trump[ed] whatever implied contract may have existed between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 749 A.2d 842. In arriving at that conclusion, the Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he Legislature\u2019s mandate as embodied in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:158-15 would be thwarted if prosecutors could, by an implied agreement contained in an employment manual, abrogate or otherwise encumber their statutory prerogatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 749 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In <em>Walsh, </em>the Court adopted the dissenting <em>opinion of </em>Judge Skillman in which he concluded that the Public Defender\u2019s promise of a future promotion made to a deputy assistant was unenforceable. <em>Walsh v. State, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 595, 689 A.2d 131. The promise was held to be incompatible with the unfettered power of the Public Defender granted in <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:158-6 to \u201chire, discharge, transfer, demote or withhold promotion from an assistant deputy public defender.\u201d 290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 13, 674 A.2d 988. Judge Skillman concluded that enforcement of the promise would \u201ctransform a statutorily mandated at will employment relationship into a contract of employment ... binding upon successors to the Public Defender in office when the purported contract was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 674 A.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The exact implications of <em>Golden </em>and <em>Walsh </em>are not altogether clear. It is arguable that collective negotiations concerning procedures for granting promotions or salary increases would infringe upon the managerial prerogatives of the City\u2019s corporation coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>sel. <em>But see Council of N.J. State College Locals v. State Bd. of Higher Educ., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>18, 33, 449 A.2d 1244 (1982) (\u201cprocedures for implementing substantive decisions ... pose no significant threat of interference with the public employer\u2019s ability to make substantive policy determinations\u201d) (citing <em>In re Local 195, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>393, 417, 443 A.2d 187 (1982)); <em>State v. State Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>54, 90-91, 393 A.2d 233 (1978) (\u201cpromotional criteria are not mandatorily negotiable while promotional procedures are so negotiable\u201d). We express no view on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Suffice it to say, the issue presented here is entirely different. Undoubtedly, there are issues and areas that cannot be the subject of negotiations because they are preempted by statute or otherwise inconsistent with corporation counsel\u2019s statutory power. We have no occasion here to set the exact boundaries of permissible collective negotiations. We are concerned here with the much broader question concerning the right of the City\u2019s attorneys to organize and join a union. That right is not forbidden by statute or ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The City\u2019s final argument is that its attorneys are supervisors, managerial executives or confidential employees and are thus barred from organizing or joining a union under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-5.3. The operative statutory language reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akj\">public employees shall have ... the right ... to form ... any employee organization ... provided, however, that this right shall not extend to ... managerial executives, or confidential employees ... nor ... shall any supervisor having the power to hire, discharge, discipline, or to effectively recommend the same, have the right to be represented in collective negotiations by an employee organization that admits nonsupervisory personnel to membership, and the fact that any organization has such supervisory employees as members shall not deny the right of that organization to represent the appropriate unit in negotiations____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">At the outset, we reject the City\u2019s argument that its attorneys are forbidden from organizing because they act as supervisors to support staff such as paralegals, administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>assistants or interns. Whether or not the attorneys are supervisors is essentially irrelevant. The statutory language bars supervisors from being represented in collective negotiations by an employee organization that admits nonsupervisory personnel. The statute provides no blanket prohibition against supervisors joining a union. The Director of Representation determined that supervisory and nonsupervisory personnel were not to be represented by the same employee organization. Further, the Director structured the negotiating unit to comport with the statute by excluding the first assistants and section chiefs who have supervisory authority over the lower level, remaining employees. We hold that the negotiating unit delineated by the Director is appropriate, meets all statutory requisites, and that the supervisory status of the attorneys with respect to the support staff does not negate their right to organize for the purpose of collective negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We also find no sound basis to disturb the Director\u2019s finding that the City\u2019s attorneys are not \u201cmanagerial executives.\u201d The term \u201cmanagerial executives\u201d refers to persons who \u201cformulate management policies and practices, and persons who are charged with the responsibility of directing the effectuation of such management policies and practices.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-3(f). In <em>In re N.J. Turnpike </em>Auth., 150 <em>N.J. </em>331, 696 A.2d 585 (1997), the Supreme Court elaborated on the statutory definition by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJb\">\u201cA person formulates policies when he develops a particular set of objectives designed to further the mission of [a segment of] the governmental unit and when he selects a course of action from among available alternatives. A person directs the effectuation of policy when he is charged with developing the methods, means and extent of reaching a policy objective and thus oversees or coordinates policy implementation by line supervisors.. . Whether or not an employee possesses this level of authority may generally be determined by ... three factors: (1) the relative position of that employee in his employer\u2019s hierarchy; (2) his functions and responsibilities; and (3) the extent of discretion he exercises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 337, 696 A.2d 585 (quoting <em>Borough of Montvale, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 81-52, 6 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 11259 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Within this analytical framework, we emphasize that all of the attorneys represented by the Association are lower level employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ees in the office of corporation counsel. It is undisputed that they report to a section chief who reports to one of the two first assistants who,- in turn, reports to corporation counsel. While the lower level attorneys may occasionally make recommendations concerning the formulation of policy, they are not policy makers. They do not develop objectives to further the City\u2019s mission. They, instead, render advice on legal questions and represent the City in litigation. As attorneys, they develop legal strategies to advance legislative and administrative policies, but this function is not the equivalent of \u201coverseeing] or coordinating] policy implementation by line supervisors.\u201d While the attorneys are vested with some degree of discretion, it is plain from the record that they are closely supervised and that their power and authority are narrowly circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We do not regard the City\u2019s attorneys as \u201cconfidential employees.\u201d The term \u201cconfidential employees\u201d refers to \u201cemployees whose functional responsibilities or knowledge in connection with the issues involved in the collective negotiations process would make their membership in any appropriate negotiating unit incompatible with their official duties.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-3(g). In <em>Township of Wayne v. AFSCME, Council 52, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 532 A.2d 255 (App.Div.1987), we suggested that access to confidential labor relations information creates sufficiently conflicting loyalties to qualify an employee as confidential. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 532 A.2d 255. However, in <em>Turnpike Authority, </em>the Supreme Court rejected that thesis, holding that \u201cmere access to such information does not automatically confer confidential employee status.\u201d 150 <em>N.J. </em>at 357, 696 A.2d 585. The Court concluded that \u201cthose who have more than \u2018mere access\u2019 to confidential information \u2014 those who \u2018assimilate it, evaluate it, analyze it and provide significant information to their supervisors\u2019 \u2014 must be excluded as confidential employees.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted a significant disparity between the definition of \u201cconfidential employee\u201d proposed by Governor Cahill in his conditional veto of Assembly Bill No. 520 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and the definition [ultimately adopted] by the Legislature. <em>Ibid. </em>Governor Cahill proposed that the term include a specific reference to those with \u201c \u2018access to confidential personnel files or information concerning the administrative operations of a public employer\u2019____\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Governor\u2019s Veto Statement to Assembly Bill No. 520 </em>at 6 (Feb. 22, 1973)). The Legislature declined to adopt that specific exclusion. The Court reasoned that this omission \u201csuggested] that the Legislature did not mean to preclude those with mere access to confidential general personnel information from joining a. collective negotiating unit.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cThe baseline inquiry remains whether an employee\u2019s functional responsibilities or knowledge \u2018would make their membership in any appropriate negotiating unit incompatible with their official duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 696 A.2d 585 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-3(g)). There must be some substantial nexus between the employee\u2019s functional responsibilities in having access to confidential information and the collective negotiations process. \u201c[M]ere physical access to information without any accompanying insight about its significance or functional responsibility for its development or implementation may be insufficient in specific cases to warrant exclusion.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In that context, there is no evidence that the information to which the attorneys have access is significant in the context of their work responsibilities and the collective negotiations process. It is to be recalled that those having such information \u2014 the attorneys assigned to labor law tasks, section chiefs, and first assistants \u2014 were excluded from the negotiating unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The City asserts that it should have been afforded a hearing on this subject. Our examination of the voluminous record, however, does not indicate that a specific request for a hearing was made respecting the precise issue raised. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(b). Beyond this, there is no genuine issue of material fact that requires further elucidation. <em>See Sloan v. Klagholtz, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 392, 776 A.2d 894 (App.Div.2001); <em>Quad Enterprises v. Borough of Paramus, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 263, 593 A.2d 1227 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Despite the vagaries inherent in the statutory definition of \u201cconfidential employees,\u201d we are thoroughly satisfied that the City\u2019s lower level attorneys do not so qualify. If the Legislature intended to prohibit all municipal attorneys from joining a union, it would have said so, as it did in the case of deputy attorneys general under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17A-7. We see no valid basis for vitiating the Commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
