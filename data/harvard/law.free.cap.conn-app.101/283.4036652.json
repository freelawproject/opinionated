App. 572, 830 A.2d 1165, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 902, 838 A.2d 211, 212 (2003) <em>(Ramirez I). </em>After retrial, the court again rendered judgment of conviction against the defendant, following a jury trial on the same offense. The defendant then filed this current appeal, claiming that the court improperly admitted (1) a statement of his girlfriend, Erin Waye, which was given to Danbury police Detective James Terry at police headquarters, (2) opinion testimony of the state\u2019s expert witness, Patti LaMonica, (3) constancy of accusation testimony from the victim\u2019s mother<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (4) a letter the defendant wrote to his brother, Eddie Ramirez, which was seized by New York authorities while the defendant was incarcerated. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts, as set forth in the opinion of this court in <em>Ramirez I. </em>\u201cOn June 25, 1999, the victim and her then boyfriend Johnny Ramirez, who is the defendant\u2019s brother, attended a party at the home of the defendant\u2019s parents. After consuming several drinks, the victim became ill. The defendant offered to escort the victim to the bathroom. When they reached the bathroom, the defendant remained with the victim while she vomited. .... The defendant then proceeded to force the victim to engage in sexual intercourse .... The victim repeatedly implored the defendant to stop, but did not have the strength to physically restrain him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u201cThe next morning, the victim awoke alone in a bed in the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 home. When she awoke, she found that her clothing was in disarray. She ate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>breakfast with the defendant\u2019s family. At that time, she was not entirely certain what had transpired the previous night and who had been involved, so she did not say anything to anybody about the incident in the bathroom. Later, the defendant drove the victim and Johnny Ramirez to Johnny Ramirez\u2019s apartment. At that time, the victim was still confused about the events of the previous night. Johnny Ramirez later took the victim to her parents\u2019 home where she lived. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cThe next morning, the victim went to work. While she was at work, she realized she had been raped, but was not certain of the identity of her assailant. Later in the day, however, she became more confident that the defendant had raped her. She returned home, where she told her mother about the assault and called the police. They then went to the hospital, where she was examined and rape kit tests were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u201cThe defendant was later arrested in New York and taken to a correctional facility in that state. The authorities in New York subsequently delivered him into the custody of the Danbury police department. He was charged with sexual assault in the first degree and, after a six day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\u201d Id., 574-75. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Because all of the defendant\u2019s claims challenge the court\u2019s admission of certain evidence, we begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201c [0]ur standard of review for the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings depends on whether the claimed error is of constitutional magnitude. The court\u2019s ruling as to the nonhear-say character of the evidence is reviewed under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. . . . [I]f an [evidentiary] impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>When an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 592, 910 A.2d 931 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L. Ed. 2d 573 (2007). In a harmless error analysis, the question is \u201cwhether the trial court\u2019s error was so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, or, stated another way, was the court\u2019s ruling, though erroneous, likely to affect the result?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>67 Conn. App. 643, 654, 789 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 938, 808 A.2d 1133 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly admitted hearsay evidence consisting of a statement made by his girlfriend, Waye, which he claims was harmful error. We agree with the defendant that the state\u2019s exhibit was improperly admitted by the court, but we conclude, however, that this impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The testimony at issue concerns a statement that Waye gave to Terry when she accompanied the defendant to the police station. Her statement indicates, inter aha, that the defendant had been with her all night on the night in question. Defense counsel objected to the admission of this statement on the grounds that it was hearsay and that the state did not demonstrate that Waye was unavailable to the state to testify as a witness. The state argued that it was not hearsay because the statement was not being offered for its truth; rather, it was being offered for the fact that it was said and was relevant evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s \u201cconsciousness of guilt . . . .\u201d The court permitted the statement to be introduced into evidence on the ground that it was not hearsay. We conclude that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>admission of Waye\u2019s statement to the police was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">As a general rule, an out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay, and it is therefore inadmissible unless it falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 812, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005). The state claims that Waye\u2019s statement was offered not for its truth, but for a nonhearsay purpose, i.e., to demonstrate the consciousness of guilt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201c[M]isstatements of <em>an accused, </em>which a jury could reasonably conclude were made in an attempt to avoid detection of a crime or responsibility for a crime or were influenced by the commission of the criminal act, are admissible as evidence reflecting a consciousness of guilt. This rule has only been applied, however, where the declarant of the <em>misstatement has been the defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>State v. Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 519, 539 A.2d 80 (1988). As for statements by declarants other than the defendant, we have held that \u201c[u]ndue pressure upon a witness, by bribery or intimidation, falls within the hearsay exception for admissions of a party by conduct. The conduct must be connected to the party himself <em>... by showing that he did the act or authorized it by words or other conduct. </em>Moreover, the circumstances of the act must manifest bad faith. . . . Evidence of undue pressure upon a witness ... is admissible ... on the theory that such conduct exhibits a consciousness of guilt.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>7 Conn. App. 326, 351, 509 A.2d 518, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 807, 512 A.2d 231 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">There is no evidence in the record that the defendant coerced, persuaded or otherwise authorized Waye to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>give her statement to Terry. The record does not indicate that Waye\u2019s statement was a product of undue pressure imposed on her by the defendant, and because Waye did not attend the trial, there is no testimony from her on this issue. In short, the state did not present any evidence to connect the defendant to Waye\u2019s statement, and, therefore, the court\u2019s admission of Waye\u2019s statement was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The defendant raises another challenge to the impropriety of the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on the ground that admission of this evidence violated his right, under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, to confront the witnesses against him. To the extent that his constitutional claim was not properly preserved, the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Golding </em>provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. <em>The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In order to determine which party bears the burden of demonstrating harm from that evidentiary impropriety, we must address the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of the statement implicated the confrontation concerns at issue in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). See <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>supra, 280 Conn. 595. In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 68, the United States Supreme Court held that when testimonial hearsay statements are at issue, the sixth amendment requires that (1) the declarant be unavailable to testify and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>280 Conn. 361, 379, 908 A.2d 506 (2006). The determination of whether a statement is testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>is subject to plenary review. Id., 378. Our Supreme Court has recognized that testimonial hearsay statements have been defined as \u201cpretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially\u201d and \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The record indicates that on June 29, 1999, Terry went to the home of the defendant\u2019s parents and notified them that he wanted to speak to the defendant and the defendant\u2019s brother, Eddie Ramirez, with regard to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>incident that occurred at their home a few nights earlier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That same night, Terry received a call from Eddie Ramirez. During this telephone conversation, Terry told Eddie Ramirez that he was investigating \u201ca case of a sexual nature\u201d and that he was looking into whether anyone had had contact with the victim on the night in question. Later that same night, Terry received a call from the defendant, who then went to the police station with his girlfriend and gave a statement to the effect of \u201cnot me. I wasn\u2019t there. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Waye\u2019s statement helped to corroborate the defendant\u2019s statement because she stated that the defendant had been with her all night.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Waye voluntarily gave a statement to Terry in connection with an investigation he was conducting into possibly criminal past conduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 383-87. Several years later in September, 2001, during the defendant\u2019s first trial, Waye then gave testimony concerning this statement, excerpts of which the defendant included as an appendix to his appellate brief in the current appeal. Because Waye\u2019s statement was made under circumstances that would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial, the statement was testimonial in nature and therefore required evidence that Waye was not available to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial. The state provided no evidence of Waye\u2019s unavailability to testify, and it also did not provide the defendant with an opportunity to cross-examine Waye with regard to her statement prior to trial. The court\u2019s admission of Waye\u2019s statement, therefore, violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation pursuant to <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Upon review of the record, however, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the state has demonstrated that the error was harmless. We conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the challenged statement had any material bearing on the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had committed the sexual assault against the victim as alleged by the state. The primary issue at the defendant\u2019s trial was not whether the defendant was with his girlfriend all night but, rather, whether he sexually assaulted the victim in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). Any weight that Waye\u2019s statement may have had on whether the sexual assault occurred must be considered in light of the other evidence presented at trial. Prior to the court\u2019s admission of Waye\u2019s statement as evidence, the jury heard testimony from the following witnesses: the victim; Sheila Mortara, the nurse who had assisted Victor Estaba, a physician, in treating the victim when she went to the hospital; the victim\u2019s mother; and Officer Joseph LeR-ose of the Danbury police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">LeRose testified that he was responsible for ensuring the defendant\u2019s safe transport from New York to Connecticut. He further testified that he had a bag that contained the defendant\u2019s property and, as he was looking through the bag to prepare an inventory record of the defendant\u2019s personal belongings, he discovered a letter the defendant had written while under the care of the New York authorities. In that letter, the defendant asked his brother, Eddie Ramirez, to talk to the victim to see if she would be willing to accept $2000 to drop the sexual assault charges against the defendant. The jury then heard testimony from Mary Beth Raffin, a forensic expert, who testified concerning her analysis of the rape kit from the examination of the victim and the blood sample taken from the defendant. It is uncon-troverted that the defendant was not with his girlfriend all night, as the rape kit tests and related DNA evidence demonstrate that he had a sexual encounter with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Finally, after objection by defense counsel, a redacted version of the defendant\u2019s letter to his brother, Eddie Ramirez, was read to the jury. The letter stated in relevant part: \u201cEd, if you can, can you have a talk with Johnny and ask him to go with you to go talk to that girl and see if you could change her mind. Can you see if she\u2019ll drop the charges? I\u2019ll give her $2,000.00 if she drops charges, all she has to do is not appear at the felony hearing. I\u2019m worried about my girl . . . . <em>Remind her that she has to stick to her story, I was with her all night </em>.... Another way of solving this [is] by talking to that girl ... I have $2,000.00 you can offer it to her if she drops the charges.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">It is clear that Waye\u2019s statement was merely cumulative evidence of what was already presented at trial through the court\u2019s admission of the defendant\u2019s letter. The defendant, in his own words, acknowledged both the <em>story </em>and the contents of that story, \u201cI was with her all night,\u201d in his letter to his brother. \u201cIt is well established that if erroneously admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other evidence presented in the case, its admission does not constitute reversible error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>86 Conn. App. 557, 574, 861 A.2d 1219 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 915, 871 A.2d 372 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We also note that \u201c[i]t is the jury\u2019s function ... to weigh the evidence, pass on credibility and find facts; that responsibility belongs exclusively to the jurors as the sole triers of fact and credibility . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>74 Conn. App. 391, 397, 812 A.2d 141 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 952, 817 A.2d 110 (2003). The juiy was free to draw any reasonable inferences from the testimony and evidence presented. On the basis of our review of the record and the evidence presented to the court by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>state, we conclude that the state has demonstrated that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the court improperly admitted the expert testimony of LaMonica. Specifically, the defendant claims that LaMonica\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because there was no factual basis for her testimony and the testimony lacked relevance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">LaMonica testified that she currently teaches sexual assault nurse examiner courses at Quinnipiac University and that she is also a sexual assault nurse examiner. Concerning her experience with patients who have reported sexual assault, LaMonica testified: \u201cMany people never disclose [sexual assault]. Many people disclose immediately or may disclose to a person, but . . . choose not to pursue it for a variety of reasons. . . . [W]e have patients who come in shortly after an assault; a day after; a week; a month; years. It\u2019s very individualized, based on many factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The defendant essentially argues that there was no factual basis for LaMonica\u2019s testimony because the victim testified that her delay in reporting the incident arose from her alcoholic intoxication rather than from a symptom of \u201crape-trauma syndrome.\u201d The defendant also argues that LaMonica\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because it was based on conjecture or speculation: \u201cLaMonica\u2019s testimony regarding delays in reporting was not cast in terms of the \u2018reasonably probable\u2019 or \u2018common,\u2019 but simply noted that any outcome was possible</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\u201cExpert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>233 Conn. 403, 431, 660 A.2d 337 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The sole purpose of LaMonica\u2019s testimony was to establish that the reason for a victim\u2019s delay in reporting a sexual assault can stem from a variety of factors on the basis of the victim\u2019s individual circumstances. In the present case, the factor that prevented the victim from reporting the incident sooner was her intoxication. There is no authority for the defendant\u2019s proposition that intoxication cannot be considered as a factor in the delay of reporting a sexual assault, and the defendant did not provide any expert testimony to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Additionally, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 632, 535 A.2d 338 (1987) (noting that expert opinion must be \u201c \u2018reasonably probable\u2019 \u201d and not based on conjecture or surmise), for the proposition that LaMonica\u2019s testimony was irrelevant, is misplaced. LaMonica\u2019s testimony that it was <em>possible </em>that a victim of a sexual assault would delay in reporting the incident was only to illustrate that a person in this situation could respond in a variety of ways. Her testimony was not an attempt to provide an expert opinion as to whether it was <em>reasonably probable </em>that a victim of a sexual assault would delay in reporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">We conclude that LaMonica\u2019s testimony focused on a subject that generally is not within the common knowledge and experience of the average juror. On the basis of her extensive experience with sexual assault victims, she presented a general description of the responses that are common among victims in these situations. LaMonica\u2019s testimony enabled the jury to find that if the victim in this case was a victim of a sexual assault, such a finding was not necessarily inconsistent with her delay in reporting it to the authorities. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>further conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that LaMonica\u2019s testimony would be helpful to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the court improperly admitted the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother because the court failed to give the jury a limiting instruction with regard to the testimony. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court should have instructed the jury that the testimony was being admitted solely for the purpose of corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony and not for a substantive purpose, i.e., determination of guilt, and that such error was harmful to the defendant\u2019s case. Because the defendant did not object to any portion of the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother, and his argument for a limiting instruction is being made for the first time in this appeal, we decline to review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part that [this] court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. . . . Our rules of practice make it clear that counsel must object to a ruling of evidence [and] state the grounds upon which objection is made ... to preserve the grounds for appeal. . . . These requirements are not simply formalities. . . . We consistently have stated that we will not consider eviden-tiary rulings where counsel did not properly preserve a claim of error by objection . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sun, </em>92 Conn. App. 618, 630, 886 A.2d 1227 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The record reflects that the defendant did not object to the testimony with which he now takes issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>appeal, nor did he request a limiting instruction at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAssigning error to a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on the basis of objections never raised at trial unfairly subjects the court and the opposing party to trial by ambush.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Additionally, <em>\u201c[i]t is well established in Connecticut . . . that the trial court generally is not obligated, sua sponte, to give a limiting instruction.\" </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dews, 87 </em>Conn. App. 63, 70, 864 A.2d 59, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 901, 876 A.2d 13 (2005). For these reasons, we decline to review this unpreserved evidentiary claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly admitted the letter the defendant wrote to his brother, Eddie Ramirez, during his incarceration. Essentially, the defendant seeks review of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ramirez I, </em>which held that the letter was admissible because the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 582-83. We decline to review this claim because the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, precludes the relitigation of the defendant\u2019s claim in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201cThe judicial doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are based on the public policy that a party should not be able to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate. . . . Both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>doctrines express no more than the fundamental principle that once a matter has been fully and fairly litigated, and finally decided, it comes to rest. ... It is well settled that the principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata apply to criminal as well as to civil cases. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u201cPursuant to the doctrine of res judicata, a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim. A judgment is final not only as to eveiy matter which was offered to sustain the claim, but also as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>98 Conn.

At the trial, defense counsel objected to the court\u2019s admission of Waye\u2019s statement, on the ground that Waye was not available to the state as a witness. Although the defendant did not make any confrontation clause arguments during the trial, and the defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, has not been properly preserved, we conclude that the record is adequate for review and that the claim is of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> In light of our analysis under <em>Golding, </em>we likewise conclude that plain error review is not warranted because the defendant has not demonstrated that he suffered manifest injustice.
