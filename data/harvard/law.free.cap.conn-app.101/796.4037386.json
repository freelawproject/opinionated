On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because his claim falls within an exception to the exclusivity statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>for cases in which the employee can prove that the employer intentionally created a dangerous condition that made the plaintiffs injuries substantially certain to occur. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The plaintiff claims that he was injured on February 13, 2002 while working for the defendant, the South-ington Metal Fabricating Company. He alleges that, on that date, he was assisting a coworker, Cristobal Nieves, in the operation of a metal bending machine. Nieves operated the control switch of the machine with his back partially turned away from the plaintiff, who stood in front of the machine and lifted a large sheet of steel plate that was approximately eight feet by two feet into the machine. Nieves thought that he heard the plaintiff say \u201cokay,\u201d causing him to activate the machine. At the time, the plaintiff was still positioning the steel plate and his left arm was still under the clamp of the machine. Once the machine was activated, Nieves was unable to stop it, resulting in a severe crush injury to the plaintiffs left arm, ultimately requiring surgical treatment and amputation of his left arm below the elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The plaintiff filed this action alleging that the defendant intentionally created a dangerous condition that made his injuries substantially certain to occur. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiffs complaint was barred by the exclusivity provision of the act. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff failed to present any evidence indicating the existence of an issue of material fact as to whether intentional acts by the defendant created a substantial certainty that the plaintiffs injury would occur. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . .

The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. ...

Section 31-284 (a), the exclusivity provision in the act, manifests a legislative policy decision that a limitation on remedies under tort law is an appropriate trade-off for the benefits provided by workers\u2019 compensation. That trade-off is part and parcel of the remedial purpose of the act in its entirety. Accordingly, our case law on workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity reflects the proposition that these statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>General Nutrition Corp., </em>252 Conn. 215, 220-21, 752 A.2d 1069 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Our Supreme Court first recognized a narrow exception to the exclusivity provision in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). In <em>Jett, </em>the Supreme Court recognized a possible exception to the exclusivity of workers\u2019 compensation where the employer intentionally directs or authorizes another employee to assault the injured party. Id., 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">In <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 491 A.2d 368 (1985), our Supreme Court declined the invitation to extend the exception to situations in which an injury resulted from the employer\u2019s intentional, wilful or reckless violations of safety standards established pursuant to federal or state laws. The court held: \u201cTo bypass the exclusivity of the act, the intentional or deliberate act or conduct alleged must have been designed to cause the injury that resulted.\u201d Id., 102. This intent is distinguishable from reckless behavior. Id., 102-103. High foreseeability or strong probability are insufficient to establish this intent. Id. Although such intent may be proven circumstantially, what must be established is that the employer knew that the injury was substantially certain to follow the employer\u2019s deliberate course of action. Id. To hold otherwise would undermine the statutory scheme and purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation law and usurp legislative prerogative. See id., 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Definitive explication of the intentional injury exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity came in <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>229 Conn. 99, 639 A.2d 507 (1994) <em>(Suarez I), </em>in which the court stated that \u201cintent refers to the consequences of an act . . . [and] denote [s] that the actor desires to cause [the] consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to follow from it. ... A result is intended if the act is done for the purpose of accomplishing such a result or with knowledge that to a substantial certainty such a result will ensue.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>omitted.) Id., 108. The plaintiff in <em>Suarez I </em>alleged that the defendant required the plaintiff and other employees to clean a plastic molding machine while it was running, refused to allow the plaintiff to use safer methods to clean the machine and refused to place a protective cover on the machine. Id., 101. It also was alleged that the defendant had told the plaintiff that if he used safer methods to clean the machine, his employment would be terminated. Id. Our Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s [alleged] conduct constituted more than a mere failure to provide appropriate safety or protective measures, and that the plaintiffs injury was the inevitable and known result of the actions required of him by the defendant.\u201d Id., 111. In <em>Suarez I, </em>the documentary evidence submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment raised a genuine dispute concerning the employer\u2019s belief that an employee would inevitably amputate his fingers as a result of the employer\u2019s demands of the employee. Id. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial, which resulted in a plaintiffs verdict. The matter was appealed again.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>242 Conn. 255, 698 A.2d 838 (1997) <em>(Suarez II), </em>our Supreme Court described its earlier ruling as establishing an exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision if the employee can prove \u201ceither that the employer actually intended to injure the plaintiff (actual intent standard) or that the employer intentionally created a dangerous condition that made the plaintiffs injuries substantially certain to occur (substantial certainty standard).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 257-58. The Supreme Court reiterated that \u201c[substantial certainty centers on whether the employer <em>believed </em>the injury was substantially certain to follow the employer\u2019s acts or conduct . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 280-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Since <em>Suarez, </em>the exception to exclusivity has been further elucidated. The substantial certainty test permits a plaintiff \u201cto maintain a cause of action against an employer where the evidence is sufficient to support an inference that the employer deliberately instructed an employee to injure himself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>92 Conn. App. 558, 563, 886 A.2d 489 (2005). \u201c[T]he plaintiff must allege facts to establish either that the employer actually intended to injure the plaintiff (actual intent standard) or that the employer intentionally created a dangerous condition that made the plaintiffs injuries substantially certain to occur (substantial certainty standard). Under either theory of employer liability, however, the characteristic element [of wilful misconduct] is the design to injure either actually entertained or to be implied from the conduct and circumstances. ... Not only the action producing the injury but the resulting injury also must be intentional.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morocco </em>v. <em>Rex Lumber Co., </em>72 Conn. App. 516, 523, 805 A.2d 168 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Although it is less demanding than the actual intent standard, the substantial certainty standard is, nonetheless, an intentional tort claim requiring an appropriate showing of intent to injure on the part of the defendant. <em>Suarez I, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 109-10. This court has stated: \u201cIt is important to note that the substantial certainty standard is a subset of the intentional tort exception. . . . Whereas the intentional tort test requires that both the act producing the injury and the specific injury to the employee must be intentional . . . the substantial certainty standard requires a showing that the act producing the injury was intentional or deliberate and the resulting injury, from the standpoint of the employer, was substantially certain to result from the employer\u2019s acts or conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>63 Conn. App. 671, 679-80, 778 A.2d 972 (2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>In sum, the substantial certainty standard requires that the plaintiff establish that the employer intentionally acted in such a way that the resulting injury to the employee was substantially certain to result from the employer\u2019s conduct. Id., 680; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Lake Compounce Theme Park, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 113, 118, 889 A.2d 810 (2006). To satisfy the substantial certainty standard, a plaintiff must show more than \u201cthat [a] defendant exhibited a \u2018lackadaisical or even cavalier\u2019 attitude toward worker safety . . . .\u201d <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Doncasters, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 231, 234, 819 A.2d 287 (2003). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate that his employer believed that its conduct was substantially certain to cause the employee harm. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">With the foregoing principles in mind, we now analyze the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant violated twenty of its own safety regulations, in addition to many regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Essentially, the plaintiff claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>defendant failed to provide appropriate training to him in working with the metal bending machine and failed to take any safety precautions to prevent his injury. The plaintiff argued that the combined effect of the large number of safety violations and the lack of training created a situation that would allow a trier of fact to find that the defendant intentionally created a dangerous situation in which it had been substantially certain that his injury would occur. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">\u201cA wrongful failure to act to prevent injury is not the equivalent of an intent to cause injury.\u201d <em>Melanson </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 689 n.6. An employer\u2019s \u201cintentional, wilful or reckless violation of safety standards established pursuant to federal and state laws\u201d is not enough to extend the intentional tort exception for the exclusivity of the act. <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 678. As noted in <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 196 Conn. 104, the act contains a provision that allows for more compensation if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>injury resulted from an OSELA violation, which demonstrates a clear understanding by the legislature that such injuries would be covered by the act. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-307.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The plaintiff also provided expert testimony that his injuries were substantially certain to occur. The critical flaw in the plaintiffs argument, however, is that it ignores the requirement of a showing of the employer\u2019s <em>subjective </em>belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur. It is not the gravity of the employer\u2019s conduct that comes under scrutiny but, rather, the employer\u2019s subjective belief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Suarez II, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 279. Thus, an opinion by an expert that an injury was substantially certain to occur does not support the requirement that the <em>defendant </em>believed that its conduct was substantially certain to cause the employee harm. See <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Doncasters, Inc., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Although the defendant admitted that, because the machine was capable of bending metal, it knew that it could probably harm a person, there is no evidence that the plaintiff was instructed to work with the machine turned on. Here, the evidence submitted indicates that the machine was turned off when the plaintiff inserted his hand into the machine and that the machine was turned on as a result of miscommunication with another employee. Because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to the defendant\u2019s intent to create a dangerous situation that it knew was substantially certain to injure him, the court properly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In this opinion ROGERS, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\"> The plaintiffs wife, Maria Borrero, also is a plaintiff.

I respectfully disagree that the plaintiff Eduardo Martinez has not presented evidentiary facts or substantial evidence to defeat a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In this case, the plaintiff submitted evidence that his injury was caused at the point of operation of a metal forming machine when its clamp severed his forearm. He was loading and positioning metal into the machine when a coworker, without verbal clearance from the plaintiff, put the machine into operation. The plaintiffs work assignment to assist in the loading and positioning of metal into the machine, which bent or formed metal under pressure, was improper. The operation of the machine required the plaintiffs coworker to have his back to the plaintiff while the plaintiff loaded and positioned metal at the machine\u2019s point of operation. At the time, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) found that the machine had no guards or sensing devices to prevent its operation while an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>employee was loading and positioning metal into the point of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The plaintiff also submitted a copy of the safety plan of the defendant employer, the Southington Metal Fabricating Company. That plan stated that its purpose was to avoid injury at the workplace. With reference to a forming machine, the plan specifically stated that the point of operation must be guarded where it can cause injury and that an interlocking device must be considered. A pressure sensing device, as required for point of operation devices, must protect the machine operator by interlocking into the control circuit to prevent or stop its slide motion if the operator\u2019s hand or other part of his body is within the sensing field of the device during the operation of the press slide. The plan also required guards to protect all areas of point of entry to the point of operation not protected by the pressure sensing device. The plan also required that all employees be given regular and continuing safety training. The plaintiff submitted evidence that neither he nor his coworker operating the machine had received any safety training.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>229 Conn. 99, 111-12, 639 A.2d 507 (1994) <em>(Suarez I), </em>our Supreme Court held that a showing much like that made by the plaintiff here would allow a finder of fact to infer that the employer believed an injury was substantially certain to follow from his acts or conduct. The jury in <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>242 Conn. 255, 280, 698 A.2d 838 (1997) <em>(Suarez II), </em>did not draw such an inference but did find that the employer intended to injure the employee, albeit, our Supreme Court held, without sufficient evidence of specific intent to injure. Our Supreme Court remarked in <em>Suarez II </em>that the evidence presented might sustain a finding that the employer believed an injury was substantially certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>to occur where ill will or malevolence on the part of the employer was not required. Id., 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">In this case, the plaintiff produced evidence of specific violations of the employer\u2019s own safety manual and OSHA requirements for safety devices within and outside the forming machine and evidence that the operators were not trained in the safe operation of the machine. The plaintiff also produced expert evidence that this conduct made the plaintiffs injury a predictable and substantially certain event.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">As to the requirement that the defendant could be found to have believed to a substantial certainty that the conduct would result in employee injury, it must be considered that the employer adopted its own specific safety plan to avoid such an injury with a metal forming machine and then knowingly did not implement the plan in any way. The defendant\u2019s multiple failures to obey OSHA requirements, which it promised to abide by in the safety plan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is further evidence of the knowing nature of the employer\u2019s conduct. When considered with the employer\u2019s knowledge of the danger inherent in the improper use of the metal forming machine, I believe that a trier of fact could find an intentional injury defined as one that the employer believed was substantially certain<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to follow from the employer\u2019s acts or conduct. Although a failure to make the workplace safe may not itself render an employer\u2019s conduct intentional, when, as here, that fact is coupled with the employer\u2019s recognition in its safety plan that the forming machine must be made safe to avoid employee injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>at the point of operation, the combination may render the conduct intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">I would conclude that the plaintiffs submissions raise an issue of material fact regarding the defendant\u2019s conduct toward the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s knowledge that his injury was substantially certain to occur. See <em>Suarez I, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 111. \u201c[Wjhether the actor knows that the consequences of his or her conduct are certain or substantially certain to result from his or her act and still proceeds with the conduct, so that he or she should be treated by the law as though he or she in fact desired to produce the result, is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\"> The plan states: \u201cIt is the intent, of [the defendant] to comply with all laws concerning the operation of the business and the health and safety of our employees and the public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\"> Our Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, adopted a trial court\u2019s decision that defined substantially certain as equivalent to inevitability.
