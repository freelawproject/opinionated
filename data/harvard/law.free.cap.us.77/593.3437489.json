United States.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b605-9\">An ancient claim against the United States, founded on loan certificates issued by the Continental Congress in 1777, and sent to the loan office in Georgia, to be given in exchange for money when countersigned hy the loan officer of that State, rejected; there being no sufficient evi-. dence that the certificates were countersigned and issued as required by the legislation which authorized them; the same claim having been rejected in 1792 hy Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary o' the Treasury, and there being no sufficient evidence now that the facts then assumed by him as the basis of his conclusions wore unfounded. The claim being moreover considered by this court as without equity.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-10\">Appeal from the Court of Claims; tho ease being thus: The Continental Congress, o,n the 3d day of October, 1776, being in want of five millions o.f dollars to prosecute the war, resolved to borrow it on what were called loan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>office certificates, and to establish a loan office in each State for the convenience of the lenders of money. The resolution directed the appointment by the authority of the State of a commissioner of loans, whose duty it was to receive the certificates from the Treasurer of the United States, and to deliver them for such sums of money as he should be able to borrow. The faith of the government was pledged to redeem these certificates when countersigned by this officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">In continuation of its policy on this subject, Congress, on the 15th of January and the 22d of February, 1777, provided for a further issue of this class of securities on the basis of the resolutions of the preceding October. Accordingly, certificates in proper form, duly signed by the designated Federal officer, were transmitted to the different loan offices of the country to be given in exchange for money, when countersigned by the loan officer of the State. Some of these certificates were sent to the loan office of Georgia, and among them forty-three, now in the possession of one Ward, as treasurer of a company called the Ohio Company, an old land company composed originally largely of Revolutionary soldiers, and which forty-three certificates made the foundation of the claim in the court below. His petition alleged that they were duly issued and in possession of a <em>bond fide </em>holder on December 28d, 1781, and about 1787 came into the possession of the Ohio Company, and he now claimed payment from the United States; representing apparently the Ohio Company, the real owner in the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">The Court of Claims decided at first in favor of the claim, but the matter was referred back by Congress for a further consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-8\">On this second hearing the court found as matter, of .fact thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-9\">\u201c2. That it was unknown and could not be ascertained who was the commissioner for the State of Georgia, or whether any such commissioner had been appointed and authorized to countersign such loan certificates; that at the time of the transaction there was no formal loan office in Georgia, and that a large part of the State was in the possession of the public enemy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\u201c3. That the said loan certificates were not signed by any duly authorized commissioner for the State of Georgia, but that they bore a certificate in the words following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">\u201c\u2018Countersigned: By order of j. A.' Treutlin, Esq., Governor of Georgia. E. Davis, Jr.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\">\u201c4. That there was no evidence to show that E. Davis, Jr,, was a commissioner for Georgia, or that he was ever reputed to be such, or that he was authorized to countersign such loan certificates by the State or by the governor of Georgia, or that these are the veritable signatures of E. Davis, Jr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-8\">\u201c 5. That interest on certain loan certificates-, similar to those in action, was paid by the Treasury Department up to the 23d December, 1781, and that on twenty-nine of the certificates in action interest for four years has also been paid by the defendants, and duly noted and indorsed thereupon, and that no objection to these or similar loan certificates, or to the authority of E. Davis, Jr., to act as commissioner, was taken by the defendants until the year 1792.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-9\">\u201c6. That no direct consideration or value ever passed to the defendants from tbe claimant or from any other person for the said loan.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-10\">In regard to the question about which the Court of Claims certified that no evidence showed it, to wit, whether E. Davis, Jr., was commissioner of loans for the State, &amp;c., it appeared that the questions had been considered in 1792 by Mr. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and that in a report dated the 28th of March, 1792, and published at the time, he stated as the result of \u201c diligent inquiry\u201d on the subject, that he had been unable to obtain evidence either of the appointment of E. Davis to the office of commissioner of loans for Georgia, of that he was ever known or reputed to have acted in that capacity; and that there was no evidence that the paper which he put in circulation had been issued for any purpose of the United States. With this report papers were transmitted to Congress tending to justify his conclusion, and to show that the certificates were placed in the hands of Davis by the executive council of Georgia, to purchase goods for the State. These papers eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>sistecl qf an affidavit of John Wereat, auditor, of Georgia, and a long time resident there, denying that Davis, whom he well knew, was at any time commissioner of loans; of letters from Diehard Wyllzhyr, commissioner of loans of the State in 1791, giving his opinion to the same effect, and a communication from .Samuel Steick, of Governor Houston\u2019s staff, that the certificates'were issued on State account.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-6\">The payment of interest Secretary Hamilton conceived to have been unauthorized, and made by mistake of one of the treasurers, a certain Hillegas. He notes that such mistakes had occurred, and that there were examples of payment on both forged and counterfeit-certificates; a payment which he observes \u201c could not confer validity upon a claim originally destitute of' it, though it might occasion hardship to individuals, who, on the faith of that payment, might have beeu induced to become possessors of these certificates for a valuable consideration.\u201d There was, however, no intimation that such was the case with regard to these certificates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-7\">In 1795 the same certificates apparently were presented by one Tracy \u201c for Benjamin Talmadge,\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> who sought to have them funded, but, in consequence of the objections previously made to them by Mr. Hamilton, they -were rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-8\">According to a statement of Ward, found among the public documents,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> the certificates were presented to the treasury in 1792 by Mr. Talmadge (who was treasurer of the Ohio Company from 1791 -until 1825), and remained.there until 1812. In that'year having, according- to this statement \u2022of Ward, been sold by Mr. Talmadge, treasurer of the company, at public auction, and bought by one John Delafield (though still according to Ward\u2019s statement considered the property of the Ohio Company), the certificates were withdrawn, from the treasury, and Congress was asked to pay them, on the petition of Delafield, who states-in his petition that he owned them, and wished them funded for his benefit;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Before the committee of Congress which had charge'of the subject, and of which Mr. Talmadge was chairman,' many- -letters and documents were produced; letters from Major Hugh McCall, a revolutionary officer of Georgia, and others, to show that the claim was well founded; among them a letter giving a history of the two persons already named (Wereat and Steick), who had certified in the papers accompanying Mr. Hamilton\u2019s report, in a way which made against the claims; Major McCall\u2019s letters tending to prove that Wereat .and Steick were uninformed 'of the passing events during Governor Treutlin\u2019s administration; also a certificate of Sheftall, Esq., stating that E. Davis did in the latter part of 1777 receive an appointment from Governor Treutlin \u201c similar to that of commissioner of loans,\u201d and countersign certificates. Divers well-known persons testified that Mr.' Sheftall\u2019s integrity was great, and his knowledge of events in the revolutionary war was supposed to be superior to that of any person living; that he had \u201can unusually strong memory,\u201d and that they would consider him in 1816 quite competent to speak about the matter in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">The committee, of which Mr. Talmadge was chairman, reported in successive sessions of the Fourteenth Congress in favor of the payment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But Congress did not pay the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\">On the case as found by them the Court of Claims decided as matter of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-7\">\u201c1.

Meanwhile, as is matter of historical knowledge, all the executive records in Georgia were destroyed by fire, in 1780.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And \u201c the papers of the State of Georgia, on which a settlement was made by the United States with that State,\u201d were burned in August, 1814; with other records of the United States Treasury.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-9\">Evidence of contemporaries abundant to prove the claim<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> perished before the United States provided a court to hear or perpetuate it. The time of the issue was not favorable to strict method in governmental transactions, and they were very loosely conducted. These certificates .were executed and sent to Georgia while the Continental government was on the wing from Philadelphia to Lancaster, and thence to Yorktown.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> The date was left blank, and apparently also the name of the payee, to be filled up by the State agent, and they were charged in the first instance to nobody. The State was at that time invaded and this fund was sent to enable the local government and forces to make head against the enemy, which soon after overran the rest, of Georgia, took its capital, and drove its executive officers from the State.<footnotemark>||</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-10\">In a report to the House of Hepresentativ\u00e9s, in 17 97,<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Honorable Dwight Foote, chairman of the committee on claims, said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-6\">\u201cIt will be recollected that at the commencement of the war the United States were destitute of money, and during a long period of years afterwards were obliged to rely principally on credit in all of their important operations. Having at that time no settled National government, a regular system for conducting publm business, especially money transactions depending on credit, was not to be expected. Great numbers of individuals were necessarily invested with the power of binding the-public by their contracts. Almost every officer of the army, whether in the commissary department or otherwise, in different stages of the war, had it in his power to contract debts legally or equitably binding on the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-7\">In view of these circumstances, this case should be judged without unfriendly'presumptions from the absence of evidence which perished by time or fire before a court was allowed to hear or perpetuate it, or from that apparent want of method in the transaction which came of the exigencies of the Revolution, to promote which these certificates were expended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-8\">But the positive recognition of the claim is great. The payment of interest for four years, which was of course indorsed on the certificate, gave them a currency which was above all reproach. They were payable to bearer. The report of 1792, doubtless prepared by a clerk, bears the signature of Alexander Hamilton, and the shadow of his great name seems to have thenceforth obscured the case. But that report was largely founded on the testimony of Wereat and Steick, whose knowledge, the far better information of Mr. Sheftall shows to have been bad, in regard to the relation which E. Davis, Jr., bore to these certificates; and in this tribunal no name, however high, and .no error, however ancient or often repeated, if finally refuted, should stop the course of justice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Talbot, <em>for the United </em>States,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae_\">relied largely upon the report of Mr. Hamilton, whose knowledge was confempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>rary knowledge, and who above all statesmen of the day would have paid any claim against the United States which was not plainly unfounded.

It will be conceded, if they were not executed as required by the legislation on the subject, that they were irregularly issued, and the United States under no obligation to pay them unless they ai\u2019e estopped in some way from interposing this defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">It .becomes, therefore, of importance, in the first instance, to ascertain whether E. Davis, Jr., who countersigned them, as he says, by order of J. A. Treutliu, governor of Georgia, was commissioner of loans for the State, and whether he negotiated them on account of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Fortunately, these questions were considered in 1792 by Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, who was charged by Congress With their investigation. In his report of the 28th of March of that year, he \u2018states as the result of diligent inquiry on the subject, that he had been unable to obtain evidence either of the appointment of E. Davis to the \u2018 office of commissioner of loans for Geoi\u2019gia, or' that he was ever known or reputed to have acted in that capacity, and that there was no evidence that the paper \u25a0vyhich he put in circulation had been issued for aiiy purpose of the United States. With this report papers were transmitted not only justifying the conclusion reached- by the Secretary, but tending strongly to-show that the certificates were placed in the hands of Davis by the executive council of Georgia to purchase goods for the State. These papers consist of an affidavit'of John Wereat, auditor of Georgia, and a long time resident there, denying that Davis, whom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>he well knew,.was at anytime commissioner of loans; of lettei\u2019s from Diehard Wyllzhyr, commissioner of loans of the State in 1791, giving his opinion to the same effect, and a communication from Samuel Steick, of Governor Houston\u2019s staff, that the certificates were issued on State account.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This report, with the accompanying papers, was published, and, of course, read by the holders of the disputed paper. If in their power to deny it, interested as they were to do sp, it would at least have' been attempted. As no contradictory proof was furnished to the Treasury Department, always ready and willing to receive it, it is fair to infer that none existed. But this considei\u2019ation did not prevent the holders, of this paper from seeking to get it funded in 1795. They were met by the accounting officers of the treasury with the sa\u00edne objections taken by Mr. Hamilton, and, as these were not removed,' the same result followed. In this condition of things, if the controversy had been between individuals, and there had been another forum to hear and decide it, it would have been resorted to at once, unless the decision of the first tribunal was accepted as final. But the.holders of these certificates acted differently. Instead of taking an immediate appeal to Congress from the decision of the treasury, they waited until two decades had passed away. Nahum Ward says that these identical certificates were presented to the treasury in 1792, by Mr. Talmadge, and remained there until 1812,- when they were withdrawn and Congress asked to pay, them, on the petition of John Delafield, who professed to possess them in his own right.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Why this delay of twenty years? No reason is even suggested for it, and none can be given which is consistent with the conduct of men 'in the ordinary affairs of life. It is absurd to suppose that any one, informed of the grouuds of. objection to a controverted claim, if there were evidence \u2022to remove them, would delay action on the subject until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>thirty-four years had passed since the transaction, out of which .the claim had.arisen, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">It is' said the forum was- changed because of newly discovered evidence, and for proof of this we are referred to the reports of Mr. Talmadge, chairman of the committee, on the petition of John Delaiield, made to Congress in 1816 with the accompanying papers. It is hard to reconcile these reports with the ownership of the property as claimed by Nahum Ward. He says the Ohio Company has owned the forty-three certificates since 1791, and yet Delaiield stated in his petition that'he owned them, and wished them funded for his benefit, and we must suppose the Congress of that day,..and especially Mr.'Tallmadge, believed the fact to. be as stated by Delaiield. At any rate the Ohio Company is estopped from denying the change of ownership, as Ward \u25a0says that Mr. Talmadge, who was treasurer of the company . from 1791 until 1825, was ordered to sell the certificates,by the company, and did sell them at public auction to Delaiield. It is true he couples this statement with another, that, notwithstanding Delaiield\u2019s purchase, they were-.-cens-ideied as the company\u2019s property; but this would place. Mr. T-dmadg\u00e9 in the predicament of aiding, while a member-ef \u25a0 ie National legislature, to procure the payment of a di\u00e9putiiddebt for a company of which he was an important'officer.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">And why the necessity of selling at all unless there were an honest purpose of parting with-the title to the property? It surely was as easy to prosecute a just claim before \u25a0Obngress in .the name of a corporation as in the name of,a natural person. If, then, Delaiield purchased the claim, free from any trust, as we are bound to suppose in -order' to relieve the Ohio Company and their treasurer' -from censure-, he did it at his own risk and for a venture, and took it subject to all equities. He cannot plead want of notice of' the defences interposed by the United States,., because the company of whom he bought, and of which he was a member, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>were well informed on the subject. It does not appear how or when the title got back in the Ohio Company, nor is it of any consequence, as the company occupies the same position in this litigation that Delafield would had he retained the ownership of the certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\u25a0 But, apart from this view of the subject, these reports do not change the status of the parties to this controversy. The evidence they furnish comes too late, is chiefly hearsay in its character, and should have, no weight in the deter-: mination of the questions in dispute. It consists mainly of lengthy letters from Major Hugh McCall, of Georgia, addressed to Mr. Talmadge, which seem to be iu the nature of arguments against the position taken by the government. One of them is devoted to a futile effort to prove that Wereat and Steick were uninformed of the passing events during Governor Tr\u00e9utlin\u2019s administration. It ,is true 'the certificate of Mr. Sheftall tends to show that Davis did act in the capacity of commissioner of loans, but although it is certified that he had an unusually strong memory, we place but little reliance on his recollection in 1816, of what transpired in the commissary department of Georgia in 1777-78. Especially do we distrust his memory of these events when it is in opposition to the recollection of others, equally trustworthy, who testified in 179\u00a3\u00a1, twenty-four years nearer.the time when the certificates were put in circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">It is. urged that the United States is not in a position to, contest the .validity of these certificates, because of the pay- , ment of interest for a period of four years. The report of Mr. Hamilton takes the ground that the interest was paid by the mistake of the treasurer, and without authority, and therefore not binding on the United States. It is very clear that there was no <em>purpose </em>on the part of the government to ratify the acts of Davis, for the paper-bearing his name was rejected, as soon as the attention of the proper department was called to it. .But it is not-necessary to discuss the general rules of law on the subject of ratification, and to show in what state of case they are applicable, for, in our judgment, under the circumstances of the claim, as they appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>in this case, there is no equity raised in favor of the Oh-io Company against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Without pursuing the subject further, or noticing the various reports in Congress adverse to this claim, we are satisfied it is not a just charge on the treasury of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\"> See American State Papers, class ix, vol.
