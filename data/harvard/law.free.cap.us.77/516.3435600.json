The act continues :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-9\">\u201c The finding of the court upon the facts, which finding shall be general or special, shall have the same effect as the verdict of'a jury. The rulings of the court in the progress of the trial when excepted to at the time, may be reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States upon a writ of error or upon appeal, provided the rulings be duly presented -by a bill of exceptions. When the finding is special, the review may also extend to the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-10\">With this enactment in force Richardson sued Coddington in the court below, in trover to recover damages for the conversion' of certain horses and mules. The declaration contained two counts, the first for the conversion of the whole, and the second for the conversion of the undivided half of sixty-four horses and forty-five mules.. By consent the case was tried, by the court without the intervention of a jury, on the plea of the general issue and joinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-11\">The court found on the 5th July, 1866, \u201c that the plaintiff was the owner of an undivided interest of one-half in forty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>eight mules and fifty-two horses, part of the property described in the declaration, and that the defendant converted \u25a0the said interest to his own use, and thereupon assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $5000,\u201d and gave judgment accordingly. \u2022 The defendant moved for a new trial, which being denied, he filed, with-leave of the court, on the BOtlx of January, 1868, a bill of exception\u2019s. The bill began:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">\u201cBe it remembered that upon the trial of this cause, by agreement of the respective parties present in court, and their attorneys, a jury was waived, and the cause was tried by the court by stipulation in writing, <em>and all just and legal objections and exceptions which might be made were reserved by each party; </em>and plaintiff, in order to maintain the issue in his behalf, introduced and read in evidence the depositions,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">After setting forth a great deal of evidence the bill ended thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">\u201c This was all the evidence offered or introduced in the cause by either of the parties, and the court thereupon found the issue for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at the sum of $5000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">\u201c Whereupon the defendant moved the court for a new trial upon the grounds following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">\u201c1st. The finding and judgment of the court is erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-10\">\u201c2d. The .damages were erroneously computed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-11\">\u201c 3d. The finding as to the damages was not warranted by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-12\">\u201c Which motion .the court overruled, and rendered judgment upon the finding against the defendant; to which sev\u00bfral findings and rulings of the court, <em>m finding the issue for the plaintiff, in assessing the damages for the plaintiff, and in overruling the motion for a new trial, and in rendering judgment for the plaintiff, </em>the said defendant, by his counsel, severally excepted at the time of such finding, overruling, and judgment respectively, and prays that this his bill of exceptions may be signed and sealed by the court, which is done.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-13\"><em>Mr, W.

The only statement after closing the evidence, is, \u201c and the court thereupon found the issue for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at the sum of $5000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">There is no question of law arising upon the pleadings or the trial. Those attempted to be raised refer to the evidence,'as embodied in the record, but which, in a trial of the facts before- the court, a jury being waived, we do not look into. We look into them only when found by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
