The production of a circular of prior date, with other terms as to compensation, does not alter the case.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-13\">. Error to the Circuit Court for the District of Missouri; the case being this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-14\">Stagg became the agent of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, in October, 1849, by his acceptance of a circular which contained this language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-15\">\u201c The usual compensation of agents, so far as we know, is 10 per cent, commission on the premiums, with one dollar for each policy, and 5 per cent..on the premiums on the renewal of policies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-16\">This circular gave him certain instructions about his agency, and some suggestions as to the modes of inducing persons to insure with the company. In about a year after-wards he received another circular like the former one in its main purpose, but'much more full and specific; a sort of short essay on the subject of life insurance, setting forth its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>advantages, and pointing out the various reasons which the agent might advantageously suggest to persons whom he should address, why they should insure their lives, and do this with the Connecticut company rather than with any other company. This second circular, intended obviously for his careful perusal and study throughout, contained, in lieu of the language above cited, from the first one, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">\u201cFor your services, as above, you will be allowed a commission of 10 per cent, on the first premiums (cash and notes), and 5 per cent, on all subsequent renewal premiums, <em>so long as you continue the agent of the company.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">The plaintiff received and acted on this latter paper for about fifteen years, when he was <em>discharged. </em>He now brought this suit, claiming some $3000, as the 5 per cent, commission on the renewal premiums of policies originally made -by him as agent, which had been received by the company since he was discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-7\">To support this claim he undertook to prove'by other insurance agents that such was the custom as between insurance companies and their agents. But the court ruled as matter of law that there was an express contract in the case, and that the custom could not be admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-8\">It also ruled that the later circular was substituted as a new contract instead of the first one, and that its fair construction was to limit the agency to the pleasure of the company, and to.terminate the right of the agent to commissions on renewal premiums with the revocation of his agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-9\">These rulings, or more particularly the second one, made the error complained of. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-10\">\n<em>Mr. J. C. Moody, 'for the plaintiff in error :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-11\">\"When Stagg received the second circular, he had already a contract with the'company fixing the terms of his agency. He knew they could not be changed without his consent. If .the company wanted to-change them he might well have presumed that they would address him directly upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>subject. He might have overlooked the little clause in question of the second circular entirely, covered up, as it was, in a mass of other matters; or, if it had caught his attention, he might have thought that it was meant for subsequently employed agents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">Now, if he did not'notice the clause, that is to say, if he did not really apprehend it as a proposition directly made to 1pm, how shall he be bound by it? It becomes, then, a main question in the case, \u201cIs it so plain that the circular was meant to bring about a change in the terms of Stagg\u2019s agency, that the law will impute to him a recognition of such intent?\u201d Let it be kept in mind that it takes two to make a bargain, and as many to <em>unmake </em>one. The use proposed to be made of this circular is to unmake a bargain of a year\u2019s standing; to convert the circular into a direct personal address to Stagg, saying: \u201cEither give up your contract entitling you to an interest in renewals, or by which you claim such interest, or resign.\u201d But the Connecticut Life Insurance Company was possessed of no authority to deal with its. agents in this military stylo. It had contracted with Stagg, and if'it -was dissatisfied with its contract, it should have addressed him directly on the subject, in the usual way of conducting a business correspondence. The clause in the circular looks like a trap .'to catch the unwary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-6\">But assuming that the circular is the equivalent of a\u2019direct appeal in the usual mode of a commercial correspondence, proposing that Stagg accept of the new terms or resign, is his silence acceptance of the new terms? <em>We </em>deny that it is. If A. has bought a horse of-B., and obtained possession at the agreed price of $200, Would he be bound to take any notice whateverof a note from B. informing him that if he retained \u25a0the horse he would expect $500 for him ? If an auctioneer had sold a hundred horses, and delivered them, or a hundred houses, and delivered them, could ho impose new terms upon the purchasers through the instrumentality of a circul\u00e1r like this? Of course not,.in either ease. Stagg, before and at the issuing and reception of the circ\u00fakir, had his contract with the company, and possession under it. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>no more bound to answer a proposition from the company for new terms than was the company to answer a similar proposition from him. The limit of his right in that direction was to write to the company, saying: \u201c Send me better terms, or I resign.\u201d The limits of the company\u2019s right with him was a direct note, saying: \u201c Accept harder terms, or we turn you out.\u201d It could not even say, \u201cAccept the harder terms, or resign.\u201d If it had, he would not have been bound to resign. Nor would his failing to resign afford an argument that he had accepted the harder term.s. lie had, in that view, the right of continuing on under his old contract until <em>removed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-5\">So we may say that, admitting the clause referred to in the circular was meant for Stagg; that he so understood it; that he was bound to treat it as a'direct proposition to accept the new terms or resign (all which matters we deny), it put no obligation upon him either of accepting the new terms or of resigning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-6\">The company not being possessed of power to compel his resignation, but only to remove him, he might well wait to see, if after all, they would go so far as to turn him off. Possibly they might not do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-7\">We do not deny that the agency held under the letter of 1848 was held at the pleasure of the principal. Our proposition is that, being so held, the' company never revoked it until they removed Stagg in 1864; that the agency was not revoked by the circular of 1849.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Atn\">\n<em>Mr. J. M. Krum, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b604-9\">Mr. Justice MILLEE</author>\n<p id=\"Aiy\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The right of the insurance company to terminate the agency of the plaintiff, at its discretion, is not denied by his counsel, nor is there any serious effort to support the offer to prove the custom. Indeed, if the court was right in holding that the contract between the parties was expressed by the language of the second circular, it is quite clear there was no room for usage, for it is there expressly stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the commission on the renewal premiums, like 'those on the original premiums, was to be paid only so long as the plaintiff continued to be the agent of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Nor can we doubt for a moment that the later circular must bo held to represent the agreement of the parties as to compensation. After having received that circular and acted on it for fifteen years, received and adjusted his compensation by it, he is estopped to deny that it was the contract under which h,e acted. If there was any other contract it was for him to show it. He does not do this by producing, the circular of the year previous. If there was anything fraudulent., unfair, or illegal in the new terms offered, or in the mode in which he was induced to accept them, he should have shown it, but he' has not even attempted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We are, therefore, clearly of opinion that when it is shown that, as agent of the company, he received and acted upon that circular, he is bound by its terms as the measure of his compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
