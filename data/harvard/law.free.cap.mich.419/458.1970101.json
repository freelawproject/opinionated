It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">In <em>Benton v Maryland, </em>395 US 784; 89 S Ct 2056; 23 L Ed 2d 707 (1969), the United States Supreme Court held that the federal Double Jeopardy Clause was applicable to actions by the states. The present cases concern the third protection, the protection against multiple punishment, and, in order to decide them, as well as to give some guidance in an area that has been described as a state of \"confusion upon confusion\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\"veritable Sargasso Sea\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we must begin with a review of the multiple-punishment aspects of the Double Jeopardy Clause as declared by the United States Supreme Court, as best those decisions can be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We begin by stating what is, at least at the time of this decision, settled law. Where multiple punishment is involved, the Double Jeopardy Clause acts as a restraint on the prosecutor and the courts, not the Legislature. <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a court from imposing more punishment than that intended by the Legislature. \"[T]he question whether punishments imposed by a court after a defendant\u2019s conviction upon criminal charges are unconstitutionally multiple cannot be resolved without determining what punishments the Legislative Branch has authorized\u201d. <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684, 688; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 715 (1980). The most recent expression of this principle is found in <em>Ohio v Johnson, </em>\u2014 US \u2014; 104 S Ct 2536, 2541; 81 L Ed 2d 425, 433 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">\"In contrast to the double jeopardy protection against multiple trials, the final component, of double jeopardy \u2014protection against cumulative punishments \u2014 is designed to ensure that the sentencing discretion of courts is confined to the limits established by the legislature. Because the substantive power to prescribe crimes and determine punishments is vested with the legislature, <em>United States v Wiltberger, </em>18 US (5 Wheat) 76, 93; 5 L Ed 37 (1820), the question under the Double Jeopardy Clause whether punishments are 'multiple\u2019 is essentially one of legislative intent, see <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359; 103 S Ct 673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>As an aid to determining the intent of a legislature, the Supreme Court has used an approach which, although first established in <em>Gavieres v United States, </em>220 US 338, 342; 31 S Ct 421; 55 L Ed 489 (1911), is now known as the <em>Blockburger </em>test because of its use in <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299, 304; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\"The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">If two statutes constitute the \"same offense\u201d under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, it is presumed that the Legislature did not intend to allow the defendant to be punished under both statutes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\"The assumption underlying the rule is that [the Legislature] ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes.\u201d <em>Whalen v United States, supra, </em>pp 691-692.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The presumption raised by the test can be rebutted by a clear indication of legislative intent, and when such an intent is found, it must be respected, regardless of the outcome of the <em>Blockburger </em>test. <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 340; 101 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981); <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359; 103 S Ct 673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Although the <em>Blockburger </em>test is simply stated, it is subject to more than one interpretation, depending on the statutes involved. When one of the two statutes involved is a necessarily lesser included offense of the other, application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test will always raise the presumption that the two statutes involve the \"same offense\u201d. The necessarily included lesser offense will never have an element not required by the greater offense. Problems arise, however, when one statute is not a lesser included offense of the other. Such is the case with the so-called compound and predicate crimes that are involved in the cases before us. The compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct requires proof of a penetration during the commission of any other felony. The \"any other felony\u201d is the predicate crime, in these cases, either armed robbery or kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">If one looks only to the statutory language, the compound and predicate crimes are separate under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. First-degree criminal sexual conduct <em>requires </em>proof of a penetration, an element not required by either kidnapping or robbery. Armed robbery requires proof of an armed taking from the person or in the presence of another, and kidnapping requires the movement or confinement of another. None of these elements are, in the strict sense, <em>required </em>for the crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Any felony will do.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">If, however, one looks to how the crimes with which the defendants were charged were actually proved \u2014 the evidence used \u2014 the compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the predicate crime of either robbery or kidnapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>are not separate offenses under <em>Blockburger. </em>In the cases of <em>Robideau </em>and <em>Bouknight, </em>the prosecution convicted the defendants of the predicate crime of armed robbery and also used the predicate crime of armed robbery to establish the \"other felony\u201d to convict the defendants of the compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Similarly, in the cases of <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Brown, </em>the defendants were convicted of the predicate crime of kidnapping, and the kidnapping was used to establish the \"other felony\u201d to convict them of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Looking to the <em>facts of the case </em>instead of at the statutes in the abstract in all four cases before us, the prosecutor was required to prove the predicate crime to establish the compound crime. If <em>Block-burger </em>is applied to the facts of the cases, the compound and predicate crimes are presumptively the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">This Court and the United States Supreme Court have applied both approaches to the <em>Block-burger </em>test for reasons not always explicable. The resulting confusion has been compounded by a failure to adequately distinguish between the different interests involved in successive-prosecution versus single-prosecution cases. Nevertheless, we must begin with a review of some of the double jeopardy cases decided by the United States Supreme Court to determine whether the <em>Blockbur-ger </em>test is to be applied in the abstract or to the facts of the cases before us, or whether it should be applied at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In <em>Blockburger, </em>the defendant was convicted in a single trial of selling narcotics not in or from their original stamped package and of selling narcotics without an official written order. The two convictions resulted from the same sale. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>looked to the statutory definitions of the crimes, as evidenced by the Court\u2019s statement that \"[e]ach of the offenses created requires proof of a different element\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 304. The Court concluded that because the first statute required proof that the narcotics were not sold in or from their original container, while the second did not, and the second statute required proof that the sale was made without an official order, while the first did not, the two crimes were separate. Therefore, the defendant could be doubly punished, notwithstanding the legislative \"double-description\u201d of crimes that had made one act into two crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Although <em>Blockburger </em>did not specifically state that the test used was for determining legislative intent by looking to the statutory elements of a crime, later decisions made that point clear. In <em>Gore v United States, </em>357 US 386; 78 S Ct 1280; 2 L Ed 2d 1405 (1958), the Court stressed that <em>Block-burger </em>had been decided as a matter of legislative intent. In <em>Iannelli v United States, </em>420 US 770, 785, fn 17; 95 S Ct 1284; 43 L Ed 2d 616 (1975), the Court, in concluding that under the <em>Blockburger </em>test conspiracy to violate gambling laws and violation of gambling laws were separate offenses, stated that \"the test focuses on the statutory elements of the offense * * * notwithstanding a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The <em>Blockburger </em>test was applied in a case involving a successive prosecution in <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977). The case involved a defendant who was convicted of joy-riding. After his release from jail, he was charged with automobile theft, a crime of which joy-riding, under Ohio law, was a necessarily included lesser offense, <em>i.e., </em>all the elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>joy-riding were also elements of automobile theft. As is always the case when true necessarily included lesser and greater offenses are involved, the Court\u2019s application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test resulted in a finding that the two crimes constituted the \"same offense\u201d and, therefore, were not to be separately punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Justice Brennan, in his concurring opinion, did not apply the <em>Blockburger </em>test. He instead treated the case as if issues of multiple punishment were not involved and proposed deciding the case on the ground that the interest of the defendant in avoiding a second trial barred the second prosecution. In previous cases involving successive prosecutions, the Court had applied the factual approach of <em>In re Nielsen, </em>131 US 176; 9 S Ct 672; 33 L Ed 118 (1889). If the same evidence used in the first trial was to be substantially used in the second trial, the defendant could not constitutionally be tried a second time. As stated in <em>Nielsen, supra, </em>p 188:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\"[A] person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it * * * cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">But Justice Brennan would have gone beyond the approach of <em>Nielsen. </em>He viewed all successive prosecutions as barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause if the second trial involved a part of the same transaction litigated in the first trial. So long as the same transaction of criminal events was involved, Justice Brennan would require that all charges possible be brought against the defendant in the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The majority\u2019s decision in <em>Brown </em>was criticized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>as reaching the right decision for the wrong reason. See Westen &amp; Drubel, <em>Toward a General Theory of Double Jeopardy, </em>1978 Supreme Court Review 81, 157. Perhaps, however, the most valid criticism is that the Court failed to fully explain its reasoning. The opinion never addressed why the traditional successive prosecution analysis of <em>Nielsen, supra, </em>was not applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In our opinion, the <em>Brown </em>Court\u2019s failure to apply the reasoning of <em>Nielsen </em>appears to be explained by its statement that \"[w]here the judge is forbidden to impose cumulative punishment for two crimes at the end of a single proceeding, the prosecutor is forbidden to strive for the same result in successive proceedings\u201d. <em>Brown, supra, </em>p 166. It thus appears that <em>Brown </em>was decided as if the only issue were one of multiple punishment. Multiple punishment could not be imposed under the statutes in question, regardless of the number of trials. It was therefore unnecessary for the Court to decide whether, if allowed, multiple punishments could be imposed in separate trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In <em>Harris v Oklahoma, </em>433 US 682; 97 S Ct 2912; 53 L Ed 2d 1054 (1977), another case involving successive prosecution which also presented to the Court its first compound and predicate crimes, the Court inexplicably reverted to the analysis of <em>Nielsen </em>and ignored <em>Blockburger. </em>The Oklahoma Legislature had linked two crimes, allowing the predicate crime of robbery to act as one of the aggravating crimes which raised second-degree murder to the compound crime of first-degree felony murder. The defendant had been tried and convicted of first-degree felony murder in the course of a robbery. The defendant was subsequently tried and convicted of the predicate robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion per curiam reversing the subsequent robbery conviction, without mentioning <em>Blockburger, </em>simply stated that the conviction of the greater crime could not be had without a conviction of the lesser crime, and for authority relied upon <em>Nielsen. </em>Unlike <em>Brown, </em>the case was decided on the ground that it involved a successive prosecution. Doing so suggests that the crimes in question had satisfied the <em>Blockburger </em>test and that multiple punishments in a single trial would be allowed. That result can be reached only if one applies the <em>Blockburger </em>test to the elements of the crimes in question in the abstract, <em>i.e., </em>first-degree murder <em>requires </em>proof of a killing, which robbery, of course, does not, and robbery requires proof of a robbery, which is not <em>required </em>to establish first-degree murder (under Oklahoma law, any specified felony would do). Applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test to the facts of the case before the Court would show that robbery was, in fact, <em>required </em>to prove first-degree murder, and it would, therefore, have been unnecessary to consider the case under the analysis of <em>Nielsen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">If the Court in <em>Harris </em>had indeed silently applied the <em>Blockburger </em>test in the abstract to the statutes before it, its method of analysis could be considered consistent with prior law. After all, numerous decisions had stated that <em>Blockburger </em>looked to the statutory elements of a crime. Yet, when faced with the next case involving a compound and predicate crime, the Court applied <em>Blockburger </em>to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 715 (1980), the defendant, was charged in a single prosecution with the compound crime of first-degree felony murder and also with rape, a predicate crime which elevated second-de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>gree murder to first. In an apparent effort to achieve the same result as that reached in <em>Harris, </em>notwithstanding that <em>Harris </em>was decided in the context of successive prosecutions, the Court, despite a footnote disclaimer to the contrary, refocused <em>Blockburger </em>away from the elements of the charged crimes, The result was that the Court transformed the <em>Blockburger </em>test into one that looked to the conduct which led to the charges against the defendant or to the actual facts proved at trial, all the while suggesting that they could be indicative of legislative intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\"In this case, resort to the <em>Blockburger </em>rule leads to the conclusion that Congress did not authorize consecutive sentences for rape and for a killing committed in the course of the rape, since it is plainly not the case that 'each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019 A conviction for killing in the course of rape cannot be had without proving all the elements of the offense of rape. See <em>United States v Greene, </em>160 US App DC 21, 34; 489 F2d 1145, 1158 (1973). <em>Cf. Harris v Oklahoma, </em>433 US 682, 682-683; 97 S Ct 2912; 53 L Ed 2d 1054 (1977). The Government contends that felony murder and rape are not the 'same\u2019 offense under <em>Blockburger, </em>since the former offense does not in all cases require proof of a rape; that is, DC Code \u00a7 22-2401 (1973) proscribes the killing of another person in the course of committing rape <em>or </em>robbery <em>or </em>kidnaping <em>or </em>arson, etc. Where the offense to be proved does not include proof of rape \u2014 for example, where the offense is a killing in the perpetration of a robbery \u2014 the offense is of course different from the offense of rape, and the Government is correct in believing that cumulative punishments for the felony murder and for a rape would be permitted under <em>Blockburger. </em>In the present case, however, proof of rape is a necessary element of proof of the felony murder, and we are unpersuaded that this case should be treated differently from other cases in which one criminal offense requires proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>every element of another offense.\u201d <em>Whalen, supra, </em>pp 693-694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The dissenting justices recognized the majority\u2019s transformation of <em>Blockburger </em>into a factual test, noting that doing so was without precedent and contrary to the avowed purpose of the test to determine legislative intent. Nevertheless, the dissenters did not propose to decide the case using <em>Blockburger. </em>They instead proposed looking to all sources of legislative history rather than relying on the \"arbitrary assumptions\u201d and \"syntactical subtleties\u201d implicit in any application of <em>Blockbur-ger </em>to compound and predicate crimes. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>p 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The application of <em>Blockburger </em>to the facts of a given case when multiple punishment was involved proved to be a short-lived practice. In <em>Al-bernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 338; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981), the Court repaired to its description of the <em>Blockburger </em>test as one which \" 'focuses on the statutory elements of the offense\u2019 \u201d. The Court found that the offense of conspiracy to import marijuana and conspiracy to distribute marijuana could be separately punished even though on the facts of the case there was but one conspiracy. The Court\u2019s conclusion that the two statutes before it were separate under <em>Block-burger, </em>however, did not end its inquiry. The Court noted that the <em>Blockburger </em>test was merely a means to determine legislative intent. The presumptions created by the test could be rebutted by a clear indication of legislative intent to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The Supreme Court found such a clear indication of legislative intent in <em>Missouri v Hunter, supra. Hunter </em>involved a single prosecution where the defendant was convicted of the compound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>crime of \"armed criminal action\u201d (possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of any felony) and the underlying predicate crime on the facts of the case, armed robbery. The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of armed criminal activity, relying on decisions of the Missouri Supreme Court, which had applied the <em>Blockburger </em>test to the facts of the cases before it and concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause was offended by convictions of both armed criminal action and the predicate felony. See <em>State v Haggard, </em>619 SW2d 44 (Mo, 1981). The Missouri Supreme Court reached that conclusion notwithstanding the Missouri Legislature\u2019s express provision for double punishment in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The United States Supreme Court did not disapprove the Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Blockburger, </em>but found that the Missouri Legislature had expressly rebutted the presumption raised by the statute\u2019s failure to pass the <em>Block-burger </em>test. Even though armed criminal action and the underlying predicate, armed robbery, were the same offense under the <em>Whalen </em>factual approach to <em>Blockburger, </em>multiple punishment was permissible because the Legislature had so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of issues of multiple punishment suggests a struggle, and an unsuccessful one, to prescribe a single standard applicable to the statutes considered. It especially evidences recent difficulty in multiple punishment cases where compound, or legislatively linked, crimes are involved. In multiple punishment cases, the Court, with one exception, has applied the <em>Blockburger </em>test to the statutory elements of crimes. This one exception, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>which looked to the facts of a case involving a compound and predicate crime, is analogous to the present case. The question left unanswered by the Supreme Court is whether the analysis of <em>Whalen </em>is the proper analysis when compound and predicate crimes are involved. The inconsistency of federal case law forces us to turn to state law for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In comparison with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of issues of multiple punishment, our Court\u2019s experience has been similarly rocky, although we have followed a somewhat different path. As was the experience of the United States Supreme Court, the first double jeopardy cases to come before this Court involved successive prosecutions. In <em>People v Cox, </em>107 Mich 435; 65 NW 283 (1895), the defendant was tried and convicted of keeping a bawdy house. He was later tried and convicted of keeping the same house as a house of ill fame under a separate statute. In an opinion by Justice Hooker, this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, finding that on the facts of the case one statute was included within the other. The opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Nielsen, supra, </em>was found to be \"decisive\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">By the time this Court first dealt with an issue of multiple punishment in a single trial, a factual, same-evidence approach was well established in successive prosecution cases. See <em>People v Cook, </em>236 Mich 333; 210 NW 296 (1926); <em>People v Beverly, </em>247 Mich 353; 225 NW2d 481 (1929). In <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973), this Court even extended the double jeopardy protection from successive prosecutions by adopting, under the Michigan Constitution, Justice Brennan\u2019s transactional approach. See <em>Ashe v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 448; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970) (Brennan, J., <em>concurring). </em>This approach expands the United States Supreme Court\u2019s same-evidence test by forbidding a second trial when part of the criminal transaction has been subject to a prior trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303; 247 NW2d 303 (1976), this Court faced its first single-prosecution, multiple-punishment case. The defendant had been convicted both of delivery of heroin and possession of heroin. Without reference to <em>Block-burger </em>or to legislative intent, we found that the prohibition against double jeopardy had been violated because \"[possession of the heroin present in <em>this </em>case was that necessary to its delivery\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 307. The rationale for looking to the facts of the case to see if any facts were doing double duty with respect to the two statutes was <em>People v Cook, supra, </em>a successive prosecution case. See, also, <em>People v Stewart (On Rehearing), </em>400 Mich 540; 256 NW2d 31 (1977), which applied the same analysis and reached the same result under the statutes replaced by those considered in <em>Martin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">This Court first faced a compound and predicate crime situation in <em>Wayne County Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374; 280 NW2d 793 (1979), <em>app dis sub nom Brintley v Michigan, </em>444 US 948; 100 S Ct 418; 63 L Ed 2d 317 (1979). There, the two defendants had been convicted of the compound crime of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and also of an underlying predicate felony, either murder or armed robbery. We applied the <em>Blockburger </em>test to the statutes in the abstract and found that the two crimes were separate: murder does not require use of a firearm and felony-firearm does not require the predicate felony to be murder; armed robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>does not require the use of a firearm and felony-firearm does not require the predicate felony to be armed robbery. More importantly, we recognized for the first time that issues of multiple punishment were to be decided by determining what the Legislature intended. Because the Legislature had expressly provided that felony-firearm was to be punished separately from and consecutive to the predicate felony, all double jeopardy concerns were satisfied. Since the decision in <em>Wayne County Prosecutor, </em>however, we have failed to look to legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79; 289 NW2d 674 (1980), the defendant, in a transaction arising out of a robbery of a gas station, was charged with and convicted in a single trial of larceny over $100, larceny in a building, and armed robbery. We applied the <em>Blockburger </em>test, but to the facts of the case rather than to the statutes in the abstract. As a matter of Michigan constitutional law, we found that multiple punishment under the statutes was impermissible because on the facts of the case before the Court the same facts proved all three crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328; 308 NW2d 112 (1981), we confronted, as did the United States Supreme Court in <em>Whalen, </em>a single prosecution where the defendant was convicted of both the compound crime of first-degree felony murder and of the underlying predicate felony. Again, we applied a method of analysis taken from successive-prosecution cases such as <em>Cook </em>and <em>Harris, </em>and looked to the facts of the case. Because, in the case before the Court, proof of the charged predicate felony also served as proof of the compound felony of first-degree murder, we found that convictions of both crimes on the facts of the case violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>We next decided <em>People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558; 330 NW2d 314 (1982). There, the defendant was convicted in a single trial of both aiding and abetting the crime of extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion. We found no federal double jeopardy violation after applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test to the statutes in the abstract. Each crime required proof of an element not required by the other. We also found no violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy under a factual approach even though the facts used to establish the aiding and abetting could also have established the conspiracy. Other facts also had been introduced into evidence which could have proved the conspiracy. In essence, for the reason that the prosecutor over-proved his case, we found no violation of the Michigan prohibition against double jeopardy. Still, we recognized that it is the intent of the Legislature which should be determinative. That realization is implicit in our statement that the crimes involved were not of the \"class or category\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Our latest experience with issues of multiple punishment came in <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95; 341 NW2d 68 (1983). There, we dealt not with the issue of multiple punishment under two statutes, but, instead, with multiple punishment under a single statute. The issue before the Court was whether the robbery of two grocery store cashiers constituted one or two robberies. Our focus was entirely on the robbery statute and legislative intent. Because only one statute was involved, an analysis under <em>Blockburger </em>was unnecessary. Our task was only to determine what act the Legislature had made criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We concluded in <em>Wakeford </em>that the Legislature intended separate robbery convictions for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>person robbed, the focus of robbery being on the assault against a person and not on the owner of the property taken. In doing so, we rejected the claim that the defendant\u2019s convictions were invalid because some of the same evidence was used in proving both robberies. <em>Wakeford, </em>however, does not answer the question now before us. Multiple punishment analysis when only one statute is involved has never been burdened by a shifting interpretation of <em>Blockburger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">As can be seen from the above review, when more than one statute is involved, Michigan\u2019s double jeopardy analysis has been no more consistent than federal double jeopardy analysis. We do come to the conclusion that much of the inconsistency in double jeopardy analysis results from the failure to clearly distinguish between single-prosecution and successive-prosecution cases. We will, therefore, undertake that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Successive-prosecution cases involve the core values of the Double Jeopardy Clause, the common-law concepts of <em>autrefois acquit </em>and <em>convict. </em>See <em>Bartkus v Illinois (On Rehearing), </em>359 US 121, 151; 79 S Ct 676; 3 L Ed 2d 684 (1959) (Black, J., <em>dissenting). </em>Where successive prosecutions are involved, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects the individual\u2019s interest in not having to twice \"run the gauntlet\u201d, in not being subjected to \"embarrassment, expense and ordeal\u201d, and in not being compelled \"to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity\u201d, with enhancement of the \"possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty\u201d. <em>Green v United States, </em>355 US 184, 187, 190; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">To protect this interest, the United States Supreme Court has adopted a factual-evidentiary approach, <em>Nielsen, supra, </em>and, where appropriate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>a collateral estoppel approach, <em>Ashe v Swenson, supra. </em>Both these approaches look to the evidence produced at the first trial to determine if the same facts or issues will be proved at the second. But these approaches are limited. They allow for the possibility that a transaction could be divided into discrete offenses, with successive trials for each offense. To preclude that possibility, this Court, in <em>People v White, </em>adopted Justice Brennan\u2019s transactional approach as the standard by which the propriety of a second prosecution is judged under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Different interests are involved when the issue is purely one of multiple punishments, without the complications of a successive prosecution. The right to be free from vexatious proceedings simply is not present. The only interest of the defendant is in not having more punishment imposed than that intended by the Legislature. The intent of the Legislature, therefore, is determinative. Under neither the federal nor the Michigan double jeopardy provisions does this Court sit as a superlegislature, instructing the Legislature on what it can make separate crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As previously described, prior decisions of this Court have applied a factual test in single-trial multiple-punishment cases, creating areas in which arguably the Legislature cannot now act. To the extent that those decisions interpret the prohibition against double jeopardy as a substantive limitation on the Legislature, we now disavow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">We are therefore left only with the question of what the Legislature intended in cases such as those at bar. As a means of determining that end, we find the <em>Blockburger </em>test to have questionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>status in the Supreme Court of the United States and find the propriety of its use in any case to be questionable. When applied in the abstract to the statutory elements of an offense, it merely serves to identify true lesser included offenses. While it may be true that the Legislature ordinarily does not intend multiple punishments when one crime is completely subsumed in another, <em>Blockburger </em>itself is of no aid in making the ultimate determination. Although its creation of a presumption may make a court\u2019s task easier, it may also induce a court to avoid difficult questions of legislative intent in favor of the wooden application of a simplistic test.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Because <em>Blockburger </em>was developed to deal with situations where an identifiable single act falls under the coverage of two statutes, it is even less helpful when applied to a compound crime. In these crimes, the Legislature has intentionally converted what would normally be two discrete acts into one legislatively created \"act\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The difficulties with the <em>Blockburger </em>test lead us to the conclusion that it should be abandoned. The United States Supreme Court has declared that it is but a test of statutory construction and not a principle of constitutional law. <em>Missouri v Hunter, supra. </em>Indeed, it would be quite contrary to established principles of federalism for the United States Supreme Court to impose on the states the method by which they must interpret the actions of their own legislatures. We, therefore, find it within our power to reject the <em>Blockburger </em>test, preferring instead to use traditional means to determine the intent of the Legislature: the subject, language, and history of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">At times, this will be a difficult task. The Legislature rarely reveals its intentions with a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>statement. Yet the difficulty in determining the intent of the Legislature cannot be cause for furthering the use of a test which reveals little, if anything, about legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Some general principles can be stated. Statutes prohibiting conduct that is violative of distinct social norms can generally be viewed as separate and amenable to permitting multiple punishments. A court must identify the type of harm the Legislature intended to prevent. Where two statutes prohibit violations of the same social norm, albeit in a somewhat different manner, as a general principle it can be concluded that the Legislature did not intend multiple punishments. For example, the crimes of larceny over $100, MCL 750.356; MSA 28.588, and larceny in a building, MCL 750.360; MSA 28.592, although having separate elements, are aimed at conduct too similar to conclude that multiple punishment was intended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">A further source of legislative intent can be found in the amount of punishment expressly authorized by the Legislature. Our criminal statutes often build upon one another. Where one statute incorporates most of the elements of a base statute and then increases the penalty as compared to the base statute, it is evidence that the Legislature did not intend punishment under both statutes. The Legislature has taken conduct from the base statute, decided that aggravating conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>deserves additional punishment, and imposed it accordingly, instead of imposing dual convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We do not intend these principles to be an exclusive list. Whatever sources of legislative intent exist should be considered. If no conclusive evidence of legislative intent can be discerned, the rule of lenity requires the conclusion that separate punishments were not intended.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As evidenced by the divisions in the United States Supreme Court in <em>Whalen </em>and in this Court in <em>Wayne County Prosecutor, </em>legislatively linked compound and predicate crimes are not subject to an easy analysis. Without a doubt, sexual penetration, regardless of the circumstances, involves social norms distinct from those norms violated by the predicate felony, in these cases, robbery or kidnapping. Yet, because the compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct incorporates all the elements of the predicate felony, it cannot be concluded that the compound and predicate felonies are entirely distinct. The focus of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, however, is clearly on penetration. <em>Cf. People v Willie Johnson, </em>406 Mich 320; 279 NW2d 534 (1979). The common element of the many ways to establish first-degree criminal sexual conduct is penetration. Although not conclusive, that suggests a legislative intent that first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the underlying predicate felony were to be separately punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">First-degree criminal sexual conduct carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The predicate crimes in the instant cases also carry maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>mum penalties of life imprisonment. This very strongly suggests that the Legislature intended that the compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the predicate crimes of robbery and kidnapping be separately punished.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">1974 PA 266, which created the crime of criminal sexual conduct, was a radical restructuring of the rape laws. Convictions were made more easily obtainable and punishments increased. See Boyle, <em>The Criminal Sexual Conduct Act, </em>43 Det Lawyer 6 (Oct, 1975). Unlike robbery and armed robbery, where robbery is subsumed in armed robbery and a greater punishment is imposed, first-degree criminal sexual conduct and those predicate crimes which normally occur along with first-degree criminal sexual conduct, including armed robbery and kidnapping, have equal punishments. If the predicate crime is considered subsumed, there is no greater punishment. To suggest that the Legislature intended first-degree criminal sexual conduct to subsume a co-equal felony would be to attribute to the Legislature a total lack of purpose. It is only when a conviction is allowed of both the predicate felony and of first-degree criminal sexual conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>that there is any purpose in having the crime of penetration under circumstances involving any other felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">If we were to conclude that only one conviction could result from fact situations such as the cases at bar, the result would be that the defendants, having completed the predicate felonies of kidnapping and robbery, could then embark on one of the most heinous crimes possible, with no risk either of a second conviction or a statutorily increased maximum sentence. We would not lightly attribute such an unthinking and callous attitude to the Legislature in its adoption of the compound felony of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The contrary conclusion unmistakably comes forth. The Legislature intended that the crimes of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and either robbery or kidnapping be separately punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In Robideau, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In <em>Bouknight, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed._</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In <em>Griffin, </em>defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury in accordance with the dict\u00e1tes of <em>People v Barker, </em>411 Mich 291; 307 NW2d 61 (1981).

A similar election in <em>Bouknight </em>would require Bouknight to serve 8 to 30 years for the non-predicate armed robbery conviction and, concurrently, 8 to 30 years for CSC 1 and the 2-year consecutive term for felony-firearm. In <em>Brown, </em>if the sentence for the CSC 1 conviction based on a predicate felony were reduced to the maximum sentence for CSC 3, Brown would still be required to serve 20 to 40 years for kidnapping and, concurrently, 20 to 40 years for the CSC 1 conviction based on being armed with a weapon.

Larceny in a building requires the crime to occur in a building, which is not required for larceny over $100. Larceny over $100 requires that over $100 be taken, which is not required by larceny in a building. Even though these two statutes are aimed at violations of the same social norm \u2014 the same harm\u2014 they are presumptively separate under <em>Blockburger. </em>The <em>Blockburger </em>test fails to recognize that the Legislature does not always create crimes in neat packages which are susceptible to a pure greater and lesser included oifense analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> It is doubtful that application of these principles in prior double jeopardy decisions of this Court would yield different results.

Absent an \"other felony\u201d the only element of first-degree criminal sexual conduct under MCL 750.520b(l)(c); MSA 28.788(2)(lXc) is penetration, which is not a crime under MCL 750.520d; MSA 28.788(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">This analysis is consistent with the result reached in <em>People v Wilder, </em>prohibiting dual convictions of first-degree felony murder and the predicate felony. Since felony murder is punishable by a mandatory life sentence, while the predicate felonies are punishable by no more than a term of years up to life, it may be inferred that the Legislature intended to punish a defendant only once for committing both crimes. While someone in the process of committing a predicate felony has a real disincentive to commit murder (mandatory life) even absent the threat of dual convictions, the same person, assuming the predicate felony carries an up-to-life maximum penalty, would have no such disincentive to commit criminal sexual conduct <em>unless </em>dual convictions are imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> Robideau raises four additional claims of error, none of which we find persuasive.

One of the counts of armed robbery also served as the \"other felony\u201d to make the criminal sexual conduct first-degree. Freddy Lee Brown was convicted in one trial of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one of kidnapping, MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581. The prosecutor concedes that the kidnapping count \"concerns the same abduction as that alleged\u201d in the count for criminal sexual conduct. In addition to his conviction of kidnapping, Randall Dale Griffin was convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Once again, the same kidnapping of which he was separately convicted served to prove the \"other felony\u201d element of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Chester Bouknight was convicted of two counts of armed robbery, one count of felony-firearm, and one count of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. One of the armed robbery counts supplied the \"other felony\u201d element of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Court of Appeals in the cases of <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>Bouknight, </em>106 Mich App 798; 308 NW2d 703 (1981), and <em>People v Brown, </em>105 Mich App 58; 306 NW2d 392 (1981), held that separate convictions of the greater crime and its underlying felony were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. The two panels concluded that the offenses were the same because it was necessary for the prosecution to prove the elements of the underlying felony to prove first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Both panels were unable to find a clear expression of legislative intent to separately punish, and thus distinguished our opinion in <em>Wayne County Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374; 280 NW2d 793 (1979). Another panel of the Court of Appeals concluded in <em>People v Robideau, </em>94 Mich App 663; 289 NW2d 846 (1980), that the two offenses were not the same because any proper felony would have sufficed to prove first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The panel was persuaded, in any event, that the Legislature clearly expressed an intent to authorize multiple convictions. In the unpublished opinion of <em>People v Griffin, </em>the Court of Appeals dismissed defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The constitution provides that \"No person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy\u201d. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. This guarantees that a person shall not be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense, either at successive trials, see <em>People v Cox, </em>107 Mich 435; 65 NW 283 (1895), or at one trial, see <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303; 247 NW2d 303 (1976). To be placed in jeopardy is to be placed in danger of conviction. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 749. Whether two offenses are the same is a question determined by compar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ing the elements of the offenses and the evidence used to prove their violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">In these cases, defendants contend that convictions of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and of the underlying felony constituted double jeopardy. They also argue that the Legislature has not clearly expressed an intent to authorize such multiple convictions under these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The people, on the other hand, maintain that the Legislature, in enacting the first-degree criminal sexual conduct statute, did intend convictions of both the greater crime and the underlying felony. This legislative intent to separately punish, the people argue, is dispositive of defendants\u2019 double jeopardy claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The people assert that the Double Jeopardy Clause restrains courts and prosecutors, but does not restrain the Legislature. The reach of the constitutional guarantee is said to be co-extensive with the intent of the Legislature, because the Legislature possesses the authority to define criminal offenses. Hence, they conclude, whether these defendants may be simultaneously prosecuted under these statutes depends on whether the Legislature intended them to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Historically, double jeopardy presented itself in the form of successive trials, largely because of the prevailing criminal procedure of the time. Note, <em>Twice in Jeopardy, </em>75 Yale L J 262, 266, fn 13 (1965). The early principle of the English common law served to protect against repeated prosecutions. Once acquitted or convicted, the defendant was freed of the great power of the state. He could not be subjected to it again for the same offense. The problem of multiple prosecutions at one trial is a contemporary one arising from the proliferation of criminal statutes adopted by legislatures. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Particular conduct may violate several statutes, giving prosecutors the option of several charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Recognizing that multiple charges simultaneously prosecuted also may put a defendant in jeopardy for the same offense, the Court has enforced the substantive meaning of the clause over its historical form. Thus, in <em>Martin, supra, </em>we held that convictions obtained in one trial of possession of heroin and delivery of the same heroin contravened the constitutional guarantee. \"Defendant may not be 'doubly punished\u2019 by convicting him of possession, which in this case was a necessary incident to the very delivery for which he was also convicted.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>p 309. See also <em>People v Stewart (On Rehearing), </em>400 Mich 540; 256 NW2d 31 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In determining the reach of the Double Jeopardy Clause, the differences between simultaneous multiple prosecutions and successive prosecutions are not of major significance. The underlying principle of the guarantee is <em>\"nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto\u201d, </em>that no person ought to be punished twice for one offense. This notion, which can be traced to Roman law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is implicated in either context. A defendant who is successively or simultaneously tried, is twice put in jeopardy for one wrong if the offenses of which he may be convicted are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Neither precedent nor reason supports the people\u2019s contention that the Legislature is not restrained by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>circular reasoning requires a unique construction of an instrument which limits the government in all of its branches. It would surely render the clause nugatory, for if legislative intent is the governing principle, that would render the courts and prosecutors impotent to effect the protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">More importantly, however, the people\u2019s argument ignores the evil of double jeopardy \u2014 that of punishing more than once for one wrong. The people ignore the historical shift in power from kings to legislators and the state of modern criminal procedure. See Sigler, <em>A History of Double Jeopardy, </em>7 Am J of Legal His 283 (1963). \"Multiple prosecutions do engender double jeopardy concerns that are not present in single prosecutions. * * * But protection from multiple <em>punishment </em>for the same offense lies at the core of the Double Jeopardy Clause, and this protection is as applicable to single prosecutions as to two.\u201d <em>Wayne County Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374, 410; 280 NW2d 793 (1979) (Kavanagh, J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Legislature is free to define offenses. The beginning point of judicial resolution of whether two offenses are the same is the Legislature\u2019s definition of an offense. Legislative authority to define offenses, however, does not mean that it may subject a defendant to jeopardy under two offenses which are the same. Nor does it mean that legislative intent to separately punish may turn what is, in legal effect, one offense into two.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Legislative intent is informative, but not disposi-tive, of the question whether a defendant may be simultaneously charged with two offenses. The vital inquiry is whether the offenses are the same. If as between two offenses, however, the Legislature intended prosecution under only one of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that should dispose of a double jeopardy claim. But if the intent is not clear or if the Legislature intended separate punishments, a court must examine the offenses for identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In sum, although the legislative power is broad it cannot make a circle square by definition. Neither can it make the same offense two different crimes under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The people contend that the first-degree criminal sexual conduct statute reflects a legislative intent to punish for both the greater crime and the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">We must decide whether conviction of the greater offense of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and conviction of the underlying felony constitute impermissible multiple punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">In <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328, 342; 308 NW2d 112 (1981), we reviewed convictions of first-degree felony murder committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a robbery and of the underlying offense of robbery. The two convictions and sentences could not stand together, we concluded, because \"the evidence needed to prove first-degree felony murder requires proof of the underlying lesser included felony\u201d, and so they are the same offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">First-degree criminal sexual conduct involving another felony requires proof of the underlying felony as a necessary element. The fact that any felony suffices does not mean that the felony alleged is not a lesser included offense. See <em>Wilder, </em>p 345. \"[T]he question is not whether the challenged lesser offense is by definition necessarily included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>within the greater offense also charged, but whether, on the facts of the case at issue, it is.\u201d <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79, 91; 289 NW2d 674 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In the cases presently before the Court, the defendants were convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving another felony and of the very same underlying felony. To this extent they were twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, contrary to Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Defendants\u2019 separate convictions of the underlying felonies should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In <em>Robideau, </em>I would reverse the Court of Appeals decision in part and vacate one of the convictions of armed robbery.

The trial court\u2019s instructions that the asportation was sufficient if it was either for the purpose of abduction or forcible sexual assault fail to conform to <em>People v Barker, </em>411 Mich 291; 307 NW2d 61 (1981).

Nevertheless, our task remains the same. We must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the meaning of the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy; specifically, the proscription against multiple punishments for the same offense. In so doing, it serves us well to recall the following observations made over 100 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\"If there is anything settled in the jurisprudence of England and America, it is that no man can be twice lawfully punished for the same offense. And though there have been nice questions in the application of this rule to cases in which the act charged was such as to come within the definition of more than one statutory offense, or to bring the party within the jurisdiction of more than one court, there has never been any doubt of its entire and complete protection of the party when a second punishment is proposed in the same court, on the same facts, for the same statutory offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\"It is very clearly the spirit of the instrument <em>[i.e., </em>the constitution] to prevent a second punishment under judicial proceedings for the same crime, so far as the common law gave that protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\"For of what avail is the constitutional protection against more than one trial if there can be any number of sentences pronounced on the same verdict? Why is it that, having once been tried and found guilty, he can never be tried again for that offense? Manifestly it is not the danger of jeopardy of being a second time found guilty. It is the punishment that would legally follow the second conviction which is the real danger guarded against by the Constitution. But if, after judgment has been rendered on the conviction, and the sentence of that judgment executed on the criminal, he can be again sentenced on that conviction to another and different punishment, or to endure the same punishment a second time, is the constitutional restriction of any value? Is not its intent and its spirit in such a case as much violated as if a new trial had been had and, on a second conviction, a second punishment inflicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\"The argument seems to us irresistible, and we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>doubt that <em>the Constitution was designed as much to prevent the criminal from being twice punished for the same offense as from being twice tried for it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Lange, supra, </em>pp 168, 170, 173.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The foregoing observations have retained their vitality to this day and are true of the meaning of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328, 350; 308 NW2d 112 (1981), <em>reh den </em>411 Mich 1157 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In my view, the double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments for the same offense encompasses the cases now before us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, in situations like these and like those present in <em>Wilder, supra, </em>the underlying or predicate offense is always included within the greater or compound offense which relies on it for a conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>paraphrase <em>Carter, supra, </em>pp 588-589, these offenses are not factually and theoretically independent; rather, they are inseparably intertwined. Each offense necessarily supplies an indispensable element of the other. Thus, to impose punishments for both offenses amounts to constitutionally impermissible multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">To so hold is not a startling departure from prior law. Rather, it is not a departure at all, but is derived logically from and based on our prior decisions. See <em>Carter, supra, </em>pp 577-589; <em>Wilder, supra, </em>pp 341-352; <em>Wayne County Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374, 405-412; 280 NW2d 793 (1979) (Kavanagh, J., <em>dissenting), reh den </em>406 Mich 1127 (1979), <em>app dis sub nom Brintley v Michigan, </em>444 US 948; 100 S Ct 418; 62 L Ed 2d 317 (1979); <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79, 85-93; 289 NW2d 674 (1980); <em>People v Stewart (On Rehearing), </em>400 Mich 540, 548-549; 256 NW2d 31 (1977); <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303, 307-310; 247 NW2d 303 (1976); <em>People v Cook, </em>236 Mich 333, 335-338; 210 NW 296 (1926). Accordingly, since we are interpreting Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15, I would reaffirm the test set forth in those cases which courts in this state are to employ when determining whether two offenses are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, <em>i.e., </em>if one offense is a necessarily or cognate lesser included offense of another, they are the same offense for purposes of the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>I am cognizant of the oft-stated maxim that the legislative body has the exclusive power to define offenses and fix punishments.

Nevertheless, that power does not in any way exempt the legislative body from honoring the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy to the same extent as must the other coequal branches of government, <em>i.e., </em>it is bound to honor <em>all </em>the protections afforded by that constitutional guarantee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the words contained in the constitution do not limit their application to any particular branch or branches:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\"No person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">To hold otherwise would constitute an improper use of judicial power, creating something out of nothing, finding a limitation which has no basis in fact, law, or logic, making law by judicial <em>\u00f1at.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\"If the Double Jeopardy Clause imposed no restrictions on a legislature\u2019s power to authorize multiple punishment, there would be no limit to the number of convictions that a State could obtain on the basis of the same act, state of mind, and result. A State would be free to create substantively identical crimes differing only in name, or to create a series of greater and lesser-included offenses, with the first crime a lesser-included offense of the second, the second a lesser-included offense of the third, and so on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\"In light of these considerations, the Double Jeopardy Clause cannot reasonably be interpreted to leave legislatures completely free to subject a defendant to the risk of multiple punishment on the basis of a single criminal transaction. In the context of multiple prosecutions, it is well established that the phrase 'the same offence\u2019 in the Double Jeopardy Clause has independent content \u2014 that two crimes that do not satisfy the <em>Block-burger </em>test constitute 'the same offence\u2019 under the Double Jeopardy Clause regardless of the legislature\u2019s intent to treat them as separate offenses. Otherwise multiple prosecutions would be permissible whenever authorized by the legislature. The Court has long assumed that the <em>Blockburger </em>test is also a rule of constitutional stature in multiple punishment cases, and I would not hesitate to hold that it is. If the prohibition against being 'twice put in jeopardy\u2019 for 'the same offence\u2019 is to provide meaningful protection, the phrase 'the same offence\u2019 must have content independent of state law in both multiple prosecution and multiple punishment cases. Since the Double Jeopardy Clause limits the power of all branches of government, including the legislature, there is no more reason to treat the test as simply a rule of statutory construction in multi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>pie punishment cases than there would be in multiple prosecution cases.\u201d <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359; 103 S Ct 673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983) (Marshall, J., <em>dissenting). </em>Also <em>Wayne County Prosecutor, supra, </em>pp 410-411 (Kavanagh, J., <em>dissenting), </em>pp 414-417 (Levin, J., <em>dissenting).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Such a view does not necessarily prevent multiple punishments for multiple offenses committed in a single transaction. <em>Cf. Wakeford, supra, </em>fn 7. Rather, as long as single transaction multiple offenses are legally and factually distinct under the test as previously set forth, the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy does not operate as a bar to the imposition of multiple punishments. Only in those infrequent cases where in reality two offenses are the same offense are multiple punishments prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In any event, these cases do not involve a legislative breach of the state constitutional protection against multiple punishments for the same offense, <em>i.e., </em>the Legislature has not clearly and unequivocally authorized punishment for both first-degree criminal sexual conduct based on sexual penetration under circumstances involving any \"other felony\u201d and the \"other felony\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, these cases involve a judicial breach of that protection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>i.e., </em>imposition of a second sentence for the same offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In summary, I would reaffirm the test set forth in our prior decisions which courts in this state are to employ when determining whether two offenses are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, i.e., if one offense is a necessarily or cognate lesser included offense of another, it is the same offense for purposes of the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy embodied in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. When applying the test to these cases, it is clear that convictions of first-degree criminal sexual conduct based on sexual penetration under circumstances involving any \"other felony\u201d, pursuant to MCL 750.520b(l)(c); MSA 28.788(2)(l)(c), and of the \"other felony\u201d violate the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, specifically, the protection to be free from multiple punishments for the same offense. In these and similar cases, the underlying or predicate offense is always included within the greater or compound offense which relies on it for a conviction. Consequently, imposing punishments for both offenses amounts to constitutionally impermissible multiple punishment for the same offense._</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Brown </em>and its directions on remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b719-5\">Cavanagh, J., participated only in the decision of <em>Brown.</em></judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> MCL 750.520b(l); MSA 28.788(2)(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\"Sec. 520b.

Rather, we have found that our constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy affords greater protection than does the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth. See, <em>e.g., People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95, 105-106, fn 9; 341 NW2d 68 (1983); <em>People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 582-584; 330 NW2d 314 (1982); <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328, 343-349; 308 NW2d 112 (1981), <em>reh den </em>411 Mich 1157 (1981); <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79, 91-92, 96; 289 NW2d 674 (1980); <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973). Of course, our reliance on the state constitution has been due in part to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s failure to clearly define the scope of the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b713-12\"> Since the scope of the corresponding Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protection is unclear, this discussion rests on the interpretation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b713-13\"> Whether that is \"legally\u201d or \"factually\u201d so is unimportant to our analysis.

Indeed, by necessary implication, a compound offense which has as an element other enumerated offenses, <em>e.g., </em>felony murder, MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548, or any other offense, <em>e.g., </em>first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b(l)(c); MSA 28.788(2)(l)(c), includes in that element, in the alternative, all of the elements of each enumerated offense or of all other offenses, <em>i.e., </em>the predicate offenses are \"legally\u201d or necessarily lesser included offenses. Of course, even if predicate offenses are not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>included in the compound offense, the proof needed to establish the compound offense will always require proof of a predicate offense, i.e., the predicate offenses are \"factually\u201d or cognate lesser included offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\"> Since the United States Supreme Court has not enunciated a constitutionally based test for use when analyzing Fifth Amendment double jeopardy issues, see <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359; 103 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983); <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 340-342; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981); <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684, 691-692; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 715 (1980), we are free to adopt our own test when reviewing such claims. In addition, the federal constitution does not prevent us from creating a different test when interpreting the double jeopardy guarantee of our own constitution, nor does it prevent the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy from affording greater protection than does the Fifth Amendment prohibition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\"> Of course, theoretically, the legislative body can riever abridge the state constitutional double jeopardy protections, <em>i.e., </em>the mere enactment of statutes which purport to authorize violations of those protections do not in fact amount to such violations. Rather, those protections are not violated until a prosecutor institutes a subsequent prosecution for the same offense after a prior conviction or acquittal or until a court imposes a second sentence for the same offense. Hence, the following observations by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\"[T]he Fifth Amendment double jeopardy guarantee serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors. The legislature remains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define crimes and fix punishments; but once the legislature has acted courts may not impose more than one punishment for the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not attempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial.\u201d <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161, 165; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977). <em>Cf. Hunter, supra; Albernaz, supra, </em>pp 334-344; <em>Whalen, supra, </em>pp 688-695.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Nevertheless, statutes which purport to authorize violations of any of the protections afforded by the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy will be construed so that such violations will not occur or will be declared unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\"> The majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is premised on specious reasoning. <em>Ante, </em>pp 490-491. The observation that armed robbery and kidnapping \"normally occur along with first-degree criminal sexual conduct\u201d is improperly speculative. Rather, it is just as likely that the predicate felony will be a breaking and entering or a larceny-related offense. However, those offenses carry maximum punishments of no more than 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, a person can be faced with the risk that a greater punishment will be imposed solely as the result of a conviction pursuant to MCL 750.520b(l)(c); MSA 28.788(2)(l)(c). Accordingly, the majority\u2019s reasoning, that the Legislature intended to impose double punishments because the predicate felonies are co-equal offenses, falls by its own weight. The bases advanced by the majority do not persuade me to find a clear expression of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\"To the extent that legislative intent is not entirely free of doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the doubt must be resolved in favor of lenity. See <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684, 694; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 714 (1980); . <em>Simpson v United States, </em>435 US 6, 14-15; 98 S Ct 909; 55 L Ed 2d 70 (1978); <em>United States v Bass, </em>404 US 336, 347; 92 S Ct 515; 30 L Ed 2d 488 (1971).\u201d <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328, 343; 308 NW2d 112 (1981), <em>reh den </em>411 Mich 1157 (1981).

However, note that the better course in such cases is for the prosecutor to charge in the alternative.
