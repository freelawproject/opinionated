Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">There is no dispute as to the facts in the instant cases. Therefore, we adopt the Court of Appeals statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\"A. <em>Furman</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">\"Plaintiff, Ralph Furman, suffered a work-related injury in 1961. He was awarded benefits for partial incapacity at that time. In 1973, he petitioned for total and permanent disability benefits alleging industrial loss of use of both legs and incurable insanity. He presented the testimony of a psychiatrist which sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ported his claim. Defendants failed to present any contradictory evidence, whereupon in January, 1973, the hearing referee made a finding of total and permanent disability on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s incurable insanity. That decision was not appealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\"In June, 1976, plaintiff\u2019s 800-week conclusive presumption period ended. MCL 418.351; MSA 17.237(351). At that time, defendants discontinued paying benefits, whereupon plaintiff petitioned for a factual determination of permanent and total disability. At the hearing, defendants presented expert testimony concerning plaintiff\u2019s mental condition. Plaintiff presented contradictory evidence. The hearing referee found that there had been no material change in plaintiff\u2019s condition since the original determination of incurable insanity was made and that plaintiff\u2019s benefits should be resumed. Defendants appealed that decision to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\"Defendants did not deny that plaintiff\u2019s condition remained unchanged after the 1973 decision. Rather, they argued that the evidence conclusively established that plaintiff had never been incurably insane, under either the definition of insanity which existed at the time the 1973 award was entered or the definition which was established thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\"In a split decision, the board affirmed the hearing referee\u2019s decision by an order entered on January 14, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">\"B. <em>Selk</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">\"Plaintiff Selk filed a petition for benefits on July 27, 1978, claiming that she injured her hips in a work-related incident in January, 1978, and that thereafter her condition was aggravated by a further work-related incident. Contradictory evidence was presented at the hearing with plaintiff and her expert testifying that her injury was work-related. Defendant\u2019s expert testified that plaintiff\u2019s condition was related to her normal 'non-work related\u2019 activities of life. The hearing referee found in favor of plaintiff and entered an open award and ordered the payment of back benefits. By order entered January 8, 1982, the board affirmed the decision of the hearing referee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\"C. <em>Kelly</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\"Plaintiff Kelly suffered a work-related back injury in January, 1974. Thereafter, defendants voluntarily paid benefits until plaintiff returned to work in November, 1975. Plaintiff quit his job in April, 1976, and filed a petition for benefits on November 11, 1976. Following a hearing held on April 26, 1978, the hearing referee found that plaintiff suffered a work-related injury in 1974. However, he refused to award benefits because he found that plaintiff did not have a compensable injury on April 21, 1976, the last day that he worked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\"By an order entered on January 15, 1982, the board reversed the hearing referee\u2019s decision. It found that plaintiff aggravated his pre-existing back injury while performing work for defendants after returning to work in 1975. It further found that plaintiff suffered disabling neck pain and headaches which resulted from the back injury. Therefore, it entered a retroactive award of compensation benefits from April 21, 1976, and thereafter until further order of the board.\u201d 120 Mich App 140-142.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">II. The Statutory Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">While these appeals were pending before the WCAB, the Legislature enacted 1981 PA 194, which amended MCL 418.801; MSA 17.237(801) to provide a new fifth paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">\"(5) When weekly compensation is paid pursuant to an award of a hearing referee, the board, or a court, interest on the compensation shall be paid at the rate of 12% per annum from the date each payment was due, until paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The Legislature directed that the amendment \"shall take effect January 1, 1982\u201d. Until December 31, 1981, the effective interest rate was 5%. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>Wilson v Doehler-Jarvis Division of National Lead Co, </em>358 Mich 510; 100 NW2d 226 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The issue is whether 1981 PA 194 was intended by the Legislature to operate prospectively or retrospectively. We agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that this case \"does not even involve retrospective application\u201d. 120 Mich App 146. We find that the statute is plain, certain, and unambiguous, <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182; 189 NW 221 (1922), and requires application, not interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The amendment provides that interest shall be paid from the date each payment was due. MCL 418.801(1); MSA 17.237(801)(1) provided prior to 1977 that compensation shall \"become payable on the fourteenth day after the employer has notice or knowledge of the disability or death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In 1977, the Legislature amended \u00a7 801 to further clarify when compensation is \"dueAs of the time the amendment in issue was enacted the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\"Compensation * * * shall become <em>due and </em>payable on the fourteenth day after the employer has notice or knowledge of the disability or death\u201d. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Against this backdrop the conclusion is compelling that 1981 PA 194 was unambiguously intended to award interest from the date payment \"was due\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">We find further support for our conclusion from the fact that legislative recognition of inflationary interest rates was not confined to the area of compensation awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">In 1980, the Legislature provided for a change in the interest rate on money judgments which clearly provided for 6% interest to the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>date of the act (June 1, 1980) and 12% thereafter. MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013. In the instant case, the Legislature failed to limit the increase in interest to the effective date of the statute and instead employed language unequivocally stating that the triggering event \"was\u201d an occurrence antedating the effective date of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Defendants correctly detail the history of the reform efforts which led to the adoption of 12 acts pertaining to workers\u2019 compensation approved on December 30, 1981, and note that the Legislature fixed an effective date of January 1, 1982, for 11 of the 12 acts. However, in our view neither the existence of a legislative concern for the financial burdens on employers or reference to the effective date of the act squarely meet the issue in this case. The Legislature used the language \"was due\u201d. Unless this language is unclear, these observations are irrelevant to our task which is to give effect to the plain meaning of the language used. <em>Owendale-Gagetown School Dist v State Bd of Ed, </em>413 Mich 1; 317 NW2d 529 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the language used required construction, we would nonetheless conclude that the board\u2019s application of the legislation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">As a matter of statutory construction, statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless the contrary intent is clearly manifested. <em>In re Davis Estate, </em>330 Mich 647, 651-653; 48 NW2d 151 (1951). Moreover, the fact that the statute relates to antecedent events does not, in itself, require a finding that the statute operates retrospectively. <em>Hughes v Judges\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>407 Mich 75, 85; 282 NW2d 160 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>An exception to the general rule is recognized where a statute is remedial or procedural in nature. <em>Hansen-Snyder Co v General Motors Corp, </em>371 Mich 480; 124 NW2d 286 (1963). Statutes which operate in furtherance of a remedy already existing and which neither create new rights nor destroy existing rights are held to operate retrospectively, unless a contrary legislative intention is manifested. Defendant argues that because it is the general rule that an act amending a specific act will be applied retroactively, <em>Rookledge v Garwood, </em>340 Mich 444; 65 NW2d 785 (1954), it follows that a new provision, which does not amend an existing one, cannot be so applied. However, the <em>Rookledge </em>principle is also simply one of statutory construction. Thus, the fact that \u00a7 801 is a new provision does not preclude retroactive application where this is the clearly expressed intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">As the Second Injury Fund concedes, this Court has held that interest rates relate to a remedy or mode of procedure. See <em>Ballog v Knight Newspapers, Inc, </em>381 Mich 527, 535; 164 NW2d 19 (1969). While <em>Ballog </em>is not dispositive of the question in the instant case because it related to interest on a money judgment, we there quoted with approval language which characterized interest on a judgment in an action of trespass or trespass on the case for damages to person or property as \"not of the substance of the right of action but exclusively an incident attached thereto by legislative fiat after such right has been adjudicated. The period for computation of such interest is in the same category\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Thus, unless we accept the defendants\u2019 position that the rights in this case are contractual in nature and that a retroactive application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>statute would impair defendants\u2019 vested rights, the conclusion must follow that interest is but an incident and not the essence of a right or liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">III. Contract Impairment</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We recognize the general rule accepted by a majority of jurisdictions that legislative changes in the rate of interest will not be retroactively applied to vary an existing contractual obligation, express or implied, fixing the rate of recoverable interest. Anno: <em>Retrospective application and effect of statutory provision for interest or changed rate of interest, </em>4 ALR2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We are persuaded nonetheless that in the instant case interest may be awarded from the date payment was due without running afoul of the constitutional provision against impairment of contract. US Const, art I, \u00a7 10; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">While this Court has characterized workers\u2019 compensation as a liability arising out of the contract of employment, we have nonetheless consistently emphasized that workers\u2019 compensation is a matter of statutory grace. <em>Rookledge v Garwood, supra, </em>p 453; <em>Wilson v Doehler-Jarvis, supra; So-lakis v Roberts, </em>395 Mich 13; 233 NW2d 1 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">In <em>Lahti v Fosterling, </em>357 Mich 578, 584; 99 NW2d 490 (1959), the Court held that an amendment to the workers\u2019 compensation act which eliminated a limitation on medical benefits had retroactive effect. The Court considered the theory, also advanced by defendants here, that \"since the workmen\u2019s compensation act is statutory, and since the employment is based upon a contract, for the legislature to change the remedies would be a violation of the rights of the parties and the contract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>In rejecting this conclusion the Court quoted with approval the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\" 'It is true that this Court has held, we believe correctly, that the basis of liability of employers under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statutes, is contractual. But we cannot say that such contractual relationship or liability necessarily precludes a subsequent Legislature from effecting changes in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws. Those who enter into such contractual relationships do so with knowledge of the right and power of the Legislature to enact any new law relating to the subject matter, not in conflict with any constitutional provision, and must be presumed to have agreed to any such change.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lahti, supra, </em>pp 594-595, quoting <em>Peak v State Compensation Comm\u2019r, </em>141 W Va 453, 459; 91 SE2d 625 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 457; 258 NW2d 414 (1977), we held constitutional the application of MCL 418.862; MSA 17.237(862), which provided that no stay on appeal from an award entered by a referee was available with respect to 70% of the weekly benefit in cases involving injuries or appeals taken by employers before the effective date of the act. We recognized the contractual nature of the relationship while reiterating the principle \"that remedies for the enforcement of a contract may be modified without violating the impairment of contract clauses\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We conclude that the interest rate on a compensation award relates to an additional remedy, and that retroactive application of the statute does not alter the substance of the relationship. See <em>Guardian Depositors Corp v Brown, </em>290 Mich 433; 287 NW 798 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Defendant correctly contends that the characterization of a particular legislative action as remedial is not a talisman which forecloses further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>analysis of a constitutional claim. The Contract Clause retains viability as a restriction on legislative action. The state may, however, alter the terms of a private contract to either lighten or increase obligations, save where its activities constitute a substantial alteration of the terms of a contract. In the latter event, the alteration is permissible if the legislation is necessary to meet a broad and pressing social need and is reasonably related to that goal. <em>Allied Structural Steel Co v Spannaus, </em>438 US 234; 98 S Ct 2716; 57 L Ed 2d 727 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Certainly the change involved here is not of the magnitude of the pension fund charge found defective in <em>Allied Structural Steel, supra. </em>Moreover, if it is conceded that the retroactive application of the 12% interest rate is a \"substantial alteration\u201d of the contract, we think it abundantly clear that compensation for worker disability is legislation for the public welfare. <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc v Kansas Power &amp; Light Co, </em>459 US 400; 103 S Ct 697; 74 L Ed 2d 569 (1983). It is also clear that the act is an attempt to remedy a serious social problem, depreciation of the value of the award as a result of the escalation in the interest rate over the period preceding final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Nor can we say that the legislative solution to the problem is not reasonably related to the goal sought to be obtained. We cannot say that the Legislature acted irrationally in considering that 12% interest was an appropriate compensation on an award ultimately deemed to have been rightfully due 14 days from notice of the injury. Defendants do not dispute plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that for two years prior to the date of enactment, governmental investment instruments provided interest generally in excess of 12%.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Defendants contend that \u00a7 801 is irrational because to the extent that the marketplace interest rate was less than 12% during the period before final judgment, plaintiffs will receive a windfall. We note that the converse is true for those periods in which the 12% interest rate was less than that obtainable in the marketplace. Moreover, if defendants\u2019 contentions were accepted and the statute was applied only to payments which are due on or after January 1, 1982, it is foreseeable that some number of workers would not, because of the length of the appeal process, receive 12% interest until 1984, 1985, or later. The wisdom of retroactive application of the 12% interest rate is, in any event, a matter confined to the exclusive judgment of the Legislature. That in any given case the statute may operate imperfectly does not authorize this Court to invalidate an act which is reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 612; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">IV. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Having found that the statute is reasonably related to a legitimate state interest for purposes of the impairment of contract claim, we conclude that defendants\u2019 due process claim is likewise without merit. In <em>Lahti v Fosterling, supra, </em>357 Mich 591-592, we quoted from <em>Matter of Hogan v Lawlor &amp; Cavanaugh Co, </em>286 App Div 600; 146 NYS2d 119 (1955), in'holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\" 'The due process clause of the State and Federal Constitutions does not freeze the burden of compensation liability as of the date of the occurrence of an industrial accident, beyond the power of legislative change. In carrying out its social purpose, the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ture has the power to increase the burden on the employer for disability or expenses occurring or continuing after the date of the enactment of the amendatory statute, even though the accident which gave rise to the disability or expenses had occurred prior to that time.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">For the reasons stated, we conclude that where an employer pays compensation pursuant to an award of a hearing referee, the WCAB, or a court which is entered after January 1, 1982, interest shall be paid at 12% from the date each payment was due. As to the remaining issues, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed for the reasons stated in its opinion.

It reads the amendatory language as if it included the words \"entered after January 1, 1982\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\"When weekly compensation is paid pursuant to an award of a hearing referee, the board, or a court <em>[entered after January 1, 1982], </em>interest * * * shall be paid at the rate of 12% per annum from the date each payment was due, until paid.\u201d (Bracketed words and emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The opinion of the Court does not state a reason for reading a pre-January 1, 1982 award limitation into the act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">An act of the Legislature that is given immediate effect \"takes effect\u201d when it becomes a law. If it is not given immediate effect, it becomes effective 90 days after the end of the legislative session.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Some acts, however, state a specific effective date (i) between the \"immediate effect\u201d date and the 90th day, or (ii) after the 90th day. When the Legislature states a specific effective date, it thereby indicates its intent to limit the retroactivity of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">It appears, because a pre-January 1, 1982 award limitation has been read into the act, that the majority reads the January 1, 1982 specific effective date as evidencing a legislative intent to limit the retroactivity or effectiveness of the amendment to payments of compensation pursuant to an award entered after January 1, 1982. We would read the specific effective date as evidencing a legislative intent to limit the retroactivity by allowing interest at the higher rate only where the interest accrues on or after January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The amendatory act is concerned with the rate of interest. The amendatory act provides for an increase in the rate of interest from 5% to 12% per annum. The specific effective date concerns the date that the change in the rate of interest shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>become effective. The date stated is January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We conclude that interest that accrues before January 1, 1982, accrues at the 5% rate, and that interest that accrues on or after January 1, 1982, accrues at the 12% rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Neither the date of the award nor the date of payment<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> has any homology with the date the change in interest rate becomes effective. The decision of the majority to make the date of the award determinative of entitlement to an increase in the interest rate will produce asymmetric and adventitious results.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The amendatory act provides that interest is payable at 12% from the date each payment is due when \"compensation is paid pursuant to <em>an award of </em>a hearing referee, the board, or a court\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Most awards are \"awards of\u2019 a hearing referee or the WCAB. It is rare for a court to make or enter an award. Also, although the WCAB may, as in <em>Kelly, </em>award compensation denied by a hearing referee, that is the exception. Ordinarily, as in <em>Selk </em>and. <em>Furman, </em>a hearing referee\u2019s award is affirmed by the WCAB.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A determination by the WCAB is left undisturbed when the Court of Appeals, or both the Court of Appeals and this Court, deny leave to appeal or affirm the WCAB after a grant of leave to appeal. It is unusual for a court to award compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">It appears, under the majority construction stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ing a pre-January 1, 1982 award limitation, that where an award was entered before January 1, 1982, and an appeal was thereafter taken that is still pending, interest will accrue at 5% \u2014 during the 2-1/3 years or longer the appeal has been pending \u2014 on weekly installments that have or shall become due and payable on or after January 1, 1982.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Similarly, under the majority construction, it appears that if a referee should at some future date, say, a year from next week, order that payment of compensation be stopped<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> on a pre-Janu-ary 1, 1982 \"award of\u2019 a hearing referee or the WCAB and that order were to be subsequently reversed by the WCAB or a court, interest would only be payable at 5% for the period during the pendency of the appeal because the award, pursuant to which \"compensation is paid\u201d, would, upon reversal of the stop order, continue to be a pre-January 1, 1982 award.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The Court reads a pre-January 1, 1982 award limitation into the act although it posits that the awards in <em>Selk, Furman, </em>and <em>Kelly </em>were entered after January 1, 1982. There are approximately one hundred cases being held in abeyance pursuant to orders entered by this Court where the award is \"an award of\u2019 a hearing referee or the WCAB entered before January 1, 1982. There are a large number of pre-January 1, 1982 \"award of\u2019 a hearing referee or the WCAB cases being held in administrative abeyance, <em>i.e., </em>without formal orders of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">This Court should not, in the instant post-January 1, 1982 award cases, decide whether the WCAB and the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> correctly read into the act a pre-January 1, 1982 award limitation. A ruling thereon is not necessary to decision in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">To limit the meaning of the January 1, 1982 effective date language so that it serves only to deny retroactivity of the 12% interest rate where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the award was paid before January 1, 1982, would be to deny the effective date language of meaning.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It would mean that the effective date language affects only an award \u2014 if there is such an award \u2014 paid after the Governor signed the amen-datory act on December 30 and before the close of business the following day, December 31, 1981, where, despite payment, the issue is still open, pending on appeal, or under reservation of rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The opinion of the Court offers the following reasons for the conclusion that the increase in interest rate is retroactive where the award is entered after January 1, 1982:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">(A) \"[T]he statute is plain, certain and unambiguous\u201d. The amendatory act states that interest is payable at the 12% rate \"from the date each payment <em>was </em>due, until paid\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) The \"conclusion is compelling that [the amendatory act] was unambiguously intended to award interest from the date payment 'was due\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">(B) The Legislature \"failed to limit the increase in interest to the effective date of the statute\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>it did in amending \u00a7 6013<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of the Revised Judicature Act, providing for the rate of interest on a money judgment. There the Legislature specifically provided that interest shall be calculated until the June 1, 1980 effective date of the amendatory act at the old 6% rate and thereafter at the new 12% rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">(C) It appears from rules of statutory construction and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ballog v Knight Newspapers, Inc, </em>381 Mich 527, 541; 164 NW2d 19 (1969), that \"interest rates relate to a remedy or mode of procedure\u201d and that \"interest is but an incident and not the essence of a right or liability\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In using the word \"was\u201d in the amendatory act, stating that interest shall be paid at the 12% rate \"from the date each payment <em>was </em>due, until paid\u201d (emphasis supplied), the Legislature was apparently expressing the proper time relationship between the date on which the right to the payment arose and the subsequent date that payment pursuant to an award would be made. Because interest, when payable at all, is always payable for the period between the date the substantive right to payment accrues and the date interest is awarded or is paid, interest is in a sense inherently retroactive. The use of \"was\u201d expresses that inherent characteristic of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">It has been said that \"expressions of the plain meaning rule may be a kind of verbal table thumping to express or reinforce confidence in an interpretation arrived at on other grounds instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of a reason for it\u201d. 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory-Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 46.01, p 49.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The specificity of \u00a7 6013 of the Revised Judicature Act may have been occasioned by the need to differentiate between actions based on written instruments and other actions in respect to the increase in the interest rate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The specificity does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>not, therefore, support either the inference drawn by the majority or the view that the Legislature intended that interest accrue at 6% on a tort judgment until June 1, 1980, but at 12% on disputed workers\u2019 compensation payments from 1976 in <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Furman </em>and from 1978 in <em>Selk.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Court\u2019s reliance on rules of construction is not persuasive. Judge Richard Posner recently observed that Professor Llewellyn had correctly criticized the canons of construction by forcefully demonstrating \"that for every canon one might bring to bear on a point there is an equal and opposite canon, so that the outcome of the interpretive process depends on the choice between paired opposites \u2014 a choice the canons themselves do not illuminate. (You need a canon for choosing between competing canons, and there isn\u2019t any.)\u201d Posner, <em>Statutory Interpretation in the Classroom </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>and in the Courtroom, </em>50 U Chi L Rev 800, 806 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">It has also been observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\"Judicial opinions are replete with vapid verbaliza-tions of standards which purport to govern decision as to the legal permissibility of retroactive application of new law. On close examination, however, most of them turn out to be little more than ways to restate the problem. Probably the most hackneyed example of such a rule is to the effect that a law cannot be retroactively applied to impair vested rights.\u201d 2 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 41.05, p 260.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In <em>Ballog, </em>the Court was considering a statute that provided for the payment of prejudgment interest. Theretofore, prejudgment interest was obtainable as damages in some cases but not in others.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If the statute were not retroactive, the courts would have been obliged to continue to draw increasingly fine and dubious distinctions among cases respecting the allowance of prejudgment interest until all actions filed before the effective date of the statute had finally been decided. Other courts that have dealt with the <em>Ballog </em>question have similarly concluded that a statute requiring payment of prejudgment interest should be given retroactive effect.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The statute considered in <em>Ballog </em>(1965 PA 240) did not, in contrast with the amendatory act here being construed, state a specific effective date. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Ballog </em>that such a statute should be construed to have retroactive effect is defensible. The rules of construction invoked in reaching that conclusion are, however, neither applicable nor persuasive in this case where the issue is whether an increase in the interest rate is applicable to interest that accrued before a specific effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">There does not appear to be any appellate decision<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> holding that a statute <em>increasing </em>the rate of either prejudgment interest or interest on a judgment should be given retroactive effect. All the cases concerning an increase in the prejudgment interest rate and some of the cases concerning an increase in the postjudgment interest rate hold that interest accrues at the increased rate only from and after the effective date of the amenda-tory act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The other postjudgment increase in interest rate cases hold that interest accrues at the increased rate only on a judgment entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>after the effective date of the act;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> because post-judgment interest accrues only on the judgment and not from the date of injury or breach, these cases defer the effectiveness of the increase in interest rate to a date on or after the effective date of the amendatory act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s holding that a statute increasing the prejudgment/award interest rate is effective as to interest that accrued <em>before </em>the effective date of the amendatory act appears to be unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">This amendatory act, along with all but one of the other acts amending the workers\u2019 compensation act that were enacted in December, 1981,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> concluded with the statement \"[t]his amendatory act shall take effect January 1, 1982\u201d. The Legislature thereby evidenced its intention that the increase in the interest rate would not become effective before January 1, 1982, and would affect only interest that accrues on and after January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This amendatory act, providing for an increase in interest rate, like acts providing for an increase in workers\u2019 compensation or other entitlement benefits, requires an increase in funding to pay for the increased cost. The Legislature generally indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>cates, by stating a specific effective date, its intent that amounts payable for prior periods shall not be affected by an increase in benefits,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> taxes, or other governmentally mandated assessments. The Legislature did just that in the instant case in recognition that a change in a governmental benefit program requiring additional funding should not ordinarily be retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The Court should give meaning and effect to the legislative decision that the increase in interest rate would not be retroactive, but that it would be effective as to all interest that accrues on or after January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Court has not addressed the other issues raised by the appellants in <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Furman. </em>It should either address them or dismiss the grant of leave to appeal thereon as improvident.</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-7\">Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-16\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> As originally enacted, subsequently amended, and re-enacted, the workers\u2019 compensation act has provided for a delay in the commencement of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The original 1912 act provided that no compensation shall be paid for an injury that does not incapacitate the worker for at least two weeks, that compensation shall begin on the 15th day after injury, and that compensation shall be computed from the date of injury if the disability continues for at least eight weeks. 1912 (1st Ex Sess) PA 10; 1915 CL 5433.
