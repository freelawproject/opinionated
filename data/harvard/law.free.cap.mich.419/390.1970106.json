Because this case is before us on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>review of the trial court\u2019s denial of summary and accelerated judgment and the Court of Appeals reversal thereof, we are without a factual record developed in the trial court and must depend for that history and other facts of the case upon the plaintiffs well-pleaded allegations which, for purposes of our decision, are taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Allan Teasel was born in 1951 and was first hospitalized at the Hawthorn Center of the Michigan Department of Mental Health in July of 1961 when he was ten years old. He was referred to the Hawthorn Center following his suspension from school for \"dangerous unprovoked aggression to peers\u201d. He was also \"dangerously aggressive to siblings and peers at home and in the neighborhood and seemed for the most part a very confused and unhappy child\u201d. He was discharged from the Hawthorn Center on November 23, 1961, with the following recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\"Allan was discharged home on trial, the recommendation that of eventual hospitalization in a long-term program in a state hospital. While awaiting this he should have medication and a home bound teacher.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In October, 1962, upon his parents\u2019 petition, Mr. Teasel was ordered by the probate court to be hospitalized at the Northville State Hospital. He remained a patient in that institution for 12 years and was discharged on December 9, 1974. It appears from the sketchy factual background contained in the pleadings before us that, during his commitment, Mr. Teasel actually resided from time to time \"in the community [and] has alternated between being with his mother and being in a halfway house\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In June or July of 1974, Mr. Teasel was arrested and charged with four separate and unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>offenses which we number for convenience of later reference:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">1. Assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, MCL 750.84; MSA 28.279, for having slashed a 15-year-old girl in the back on June 12, 1974, necessitating 80 stitches to close the wound;</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">2. Assault with intent to murder, MCL 750.83; MSA 28.278, for having slashed a 14-year-old girl in the back on June 25, 1974, necessitating 36 stitches to close the wound;</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">3. Assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, MCL 750.84; MSA 28.279, for having slashed a 12-year-old girl in the back on June 28, 1974, requiring 80 stitches to close the wound; and</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">4. Assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, MCL 750.84; MSA 28.279, for a knife attack upon a young girl on an unspecified date in the summer of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The first three of the foregoing charges were brought in the Recorder\u2019s Court of the City of Detroit and the fourth was brought in the Third Judicial Circuit Court. The first and third of the charges resulted in negotiated pleas of guilty on November 21, 1974, to charges of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder and felonious assault (MCL 750.82; MSA 28.277), respectively, in return for the dismissal of the second of the enumerated offenses. On December 20, 1974, Mr. Teasel was sentenced to serve concurrent terms of imprisonment of 2 to 10 and 2 to 4 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was then brought to trial upon his plea of not guilty to the fourth of the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>assault charges, and was acquitted by reason of insanity by the trial judge on March 28, 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Plaintiff was released from prison in December of 1980. He was arrested in February of 1981 for carrying a concealed weapon, and again in June of 1981 for second-degree criminal sexual conduct. The criminal sexual conduct charge was brought because it was alleged that Mr. Teasel \"walked nearby a girl who was on a lunch break from the store where she worked seated beside the store eating a sandwich when plaintiff suddenly bent down and grabbed her front ripping open smock, shirt, and bra\u201d. The concealed weapons charge was dismissed, apparently for lack of probable cause for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In June of 1981, while the criminal sexual conduct charge was pending in the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court, Mr. Teasel\u2019s mother petitioned the Oakland County. Probate Court to have her son committed to a state mental institution. Mr. Teasel was admitted on June 24, 1981, to the Clinton Valley Center, but was released on July 1, 1981. Mr. Teasel\u2019s mother again petitioned the Oakland County Probate Court for the commitment of her son on November 4, 1981. That petition was supported by the affidavits of two physicians who certified that Mr. Teasel was \"mentally ill\u201d and was \"a person requiring treatment * * * who meets the requirements for judicial admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sion\u201d. After a hearing on November 16, 1981, the probate court ordered Mr. Teasel to be hospitalized, finding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\">\"[b]y clear and convincing evidence [that Mr. Teasel] is a person requiring treatment because [he] is mentally ill, and as a result of that illness: can be reasonably expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure others, and has engaged in an act or acts or made significant threats that are substantially supportive of the expectation\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The probate court order, filed on November 16, 1981, required that Mr. Teasel be hospitalized at the Clinton Valley Center. Officials of the defendant Department of Mental Health released him from hospitalization four days later, on November 20, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On January 4, 1982, while Mr. Teasel was incarcerated in the Oakland County Jail awaiting trial on the criminal sexual conduct charge, this lawsuit was filed in the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a complaint entitled \"Complaint for Injunctive Relief\u2019, Mr. Teasel prayed for the following relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u2014An injunction compelling the Department of Mental Health to return him immediately to a state hospital for treatment until he was no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\"a person requiring treatment\u201d as defined by statute;</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">\u2014An injunction compelling the defendant to file petitions for plaintiffs commitment to a hospital facility;</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\u2014An order requiring the Department of Mental Health to show cause why the requested injunctive relief should not be granted; and</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u2014Other appropriate equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The Department of Mental Health moved for summary or accelerated judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before decision on the defendant\u2019s motions, Mr. Teasel filed an amended complaint naming the directors of the Michigan Department of Mental Health and the Clinton Valley Center as additional defendants. He alleged in the amended complaint that the newly added defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u2014\"[Discharged [the] plaintiff from hospitalization in violation of the court order, the statutes and constitution\u201d because he was \"still a person requiring treatment as defined by the statute\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u2014\"[F]ailed to review the clinical status of plaintiff to determine whether he was still a person requiring treatment\u201d before discharging him from hospitalization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">After a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motions for summary and accelerated judgments, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>court denied the motions and ordered Mr. Teasel transferred from the Oakland County Jail to the custody of the Michigan Department of Mental Health to be hospitalized in a mental institution until further order of the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">The Court of Appeals peremptorily reversed the decision of the trial court, vacated its order, and \"granted\u201d the motions for summary and accelerated judgments that the defendants had filed in the circuit court. The Court of Appeals treated the plaintiffs complaint for injunctive relief, which it identified as \"Complaint for Mandamus\u201d, as a request for a hearing pursuant to GCR 1963, 820.1(7) and remanded the case \"[t]o the Oakland County Probate Court for a full evidentiary hearing regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the release of Allan Teasel by the Department of Mental Health\u201d. The probate court was also directed to \"[m]ake findings whether there was evidence to support the release of Allan Teasel in the light of his full psychiatric history, [to determine] whether his release constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>abuse of discretion and [to make] * * * other orders, if any be appropriate\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asql\">We granted leave to appeal. 417 Mich 884 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">The relief Mr. Teasel seeks, broadly stated, is hospitalization and treatment in a state institution until the condition of his health permits his discharge according to the terms of MCL 330.1476; MSA 14.800(476). Narrowly stated, the relief he seeks is an order returning him to the Clinton Valley Center for hospitalization until the individual defendants examine his clinical status and make an informed determination whether he is a person who is \"clinically suitable for discharge\u201d or requires further hospitalization as a \"person requiring treatment\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7476 and 401, respectively, of the Mental Health Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Mr. Teasel claims entitlement to the relief he seeks on two grounds:_</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>First, he asserts that the defendants discharged him from hospitalization in contravention of the probate court order of commitment and the Mental Health Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Second, he claims that neither the director of the Clinton Valley Center nor the Director of the Department of Mental Health ever reviewed his clinical status and medical records prior to his discharge from the Clinton Valley Center in order to determine whether he was still \"a person requiring treatment\u201d and thus failed to make the discharge decision as required by \u00a7 476. He claims that the Director of the Department of Mental Health merely ordered his discharge arbitrarily and in keeping with what Mr. Teasel characterizes as the \"revolving door policy\u201d of the Department of Mental Health. Mr. Teasel, therefore, seeks judicial intervention to compel the Department of Mental Health, through the individual defendants, to inform themselves of Teasel\u2019s clinical status before ordering his discharge from hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendants contend, as will be more fully detailed below, that the circuit court is entirely without jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">To the extent that the first of the plaintiff\u2019s claims is a request of this Court to pass upon the substantive correctness of the determination, if any, by the defendants that Mr. Teasel, at the time of his discharge from hospitalization, was not still a \"person requiring treatment\u201d, in the sense that he was \"mentally ill\u201d as defined in \u00a7 401, we decline to do so for the reasons stated in Part IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We are content to examine the narrower ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tion raised by Mr. Teasel which we perceive as having two subissues: 1) who, in the Department of Mental Health, is required by the Mental Health Code to determine an involuntarily committed patient\u2019s eligibility for discharge from hospitalization, and 2) whether the circuit court has the authority to compel the Department of Mental Health, by injunctive order, to continue the care and treatment of an involuntarily committed patient until the appropriate official of the Department of Mental Health, applying the standards set forth in the Mental Health Code, determines such patient\u2019s clinical suitability for discharge from hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">Our answer to the first question, applied to the facts of this case, is that the director of the Clinton Valley Center, or his designee, is obligated to determine Mr. Teasel\u2019s clinical status before ordering his discharge from hospitalization. Our answer to the second question is that the circuit court has authority to compel the exercise of such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Before stating our reasons for concluding that the circuit court has jurisdiction to entertain this litigation, and to order a portion of the relief requested, it may be helpful to describe more fully the specific claims of the parties and our understanding of the powers and duties of the defendants under the Mental Health Code concerning the hospitalization, care, treatment, and discharge of involuntarily committed patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The plaintiff claims that the circuit court has jurisdiction to compel the director of the Clinton Valley Center to make an informed decision whether to release him, and jurisdiction to order the plaintiff returned to the Clinton Valley Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>until such decision is made. The defendants assert that the circuit court\u2019s order of May 13, 1982, directing that Mr. Teasel be returned to the Clinton Valley Center, is, in essence, a civil commitment order issued without authority since the Legislature has confided to the probate court the exclusive jurisdiction under the Mental Health Code to order a person committed to a mental hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The plaintiff responds that he does not question the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court to order civil commitment under the Mental Health Code. He insists, however, that the circuit court has the constitutionally conferred authority to review for abuse of discretion, including the failure to decide according to statutory requirements, the decision of the director of a mental health facility to discharge a judicially committed patient, and the authority to order the continued hospitalization of a properly committed patient until the director renders a determination according to the standards for discharge enunciated in \u00a7 476. See fn 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We turn first to the question whether either of the individual defendants had a duty to review the plaintiffs clinical status and, upon the basis of that and any other relevant information, decide to discharge him from hospitalization in June, 1981. We will then address the question whether the circuit court has jurisdiction to order that a decision be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">At the hearing before the circuit court on the motions for summary and accelerated judgment, counsel for Mr. Teasel claimed that neither the Director of the Department of Mental Health nor the director of the Clinton Valley Center reviewed Mr. Teasel\u2019s clinical status before he was ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>discharged from the hospital. The assistant attorney general, appearing for the defendants, did not deny that claim but simply asserted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-3\">\"The allegations of the amended complaint insofar as they pertain to these two defendants are that each of them failed to review the clinical records of Allan Teasel before he was discharged from the Clinton Valley facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">\"There is no duty or obligation in law for the director of the Department of Mental Health or the director of a facility to review a patient\u2019s record before he is discharged\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Indeed, at the circuit court hearing, there was no representation by the defendants that there had been <em>any </em>review of plaintiff\u2019s clinical status by the named defendants or by anyone to whom such authority had been delegated. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated, at oral argument before the trial court and before this Court, that it was impossible to know from the plaintiffs hospital record whether there had been a review of plaintiffs clinical status by anyone, and stated the belief that there had been none.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The assistant attorney general, appearing on behalf of the defendants, did not, until appearing before this Court, represent that there had been <em>any </em>clinical review of the plaintiffs medical status by <em>anyone. </em>Before this Court, the assistant attorney general opined that a \"team\u201d determination had been made to discharge plaintiff, and that, \"I can\u2019t say for sure whether the chief clinician actually interviewed Allan Teasel. I know that he did review the decision of the treatment team, and with the treatment or team psychiatrist and reviewed their recommendation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Nowhere in the Mental Health Code is the Director of the Department of Mental Health personally charged with the responsibility to determine a patient\u2019s clinical readiness for discharge, nor is he empowered to order such discharge. While the Legislature has explicitly authorized \"the director\u201d to \"discharge\u201d judicially hospitalized patients whom the \"director deems clinically suitable for discharge\u201d, and has mandated the \"director\u201d to \"discharge a patient hospitalized by court order when the patient\u2019s mental condition is such that he no longer meets the criteria of a person requiring treatment\u201d, see fn 8, the \"director\u201d to which the statute has reference is defined in \u00a7 400 as \"the chief officer of a hospital or a person authorized by a director to act on his behalf\u2019. The Director of the Department of Mental Health has no such duty. It is clear then that broad discretion is confided to the director of a hospital facility, or his delegate, concerning the decision whether a patient is a person \"clinically suitable for discharge\u201d or \"requiring treatment\u201d, but it is not confided to the Director of the Department of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The standards or criteria according to which the determination is to be made are established not only in \u00a7 476, see fn 8, but also by fair implication in other relevant provisions of the Mental Health Code. The Department of Mental Health has the duty, for example, to \"ensure that adequate and appropriate mental health services are available to all citizens throughout the state\u201d. MCL 330.1116; MSA 14.800(116). Probate courts may order an individual \"hospitalized\u201d, MCL 330.1468; MSA 14.800(468), and hospitalization is defined as providing \"treatment for a person as an inpatient\u201d. MCL 330.1400(d); MSA 14.800(400)(d). Treatment is defined as including \"care, diagnostic, and thera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>peutic services\u201d, MCL 330.1400(e); MSA 14.800(400)(e), and the decision to discharge a patient depends upon the decision of a health facility director, or his delegate, that a patient is \"clinically suitable for discharge\u201d, MCL 330.1476(1); MSA 14.800(476)(1), or \"no longer meets the criteria of a person requiring treatment\u201d, MCL 330.1476(2); MSA 14.800(476X2).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\">Taken together, the foregoing provisions clearly mean that Mr. Teasel\u2019s judicially ordered hospitalization was for the purpose of treatment, including therapy, and the decision to discharge him from treatment required the competent professional judgment of the director of the Clinton Valley Center \"or a person authorized by [him]\u201d that the plaintiff met the statutory criteria for discharge. Such a judgment could not have been made unless Mr. Teasel\u2019s clinical status was evaluated by reference to his medical records, history, and mental health at the time of discharge. Plainly, a judgment concerning those matters calls for the exercise of sound and informed professional clinical discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">As we have said, the Mental Health Code, taken as a whole, imposes a clear legal duty upon the director of a facility to which a patient has been judicially committed, or his designee, to make an informed decision to discharge the patient. Manifestly, the decision whether a hospitalized patient is \"clinically suitable for discharge\u201d or \"no longer meets the criteria of a person requiring treatment\u201d is a matter of professional judgment. The nature of psychiatric care and treatment to be provided to a hospitalized patient and the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>whether treatment is any longer necessary are matters calling for the exercise of informed medical judgment of a highly specialized sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Although it is clear to us that the decision to release a judicially hospitalized patient is discretionary with health care professionals, it is equally clear to us that those health care professionals are under a clear duty to render an informed determination whether to release such a patient from care. Mr. Teasel claims his discharge was solely the result of application of an alleged \"revolving door policy\u201d by which persons who are charged with and awaiting trial for criminal offenses, and who are judicially committed to a mental health facility by order of the probate court, are given no care and treatment, but instead are promptly discharged from hospitalization without regard to the condition of their mental health and returned to the criminal courts for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The defendants have taken the position that the decision whether to discharge a patient from hospitalization is confided, by \u00a7 476 of the Mental Health Code, to the director of a hospital facility and that it is a decision which is unreviewable by any court, even for abuse, or for the director\u2019s complete failure to decide in accordance with the statutory provisions. Indeed, the assistant attorney general argued before this Court that even if the release decision were determined by \"flipping a coin\u201d, no court would have authority to review that procedure or order a remedy. The remedy for such a concededly hypothetical situation,, according to the assistant attorney general, would be an appeal to the director of the institution, to the Director of the Department of Mental Health, or ultimately to the Governor; and if the Governor did not order the necessary relief, \"then I suppose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>next time you elect a new Governor. These are decisions of the executive branch, and not of the courts\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\">We do not agree. We hold that a circuit court is constitutionally and statutorily empowered to review, . upon a proper petition, the procedure by which a patient, hospitalized under a probate court order of civil commitment, is discharged, in order to determine whether the official ordering the discharge decided according to the criteria for discharge established by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We hold further that if it is determined, upon an evidentiary hearing, that such an informed decision has not been made, a circuit court is empowered to compel its making.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 13 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\"The circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters not prohibited by law; * * * power to issue, hear and determine prerogative and remedial writs\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">MCL 600.605; MSA 27A.605 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\"Circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear and determine all civil claims and remedies, except where exclusive jurisdiction is given in the constitution or by statute to some other court or where the circuit courts are denied jurisdiction by the constitution or statutes of this state\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">See also MCL 600.601; MSA 27A.601, MCL 600.4401; MSA 27A.4401.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">It is beyond dispute that the constitutional authority of circuit courts includes the common-law power to issue writs of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>not lie to control the exercise or direction of the discretion to be exercised. Moreover, it will not lie for the purpose of reviewing, revising, or controlling the exercise of discretion reposed in administrative bodies. However, the writ will lie to require a body or an officer charged with a duty to take action in the matter, notwithstanding the fact that the execution of that duty may involve some measure of discretion. See <em>Bischoff v Wayne </em>County, 320 Mich 376, 385-387; 31 NW2d 798 (1948); <em>Michigan State Dental Society v Secretary of State, </em>294 Mich 503, 514-519; 293 NW 865 (1940).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, mandamus will lie to compel the exercise of discretion, but not to compel its exercise in a particular manner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b617-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>This Court has held that it has the power to compel a county board of supervisors to act in their executive capacity and to pay an obligation imposed by law, <em>People ex rel Bristow v Macomb County Supervisors, </em>3 Mich 475 (1855). We have issued a writ of mandamus compelling the expenditure of withheld funds that by law could only be used for the completion of a jail, <em>Attorney General ex rel Greenfield v Alcona County Board of Supervisors, </em>167 Mich 666; 133 NW 825 (1911). We have ordered that boards of supervisors render unto public employees their salaries that were owing them, <em>Sturgis v Allegan County, </em>343 Mich 209; 72 NW2d 56 (1955), and we have stated that a court has the power to compel commissioners responsible for the upkeep and repair of a jail to comply with the Legislature\u2019s directive upon a showing that they have failed or refused to meet their responsibility under the statute, <em>Wayne County Jail Inmates v Wayne County Sheriff, </em>391 Mich 359; 216 NW2d 910 (1974). When agencies of government fail to perform duties imposed by the Legislature or the constitution, the courts will not hesitate to order performance. <em>Jail Inmates, supra; King v Director of Midland County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>73 Mich App 253; 251 NW2d 270 (1977); <em>Wayne County Prosecutor v Wayne County Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>93 Mich App 114, 121; 286 NW2d 62 (1979); <em>Kosa v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>78 Mich App 316; 259 NW2d 463 (1977), <em>aff'd in part and modi\u00f1ed on other grounds </em>408 Mich 356, 383; 292 NW2d 452 (1980) . See, generally, 4 Davis, Administrative Law, ch 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We think, therefore, that it is clear and settled that a circuit court has the power to compel an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>agency of government, through its officials, to discharge a duty imposed by law. The power is not one to create a duty where none existed before or to mandate action where the decision whether to act is discretionary. Rather, the power is the constitutional power of a circuit court to direct, upon the complaint of an aggrieved party, that a duty imposed by law upon the executive department of government to make a decision according to legislatively established criteria be carried out. Were it otherwise, our citizens would be powerless to compel their public servants to conduct the business of government \u2014 to make a decision, whether good or bad, but some decision, based upon the legislatively established criteria where the duty to <em>make </em>a decision is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">While, as we have said, we do not consider today whether a circuit court has authority to review the substantive correctness of the professional judgment that a patient is \"clinically suitable for discharge\u201d or no longer \"a person requiring treatment\u201d, we do hold that the circuit court is empowered, upon general principles, to determine, upon the petition of a patient hospitalized by court order, whether the decision reposed by statute in an official of the Department of Mental Health to discharge such a patient, has been reached following a full and careful evaluation of the individualized facts of the patient\u2019s clinical record and the current condition of his mental health, and to compel, by writ of mandamus, the exercise of such professional judgment as a condition precedent to discharging the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Addressing the specific relief afforded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>circuit court in this case (see fn 6), the defendants assert that the circuit court\u2019s order, while not so denominated, was in reality a writ of mandamus compelling the directors of the Department of Mental Health and the Clinton Valley Center to readmit and retain appellant in a mental health facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">However, defendants argue that, even assuming the court\u2019s authority to act, mandamus is not a proper remedy for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">First, mandamus will not issue unless there is no other adequate remedy, <em>Hill v State Highway </em>Comm, 382 Mich 398, 402; 170 NW2d 18 (1969), and plaintiff had the alternative remedies of seeking private treatment on a voluntary basis or petitioning the probate court for a new involuntary commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Second, mandamus should not have issued in this case because plaintiff had no clear, legal right, nor did the defendants have any clear, legal duty, to admit and retain plaintiff in a mental health facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Neither argument is persuasive. As to the first, while it is evident that treatment on a voluntary basis, even if it were within Mr. Teasel\u2019s financial capacity, would address his need for mental health care, the point is immaterial. While the long-term purpose of the appellant\u2019s lawsuit is to obtain the care and treatment of which he was judicially declared in need, its immediate purpose is to compel the defendants to perform the duty imposed upon them by law before ordering Mr. Teasel to be discharged from hospitalization. The \"alternative remedy\u201d defendants suggest would operate to circumvent that duty. In addition, we fail to perceive how a petition by appellant, seeking a new involuntary commitment in the probate court, provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>any remedy at all. Plaintiff is asserting that defendants have a \"revolving door policy\u201d, evidenced by the failure of the defendants to review a patient\u2019s, particularly his own, clinical status prior to the release decision. The \"remedy\u201d of seeking another involuntary commitment is not a remedy that will rectify the situation of which the plaintiff complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Defendant\u2019s second point is that \"mandamus should not have issued in this case [because] plaintiff had no clear, legal right, nor did the defendants have any clear, legal duty, to admit and retain Allan Teasel in a mental health facility\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Whether the defendant had a duty to admit Mr. Teasel to a mental health facility upon the commitment order of the probate court is not an issue in this lawsuit and is therefore immaterial. Mr. Teasel does not claim that the defendants had a \"clear legal duty\u201d to retain him at the Clinton Valley Center, but that \"they\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> had a \"clear legal duty\u201d to review his \"clinical status\u201d prior to the decision to release him, in order to make the necessary informed professional judgment whether he was \"clinically suitable for release\u201d or still \"a person requiring treatment\u201d as defined by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We agree. It is contrary to the entire import of the Mental Health Code that defendants could make a decision to release based, as was hypothe-cated, on flipping a coin or by arbitrarily releasing, for example, every third patient. Admittedly, the nature of decisions concerning psychiatric care, treatment, and discharge from hospitalization involves the application of specialized knowledge, experience, and professional judgment. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the plaintiff does not seek to control the director\u2019s discretion, but to compel him to make an informed judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, that Court granted defendant\u2019s motions for summary and accelerated judgment, correctly stating that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to conduct <em>original proceedings </em>in mental commitment cases. However, the fact that the circuit court is without jurisdiction to conduct <em>original </em>proceedings in mental commitment cases does not speak to the issue presented in this case. The Court of Appeals order fails to address plaintiffs essential aver-ments that he was released without any review of his clinical status, and that a court has authority to require that the proper public health official make an informed decision as a condition precedent to releasing the plaintiff from hospitalization. Observing \"that there may be substantial question whether there is an evidentiary basis for the release of plaintiff\u201d, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the probate court for an evidentiary hearing and finding by the probate judge \"whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>there was evidence to support the release * * * in the light of [Mr. Teasel\u2019s] full psychiatric history, whether his release constituted an abuse of discretion and for such other orders, if . any be appropriate\u201d. See fn 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">Both parties concede that the probate court is without jurisdiction to hold the hearing ordered by the Court of Appeals and lacks the power to issue any relief as contemplated by the Court of Appeals order, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The probate court is a court of limited jurisdiction and is entirely a creature of statute. See Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 15; <em>In re Kasuba Estate, </em>401 Mich 560, 565-566; 258 NW2d 731 (1977). There is no authority cited, nor have we found any, for the proposition that a probate court has the power to issue general equitable relief. The Legislature has not granted mandamus powers or general equitable jurisdiction to probate courts. Although a probate court, being a court of record, does have the contempt power, MCL 600.1416 and 600.1701(3); MSA 27A.1416 and 27A.170K3), a probate court may not, logically, adjudge defendants in contempt for that which it could not order to be done by mandamus or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In remanding the case to the probate court for hearing, as well as in granting the defendant\u2019s motions for summary and accelerated judgments, the Court of Appeals erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Mr. Teasel also would have us declare that the medical soundness of the decision of the director of a mental facility to release a judicially committed patient is subject to judicial review. He asserts also that . \u00a7476 is contrary to public policy in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>it provides no judicial review whatsoever of the decisions of the Department of Mental Health in releasing hospitalized patients. Since we have held that the circuit court has jurisdiction to require that an informed decision be made whether to release a judicially committed patient, and since we are remanding to have the circuit court determine whether such decision was in fact made, we need not reach or decide this issue. It would be premature to do so. The plaintiff has alleged, and wishes the opportunity to prove, that an informed decision was not rendered by the appropriate official prior to plaintiffs release from hospitalization. We hold that he is entitled to that opportunity and that the circuit court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We reserve for another day consideration of the question whether, where such a decision is made, the judiciary is empowered to review its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals, granting the defendant\u2019s motions for summary and accelerated judgment and remanding the case to the probate court for further proceedings, is vacated, as is our stay in connection therewith. The case is remanded to the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing at which the defendants shall have the opportunity to show whether the decision to discharge Mr. Teasel from hospitalization was an informed judgment based upon consideration and evaluation by the director of the Clinton Valley Center, or his designee, of the plaintiffs clinical status, medical record and mental health, and was otherwise made in conformity with the provisions of the Mental Health Code, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u00a7 476, and this opinion.

See, generally, 4 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 181 and Supp. Mandamus will lie to enforce a clear legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">We observe in passing that neither party has addressed the specific question whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to issue its order in this case. It has been assumed that plaintiffs complaint was one for mandamus. MCL 600.4401; MSA 27A.4401 allows a complaint for mandamus against a state officer to be brought in either the circuit court or in the Court of Appeals. However, GCR 1963, 714.1(1), requires that a complaint for mandamus against a state officer be instituted in the Court of Appeals. See MCR 3.305(A)(1), <em>effective March 1, 1985 </em>(actions for mandamus against a state officer may be brought in the Court of Appeals or the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The plaintiff did not denominate his complaint as a complaint for mandamus. Indeed, his amended complaint sought <em>injunctive </em>relief, and does not mention mandamus. The word \"mandamus\u201d does not appear in the record of the May 5, 1982, hearing that culminated in the trial court\u2019s order requiring the Department of Mental Health to place plaintiff in a mental institution, although the term \"mandatory injunction\u201d does.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The Court of Appeals, without explanation, stated, in its order, fn 7 <em>supra, </em>that it was treating \"plaintiffs complaint for mandamus\u201d as a request pursuant to GCR 1963, 820.1(7). It is wholly unclear whether the trial judge considered the difference between a mandatory injunction and a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">A circuit court has the power and jurisdiction possessed by courts of record at common law (as altered by constitution, laws, and rules of the Supreme Court) and it has the power and jurisdiction possessed by courts and judges in chancery in England on March 1, 1847 (as altered by constitution, laws, and rules of the Supreme Court). MCL 600.601; MSA 27A.601. There has been a merger of law and equity in this jurisdiction. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5; MCL 600.223(4); MSA 27A.223(4); GCR 1963, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">It is unclear,, however, whether the prior statutory prohibition and the current General Court Rule against bringing writs of mandamus against state officers in the circuit court were meant to apply to mandatory injunctions. A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy at law; a mandatory injunction is traditionally a remedy in equity. See, generally, 43 CJS, Injunctions, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 8; 55 CJS, Mandamus, \u00a7 2(b); 52 Am Jur 2d, Mandamus, \u00a7 4; 42 Am Jur 2d, Injunctions, \u00a723.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">A mandatory injunction is, in the strictest sense, an interlocutory instrument. <em>Burch v State Highway Comm\u2019r, </em>362 Mich 488, 497-502; 107 NW2d 791 (1961) (Black, J., <em>dissenting); </em>4 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed), part IV, group II, ch I, \u00a7 III, pp 970-971.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Whether the remedy awarded is termed a writ of mandamus or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>mandatory injunction, the decision to issue that relief is discretionary with the trial court. <em>Donovan v Guy, </em>344 Mich 187, 192; 73 NW2d 471 (1955) (mandamus is a discretionary writ); <em>DeYoung v State Land Office Board, </em>316 Mich 61, 66; 24 NW2d 424 (1946) (a writ of mandamus is a writ of grace and not a writ of right); <em>Livonia Drive-In Theater Co v Livonia, </em>363 Mich 438, 446; 109 NW2d 837 (1961) (the remedy of mandamus is discretionary and such a writ will issue against public officials only to compel the enforcement of a clear legal duty); <em>Steggles v National Discount Corp, </em>326 Mich 44, 50; 39 NW2d 237; 15 ALR2d 208 (1949) (mandatory injunction is largely a matter of discretion of the trial court). See, generally, 52 Am Jur 2d, Mandamus, \u00a7\u00a7 31-42; 42 Am Jur 2d, Injunctions, \u00a7\u00a7 24-38; 55 CJS, Mandamus, \u00a7 9; 43 CJS, Injunctions, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We do not decide, and indeed we need not decide, the preferred label for the relief awarded by the trial court. The circuit court, in its opinion from the bench, stated that the order was to be a <em>mandatory injunction. </em>We note that the relief requested by plaintiff is probably more in the nature of a mandatory injunction since the plaintiff sought injunctive relief and since the trial court\u2019s order obviously envisioned further proceedings, because the order required defendant to institutionalize plaintiff until further order of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
