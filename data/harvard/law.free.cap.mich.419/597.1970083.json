O\u2019Dowd was driving when he was killed in an automobile accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>by the wrongful death act, this action was brought by the personal representative of his estate, his wife, Kathleen O\u2019Dowd.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint seeks to recover on a product liability theory and for four categories of damages: 1) medical, hospital, and funeral expenses incurred by the estate; 2) pain and suffering endured by O\u2019Dowd following the accident and before his death; 3) loss of support, society, and companionship suffered by the heirs of his estate; and 4) loss of support, society, and companionship suffered by O\u2019Dowd\u2019s wife, Kathleen, and son, Thomas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>During the hours preceding the accident, O\u2019Dowd had consumed beer and liquor at the Hillcrest Country Club. The trial court granted General Motors leave to file a third-party complaint seeking contribution from Hillcrest on the basis of an alleged violation of the dramshop act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed. The Court reasoned that contribution was not obtainable because this action had been brought by the personal representative of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s estate and only O\u2019Dowd\u2019s heirs could maintain a dramshop action against Hillcrest:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">\"Because the potential liability of the club is to plaintiff in her individual capacity it cannot be said to be a common liability with that of [General Motors] to plaintiff as personal representative of her husband\u2019s estate. In these circumstances, contribution is not appropriate and the country club should not have been added as a third-party defendant.\u201d <em>O\u2019Dowd v General Motors </em>Corporation, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided October 12, 1982 (Docket No. 58178).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">At common law, contribution was not, as a general rule, recoverable among or between joint wrongdoers or tortfeasors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature partially abrogated the common-law bar by adopting the 1939 Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act which provided for contribution in respect of a judgment obtained against two or more persons jointly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court abolished remnants of the common-law rule in <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314, 329, 334; 174 NW2d 797 (1970).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Subsequently, the Legislature, at the urging of the Law Revision Commission,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> substituted<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the substance of the 1955 Uniform Contribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Among Tortfeasors Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for the 1941 act. Section 1 of the statute now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">\"(1) Except as otherwise provided in this act, when 2 or more persons <em>become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to a person or property or for the same wrongful death, </em>there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The former limitation on contribution among tortfeasors to the class of tortfeasors where a judgment was obtained against two or more persons jointly was thought to preclude contribution where (i) the acts of the tortfeasors were separate, independent, or concurrent rather than joint or in concert, or (ii) where the tortfeasors were liable in tort on different legal theories.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The revised act by explicitly providing for contribution among tortfea-sors \"severally\u201d liable in tort extended contribution to these situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Under the revised act, all that is necessary to enforce contribution is that the tortfeasors commonly share a burden of tort liability<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or, as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>sometimes put, there is a common burden of liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Had O\u2019Dowd survived the accident, and Kathleen or Thomas<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> had joined him in bringing a product liability action against General Motors, Hillcrest and General Motors would share a common burden of tort liability to Kathleen and Thomas.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If O\u2019Dowd had been injured by a drunken driver, the tavern, the manufacturer of the automobile and the driver could be under a common burden of tort liability to O\u2019Dowd and his wife and child. Yet it is argued, and the Court of Appeals held, that General Motors and Hillcrest cannot share a common burden of tort liability in this case because any tort liability on the part of General Motors in this wrongful death action would be owed to the personal representative of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s estate and any tort liability on the part of Hillcrest would be owed to O\u2019Dowd\u2019s heirs in their individual capacities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Thus, O\u2019Dowd\u2019s personal representative essentially contends that contribution among tortfeasors is obtainable only where a common burden of tort liability is owed to the same plaintiff. We do not agree._</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Section 1 of the contribution statute provides for contribution among tortfeasors \"jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to a person or property or for the same wrongful death\u201d. The statute does not in terms focus on the identity of the plaintiff, but rather on the nature of the injury suffered; section 1 says nothing about the capacity in which the plaintiff brought the action. We do not understand the phrase \"to a person or property\u201d as conditioning contribution among tortfea-sors on liability to the same plaintiff, but rather as providing that contribution is obtainable without regard to whether the defendants have been sued for injury to person, injury to property, or wrongful death. If the defendants are jointly or severally liable in tort for \"the same injury to a person\u201d or for \"the same injury to * * * property\u201d or for \"the same wrongful death\u201d, contribution pursuant to \u00a7 1 is obtainable. It was not part of the legislative purpose to provide for contribution from a dram-shop where the injured person survives an automobile accident, but to deny it where he was killed in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">This view is supported by \u00a74 of the statute, which omits the phrase \"to a person or property\u201d and provides for setoff when the , plaintiff settles with \"1 or 2 or more persons liable in tort <em>for the same injury or the same wrongful death\u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Legislature did not intend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>limit contribution under \u00a7 1 to tortfeasors liable to the same plaintiff while requiring setoff under \u00a7 4 where tortfeasors are liable for the same injury or for the same wrongful death, but are not liable to the same plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">In <em>Moyses, supra, </em>this Court \"returned the doctrine of contribution among non-intentional wrongdoers to the original equitable rules\u201d. <em>Caldwell v Fox, </em>394 Mich 401, 419-420; 231 NW2d 46 (1975). It would not be consistent with equitable rules to deny contribution because a wrongful death action may only be maintained by the deceased\u2019s personal representative. The Supreme Court of Minnesota, responding to the argument that there was no common liability to the injured person in tort, said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">\"Contribution is a flexible, equitable remedy designed to accomplish a fair allocation of loss among parties. Such a remedy should be utilized to achieve fairness on particular facts, unfettered by outworn technical concepts like common liability.\u201d <em>Lambertson v Cincinnati Corp, </em>312 Minn 114, 128; 257 NW2d 679 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The contribution statute provides a substantive basis for contribution, grounded in the concept that where more than one person is legally responsible for the loss they should share in and contribute to the cost of providing reparations, which is not dependent on the form of the several causes of action. <em>Cf. Sziber v Stout, </em>419 Mich 514; 358 NW2d 330 (1984)._</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">General Motors is not seeking contribution for two categories of damages sought in this wrongful death action by the personal representative of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s estate: 1) medical, hospital, and funeral expenses incurred by the estate; and 2) pain and suffering endured by O\u2019Dowd following the accident and before his death. Kathleen and Thomas O\u2019Dowd could not recover for such elements of damages from Hillcrest in a dramshop action, and General Motors cannot obtain contribution therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">General Motors is seeking contribution with respect to damages compensating for the loss of support, society, and companionship. With respect to these damages, General Motors and Hillcrest may become \"severally liable in tort * * * for the same wrongful death\u201d, and contribution is proper under \u00a7 1 although the capacities in which plaintiffs may maintain an action differ. See <em>Jones v Fisher, </em>309 NW2d 726 (Minn, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Though the identity of the plaintiff in this wrongful death action against General Motors differs from the plaintiff in a dramshop action against Hillcrest, the beneficiaries of a recovery for loss of support, society, and companionship will in each case be Kathleen and Thomas O\u2019Dowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Counsel for the personal representative represented to this Court during oral argument that a dramshop action filed in the Macomb Circuit Court against Hillcrest by Kathleen and Thomas O\u2019Dowd in their individual capacities has been settled.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Although this representation by counsel is not part of the record on appeal,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we note that \u00a7 4 of the contribution statute suggests that under such circumstances General Motors might not be entitled to contribution from Hillcrest although it might seek a setoff in respect to the settlement paid by Hillcrest to Kathleen and Thomas O\u2019Dowd.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\">In all events, it is no longer necessary, in light of the settlement, to consider whether, because of potential prejudice to the plaintiff, the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted General Motors to file a third-party complaint for contribution against Hillcrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b815-5\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Ryan, Brick-ley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Levin, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\"> \"(1) Whenever the death of a person or injuries resulting in death shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, in respect thereof, then and in every such case, the person who, or the corporation which would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony.
