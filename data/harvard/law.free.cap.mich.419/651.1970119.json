They wore white uniforms, and their duties consisted of picking up refuse from city streets with a hand shovel and a broom and placing it in white wheeled barrels which they pushed. Plaintiffs were represented exclusively by defendant labor union. The position of white winger was considered a light-duty job and, prior to the summer of 1975, the city\u2019s practice was to assign that duty, for the most part, to individuals who were physically unable to work on its garbage truck crews.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">However, under a 1973 collective-bargaining agreement between the city and the union, employees in the job classification of sanitation laborer were all subject to the same job duties. In the summer of 1975, the city ordered the white wingers to submit to physical examinations in order to determine if they were physically able to perform all duties required of sanitation laborers. Subsequently, several white wingers were retired, placed on leaves of absence, or placed on workers\u2019 compensation. On September 8, 1975, a number of the white wingers contacted the union steward concerning the city\u2019s apparently new policy. Ten days later, a conference was held between the city and the union to discuss the situation. However, the city adhered to its position that all workers within the sanitation laborer classification had to fulfill all job duties._</p>\n<p id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The next day, September 19, 1975, the city gave the union the following written notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-4\">\"Employees who cannot perform regular job assignments because of failing health are eligible for sick leave according to the master agreement. Failing health is a personal problem, and we do not have light jobs in this department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On September 30, 1975, the union instituted grievance proceedings on behalf of plaintiffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first two steps of the grievance procedure were waived and, on October 9, 1975, the grievances were denied at the third step by the City Commission Administrative Coordinator. Under article 8 of the collective-bargaining agreement, defendant union had 15 days to proceed to step four of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>grievance procedure by referring the grievance to the Appeal and Review Board. At a Local 26 union meeting conducted on October 24, 1975, members were told that the grievances were being processed by Council 77. Also, the District Council 77 executive director testified before the hearing referee that, as a matter of policy, he processed all step-three grievances to step four. In fact, defendant union did not proceed to step four within the 15-day time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">On February 17, 1976, plaintiffs filed unfair labor practice charges, alleging that the city had improperly influenced union affairs to plaintiffs\u2019 detriment and that the union had breached its duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The hearing referee found, and no one disputes, that the failure to process the grievance was without explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">\"In the present case, the white wing grievance stopped at the third step. What happened to it is a matter of conjecture. Local union president Robertson testified he pushed for arbitration. Council 77 personnel say they didn\u2019t get the request, which brings up three possibilities. First, the local didn\u2019t press the matter the way they said they would by written request through union channels. Secondly, Council 77 mishandled the grievance processing or thirdly, that someone in the local or council purposely dropped the entire thing. From the testimony, it appears as though either the local or Council 77 representatives mishandled the grievance by neglecting to follow procedure, to process the grievance to arbitration. The question is, then, is this lack of action, arguably, an unfair labor practice under PERA \u2014 without any further inquiry as to merit or lack of it in the grievance itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-9\">\"In this case, there is an absence of evidence of purpose (or motive, if you will) to the failure of the union local or council to pursue the grievance. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>subject matter had been the object of a special conference with the city. Both the local union and the union council, though passing the blame for failure to process back and forth, apparently show no hostility, animosity, or invidious motivation toward any of the white wingers, or their claim. At best, from the viewpoint of the charging party, the union local or council did not efficiently do as they said they would. Absent other considerations, such action is not, in the opinion of this writer, an unfair labor practice under Michigan law\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Accordingly, the referee recommended dismissal of the action and, on August 11, 1979, the Michigan Employment Relations Commission issued its decision, adopting that recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\"Where the union has vigorously pursued the grievance through three steps of the grievance procedure and no animosity is shown, we will presume that the union has fulfilled its collective-bargaining obligation.

The apparent negligence in failing to request arbitration does not constitute a breach of the duty of fair representation, where no unlawful intent has been proven. <em>[Local 542, Council 77,] American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO [v Rupinski], </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 861.

Also, see generally, Anno: <em>Union\u2019s Liability in Damages for Refusal or Failure to Process Employee Grievance, </em>34 ALR3d 884.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Although <em>Vaca, supra, </em>and <em>Lowe, supra, </em>appear to set forth a simple rule, they have engendered much debate over the requisite evidentiary proofs and burdens, especially as regards union enforcement of grievance procedures embodied in collective-bargaining agreements. In <em>Vaca, supra, </em>p 177, the Supreme Court of the United States made it clear that a union\u2019s duty of fair representation is comprised of three distinct responsibilities: (1) \"to serve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any\u201d, (2) \"to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty\u201d, and (3) \"to avoid arbitrary conduct\u201d. A union\u2019s failure to comply with any one of those three responsibilities constitutes a breach of its duty of fair representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">\"A union must conform its behavior to each of these three separate standards. First, it must treat all factions and segments of its membership without hostility or discrimination. Next, the broad discretion of the union in asserting the rights of its individual members must be exercised in complete good faith and honesty. Finally, the union must avoid arbitrary conduct. Each of these requirements represents a distinct and separate obligation, the breach of which may constitute the basis for civil action.\u201d <em>Griffin v International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America UAW, </em>469 F2d 181, 183 (CA 4, 1972). Also <em>Tedford v Peabody Coal Co, </em>533 F2d 952, 957 (CA 5, 1976); <em>Ruzicka v General Motors Corp, </em>523 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>F2d 306, 309-310 (CA 6, 1975), <em>reh den </em>528 F2d 912 (CA 6, 1975) <em>(Ruzicka I).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">\"[t]he major goal of the duty of fair representation is to identify and protect individual expectations as far as possible without undermining collective interests. Where the individual and collective group interests clash, the former must yield to the latter. When collective bargaining agreements are executed, there may be many provisions which lead individual employees to believe they are entitled to specified benefits but, in the final analysis, the collective group interests must remain paramount. The nature of any labor policy requires an election between preserving the group interests through democratic processes and adopting external restraints to protect the minority.\u201d <em>Tedford, supra, </em>pp 956-957.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 unfair labor practice charge against the union did not allege discriminatory conduct. However, it did allege that the union had acted in bad faith and arbitrarily. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence upon which to find that the union acted in bad faith. Thus, the only question before us is whether plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to find that the union breached its duty of fair representation by arbitrary conduct in the processing of their grievances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\"As in this case, courts generally have little difficulty in applying the 'discriminatory\u2019 and 'bad faith\u2019 standards of conduct to the facts presented to them. However, there is significant uncertainty in the cases as to what constitutes 'arbitrary\u2019 conduct and as to how arbitrary conduct is distinguishable from negligent conduct. See <em>Barhitte v Kroger Co, </em>85 CCH Labor Cases \u00b6 11,081 at p 20,231 (WD Mich, 1978). Due to this difficulty, the Court finds that some general discussion of what constitutes arbitrary and negligent conduct in fair representation cases is necessary.\u201d <em>Dutrisac v Caterpillar Tractor Co, </em>511 F Supp 719, 723 (ND Cal, 1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A. <em>Federal Cases.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Since <em>Vaca, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court has not spoken definitively to the problem before us. However, the federal district and circuit courts have had scores of suits raising the same issue, some on remarkably similar facts. Moreover, even though there has been disagreement over the conduct required by the three responsibilities composing the duty of fair representation, it has generally been recognized that <em>Vaca </em>enlarged that duty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\"><em>\"Vaca\u2019s </em>'repeated references to \"arbitrary\u201d union conduct reflects a calculated broadening of the fair representation standard.\u2019 * * * Thus, an inexplicable failure to fully process a grievance, without a determination of its merit, has been held to be so negligent that it amounts to 'arbitrary and perfunctory\u2019 handling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-9\">\"[However, i]t suffices that the union decides in good faith and on the basis of objective, rational criteria that the grievance lacks sufficient merit to justify the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>pense of arbitration.\u201d <em>Curth v Faraday, Inc, </em>401 F Supp 678, 681 (ED Mich, 1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The <em>Curth </em>court, while acknowledging a union\u2019s heightened responsibilities under the duty of fair representation, nevertheless blurred the distinctions between the three separate components of that duty. Indeed, although the plaintiff\u2019s claim was one of arbitrary union conduct, the court went on to state that the fact that \"the union refused to arbitrate a claim which it believed was meritorious * * * standing alone, supports neither an inference of bad faith nor one of discriminatory intent\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 682, fn 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the court held that the union\u2019s failure to arbitrate a grievance because of a lack of local union funds and because of a perception that the arbitrator would rule against the grievance did not constitute bad-faith or arbitrary conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Subsequently, in a landmark, but different, case, the Sixth Circuit made the following comments which apply with equal force to <em>Curth:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">\"We believe that the District Court misread <em>Vaca </em>when it held that 'bad faith\u2019 must be read into the separate and independent standards of 'arbitrary\u2019 or 'discriminatory\u2019 treatment.

Where these three elements are satisfied, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>omission is classified as being so egregious, so far short of minimum standards of fairness to the employee and so unrelated to legitimate union interests as to be arbitrary.\u201d Also <em>Robesky v Qantas Empire Airways </em>Ltd, 573 F2d 1082 (CA 9, 1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Further, after reviewing <em>Ruzicka I, Ciirth, </em>and <em>Ruggirello, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">\"[w]here there is no determination of the merits of an employee grievance and the union negligently misses a time limit resulting in depriving the employee of access to the mandatory grievance dispute process, the union has acted arbitrarily and so has breached its duty of fair representation.

Also <em>Field v Local 652 UAW AFL-CIO, </em>6 Mich App 140, 146-147; 148 NW2d 552 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The oft-stated maxim that \"a union is not liable to a member for breach of its duty of fair representation for mere negligence\u201d was repeated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Sims v United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers AFL-CIO, </em>26 Mich App 129, 132; 182 NW2d 90 (1970). Although citing the three standards of conduct set down in <em>Vaca, </em>the Court of Appeals found them not to encompass the union\u2019s failure to timely demand arbitration of the plaintiffs grievance. Accordingly, it was held that, since the complaint alleged only simple negligence, summary judgment should have been granted in favor of the union, <em>i.e., </em>the complaint did not state a claim for a breach of the duty of fair representation. <em>Sims, supra, </em>pp 132-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Conversely, in <em>Handwerk v United Steelworkers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number><em>of America, </em>67 Mich App 747, 750-753; 242 NW2d 514 (1976), the Court of Appeals found that allegations regarding the union\u2019s failure to timely demand arbitration pursuant to collectively bargained grievance procedure time limits did state a cause of action for a breach of the duty of fair representation due to arbitrary conduct so as to withstand a motion for summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117.2(1). The Court distinguished <em>Sims </em>as a pre-Lowe case. Thus, it relied not on <em>Sims, </em>but on <em>Ruzicka I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In <em>Merdler v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>77 Mich App 740, 746; 259 NW2d 211 (1977), the union did not process the plaintiffs grievance because it found the grievance to be without merit. The Court of Appeals, citing <em>Handwerk, </em>found that such conduct was not negligent. However, the Court of Appeals essentially held that the plaintiffs allegations of bad-faith conduct on the part of the union amounting to a breach of the duty of fair representation were conclusory and insufficient to state a claim. Thus, summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117.2(1) in favor of the union was proper. <em>Merdler, supra, </em>pp 745-747. Also <em>Martin v Shiawassee County Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>109 Mich App 32; 310 NW2d 896 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Similarly, in <em>Pearl v Detroit, </em>126 Mich App 228, 235-238; 336 NW2d 899 (1983), the union did not demand arbitration of the plaintiffs grievance because it found the grievance to be without merit. The Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs allegations of bad faith and discriminatory and arbitrary conduct on the part of the union amounting to a breach of the duty of fair representation were conclusory and, since the union had submitted affidavits and depositions showing that its conduct was proper which the plaintiff did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>rebut, summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117.2(3) in favor of the union was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">We must decide, generally, what constitutes arbitrary union conduct amounting to a breach of the duty of fair representation, and, specifically, whether defendant union\u2019s conduct in this case falls within that general definition. Initially, we think it clear that both the MERC and the Court of Appeals erred by requiring plaintiffs to show bad faith on the part of the union in order to establish a breach of the duty of fair representation due to arbitrary conduct. Indeed, the language of both <em>Vaca </em>and <em>Lowe </em>points out the error of the MERC and the Court of Appeals analyses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">An examination of the words in question is in order. As Judge McCree noted in <em>Ruzicka I, </em>both \"arbitrary\u201d and \"perfunctory\u201d are adjectives indicating an intentional act or omission. A standard dictionary definition of \"arbitrary\u201d is \"determined by whim or caprice\u201d, while that of \"perfunctory\u201d is \"done or acting routinely and with little interest or care\u201d. Similarly, \"whim\u201d means \"a sudden or capricious idea\u201d, while \"caprice\u201d means \"an impulsive change of mind\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">\"The words 'arbitrary\u2019 and 'capricious\u2019 have generally accepted meanings. The United States Supreme Court has defined the terms as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">\"Arbitrary is: ' \"[WJithout adequate determining principle * * * Fixed or arrived at through an exercise of will or by caprice, without consideration or adjustment with reference to principles, circumstances, or significance, * * * decisive but unreasoned\u201d \u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">\"Capricious is: ' \"[A]pt to change suddenly; freakish; whimsical; humorsome\u201d \u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>\"United States v Carmack, </em>329 US 230, 243; 67 S Ct 252; 91 L Ed 209 (1946).\u201d <em>Bundo v City of Walled Lake, </em>395 Mich 679, 703, fn 17; 238 NW2d 154 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In contrast, \"bad faith\u201d indicates an intentional act or omission undertaken dishonestly or fraudulently. Arbitrary or perfunctory conduct does not require a dishonest or fraudulent intention for its accomplishment. Consequently, a union, through arbitrary conduct and absent any bad faith, can breach its duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Further, for purposes of PERA, we do not interpret a union\u2019s responsibility to avoid arbitrary conduct narrowly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition to prohibiting impulsive, irrational, or unreasoned conduct, the duty of fair representation also proscribes inept conduct undertaken with little care or with indifference to the interests of those affected. We think the latter proscription includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances: (1) the failure to exercise discretion when that failure can reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any or all union members, and (2) extreme recklessness or gross negligence which can reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any or all union members. We hold that the conduct of defendant union in this case is encompassed by the foregoing prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Testimony before the hearing referee indicated that the local union determined that plaintiffs\u2019 grievances had merit and processed them through the first three steps of the collectively bargained grievance procedure. The local claimed to have then forwarded the grievances to the district council for further processing through the grievance mechanism. However, although it was the district\u2019s practice to process all step-three grievances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>to step four, plaintiffs\u2019 grievances were not timely processed to step four. The district could offer no reason for that failure, other than to claim that it never received the grievances from the local.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Although we agree with the maxim that a union\u2019s mere negligence does not constitute a breach of its duty of fair representation, the conduct in this case amounted to much more. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit would find that the negligence was not ordinary because there was no reliance on a past practice. <em>Ruzicka II; Ruzicka III. </em>Rather, the failure to process the grievances to step four was directly contrary to the union\u2019s past practice. Absent a reasoned, good-faith, nondiscriminatory decision not to process a grievance,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> if elected union officials fail to comply with collectively bargained grievance procedure time limits, the union has acted arbitrarily and breached its duty of fair representation. Union officials should certainly be aware of grievance procedure time limits which are included in an agreement which the union collectively bargained for on behalf of its members. Their inexplicable failure to comply with those limits indicates inept conduct undertaken with little care or with indifference to the interests of those affected, an extreme recklessness or gross negligence which could reasonably have been expected to have had an adverse effect on the griev-ants.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">We adopt the following comments of the federal district court in <em>Dutrisac, supra, </em>p 728, as they are a fitting conclusion to this analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-8\">\"The Court wishes to point to two very compelling reasons that conduct such as that found in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>case should not constitute only 'mere* negligence. First, the collective bargaining agreement provides that only the union can file for arbitration on behalf of the employee with the- employer; the employee himself cannot file. This is a common provision in collective bargaining agreements. This provision, negotiated and entered into by the union and the employer, places an imposing duty upon the union to file notices of arbitration without mistake. With such a weighty duty, lesser conduct than is required in other circumstances can constitute arbitrary conduct violating the duty of fair representation owed to the employee-union member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">\"Second, there is a severe loss to the employee where the union fails to observe a time limit such as the one in the present case. A terminated employee is prevented from pressing his grievance against the employer where the union has missed a time limit that must be complied with to invoke a stage of the mandatory grievance process. Thus, the employee is left with no recourse against the employer unless he can prove in court that the union violated its duty of fair representation. The severe loss to the employee of improper termination coupled with an inability to invoke a review of the employer\u2019s decision imposes a weighty burden on the union not to make mistakes in the handling of the employee\u2019s grievance. Again, lesser conduct can constitute arbitrary conduct and a breach of the duty of fair representation, because the duty of the union is great. If unions are allowed to escape breaches of the duty of fair representation by claiming that they only negligently missed time limits that precluded review of the employee\u2019s termination, employees will never be able to pursue their claims of improper termination. This is a loss to the employee that this Court cannot tolerate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">In conclusion, we hold that: (1) PERA impliedly imposes on labor organizations representing public sector employees a duty of fair representation; (2) bad-faith conduct is not always required to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>out a breach of that duty; (3) the conduct prohibited by the duty of fair representation includes (a) impulsive, irrational or unreasoned conduct, (b) inept conduct undertaken with little care or with indifference to the interests of those affected, (c) the failure to exercise discretion, and (d) extreme recklessness or gross negligence; (4) absent a reasoned, good-faith, nondiscriminatory decision not to process a grievance, the failure of a labor organization to comply with collectively bargained grievance procedure time limits constitutes a breach of the duty of fair representation; and (5) in this case, the union\u2019s inexplicable failure to comply with the grievance procedure time limits indicates inept conduct undertaken with little care or with indifference to the interests of plaintiffs, which could have reasonably been expected to foreclose plaintiffs from pursuing their grievance further. As a result, the union breached its duty of fair representation to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The judgments of the Court of Appeals and of the MERC are reversed, and this case is remanded to the MERC for a determination of the relief due plaintiffs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b888-6\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Ryan, and Brickley, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\"> Plaintiffs have also posed the issue \"whether the Michigan Employment Relations Commission can arbitrarily ignore evidence of unilateral change and refusal to bargain over changes in working conditions in violation of MCL 423.210(l)(e)[; MSA 17.455(10)(l)(e)]\u201d. However, that issue has not been preserved for appeal because plaintiffs did not raise it before the MERC, have made only a brief presentation which can hardly be classified as an argument, have not cited the record to support their factual assertions in regard to that argument, have not explained how the facts asserted amount to a breach of any legally cognizable duty, and have failed to cite any authority in support of their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">\"This is insufficient to present these questions for consideration in this forum.

Thus, this Court has stated that in construing our state labor statutes we look for guidance to \"the construction placed on the analogous provisions of the NLRA by the [National Labor Relations Board] and the Federal courts\u201d. <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 616, 636; 227 NW2d 736 (1975), <em>reh den </em>394 Mich 944 (1975), <em>app dis sub nom Crestwood Ed Ass\u2019n v Bd of Ed of School Dist of Crestwood, </em>427 US 901; 96 S Ct 3184; 49 L Ed 2d 1195 (1976).

The precise obligation owed to an individual member varies with the union activity involved. In contract negotiation, the union has a large measure of discretion to act for the common benefit of the entire membership. Less discretion is allowed in the administration of the contract; after the contract has been made, the duty of fair representation includes the responsibility of advancing and protecting the rights of individual members.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Where the union is the exclusive agent of the member in a grievance proceeding, a failure on the part of the union to process a grievance will generally bar the member from enforcing his rights under the collective-bargaining agreement. As an exclusive agent, the union owes a fiduciary duty to its members. As a fiduciary, the union is required to exercise reasonable care in the processing of a member\u2019s grievance. An unexplained failure to process a grievance indicates a failure to exercise reasonable care.
