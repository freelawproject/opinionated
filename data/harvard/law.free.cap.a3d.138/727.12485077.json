Because the RTKL specifically provides that the RTKL does not apply where access to the records is otherwise provided by law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 15, 2015, PFUR submitted a standard request form to the Department, pursuant to the RTKL and \"not ... under any other law,\" along with an affirmation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking voter registration and candidate information. (R.R. at 7a, 8a, 13a.) The request expressly stated that PFUR was not seeking the public information list, known as the full voter export. (R.R. at 11a.) PFUR sought four specific items in the Request,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, only the following three items remain at issue in this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) [Q]uery and extract the following information from the SURE system and send it to PFUR in manipulable electronic database medium: The full names and associated home or mailing addresses and full dates of birth of all Public Registered Voters in all counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who have a first name of \"Barbara\", \"David\", \"James\", \"Jennifer\", \"John\", \"Linda\", \"Lisa\", \"Mary\", \"Michael\", \"Robert\", \"Susan\", or \"William\" [(Requested Item 1)];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) [S]end the following information to PFUR in manipulable electronic database medium: The Philadelphia County Voter List [ (Requested Item 2) ];\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) [A] screen shot/screen print copy of the following identified citizens' voter registration information in the SURE system (i.e. name/address/date of birth/political party registration) [of]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ... Thomas W. Scott [ (Name, Home Address, and Date of Birth),] ... Wagdy V. Abdelshaheed [ (Name and Birth Year),] ... Korri J. Brown [ (Name and Birth Year), and] ... Richard E. Burridge [ (Name and Zip Code) (Requested Item 3) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (R.R. at 11a-12a (footnote omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to Section 902(b)(2) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.902(b)(2), the Department, via letter to PFUR, extended its deadline to respond by 30 days due to the extent and nature of PFUR's Request and indicated that it would include the estimated or actual fees in its subsequent response once the records became available. (R.R. at 21a-22a.) On July 22, 2015, the Department granted PFUR's request, provided that PFUR complete the Department's \"Request for Voter Lists from the Department of State\" form, which requires the requester to affirm that the records would not be used for purposes unrelated \"to elections, political activities and law enforcement,\" and obligates the requester to present the Department with proper identification and to pay the applicable fee of $20.00 before receiving the records, as mandated by the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations. (R.R. at 25a-28a.) Upon its receipt of the required information from PFUR, the Department stated that it would process the Request pursuant to Sections 306 and 3101.1 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.306, 67.3101.1, and provide a copy of the public information list, known as the full voter export, to PFUR. (R.R. at 25a-26a.) In its response, the Department informed PFUR that the full voter export contains \"all of the information sought in a fully manipulated electronic format wherein [PFUR] can perform [ ] simple quer [ies] for any ... information [it] seek[s].\" (R.R. at 26a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 28, 2015, PFUR appealed to the OOR challenging the Department's \"grant\" of access to the requested records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The OOR invited the parties to supplement the record and directed the Department to notify third parties of their ability to participate in the appeal. Neither party requested a hearing. In its appeal, PFUR argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that as a corporation, it could not produce the proof of identification required by the Voter Registration Act and objected to any third party notification. (R.R. at 37a-38a.) On August 6, 2015, the Department timely submitted a Brief in Opposition to Appeal and the affidavit of Jonathan Marks, Commissioner of the Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation. In response, PFUR submitted its Counter-Statement of the Issues. PFUR then sent its \"final brief\" to the Department, in which it argued, generally, that the Department acted arbitrarily in following the requirements for access set forth in the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations. (R.R. at 80a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his affidavit, Commissioner Marks attested that the full voter export, otherwise known as the public information list, which is available electronically, \"contains all of the information [requested by PFUR],\" and \"[t]he Department regularly makes this list available pursuant to the applicable election and voter registration laws and regulations.\" (R.R. at 67a.) Commissioner Marks described the purposes for which voter records are conditionally made available to the public and the unique nature of these records, and he acknowledged the General Assembly's enactment and the Department's promulgation of \"reasonable safeguards to ensure that [voter registration]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   information is not used improperly.\" (R.R. at 67a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The OOR issued its Final Determination denying in part and dismissing as moot in part PFUR's appeal with regard to the requested voter registration information and the Department's conditional grant of access to those records. (R.R. at 81a, 85a-87a.) The OOR determined that \"the Department [ ] established that it may withhold the responsive records [ (Requested Item 1 and 2) ] unless and until [PFUR] complies with the applicable provisions of the [Voter Registration] Act ... and the Department ['s] regulation[s.]\" (R.R. at 86a (citations omitted).) Relying on Commissioner Marks' affidavit, the OOR found that because Requested Item 3 was \"available through 'publicly accessible electronic means,' the Department [ ] met its obligations under the RTKL,\" and denied the appeal as to that item. (R.R. at 86a (citing Section 704(a) of the RTKL, 65 P.S \u00a7 67.704(a) ).) On September 9, 2015, PFUR petitioned for reconsideration of the OOR's Final Determination. The OOR did not act on the petition for reconsideration. This petition for review by PFUR followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, PFUR argues that the OOR erred in affirming the Department's decision and misinterpreted Section 3101.1 of the RTKL because no conflict exists between the RTKL and the Voter Registration Act. Since PFUR requested the items at issue under the RTKL and followed all of the RTKL's statutory requirements for obtaining those documents, PFUR contends that the Department \"may not dictate in an arbitrary or discriminatory fashion what law a requester may use to access public records\" or \"condition access to such records on compliance with a different statute,\" and \"the OOR cannot enforce stricter access provisions of another law or regulation.\" (PFUR's Br. at 22, 24, 26.) PFUR contends that the General Assembly did not intend the Voter Registration Act and corresponding regulations to be the exclusive means by which requesters may access that information, and therefore, the Department may not condition access to the requested voter registration information upon PFUR's compliance with the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   PFUR also argues that the OOR abused its discretion by determining that the Department granted access to the specific records requested by PFUR. Specifically, PFUR asserts that the Department did not grant access to the records requested because it \"attempt[ed] to narrow PFUR's request to records [ ] available only under the Voter Registration Act.\" (PFUR's Br. at 16.) PFUR maintains that under the RTKL, the Department must perform the query PFUR requested, provide\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   the specific records resulting from that query, and those results had to be in the medium requested by PFUR. (PFUR's Br. at 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, the Department argues that the RTKL, the Voter Registration Act, and the Department's regulations must be construed together. The Department argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that \"the method\n   of accessing the [requested voter registration] information are 'otherwise provided by law,' \" and that Section 1404 of the Voter Registration Act, 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404, and Section 183.14 of the Department's regulations, 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 183.14, govern that\n   <strong>\n    access.\n   </strong>\n   (Department's Br. at 12.) The Department contends that, pursuant to Sections 306, 701, 703, and 3101.1 of the RTKL, the RTKL \"specifically preserved the provisions of other laws and regulations that speak to the availability of agency records.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Department's Br. at 10-11.) Specifically, the Department maintains that where the RTKL conflicts with the access provisions of another state law, the state law supersedes the RTKL. (Department's Br. at 11, 14-15.) The Department also argues that it complied with the Request by agreeing to provide PFUR with access to the requested information in a manipulable electronic format, known as the full voter export, in accordance with the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations. Essentially, PFUR could receive the information it requested by completing the Department's form,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   showing identification, and paying $20.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This case involves the interpretation and interplay between the RTKL, the Voter Registration Act, and the Department's regulations. \"[W]hether the RTKL applies to PFUR's request [for access to voter registration information] in the first instance represents a purely legal issue which this Court is authorized to decide[,]\" and \"[i]n analyzing this matter, we are guided by the Statutory Construction Act of 1972.\"\n   <em>\n    McCord v.

The Act further provides, '[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.'\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908793,4365625\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/103/1276/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1921(b). Only where the operative statutory language is not explicit in conveying the intent of the General Assembly\n   should courts look beyond the General Assembly's words to ascertain its intent. In doing so, as it becomes necessary, the Act provides that courts may ascertain such intent by looking to several enumerated considerations, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   '[t]he mischief to be remedied[,]' '[t]he object to be attained[,]' and '[t]he consequences of a particular interpretation.'\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908793,4365625\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/103/1276/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1921(c).... Moreover, the Act explains that parts of statutes which are in\n   <em>\n    pari materia, i.e.,\n   </em>\n   statutory parts which relate to the same persons or things, are to be construed together wherever possible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908793,4365625\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/103/1276/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1932.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908793,4365625\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/103/1276/\">\n    103 A.3d at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Having set forth the above principles, we turn to the relevant RTKL provision. Section 3101.1 of the RTKL provides that \"[i]f the provisions of th [e RTKL] regarding\n   <strong>\n    access to records conflict\n   </strong>\n   with any other ... State law,\n   <strong>\n    the provisions of th[e RTKL] shall not apply.\n   </strong>\n   \" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.3101.1 (emphasis added). Thus, under the plain language of the RTKL, we look to the access provisions of the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations to determine whether the RTKL access provisions are in conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 1404 of the Voter Registration Act, 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404, governs public information lists, generally. That section establishes the information contained in public information lists, the authority of the Secretary to promulgate regulations pertaining to access to the list, as well as information about copying the list. 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404(a) -(c). Section 183.14 of the Department's Regulations, 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 183.14, also governs public information lists. That section includes more specific information about the list's contents, availability, inspection and copying, fees, and provides a timeline for processing requests, as well as certain reasonable safeguards, which must be followed before access to the list will be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   4 Pa.Code \u00a7 183.14(a)-(b) (establishing the information contained in the list, the time the list is available, and the contents of the Department's form), (h) (providing that access to the list may be disrupted occasionally), (i) (prescribing a timeline for processing requests and that \"the Department ... will distribute the public information list ... for a reasonable fee\"), (j) (permitting the Department to \"supply the ... list in a paper copy or in an electronic format\"), and (k) (providing that \"[t]he list may not be published on the Internet\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Voter Registration Act, the General Assembly established a comprehensive framework within which the Department is responsible for compiling, organizing, maintaining, and disseminating voter registration records. 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404 ; 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 183.14. These records\n   include names, addresses, birth dates, party registration, and voting history. It is the Department that has been entrusted with the custody, control, and protection of voter registration information, and the Secretary of the Department who has been delegated the authority to develop reasonable safeguards in the form of regulations governing the public's access to that information. 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404(a)(1). The affidavit of Commissioner Marks\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   states the purposes for which voter registration information is made available, including \"to assist candidates for public office in identifying constituents and carrying out campaign-related activities[, and to help p]olitical parties, candidates for public office, political campaigns, and special-interest groups use the information to identify constituents and carry out election-related activities.\" (R.R. at 67a.) He also explained that due to the \"unique nature of the records, the General Assembly and the Department, ... have imposed [ ] reasonable safeguards to ensure that the information is not used improperly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Commissioner Marks reiterated that those wishing to gain access to such information must abide by the reasonable safeguards set forth by the Department, as authorized by the General Assembly, including completing the Department's form, presenting proof of identification,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"stat[ing,] in writing [on a form prescribed by the Department] that any information obtained from the list will not be used for purposes unrelated to elections, political activities or law enforcement,\" and paying the reasonable $20.00 fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R.R. at 67a); 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404(b)(3), (c)(1)-(2) ; 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 183.14(a), (b)(1)-(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We conclude that the RTKL provisions conflict with the access provisions of the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations, and therefore, the RTKL's access provisions do not apply to PFUR's request for voter registration information. Moreover, the Department's regulations expressly establish the manner and medium in which the public information list may be made available for public\n   inspection and copying to those who request access to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1404(a)(1) (providing that \"[a] commission shall provide for computer inquiries concerning individual registered electors\"), (c)(1) (providing that \"[t]he commission ... may provide copies in some other form ...\"); 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 183.14(j) (providing that \"[t]he Department ... will supply the public information list in a paper copy\n   <strong>\n    or in an electronic format.\n   </strong>\n   \") (emphasis added). Commissioner Marks also attested to the fact that PFUR would be able to access all the information it sought from the full voter export, or public information list, a fact that PFUR acknowledged at oral argument. Therefore, we conclude that PFUR was granted access to the requested voter registration information in accordance with the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations, and in a manner and medium in which the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations explicitly allow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations comprehensively govern the accessibility of voter registration information in Pennsylvania, and the RTKL expressly provides that it will not apply under such circumstances. Therefore, the Department may respond to requests for voter registration information under the RTKL by requiring requesters to comply with the Voter Registration Act and the Department's regulations.

Section 102 of the RTKL defines \"[r]equester\" as \"[a] person that is a legal resident of the United States and requests a record pursuant to this act. The term includes an agency.\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.102. However, because of its corporate status and inability to produce photo identification, PFUR argues that it \"cannot comply with the [Department's] prescribed form\" to gain access to the requested records. (PFUR's Br. at 23-24.) We are unpersuaded by this argument and note that PFUR's president filled out an \"affirmation\" on behalf of PFUR when requesting the information under the RTKL.

We also note that PFUR agreed to pay up to $100 for the requested records. (R.R. at 23a-24a.) Therefore, we disagree that the $20.00 fee is unreasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    PFUR argues that under Section 704(b)(2) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.704(b)(2) (requiring agencies to provide printed copies of records to requesters \"unwilling or unable to access [ ] record[s] electronically\"), the Department must provide PFUR with printouts of the records requested.
