The plaintiff alleged that he was injured\n   when he fell off a retaining wall that was constructed as part of a municipal construction project for which the defendant was the design contractor. The court rendered summary judgment on the\n   ground that the defendant, as a design contractor, was not a user of the wall and, therefore, as a matter of law could not be liable in public nuisance. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in granting summary judgment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. By substitute complaint, filed on October 7, 2014, the plaintiff alleged that he was injured when he fell off a retaining wall that was constructed with no protective fencing by M. Rondano, Inc. (Rondano), as contractor for the town of Redding (town). The defendant had been hired by the town to design, engineer, inspect and supervise the \"Streetscape Project\" (project) of which the wall was a part. The complaint alleged in separate counts against the town, Rondano, and the defendant that the wall was constructed on public land and constituted a public nuisance. In its answer, the defendant denied, inter alia, that it was required to supervise the project, that it was responsible for site safety, and that it had control over the retaining wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 17, 2014, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that it could not, as a matter of law, be deemed to have been in control of the project and therefore could not be liable under a nuisance theory. In support of the motion, the defendant filed a memorandum of law outlining its legal claims, and attached an affidavit of Derek A. Kohl, a principal of the defendant; portions of an agreement between the defendant and the town;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a construction report;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   specifications for roads, bridges and incidental construction by the Department of Transportation (department) dated January, 2010; a letter dated July 5, 2011, from the defendant on behalf of the town to the department; a document entitled scope of services; and several Superior Court cases. Kohl's affidavit averred that the defendant was the architect for the project and was primarily responsible for architectural and engineering services and did not install, perform or put into motion any physical act upon the wall. He further averred that the defendant did not have the ability to control the contractor or the construction site, or to advise as to site safety; those responsibilities were allocated to the contractor during the construction until the responsibilities reverted to the town.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement specifies that the contractor will maintain the construction area throughout the duration of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment on September 26, 2014. He argued in the alternative that each defendant had control of the project, that design engineers can be liable in public nuisance for defective or dangerous construction that they create by their design, that the defendant had control over the project until it was completed in 2012, and that the project was not even substantially completed until October, 2011, after the plaintiff's fall. In support of these contentions, the plaintiff filed a certificate of compliance from the department dated October 25, 2011; a certificate of acceptance of work dated January 18, 2012; sections of the department's bridge design manual; the defendant's meeting minutes from June 16, 2011; further portions of the agreement between the town and the defendant; a\n   department consultant administration and project\n   development manual; an April 6, 2010 letter from the defendant regarding the status of the project; an excerpt from the deposition of Natalie Ketcham;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   a department project manual for the project with the defendant's copyright notification; a department construction manual; the defendant's meeting minutes dated October 4, 2011; the affidavit of Brandon Smith; the affidavit of Skylar Smith with attached photographs of the wall; and a document entitled \"Fielding deposition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant in a memorandum of decision on December 5, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

It noted that the plaintiff had failed to assert claims of professional negligence against the defendant.

The plaintiff subsequently appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We apply a well settled standard of review to the plaintiff's claim that the court improperly rendered summary judgment. \"Practice Book \u00a7 [17-49] requires that judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n   moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case.... The facts at issue are those alleged in the pleadings.... The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law.... The party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 [17-44 and 17-45]. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party....

The defendant responds that neither the issue of whether the defendant actually designed the wall nor whether the defendant's role in the design of the wall had ceased is material to\n   the question of whether the defendant had control of the wall for purposes of nuisance liability. It asserts that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the defendant controlled the wall, and, therefore, the court properly granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A nuisance ... describes an inherently dangerous condition that has a natural tendency to inflict injury upon persons or property....

Even if there is an issue of material fact as to whether the defendant designed the wall, and even if the defendant's role in the project had not ceased at the time of the plaintiff's injury, nothing presented by the plaintiff rebuts the statement by the defendant's affiant, supported by the evidence submitted by the defendant, that the defendant had no control over the physical property. Most notably, the agreement states that Rondano is responsible for site safety, maintenance, and operation during construction. Any input the defendant had into the design of the wall was mediated by either the town or Rondano. In\n   <em>\n    Tippetts,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court concluded that \"[t]he plaintiff's delegation of its authority over the bridge project was temporally as well as functionally limited.\"\n   <em>\n    Tippetts,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501438\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/177/\">\n    204 Conn. at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20A.2d%20688\">\n    527 A.2d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, we conclude that there was no evidence\n   of delegation to the defendant of authority over the wall, therefore the defendant was not a user of the property.\n   The plaintiff also asserts that the defendant's inspection duties amounted to control over the property. The agreement states that the defendant, referred to as the Consulting Engineer, is required \"[t]o furnish an inspection force at the level of and in the numbers established by negotiations for the construction engineering and inspection of this contract. The Resident Engineer/Chief Inspector shall work under the general supervision of the Municipality's Municipal Administrator. All orders to the Municipality's contractor on site will be transmitted by the Consulting Engineer's Resident Engineer/Chief Inspector.\" In the context of the agreement, this language does not indicate any independent control over the property; the defendant was under the supervision of the town and would relay orders from the town to Rondano. Although the defendant may have inspected the property, made recommendations, and relayed orders, there is no genuine issue of material fact that the defendant lacked control over the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, the trial court properly concluded there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the defendant had control over the property. Accordingly, the court properly granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Brandon Smith had brought a similar action, which the trial court consolidated with this action and in which the trial court granted summary judgment as to the defendant BL Companies, Inc., as well.

Landlord-tenant premises liability cases are distinguishable in that they are based on negligence, and the landlord, as owner of the property, has presumptive control over the property because the court's inquiry in these cases concerns whether the landlord has relinquished control over the specific area in which the injury occurred.

Some legal scholars have addressed the sometimes overlapping nature of nuisance and negligence liability: \"The source of the harmful invasion of plaintiff's interest will often involve conduct or a condition for which defendant will be liable under ordinary principles of tort law independent of nuisance. The commonest example is probably negligence. Defendant may create a nuisance by negligence as where one's manufacturing operations are so conducted as to cause an unnecessary and unreasonable amount of smoke or fumes.... [F]amiliar principles of tort law will account for liability without any special regard to the peculiarities of nuisance....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \"The above discussion should dispose of the question sometimes put of drawing a distinction between nuisance and negligence. There may be nuisances that do not involve negligence, and there may be negligence that does not produce a nuisance (though it causes other injury). But negligence is one way in which a nuisance may be caused, and where that is the case there is no distinction-the two coalesce.\" (Footnotes omitted.) 1 F.
