The PUC, in the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order at issue in this case, granted Rasier-PA, LLC's (Rasier) application at PUC Docket No. A-2014-2416127\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for authorization to provide experimental service pursuant to 52 Pa.Code \u00a7 29.352\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for passenger trips between points in Allegheny County (Allegheny Application). Executive argues that the PUC abused its discretion when it denied reconsideration because the PUC lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate Rasier's Allegheny Application since Rasier proposed to provide\n   transportation service as a carrier without having custody of any vehicles. Finding no error, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rasier filed its Allegheny Application on April 14, 2014. Executive, among other existing taxi cab companies that provide services in the areas proposed to be served by Rasier, filed a protest. Two PUC Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) held combined evidentiary hearings for the Allegheny Application and for Rasier's application for statewide authorization (Statewide Application). The ALJs issued a Recommended Decision on September 25, 2014 dismissing the Allegheny Application on the basis that Rasier failed to comply with PUC Orders requiring production of trip data and, thus, obstructed the hearings. (Recommended Decision at 9, R.R. at 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As provided by Section 335(a) of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 335(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the PUC exercised\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the Recommended Decision, and subsequently issued the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order substantially reversing the Recommended Decision. The PUC, in the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order authorized Rasier to provide service in Allegheny County subject to extensive compliance and operating conditions identical to those the PUC imposed in the companion December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order granting Rasier statewide authorization. The PUC would issue a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) allowing Rasier to operate as an experimental common carrier in Allegheny County if Rasier filed a Compliance Plan. Rasier filed its Compliance Plan on December 24, 2015, addressing the conditions set forth in Appendix A of the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order regarding driver integrity, vehicle safety, adequate\n   insurance, and other provisions. By Order entered January 29, 2015, the PUC approved the Compliance Plan (Compliance Order) and authorized Rasier to operate in accordance with the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order. Executive did not appeal the Compliance Order. Executive filed the Petition for Reconsideration on December 22, 2014, which Rasier timely answered. In addition to entering the Compliance Order on January 29, 2015, the PUC denied Executive's Petition for Reconsideration on that date. Executive subsequently filed this petition for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As noted above, Executive argues that the PUC abused its discretion when it denied reconsideration. Executive posits that the PUC lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Rasier's Allegheny Application in the first instance because Rasier proposed to provide transportation service as a carrier without having custody of any vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In greater detail, Executive argues that custody of vehicles used to provide service as a \"common carrier\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a sine qua non\n   of the Public Utility Code's regulatory scheme for motor carrier services. Executive contends that custody and control is the sole manner in which a CPC holder can ensure compliance with the safety requirements, and points out that \"Section 1501 of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   requires all public utilities to furnish and provide a certain quality of service and facilities and imposes affirmative duties upon them to maintain such quality.\" (Executive's Br. at 10.) According to Executive, absent custody or control, a CPC holder functions merely as a \"broker,\" someone who facilitates transportation services with no responsibility to comply with regulatory standards. Executive notes that the PUC \"does not hold brokers responsible for the vehicle standards of the services it brokers because it would be absurd to do so.\" (Executive's Br. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thus, the PUC's conclusion that it had jurisdiction over Rasier's Allegheny Application\n   and that vehicle ownership is not required for jurisdiction is, under Executive's interpretation, inconsistent with Section 1501 of the Public Utility Code and the PUC's position on brokers. For Executive, the critical factor is custody or control over a vehicle, not ownership. It argues that while a \"common carrier by motor [vehicle]\" is not required to own or operate a vehicle, such carrier has an \"obligation[ ] under the [Public Utility] Code to assume custody, control and supervision of each vehicle it operates under its [CPC.]\" (Executive's Br. at 12.) As such, Executive maintains that the PUC erred in assuming jurisdiction to grant the Allegheny Application because Rasier proposes to act as a \"broker,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   as defined at 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(b), and not a \"common carrier by motor vehicle\" within the meaning of the Public Utility Code. On that basis, Executive asserts, the PUC misapplied the law and abused its discretion when it approved Rasier's Allegheny Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The PUC argues that it denied Executive's Reconsideration Petition because it failed to meet the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Duick v. Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company,\n   </em>\n   56 Pa.P.U.C. 553, 559 (1982).\n   <em>\n    Duick\n   </em>\n   requires that a reconsideration petition identify \"new and novel arguments, not previously heard, or considerations which appear to have been overlooked or not addressed by the Commission,\" not \" 'a second motion to review and reconsider, to raise the same questions which were specifically considered and decided against them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania Public Service Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"983138\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/118/380/\">\n    118 Pa.Super. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=179%20A.%20850\">\n    179 A. 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854 (1935) ). The PUC contends that Executive, in its Reconsideration Petition, sought what\n   <em>\n    Duick\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Railroad Co.\n   </em>\n   expressly deny: a second review of questions definitively decided against Executive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before we address the parties' respective positions, a brief review of Rasier's proposed services is in order. In the companion case to this one, we also discussed Rasier's Transportation Network Company (TNC) service.\n   <em>\n    Capital City Cab Service, et al. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484833,6800343\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/119/\">\n    138 A.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201566722\">\n    2016 WL 1566722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2016) (\n   <em>\n    Capital City Cab\n   </em>\n   ). The PUC, in its brief, describes a TNC as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a fee-based motor carrier employing various modes of mobile digital computing to connect passengers with prequalified drivers of passenger vehicles. TNCs utilize electronic and social media forms of communication, including mobile applications and web-based reservation services, to facilitate these connections. The TNC business model generally does not seek to own vehicles or employ drivers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (The PUC's Br. at 4.) Rasier is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber). (Hr'g Tr., August 18, 2014 at\n   53, 60, S.R.R. at 5b, 12b.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Uber owns the smartphone application, digital platform, and technology (App) Rasier has licensed. Rasier uses the App to offer transportation to the public for compensation using non-certificated drivers operating their personal vehicles. (Hr'g Tr. at 57, 75, 77, 90, 101-02, 262-63, S.R.R. at 9b, 27b, 29b, 42b, 53b-54b, 180b-181b.) Potential customers create a user account with Uber and proffer an acceptable form of electronic payment. (Hr'g Tr. at 55-57, S.R.R. at 7b-9b.) A customer who requests a ride is paired by the App with the nearest driver available to accept passengers. The App notifies the rider who then views a map showing the driver's location, the driver's photograph, the vehicle type used by the driver, its license plate number, and an estimated time of arrival. (Hr'g Tr. at 58, S.R.R. at 10b.) Upon arrival, the driver provides a ride as directed. The App charges the customer electronically when the customer exits the driver's vehicle. (Hr'g Tr. at 56, S.R.R. at 8b.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Turning now to the parties' arguments and the record, we see that Executive raised the same arguments before both the ALJs and the PUC as in its Petition for Reconsideration and its appeal here. Indeed, Executive does not argue that the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order granting Rasier's Allegheny Application or the January 29, 2015 Opinion and Order denying reconsideration failed to address Executive's claims. Instead, Executive reiterates the arguments made below and does not explain why it is entitled to reconsideration under\n   <em>\n    Duick.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Executive argued before the ALJs that Rasier is not a common carrier because it did not propose to provide transportation service with its own vehicles in the Allegheny Application, and that Rasier really sought authority to act as a \"broker\" as defined at 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501. (Executive's Br. to the ALJs at 2-3, 11-13, R.R. at 80-81, 89-91). In the alternative, Executive argued before the ALJs that Rasier could not be a \"broker\" within the meaning of that term because Rasier's Allegheny Application did not propose to use certificated carriers to provide service. (Executive's Brief to the ALJs at 3, 14-15, R.R. at 81, 92-93). These are the same arguments made to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our review of the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order shows that the PUC cited to those sections of Executive's brief when the PUC rejected the argument that Rasier was required under the Code to own vehicles in order to be a motor carrier. (December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order at 29-31.) The PUC, in the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order, concluded that the definitions for transportation public utilities stood for the contrary, i.e., that the PUC has jurisdiction over transportation services offered to the public for compensation independent of vehicle ownership or custody. The PUC in the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order further concluded that Rasier's service fell within its jurisdiction because Rasier utilized Uber software and back office functions to unquestionably offer and operate an \"on demand\" motor carrier passenger service to the public for compensation. (December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order also addressed Executive's alternative argument regarding \"broker\" service and uncertificated carriers. The PUC concluded that Rasier will not use certificated motor carriers and, thus, cannot be a \"broker\" under the Public Utility Code, and also concluded that\n   52 Pa.Code \u00a7 29.352 allows flexibility to authorize on a trial basis new motor carrier service that is not an exact definitional fit in order to determine if such service is beneficial to the public. (December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order at 21.) On that basis, the PUC determined that it was appropriate to consider Rasier's TNC service as a common carrier under the experimental service regulation because Rasier is not a broker and because Rasier proposes to provide transportation service to the public for compensation. (December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Executive's Petition for Reconsideration, it asserts the same argument regarding Rasier acting, not as a motor carrier, but rather as a broker without using certificated motor carriers. (Petition for Reconsideration at 5-7, R.R. at 232-34). The PUC in the January 29, 2015 Order denying Reconsideration declined to reconsider whether Rasier was a broker absent any new basis for doing so. (January 29, 2015 Order at 21.) After further review, we conclude that the PUC did not err or abuse its discretion when it denied Executive's Petition for Reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    J.A.M. Cab Company, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission,\n   </em>\n   132 Pa.Cmwlth. 390,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1401234\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/132/390/#p1318\">\n    572 A.2d 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1318 (1990) ;\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Railroad Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=179%20A.%20850\">\n    179 A. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   854 ;\n   <em>\n    Duick,\n   </em>\n   56 Pa.P.U.C. at 559.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As noted above, Executive seeks review only of the PUC's denial of its Petition for Reconsideration. Thus, we are not called upon to review the merits of the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order granting Rasier's Allegheny Application. As such, we will not address here whether that decision is in accordance with law or supported by substantial evidence. However, we note that we performed that analysis in\n   <em>\n    Capital City Cab,\n   </em>\n   wherein we addressed the merits of the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order granting Rasier's Statewide Application and affirmed the PUC's determination.\n   <em>\n    Capital City Cab,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484833,6800343\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/119/\">\n    138 A.3d at 128-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record in that matter was made in conjunction with the PUC's consideration of the Allegheny Application, and many of the same participants made the same arguments and relied on the same witnesses and evidence. We would, thus, have concluded that the PUC, likewise, did not err here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For these reasons, the January 29, 2015 Opinion and Order denying Executive's Petition for Reconsideration is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   President Judge PELLEGRINI concurs in result only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   NOW, this 22nd day of April, 2016, the January 29, 2015 Opinion and Order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission denying Executive Transportation Co., Inc.'s Petition for Reconsideration is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Contemporaneously with this Opinion, we address at consolidated Docket Nos. 238 and 240 the PUC's separate December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order granting Rasier statewide authorization to provide experimental service pursuant to 52 Pa.Code \u00a7 29.352 at PUC Docket No. A-2014-2424608 (Statewide Application). Also consolidated with those matters is No. 253 C.D. 2015, which is Executive's appeal of the PUC's January 29, 2015 Opinion and Order denying reconsideration of the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order at PUC Docket No. A-2014-2424608.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The PUC's regulation at 52 Pa.Code \u00a7 29.352 governs certification for the provision of experimental service, and provides as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    In order to advance and promote the public necessity, safety and convenience, the Commission may, upon application, grant a new certificate or an amendment to an existing certificate in order to allow to be provided a new, innovative or experimental type or class of common carrier service.

(Executive's Br. at 1.) As such, the merits of the December 5, 2014 Opinion and Order are not directly before us. As we note subsequently here, Executive challenged the PUC's jurisdiction to consider Rasier's Application before the ALJs, again before the PUC on\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review, and again in its Petition for Reconsideration. However, the PUC's jurisdiction is not implicated directly by our review of the denial of reconsideration as we look simply to whether the issues raised on reconsideration were considered previously during the review of Rasier's Application. The same posture was presented at No. 253 C.D. 2015. There, we nonetheless addressed Executive's argument that the PUC lacks authority even to consider Rasier's Application as it provides important guidance with regard to the experimental service provisions at 52 Pa.Code \u00a7 29.352, and the PUC fully addressed the issue in its brief. We, thus, were able to conduct effective appellate review of this question notwithstanding Executive's limiting its appeal to the denial of reconsideration. Moreover, it is black letter law that issues concerning an agency's jurisdiction are never waived and can be raised\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    by the court.\n    <em>\n     Blackwell v.
