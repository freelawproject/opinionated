On appeal, the defendant claims (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and (2) that the court violated his rights to a fair trial and to confrontation when it permitted the guardian ad litem to sit near the victim while the victim testified. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court was presented with the following evidence during the defendant's criminal trial. The victim was born in 1996. In 2005, the victim's mother met and began dating the defendant. In 2006, the victim's mother moved into the defendant's home along with the victim and the victim's younger brother. In 2007, the victim's mother married the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Initially, the victim got along well with the defendant, but, after they moved into the defendant's home, the defendant began touching the victim inappropriately. The defendant would rub her thighs or slap her buttocks, and, when the victim would protest,\n   he would offer her money and tell her not to say anything to anyone. The victim began to notice that, although she went to bed with clothing on, when she awoke in the morning, she often was not wearing any clothing. She soon realized that the defendant was entering her bedroom in the early hours of the morning, after her mother had left the home to deliver newspapers after 1 a.m.\n   Around this time, the defendant's sexual assaults escalated. He engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with the victim on several occasions, causing the victim to experience pain, and to bleed on one occasion. During these assaults, the defendant removed his pants but kept on his shirt. He also told the victim to be quiet, and he threatened to throw her family out of his home if she told anyone about his assaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some point during the 2006-2007 school year, the victim moved into the home of her father, while her mother and her younger brother remained in the home of the defendant. The defendant occasionally would pick up the victim to bring her to his home to see her mother. During these rides, he would inappropriately touch the victim on her thighs and buttocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, the victim disclosed this abuse to her boyfriend, who encouraged her to tell someone. On April 7, 2012, the victim disclosed the abuse to her father, who immediately took her to the police station to file a report. The defendant later was arrested and charged with one count of sexual assault in the first degree and two counts of risk of injury to a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant elected to be tried by the court. Following the trial, the court found the victim to be credible, specifically stating: \"[T]he court ... heard the testimony of the complainant ... [who] was on the stand for almost ... a full ... a complete day of testimony. She testified ... consistently throughout the course of the day. She never wavered in her allegations with regard to what happened. She handled cross-examination and various questions that came at her, again, without changing her story or her consistency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court also found that the victim \"specifically [had] alleged that there was sexual intercourse by way of vaginal intercourse [that] took place. That there was penetration in that the defendant penetrated by way of\n   his penis her vagina, that there was vaginal intercourse beyond just the touching as part of the risk of injury counts with regard to sexual intercourse [and the court] want[ed] to make it clear that that evidence was absolutely on the record and that [the] court credit[ed] her account of the vaginal intercourse as she [had] described it repeatedly throughout the course of her day of testimony.\" The court, thereafter, convicted the defendant on all counts. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because there was no physical evidence introduced during the trial, and, therefore, the only evidence to support the charges was the testimony of the victim, who was inconsistent and unreliable. He contends that \"[w]here, as in this case, the witness' testimony is so discrepant, the court's determination of credibility was clearly erroneous.\" The state responds: \"Because the defendant's sufficiency of the evidence claim hinges entirely on his challenge to the express, unassailable credibility determination on the part of the fact finder, his claim must fail.\" We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"When reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we do not attempt to weigh the credibility of the evidence offered at trial, nor do we purport to substitute our judgment for that of the [fact finder]. Instead,\n   our review consists of a two-step process in which we construe the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict ... and then determine whether the [fact finder] could reasonably have found, [on the basis of] the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, the defendant's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant next claims that by allowing the guardian ad litem to sit closer\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the victim while the victim testified, the court violated the defendant's right to a fair trial and his right to confrontation under both the federal constitution and the state constitution, and demonstrated personal bias. With respect to his due process right to a fair trial claim, the defendant argues that the trial court was not impartial. Specifically, he claims that by permitting this special accommodation, without requiring the state to demonstrate a compelling need for it, \"the complainant has been accorded the status of a 'child victim' by the trial court,\" despite the fact the she was nearly eighteen years old when she testified and did not fall within the chronological purview of General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claims that the court validated the victim's \"alleged victimization\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   and thereby \"eviscerated [the defendant's] presumption of innocence.\" The defendant further argues that the court's \"consideration of [the complainant] as a 'victim' necessarily means that the trial court believed a crime to have been committed, and that the defendant was thereby guilty.... [The court's] decision [is] devoid of any evidence of compelling need and [is] representative only of the court's predetermination of the defendant's guilt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to his right to confrontation claim, which the defendant included in his appellate brief as part of his due process claim, the defendant contends that the court permitted the guardian ad litem to act as a \"buffer to shield [the victim] from cross-examination,\" thereby interfering with his right to confrontation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the defendant is not claiming that he was unable to have a face-to-face confrontation with the\n   victim-which he clearly had-we are at a loss to discern in what way the guardian ad litem acted as a \"buffer to shield\" the victim in violation of his right to confrontation, and the defendant does not explain this in his brief. As such, although he states that he also is making a claim under the confrontation\n   clause, we review this claim under the same rubric as we review his due process claim, namely, that the alleged constitutional error here is that the court permitted this accommodation without requiring the state to show a compelling need for the accommodation, demonstrating the trial court's bias and predetermination of the defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant contends that our standard of review for his constitutional claims is one of \"inherent prejudice\" and that he need not prove actual harm. The state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the guardian ad litem to sit near the victim while the victim testified. It also argues: \"Here, the defendant's claim that the trial court was partial and incapable of divorcing [the victim's] need for an accommodation from a determination that she was credible is not only unreasonable, but it fails to find any support in the record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant. During direct examination, the prosecutor asked the victim to explain what the defendant would do to her after he removed her clothing. The victim broke down emotionally and stated that the defendant \"first ... would begin by touching\" her. The prosecutor responded: \"That's okay, if it's hard, just, you know, try to breathe, take your time, okay....\" The victim then said she was sorry. The prosecutor asked for a moment, and the victim was given water and tissues. The court then took a short recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the recess, at the request of the prosecutor and over the objection of the defendant, the court permitted\n   the guardian ad litem to sit closer to the victim. Specifically, the court ruled that the guardian ad litem could sit closer to the victim \"for whatever moral support that brings. But, obviously, no communication and no kind of eye direction to testify in one way or the other, okay, the testimony has to be just from this particular witness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After thoroughly considering the defendant's brief and his reply brief, along with his oral argument before this court, it appears that the essence of the defendant's claim boils down to one of judicial bias, but in the form of an alleged structural error in which harm is inherent and need not be demonstrated. Essentially, the defendant argues that, because the trial court permitted the guardian ad litem to sit near the victim as an accommodation for the victim, without requiring the state to show a compelling need for the accommodation, the court demonstrated that it had predetermined that the complainant was a victim before the completion of evidence. This, he contends, forced him to endure a trial by a judge who was not impartial and who did not presume his innocence. As a result, he contends, he suffered inherent prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the\n   defendant's claim is without merit, as he has failed to demonstrate any lack of impartiality on the part of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A claim of judicial bias is a very serious matter. \"Accusations of judicial bias or misconduct implicate the basic concepts of a fair trial.... It is a well settled general rule [however] that courts will not review a claim of judicial bias on appeal unless that claim was properly presented to the trial court via a motion for disqualification or a motion for mistrial.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court also ensured that the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the victim. Thus, when it permitted the guardian ad litem to sit nearer to the victim while the victim testified, overruling the objection of the defendant, the court merely was attempting to make a minor witness more comfortable as she resumed her testimony after having broken down emotionally during her testimony before the recess. There is no indication in this record that\n   the court predetermined the defendant's guilt or that the court in any way was not an impartial adjudicator. Accordingly, the record disclosed no judicial bias and, therefore, no structural error based on judicial bias. Ultimately, \"[t]he fact that a trial court rules adversely to a [defendant], even if some of these rulings were to be determined on appeal to have been erroneous, does not demonstrate personal bias.\"\n   <em>\n    Bieluch v.

Thus, this is not a case in which the defendant's right to face-to-face confrontation has been infringed or a case in which the court, as the fact finder, did not have an adequate opportunity to assess the credibility of the witness.

Furthermore, following the recess, the defendant had an opportunity to continue his cross-examination of the victim.

The parties, on February 20, 2014, stipulated to a reconstruction of that portion of the transcript, which was comprised of the notes of the court reporter and the recollection of counsel. Although the defendant quotes some of the relevant portions of that transcript in his brief, he has not included it in his appendix. The state has provided in its appendix, the portion of the reconstructed transcript that contains the request for a recess by the guardian ad litem.

Indeed, a claim of judicial bias that constitutes structural error normally involves some extrinsic factor, not occurring in the courtroom, that would implicate a defendant's due process rights, such as bias based on a direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest. See\n    <em>\n     Tumey v. Ohio,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n     273 U.S. 510\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 521-23,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n     47 S.Ct. 437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p521\">\n     71 L.Ed. 749\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1927) (violation of due process where court invalidated and found inherently prejudicial procedure wherein mayor of village, who was responsible for assessing fines against defendants convicted of violating state's prohibition act, received costs, in addition to regular salary, as compensation for hearing such cases, but no costs were paid to mayor unless defendant was convicted);\n    <em>\n     State v.

Rather, he claims that the procedure the court allowed reflected its bias. At common law, claims concerning a judge's personal bias or prejudice would not form a sufficient basis for imposing a constitutional requirement under the due process clause, however, and, thus, such personal bias or prejudice could not amount to structural error.

Additionally, the defendant did not file a motion for new trial or for a mistrial on the basis of judicial bias. The defendant failed to raise any claim before the trial court that the judge's action in permitting the guardian ad litem to sit in closer proximity to the victim during the victim's testimony in any way infringed on his right to confrontation or to a fair trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
