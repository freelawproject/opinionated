Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.) (\"LE\") \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 to 9-1201, a \" covered employee\" is entitled to compensation from his or her employer for an accidental personal injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LE \u00a7 9-501(a)(1) (\"Except as otherwise provided, each employer\n   of a covered employee shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to[ ] the covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee [.]\" (Paragraph break omitted)). Pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-227(b), for purposes of workers' compensation, \"[a] sole proprietor may elect to be a covered employee if the proprietor devotes full time to the business of the proprietorship.\" In other words, under certain circumstances, a sole proprietor may elect to be a \"covered employee\" for purposes of workers' compensation. Under the Act, the amount of\n   compensation that is due to a \"covered employee\" who \"has a permanent total disability resulting from an accidental personal injury\" is based on the covered employee's \"average weekly wage\" (\"AWW\"). LE \u00a7 9-637(a) (1). Specifically, the amount of compensation that is due to the covered employee in such a circumstance is two-thirds of the covered employee's AWW, provided that the AWW does not exceed the State's AWW or equal less than $25.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case involves a matter of first impression in Maryland-namely, how to calculate the AWW of a sole proprietor who has elected coverage under the Act. Specifically, we must decide whether the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act should be calculated based on the sole proprietorship's gross receipts or gross income (without deducting business expenses)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or net profit (the gross receipts less business expenses). We hold that the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act is to be calculated based on the sole proprietorship's net profit, not on the sole proprietorship's gross receipts or gross income. The sole proprietorship's net profit is the best approximation of the earnings that a sole proprietor actually takes home because net profit does not include the sole proprietorship's business costs and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Patrick Long (\"Long\"), Petitioner, is the self-employed sole proprietor and owner of Long's Floor Works (\"the Employer\"). Before 2011, Long elected to obtain workers' compensation coverage as a covered employee. In 2011, Long was working as a subcontractor for Ryan Floors, Incorporated. Ryan Floors, Incorporated paid the Employer based on the number of hours that Long worked. In July 2011, Long injured his back while installing carpet during the course of his employment. Long's injury required surgery, and, according\n   to Long's counsel, Long is likely \"going to be disabled for life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Almost six months later, on January 23, 2012, Long filed with the Workers' Compensation Commission (\"the Commission\") a \"Notice of Employee's Claim,\" seeking workers' compensation benefits. On July 16, 2012, the Commission conducted a hearing on Long's claim. On July 19, 2012, the Commission issued an \"Award of Compensation,\" finding that: (1) Long \"sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment\"; (2) Long's disability was the result of the work-related accidental injury; (3) Long was temporarily totally disabled from August 20, 2011 to September 20, 2011, and from November 1, 2011 \"to the present and continuing\"; (4) Long was temporarily partially disabled from September 21, 2011 to October 31, 2011; (5) the authorization for medical treatment as recommended by Long's doctor was allowed; (6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   the insurer, the Injured Workers' Insurance Fund (\"IWIF\"), Respondent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Employer would pay causally-related medical expenses as stipulated by the Commission's Medical Fee Guide; and (7) Long's AWW was $1,500, \"subject to verification.\" Accordingly, based on its findings, the Commission ordered that IWIF and the Employer compensate Long for temporary total disability for his past and continuing temporary total disability at a rate of $940 per week, and that IWIF and the Employer pay the causally-related medical expenses. The Commission also ordered IWIF and the Employer to compensate Long for his temporary partial disability at a rate of 50% of the difference\n   between Long's AWW \"and his wage[-]earning capacity in the same employment or otherwise if less than before the accident, but not to exceed fifty per centum of the State [AWW] for the period\" September 21, 2011 to October 31, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 28, 2012, Long filed with the Commission a \"Request for Document Correction,\" asking that two \"errors\" in the Commission's Award of Compensation be corrected. Specifically, Long asked that the Commission amend the date of the accidental injury from July 24, 2011 to July 31, 2011, as he had \"amended the date of the accident at the hearing[.]\" Long also stated that the Commission's calculation of his AWW was incorrect, and asked that the Commission amend the AWW from $1,500 to $1,737.11 in accordance with a \"Wage Statement\" that he attached to the Request for Document Correction. The attached Wage Statement demonstrated that Long had calculated his AWW to be $1,737.11 by adding his \"gross wages\" from the fourteen weeks preceding the injury, and dividing the total by fourteen. Long also attached a statement from Ryan Floors, Incorporated showing the Employer's gross receipts throughout 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 7, 2012, the Commission issued an amended Award of Compensation, amending in its findings the date of the accidental injury from July 24, 2011 to July 31, 2011, and changing Long's AWW from $1,500 to $1,737.11. The Commission made no changes to any other aspects of the Award of Compensation. In other words, IWIF and the Employer were still required to compensate Long for temporary total disability at the rate of $940 per week and to compensate Long for temporary partial disability at a rate of 50% of the difference between Long's AWW \"and his wage[-]earning capacity in the same employment or otherwise if less than before the accident, but not to exceed fifty per centum of the State [AWW] for the period\" September 21, 2011 to October 31, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 16, 2012, IWIF filed with the Commission a motion for rehearing on the AWW amount, stating that Long's AWW should be $225.90, not $1,737.11. Almost one year later, on August 12, 2013, the Commission conducted a rehearing\n   on the amount of Long's AWW. During the rehearing, IWIF alleged that Long's \"gross wages\" in 2011 were between $11,000 and\n   $12,000. IWIF based its figures on Schedule C of Long's 2010 federal income tax return,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which showed a net profit of $11,747, and IWIF's premium audit report for the Employer from May 2010 through May 2011, which showed Long's \"gross wages\" as $11,077.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   IWIF argued that Long's AWW should be based on the Employer's net profit, which is the money that Long received after subtracting his business expenses from his gross receipts. IWIF's counsel noted that dividing the net profit of $11,747 by fifty-two, the number of weeks in a year, would yield an AWW of $225.90. Long responded that a calculation of his AWW had to be based on the Employer's gross receipts, not net profit, because gross receipts are the equivalent of gross wages for a sole proprietor. Indeed, Long argued that nothing under Maryland law supported calculating a sole proprietor's AWW based on net profit. Long further asserted that IWIF based its insurance premiums on the Employer's gross receipts, not on the Employer's net profit. IWIF replied that a self-employed individual's net profit essentially constitutes wages, as the net profit is the amount that the individual takes home after business expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the rehearing, various documents were submitted to the Commission. Schedule C of Long's 2010 federal income tax return showed the Employer's gross receipts as $38,748 and the Employer's net profit as $11,747. Long's 2011 federal individual income tax return (Form 1040), including Schedule C and Schedule SE (Self-Employment Tax), were also submitted. Long's 2011 federal individual income tax return stated that he received no wages. Line 12 of Long's 2011 federal individual income tax return, however, listed his business\n   income as $16,879, the figure that was identified in Schedule C and Schedule SE as the Employer's net profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also in Schedule C of Long's 2011 federal income tax return, the Employer's gross receipts are shown as $44,606, and the total business expenses are shown as $27,727. Thus, the Employer's net profit was $16,879, which is the gross receipts of $44,606 less the business expenses of $27,727.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also submitted was correspondence from IWIF to Long concerning the Employer's insurance premiums. For the policy that was effective from May 15, 2008 through May 15, 2009, one document showed an estimated premium of $2,196 based on an audited payroll of $36,900. Additionally, in response to a Premium Audit Report for the policy that was effective from May 15, 2010 through May 15, 2011, in a pre-printed form dated May 23, 2011-only two months before the accidental injury-Long stated that there was zero employee payroll and that his \"gross wages\" were $11,077.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another document\n   from IWIF dated March 16, 2012 showed that the premium for May 15, 2011 through May 15, 2012 was $2,416, and that the estimated renewal premium for May 15, 2012 through May 15, 2013 was $2,905, subject to an audit. And, in a letter dated May 15, 2012, as to the policy that was effective from May 15, 2011 through May 15, 2012, IWIF stated that the premium for the \"policy was based on your estimated payroll\" and that \"[t]he information provided on this Premium Audit Report will determine the proper premium based on the actual payroll.\"\n   On August 13, 2013, the Commission issued an order finding that Long's AWW was $496.44. The Commission explained its reasoning as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Long] submitted his 2011 [federal individual] tax return. This document is the best evidence of the correct [AWW].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Long] earned a total of $16,879.00 in 2011. Previous Orders of the Commission reveal that [Long] only worked from 1/1/11 to 8/19/11 and was out of work for the remainder of the year[,] with the exception of a brief period when he worked part-time from 9/21/11 to 10/31/11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The period from 1/1/11 to 8/19/11 is 34 weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, the correct [AWW] is $496.44[,] which was calculated by taking the full earnings for the year ($16,879.00) and dividing that figure by 34 weeks. The Commission recognizes that this number is slightly higher than the actual [AWW] because[,] to be precisely accurate[,] the amount earned while working from 9/21/11 to 10/31/11 should be deducted from the 2011 earnings before dividing by 34, but the Commission does not have that post-injury wage information available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 23, 2013, Long filed with the Commission a Request for Rehearing and a Motion for Rehearing as to the Commission's finding that his AWW was $496.44. In the motion, Long contended that the Commission erred in calculating his AWW based on his net profit because IWIF allegedly charged him an insurance premium \"based upon his gross revenues or gross earnings and not his net profit[ ].\" (Underlining omitted). In other words, Long argued that his AWW should be calculated based on his gross receipts because that is the figure that IWIF supposedly used to determine his insurance premiums. According to Long, if IWIF could calculate his AWW based on his net profit, IWIF would receive a \"windfall profit\" because IWIF \"would be allowed to have collected premiums that bore no risk of loss.\" On September 4, 2013, the Commission denied the Request for Rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 12, 2013, Long filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\"the\n   circuit court\"). On October 2, 2013, IWIF filed a response to the petition for judicial review. Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Long attached to his motion for summary judgment a signed affidavit, in which he averred that an IWIF representative had told him that his insurance premium for the policy year beginning on May 15, 2012 \"would be based upon [his] gross profit[ ] of $48,000.00.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 12, 2014, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment. During the hearing,\n   Long's counsel contended that Long's AWW should be calculated based on the Employer's gross income in the weeks preceding the accidental injury because that \"is how normal employees' [AWW]s are computed.\" Long's counsel argued, alternatively, that Long's AWW should be calculated based on the Employer's gross income because, before the accidental injury, IWIF allegedly based insurance premiums on the Employer's gross receipts. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court orally granted IWIF's motion for summary judgment, thereby affirming the Commission's decision, and denied Long's motion for summary judgment. On the same day, the circuit court issued orders to the same effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 28, 2014, Long filed a notice of appeal. In a reported opinion dated September 30, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court's judgment granting IWIF's motion for summary judgment and affirming the Commission's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Long v.

Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals held that a sole proprietor's \"gross wages\" and \"gross income\" are not synonymous, and that, under the circumstances of the case, \"the Commission did not err in concluding that AWW should be based on Long's net profit[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360808\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/48/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360808\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/48/#p72\">\n    at 57, 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360808\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/48/#p72\">\n    123 A.3d at 568, 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court of Special Appeals further rejected Long's alternative argument that, if insurance premiums are based on a sole proprietorship's gross income, then AWW must also be calculated on that basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360808\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/48/#p72\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360808\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/48/#p72\">\n    at 66-67, 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20573\">\n    123 A.3d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576-77. As to that argument, the Court of Special Appeals stated: \"Adoption of such a rule in a case like the one at bar would result in a sole proprietor being able to recover an AWW far greater than the amount of money he or she was out-of-pocket as a result of not being able to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20573\">\n    123 A.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Long thereafter filed a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari,\n   </em>\n   which this Court granted on January 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Long v.

Long argues that Code of Maryland Regulation (\"COMAR\") 14.09.03.06 unambiguously requires that the AWW be calculated using gross wages, without regard to whether an individual is a regular employee who works for a separate employer or a self-employed sole proprietor. Long asserts that case law establishes a relationship between the premiums that are charged\n   by a workers' compensation insurer and the benefits that are paid to an injured\n   insured, and that, as a result of that relationship, the AWW is to be based on the amount that is utilized by an insurer to calculate premiums. According to Long, the Commission disregarded this relationship when it calculated his AWW based on net profit instead of \" gross receipts/payroll.\" In other words, Long maintains that the AWW must be calculated on the same basis as insurance premiums are calculated-here, gross payroll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Long further contends that, to the extent that the term \"gross wages\" in the context of a sole proprietor is ambiguous, such ambiguity must be construed in his favor to mean \"gross payroll.\" Long argues that he will not receive a windfall if his AWW is calculated based on his gross receipts because he paid insurance premiums based on his gross payroll. Long asserts that cases from other jurisdictions are largely distinguishable from this case, and maintains that certain other jurisdictions have rejected the use of net profit to calculate the AWW. Alternatively, Long contends that this Court should remand the case to the Commission for a hearing to determine a different computation method for AWW, \"such as what figure [ ] Long would have to pay a general manager to do the work he did[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IWIF\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   responds that the Commission was correct in calculating Long's AWW by dividing the Employer's net profit-not gross receipts-by the number of weeks that Long had worked in the year that he was injured. IWIF contends that the Commission is permitted to deviate from the AWW calculation method set forth under the Act and in COMAR 14.09.03.06, and argues that the Commission was correct in deviating in this case because, as a sole proprietor, Long did not receive wages from the Employer. IWIF asserts that other jurisdictions have taken the position that the best method of calculating a sole proprietor's AWW is through using net profit or net taxable income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IWIF maintains that an employer's gross receipts are not analogous to an employee's gross wages because gross receipts include business expenses and do not reflect the money that is actually available to the sole proprietor. According to IWIF, Long's 2011 federal individual tax return-specifically Schedule C and the Employer's net profit-provides the best evidence from which to calculate Long's AWW. IWIF contends that, unlike gross receipts, net profit represents the money that the sole proprietor earned and that is available to the sole proprietor after business expenses are taken into account. As to a relationship between the AWW and insurance premiums, IWIF contends that no Maryland court has held that insurance premiums dictate AWW and argues that using insurance premium estimates to calculate the AWW would be speculative. As a final matter, IWIF asserts that using the Employer's gross receipts to calculate Long's AWW would result in a \"windfall benefit\" that is far beyond what Long actually earns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hranicka v.

The Commission's decision \"is presumed to be prima facie correct[.]\" LE \u00a7 9-745(b)(1). That presumption, however, does not extend to questions of law, which we review independently.

Accordingly, we determine whether the agency's conclusions are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.

And, once the AWW is calculated, LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(1) instructs the employer or the insurer to \"pay the covered employee compensation that equals two-thirds of the [AWW] of the covered employee [.]\" For the ordinary employee, the operation of these provisions poses no issue. A sole proprietor, however, is self-employed and not an \"employee\" in the traditional sense. Indeed, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-227(a), \"a sole proprietor is not a covered employee\" unless he or she makes an election in accordance with LE \u00a7 9-227(b) and submits written notice of that election to the Commission and the insurer in accordance with LE \u00a7 9-227(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as the Supreme Court of Arizona has recognized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   In reality, sole proprietors are not employees and do not earn wages. A sole proprietor can never be an employee of the business he or she creates because a sole proprietor and the business are one legal entity. A person cannot be one's own employee.

The premiums paid or set aside to constitute the fund are thus ascertained. The actual earnings are taken as determining the risk in loss of earnings or capacity. This correspondence would have to be disregarded to accept the present claimant's contention. The insurance premiums and the fund built up for compensation would lose their relation to the compensation to be paid. Employers distributing work on the share-the-work plan would multiply the responsibility for compensation\n   without any increase in work done.

For example, if both a sole proprietor and his employee are injured on the first day of business, the employee could receive permanent disability benefits but the sole proprietor could not. And what of the sole proprietor who earns a profit one year and not the next?

COMAR 14.09.03.06A directs the Commission to determine a covered employee's AWW \"from gross wages, including overtime [.]\" Significantly, neither the Act nor COMAR defines\n   the term \"gross wages,\" and neither specifies whether, in the case of a sole proprietor, \"gross wages\" refers to the sole proprietorship's gross receipts, net profit, or some other figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   We disagree with Long that the term \"gross wages\" is synonymous with \"gross receipts\" or \"gross income.\" Under the Act, for purposes of calculating AWW, \"wages shall include: (i) tips; and (ii) the reasonable value of housing, lodging, meals, rent, and other similar advantages that the covered employee received from the employer.\" LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(2) (paragraph breaks omitted). And, Black's Law Dictionary defines \"wage\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   [p]ayment for labor or services, usu[ally] based on time worked or quantity produced; specif[ically], compensation of an employee based on time worked or output of production. Wages include every form of remuneration payable for a given period to an individual for personal services, including salaries, commissions, vacation pay, bonuses, and the reasonable value of board, lodging, payments in kind, tips, and any similar advantage received from the employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Wage, Black's Law Dictionary 1811 (10th ed. 2014). In other words, the plain meaning of the term \"wages\" is compensation or payment in almost any form for an individual's labor or services. And, as understood in everyday parlance, \"wages\" are earned by an individual after performing work;\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   individuals, not business entities, earn wages. Moreover, under the plain language of the Act and COMAR, it is evident that \"gross wages\" and \"wages\" refer to an individual's earnings. Indeed, under COMAR 14.09.03.06A, AWW is calculated \"from gross wages, including overtime[.]\" Common sense dictates that only an individual, and not a business entity, can earn overtime. Similarly, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(2)(ii), \"wages shall include: ... the reasonable value of housing, lodging, meals, rent, and other similar advantages\n   <strong>\n    that the covered employee received from the employer.\n   </strong>\n   \" (Emphasis added). Stated otherwise, from the plain language of the Act and COMAR 14.09.03.06, as well as the plain and commonsense meaning of the terms, we conclude that \"gross wages\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   and \"wages,\" in the context of calculating AWW, refer to an individual's earnings, and not a business entity's earnings, even if that business entity is a sole proprietorship. Indeed, the relevant provisions of the Act and COMAR 14.09.03.06 specifically reference the \"covered employee\" or \"claimant,\" not a covered employee's or claimant's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   By contrast, \"gross income\" or \"gross receipts\" more broadly encompass a business entity's earnings. For example, Black's Law Dictionary defines \"gross receipts\" as \"[t]he total amount of money or other consideration received by a business taxpayer for goods sold or services performed in a taxable year, before deductions.\" Gross Receipts, Black's Law Dictionary 819 (10th ed. 2014). Similarly, \"gross income\" is defined as \"[t]otal income from all sources before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions.\" Gross Income, Black's Law Dictionary 881 (10th ed. 2014). Thus, \"gross income\" and \"gross receipts\" are broader terms that may include not only an individual's earnings, but also a business entity's earnings. It does not follow, however, that \"gross wages\" is synonymous with \"gross income\" and \"gross receipts,\" especially in light of the circumstance that \"gross wages\" is a narrower term that is aimed at capturing an individual's earnings, and does not refer to anything that is related to a business entity's earnings, as, unlike an individual, a business entity cannot earn overtime or have lodging or meals in the ordinary sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Further still, \"gross income\" and \"gross receipts\" are distinct from \"net profit.\" As just mentioned, \"gross income\" and \"gross receipts\" are figures that do not take into account any deductions. Thus, a business entity's \"gross income\" or \"gross receipts\" includes the business's costs and expenses. By contrast, \"net profit\" is \"[t]otal sales revenue less the cost of the goods sold and all additional expenses.\" Net Profit, Black's Law Dictionary 1404 (10th ed. 2014). As demonstrated by Long's 2011 Schedule C, in this case, the Employer's net profit was calculated by subtracting the total business expenses from the Employer's gross income. Thus, net profit does not include a business's\n   costs and expenses that often\n   have little or nothing to do with an employee, such as advertising, depreciation, vehicle rentals, supplies, and utilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Significantly, in this case, as a self-employed sole proprietor, Long did not earn \"wages,\" and instead claimed only business income on his 2011 federal individual income tax return. Similarly, the 2011 Schedule C did not include any business expense for \"wages.\" Having not earned wages, and thus lacking any gross wages, the standard AWW calculation that is contemplated by the Act and COMAR 14.09.03.06 simply cannot be used in Long's case. It is undisputed that Long did not earn wages from the Employer. Moreover, as a sole proprietor, Long would not have received vacation wages or been involuntarily laid off by the Employer, as set forth in COMAR 14.09.03.06B. Accordingly, in this situation, where a self-employed sole proprietor seeks workers' compensation benefits, the Commission is not bound by an initial award calculation; instead, the Commission \"can determine an accurate [AWW] at the first hearing\" based on evidence that is presented by the parties.

Our holding is consistent with a number of cases from other jurisdictions that have determined that a self-employed individual's AWW is to be calculated based on net profit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vite,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7122883\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/377/453/\">\n    377 S.W.3d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Commission's decision to deduct the business expenses [the sole proprietor] claimed from his gross receipts, as set forth in his 2007 federal tax return, constituted a determination of\n   [AWW] that was 'just and fair to all parties,' as allowed by [statute].\");\n   <em>\n    Carnahan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%201122\">\n    821 A.2d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Because the driver had \"produced no evidence, other than his tax returns, that would suggest an alternate method of calculating his income, [the Court] agree [d] that the board was correct to use his net profit ... as his 'gross earnings.' \");\n   <em>\n    Stephen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"514446\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/324/334/\">\n    478 S.E.2d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]ubstantial evidence in the record [ ] support[ed] a finding that [the subcontractor]'s [AWW] and compensation rate should be based upon his net earnings, [the subcontractor]'s gross earnings having included wages paid to other employees and various business deductions.\");\n   <em>\n    Meredith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2311890\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/21/537/\">\n    466 S.E.2d at 109-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The Court affirmed the calculation of a self-employed sole proprietor's AWW based on net taxable income that was reported by the sole proprietorship, and stated that, \"[w]hen the earnings of an injured employee are not amenable to the primary calculation specified in [the statute], the commission properly resorts to such other method of computing [AWW] most nearly approximating the amount which the injured employee earns.\" (Citations, brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In this case, Long determined his self-employment tax liability for the 2011 tax year by using the Employer's net profit of $16,879; and, on his 2011 federal income tax return, Long claimed income consisting of the Employer's net profit of $16,879 and a taxable refund or credit of $369. In other words, by his own admission, Long's\n   take-home earnings in the year of his injury were $16,879, not the Employer's gross income of $44,606. Using the Employer's net profit-which Long himself identified as his income and used for purposes of determining his self-employment tax liability-as the basis for the calculation of Long's AWW is reasonable and logical under the circumstances of this case. As the Supreme Court of New Hampshire explained in\n   <em>\n    Carnahan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%201122\">\n    821 A.2d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , equating \"gross earnings\" (or, in this case, \"gross wages\") with \"gross income\" would lead to an absurd result in the case of a self-employed individual:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   An independent contractor with a gross income of $200,000 who incurs $150,000 in business expenses would have \"gross\n   earnings\" of $200,000.

Indeed, in this case, to hold otherwise-that Long's AWW should be based on the Employer's gross receipts-would lead to a slippery slope and result in the problem that we so carefully sought to avoid in\n   <em>\n    Stevenson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2257538\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/171/572/#p575\">\n    171 Md. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20A.%20910\">\n    189 A. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   913 -namely, that \"[c]onceivably[,] work[ers who are] injured might be entitled to receive much more by reason of their injuries than they could possibly earn at work.\" Ultimately, using a sole proprietorship's net profit instead of its gross income or gross receipts avoids the pitfall of a possible windfall to the sole proprietor whereby the sole proprietor would receive more compensation by being injured than by working. Additionally, we observe that the Act's purpose is to \"protect[ ] employees, employers, and the public alike\" by \"provid[ing] employees suffering from work-related accidental injuries, regardless of fault, with a certain, efficient, and dignified form of compensation[, and i]n exchange, employees abandon common law remedies, thereby relieving employers from the vagaries of tort\n   liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Polomski v.

However, as evidenced by LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(1), compensation to a covered employee for permanent total disability for an accidental personal injury is to equal two-thirds of the AWW, not the full AWW. In other words, as demonstrated by the two-thirds formula, although the purpose of workers' compensation is to protect an employee and provide the employee with compensation, such compensation is not intended to exceed, or even match, what the employee earns on a weekly basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   We are unpersuaded by Long's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"623615\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/172/144/\">\n    322 S.E.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the contention that his AWW should be based on the Employer's gross receipts. In\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 348, the Board calculated the independent contractor's AWW based on his \"full-time wage[,]\" awarding compensation at a rate of $135 per week based on the independent contractor's gross receipts without deducting \"production costs.\" The Court of Appeals of Georgia affirmed the award and rejected the employer's contention that there was a difference between the terms \"fees\" and \"wages\" for purposes of the workers' compensation act, simply stating: \"[I]t is not mandated by definition or otherwise that one make any deductions before calculating the [independent contractor]'s wages, particularly in view of the fact that [the employer] deducted the workers' compensation premiums from his gross, rather than net, receipts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349. Significantly,\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   had an uncomplicated fact pattern involving a very low amount of compensation, and the opinion consists of only four paragraphs. Indeed, the sole issue in the case was whether the independent contractor's \"production costs\" should have been deducted from his wages before calculating his AWW.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 348. Interestingly, at no point did the Court identify the amount of the independent contractor's wages or production costs. And the Court's sole rationale for affirming the Board's award appears to be that the employer paid insurance premiums that were based on the independent contractor's gross receipts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 349. In this case, however, Long seeks to have numerous costs and expenses included in\n   the calculation of his AWW-costs and expenses totaling $27,727, as reflected in the 2011 Schedule C, which comprises approximately 62% of the Employer's gross income of $44,606. Under these circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   provides little guidance or support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Instead, we conclude that the reasoning of the Court of Appeals of South Carolina in\n   <em>\n    Stephen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"514446\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/324/334/\">\n    478 S.E.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is more persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Stephen, id.\n   </em>\n   at 81, the Court affirmed the calculation of the subcontractor's AWW and compensation rate based on his net earnings, not his gross earnings, because the subcontractor's gross earnings included wages that were paid to other employees and various other business expenses that were deducted from the subcontractor's taxable income. The Court thoroughly explained the problems that arise in using gross receipts for determining AWW, namely, that gross receipts include \"[a] plethora of business expenses [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80. The Court rejected the subcontractor's contention that his AWW should be based on his gross receipts because that was the figure that was used by the construction company for insurance premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81. Specifically, the Court held that \"reimbursements received by [the subcontractor could ]not be the basis for a computation of his 'earnings [,]' \" because the statutory language of \"earnings of the injured employee\" meant \"the actual sum paid to the employee as his wages, not the totality of payments including reimbursements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In our view, this approach is the correct one because it relies on a self-employed individual's pre-injury net profit, as reported on his or her taxes, and avoids a windfall to the self-employed individual that can result if business expenses are not deducted and not factored into the calculation of AWW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   That other jurisdictions have used figures other than a self-employed individual's net profit in calculating AWW is of no consequence because those cases are distinguishable in that either the self-employed individual had no net profit, or the self-employed individual presented an appropriate alternative income basis on which to base AWW.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mail Boxes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466313\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/181/119/\">\n    888 P.2d at 778, 780-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Because the sole proprietor had\n   earned no wages in the year that he was injured and was not paid\n   wages, under the provisions of the Arizona Workers' Compensation Act, the Court held that \"[t]he best way to measure the lost earning capacity of a sole proprietor is by the market value of the services performed.\");\n   <em>\n    McAnelly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=460%20S.E.2d%20894\">\n    460 S.E.2d at 895, 898-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Although the sole proprietorship did not have any net profit the year preceding the sole proprietor's injury, because the sole proprietor was paid wages, as shown on the sole proprietorship's payroll record, those wages should have been the basis for calculating the sole proprietor's AWW.);\n   <em>\n    Thompson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"396573\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/12/449/\">\n    748 P.2d at 437-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Because the sole proprietor's widow had presented evidence that checks that were drawn on the sole proprietorship's account and recorded as \"owner withdrawals\" were used by the sole proprietor for personal expenses, and because no other evidence of income was presented, the Court concluded that the sole proprietor's AWW was properly calculated based on the amount of the \"owner withdrawals\" in the twenty-six weeks preceding the accident.). Simply stated, these cases are distinguishable from the instant case, where the Employer had a net profit the year in which Long was injured, and the evidence presented as to Long's wages included Long's tax returns and Schedule C, and did not include some other measure such as \"owner withdrawals.\" Significantly, none of the courts in\n   <em>\n    Mail Boxes, McAnelly\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   stated that it would be inappropriate to use a self-employed individual's net profit as the basis for calculating AWW in other circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   We also reject Long's contention that his AWW should have been based on the Employer's gross receipts because IWIF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   based insurance premiums on the Employer's gross receipts, and we are unpersuaded that\n   <em>\n    Picanardi, Stevenson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Crowner\n   </em>\n   compel the result that Long seeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained above, a sole proprietorship's\n   gross receipts include business costs and expenses that should not be included in a calculation of AWW because such costs and expenses have little to do with the sole proprietor's labor and services and do not reflect what the sole proprietor takes home in actual wages.

In any event, as we explained above, adopting the position that a sole proprietor's AWW should be based on a sole proprietorship's gross receipts because insurance premiums are based on gross receipts would result in an injured sole proprietor's being able to recover an AWW that is greater\n   than the sole proprietor's AWW when he or she is working. In other words, the sole proprietor would receive a windfall by virtue of being injured. We decline to adopt such a general rule that would, in effect, permit a sole proprietor to receive a windfall for being injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Our workers' compensation jurisprudence and our liberal construction of the Act do not compel a different result.

We also noted, however, that in liberally construing the Act, \"we seek to avoid an interpretation which would lead to an untenable or illogical outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270362\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/467/#p473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270362\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/467/#p473\">\n    at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270362\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/467/#p473\">\n    784 A.2d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Here, in our view, there is no ambiguity-a sole proprietor's \"gross wages\" are the sole proprietorship's net profit, not gross receipts. To hold otherwise would produce the illogical and unreasonable outcome that would create a windfall for sole proprietors, who would be entitled to far greater workers' compensation benefits than employees who do the same work for the same earnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In sum, we hold that the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act is to be calculated based on the sole proprietorship's net profit, not on the sole proprietorship's gross income. In this case, the Commission was correct in calculating Long's AWW based on the Employer's net profit in 2011, the year in which Long sustained his injury. The 2011 Schedule C identified a net profit of $16,879, which was the sole proprietorship's gross income of $44,606 less total expenses of $27,727. The net profit was the amount that Long identified on his 2011 federal individual income tax return as business income, and was the amount that Long\n   identified as net profit for purposes of self-employment tax liability. The Commission determined that, in 2011, Long worked from January 1, 2011 to August 19, 2011, a period of thirty-four weeks. Accordingly, Long's AWW was calculated by dividing the net profit of $16,879 by thirty-four, arriving at an AWW of $496.44. The evidence in the record supports this figure, and the calculation was correctly based on the Employer's net profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

For example, as discussed above, a case may arise in which a sole proprietor operated at a loss prior to sustaining an accidental personal injury.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mail Boxes,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466313\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/181/119/\">\n     888 P.2d at 780-81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Under such a circumstance, where the sole proprietorship has a zero or negative net profit, the sole proprietor may present evidence of something other than net profit as an appropriate basis for calculating his or her AWW. However, because that is not the circumstance before this Court in this case and because the Commission was presented only with using either net profit or gross receipts in calculating Long's AWW-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    Long did not propose some other alternative to net profit other than gross receipts-we leave that question for another day. The Commission should, however, be cautious in departing from the use of net profit in calculating a sole proprietor's AWW.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    As an initial matter, as did the Court of Special Appeals, we note that the record in this case does not definitively demonstrate that IWIF based insurance premiums on the Employer's gross receipts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Long,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360808\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/48/#p72\">\n     225 Md.App. at 66-67\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20573\">\n     123 A.3d at 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"We will assume, for purposes of this appeal, that [Long] is correct in regard to the basis for the premium in 2011, although the matter is not free from doubt.\" (Footnote omitted)). For example, in response to a Premium Audit Report for the policy that was effective from May 15, 2010 through May 15, 2011, in a pre-printed form dated May 23, 2011-only two months before Long's accident-Long stated that employee payroll was zero and that his \"gross wages\" were $11,077. At the February 12, 2014 hearing before the circuit court, Long's counsel claimed that Long \"simply wrote the wrong number down.\" What effect, if any, the audit had on IWIF's calculations of Long's premiums is unknown. And, before this Court, IWIF disputes that it set premiums based on Long's actual gross wages/payroll.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    As a final point, we note that, at oral argument, Long's counsel apparently abandoned the position that Long's AWW should be $1,737.11, as the Commission had originally amended the award to state after Long's request. Instead, Long's counsel contended that the AWW should have been $1,311.94, which is the Employer's gross receipts of $44,606 divided by thirty-four (the number of weeks that Long worked in 2011). This figure greatly exceeds the $496.44 that the Commission calculated Long's AWW to be based on the Employer's net profit. In our view, the significant gap between the AWW of $486.44 and $1,311.94 demonstrates in a very plain way why using net profit to calculate a sole proprietor's AWW is desirable-Long would receive a windfall by having his AWW based on the Employer's gross receipts because he would receive compensation at a much higher weekly rate than what he was actually taking home while working.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
