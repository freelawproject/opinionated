DHS investigated and, on September 2, 2003, issued DPW Child Protective Service Investigation Report form (CY-48) for the girls reflecting that physical abuse was indicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Record (C.R.)

He does not deny that the founded reports are based upon the exact crimes for which he was convicted, but rather claims that his criminal convictions were based on perjury and falsified records obtained by corrupt DHS and state officials. J.C. claims that his founded reports should be expunged from the ChildLine Registry because he was innocent of the criminal charges underlying the convictions upon which the reports were based. He also argues that he \"is not Collateral[ly] estop[ped] from [this Court] hearing this case because there is a[n] actual case and controversy that exists at both stages Judicial and Administrative which both investigations [were] done together.\" J.C.
