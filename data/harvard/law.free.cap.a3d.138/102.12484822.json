Common pleas found that the Commonwealth met its burden of proof under the Forfeiture Act and that Falette did not establish that he was \"the owner of the currency, that the currency was lawfully obtained and that he does not possess the currency for illegal purposes.\" (Order, May 15, 2014.) On appeal to this Court, Falette argues that common pleas erred in concluding that the Commonwealth established the required nexus between the seized cash and unlawful activity necessary under the Forfeiture Act and in admitting certain opinion testimony without proper foundation. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 7, 2009, Pennsylvania State Police (State Police) Trooper Derek Felsman (Trooper Felsman) was patrolling Interstate 80 (I-80) in Monroe County when, at 6:00 p.m., he initiated a traffic stop of a black Lincoln Town Car for Traveling Too Closely to Another Vehicle, i.e., tailgating. Trooper Felsman explained that he observed four individuals in the vehicle, including the driver, Juan Lugo. Lugo produced a valid New Jersey driver's license and registration card, which revealed that Lugo's sister owned the vehicle. Sitting next to Lugo was his brother and there were two other passengers in the back seat. Subsequently, Trooper Felsman searched the vehicle and discovered four ecstasy pills in the cigarette outlet in the center console area of the vehicle and four small plastic bags containing marijuana \"in the right rear passenger door, underneath the cigarette ashtray.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 16, 18, R.R. at 33a, 35a.) Lugo admitted that the drugs were his. Trooper Felsman continued his search and found $34,440.00 in cash hidden under the seatbelt attachment in the \"B pillar\" on the passenger side of the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lugo and the other passengers denied ownership of the cash or knowing that it was there. The State Police confiscated the cash and drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trooper Felsman gave Lugo a warning for tailgating and charged him with possession of a controlled substance for personal use (the ecstasy tablets); possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use; and possession of drug paraphernalia (the plastic bags that contained the marijuana). Lugo pleaded guilty in December 2009 to the marijuana possession charge, the remaining charges were\n   <em>\n    nolle prossed,\n   </em>\n   and he was sentenced to 15 to 30 days in prison and a fine of $105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Commonwealth filed the Petition on November 24, 2009, seeking to forfeit the $34,440.00 found in the vehicle. Falette, who was not present during the August 7 traffic stop, filed an answer (Answer) asserting ownership of the cash, and that the cash had no relationship to illegal activity, but was derived from the settlement of a personal injury lawsuit. Attached to the Answer were two checks from a law firm made out to Falette with the notation \"Settlement Proceeds to Client.\" or \"Settlement Funds.\" (Answer, Exs. 1-2.) One check, dated June 17, 2009, was for $14,496.22, and the second, dated July 16, 2009, was for $23,303.33. (Answer, Exs. 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Common pleas held a hearing on the Petition on April 17, 2014, at which the both the Commonwealth and Falette presented\n   evidence. The Commonwealth offered Trooper Felsman's testimony. Trooper Felsman explained that, upon effectuating the traffic stop, he observed four individuals in the vehicle: Lugo, Lugo's brother, and two others in the back seat. Lugo indicated that his sister, who owned the car, let him and others use her vehicle. On that day, he was taking a friend, one of the back seat passengers, somewhere in Pennsylvania. Lugo stated that he did not know exactly where they were traveling, but that the friend was giving him directions to their destination. After collecting the occupants' identification, Trooper Felsman ran a search on the State Police database, which revealed that Lugo and his brother had been charged with assault, burglary, and credit card fraud. The back seat passengers had no criminal charges or convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Trooper Felsman then asked Lugo for permission to search the vehicle because: he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana; there were air fresheners in the vehicle; he suspected that the passengers in the back seat were pretending to be sleeping; and the portion of I-80 where he had stopped Lugo was \"a heavily travelled drug corridor.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 9-10, R.R. at 26a-27a.) Falette objected to Trooper Felsman's testimony regarding I-80 as lacking foundation, which was overruled. Trooper Felsman stated that Lugo consented to the search. Trooper Felsman found four ecstasy pills in the cigarette outlet in the center console area of the vehicle and four small plastic bags containing marijuana \"in the right rear passenger door, underneath the cigarette ashtray.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 16, 18, R.R. at 33a, 35a.) Lugo admitted the drugs were his, and Trooper Felsman charged Lugo with possession of drugs for his own personal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the search, Trooper Felsman noticed that a screw was missing from the B Pillar on the vehicle's passenger side and, shining his flashlight in that area, he saw black plastic bags behind the plastic. He decided to investigate further, and, as he was removing the plastic housing from the seatbelt attachment, which \"took a while,\" he observed Lugo giving him a \"long blank\" or \"thousand yard stare.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 15, R.R. at 32a.) Trooper Felsman explained that watching the behavior of individuals during a traffic stop is important because that behavior can be an indicator of illegal activity. Trooper Felsman found two black plastic bags, each of which contained cash. The bags were transferred to the State Police barracks, counted, and found to total \"$34,440 in numerous denominations of hundred dollar, fifty dollar and twenty dollar bills.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 15-16, R.R. at 32a-33a.) None of the vehicle's occupants claimed the money and \"denied knowing [that it] was there, [ ] whose money it was, how it got there, or how much it was.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 16-17, R.R. at 33a-34a.) Falette's name was never mentioned during or after the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Falette testified that he was a long-time friend of Lugo and Lugo's sister, and they all lived in Passaic, New Jersey. Falette claimed that the $34,440.00 found in the vehicle was his and part of the settlement proceeds he received in a personal injury lawsuit from a 2006 automobile accident. The case settled shortly before the August 2009 traffic stop, and he received two settlement checks from his lawyers for a total of $37,799.55. Cross-examination elicited the following testimony. Falette explained that after he deposited the checks in the bank he decided that he wanted to have cash on hand to impress people. Although Falette indicated that he took the cash out of the bank little by little over a period of months, Falette acknowledged that he deposited those checks on July 16, 2009, just a couple of weeks before the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   He said he spent a considerable amount of the proceeds, and then \"stashed\" the remaining $34,440.00 inside the B Pillar of the vehicle, which he regularly borrowed. (Hr'g Tr. at 28, R.R. at 45a.) Falette indicated that he did not tell anyone about his stash of cash, and did not know that Lugo was \"going to use the car, you know, somehow, so fast.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 23-24, R.R. at 40a-41a.) He acknowledged that his decision to use someone else's vehicle as a savings bank was \"stupid,\" and he attributed his bad decision to being young and foolish. (Hr'g Tr. at 24, R.R. at 41a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After hearing argument, common pleas took the matter under advisement. On May 15, 2014, common pleas found that the Commonwealth established a \"nexus between the seized currency and unlawful activity\" and granted the Petition. (Order, May 15, 2014, at 1.) The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Pursuant to the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Burke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20542\">\n    49 A.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2012), the Commonwealth has sufficiently established a nexus between the seized currency and unlawful activity based on the following factors: (1) presence of drugs in close proximity to the currency at the time of the stop which creates a rebuttable presumption that it is related to drug trafficking,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   (2) inconsistent statements made by the vehicle occupants' [sic] as well as their unusual behavior at the time of the stop, including the back passengers who were pretending to be asleep during the stop; [sic] (3) the drivers' [sic] drug-related conviction as a result of the stop, (4) the placement of the currency in the B Pillar of the car, an area which was not intended for use by the manufacturer, (5) the packaging of the money in two plastic bags, and (6) the fact that the car was registered to a third party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Furthermore, the Court finds that the claimant, Raphael [sic] Falette, failed to establish himself as the owner of the currency, that the currency was lawfully obtained and that he does not possess the currency for illegal purposes. Falette testified that the money was proceeds from a civil lawsuit settlement and that he placed it in the B Pillar to show it off to his friends and for easy access to the money. We find this explanation to be both illogical and devoid of any credibility. The money was neither easily accessible nor was it openly stored for showing it off to his friends. Instead, it was in an area of another person's vehicle which was not intended for use by the manufacturer. Therefore, the placement of the money is not consistent with [Falette's] explanation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Order, May 15, 2014.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Falette appealed, and common pleas directed him to file a Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(b). Falette did so, challenging common pleas' conclusion that the Commonwealth met its burden of proving a nexus between the cash and unlawful activity and admission of Trooper Felsman's testimony regarding I-80 being a \"drug corridor.\" (1925(b) Statement, Falette's Amended Br. at 28.) In its 1925(a) opinion, common pleas stated that it had adequately addressed the issues raised in Falette's 1925(b) Statement in its May 15, 2014 Order. Common pleas further concluded\n   that, while it believed that the Commonwealth had laid the proper foundation for Trooper Felsman's I-80 \"drug corridor\" testimony, if it had erred, any error was harmless because that testimony \"played no part in [the] adjudication of this matter.\" (1925(a) Op. at 1.) Falette now appeals to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Falette first argues that common pleas erred in concluding that the Commonwealth met its burden of proving a substantial nexus between the $34,440.00 and unlawful drug activity by a preponderance of the evidence. Falette contends that common pleas could not rely on the rebuttable presumption that money found in close proximity to controlled substances is derived from selling such substances because common pleas did not find that the drugs and cash were found in close proximity to each other. He maintains that, even if the presumption applies, it was rebutted by the lack of evidence that normally is present for establishing a substantial nexus between cash and illegal drug activity. Absent from this record, according to Falette, is evidence such as: traces of drugs on the money; a canine sniff of the money; that the money was bundled in a manner consistent with drug dealing; histories of drug crimes for the vehicle's occupants; or paraphernalia related to drug sales. He further points to the small amount of drugs found in the car that were for Lugo's personal use and not for sale. At most, Falette asserts, the Commonwealth established a suspicion that there was a nexus between the cash and illegal drug trafficking, which is insufficient to warrant forfeiture pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Fontanez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"837197\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/559/92/\">\n    559 Pa. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562546,837197\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/152/\">\n    739 A.2d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999),\n   <em>\n    Burke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20542\">\n    49 A.3d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. $15,000.00 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7276639\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/31/768/\">\n    31 A.3d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2011). Finally, Falette contends that, even if the Commonwealth met its burden, his unrebutted testimony established that he was an innocent owner pursuant Section 6802(j) of the Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6802(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that it met its burden via the rebuttable presumption provision found at Section 6801(a)(6)(ii) of the Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(ii), and that Falette had to come forward with contrary evidence or face inevitable defeat.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. $259.00 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146159\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/860/228/#p231\">\n    860 A.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004). According to the Commonwealth, the cash was in close proximity to both the ecstasy pills recovered from the vehicle's front console and the marijuana stored in the rear passenger door. Having met its burden, the burden then shifted to Falette to establish that he is an innocent owner under the Forfeiture Act, which the Commonwealth asserts he did not because common pleas found Falette's explanation \"completely implausible.\" (Commonwealth's Br. at 17 (quoting Hr'g Tr. at 34-35, R.R. at 51a-52a).) Therefore, the Commonwealth maintains, common\n   pleas' Order granting the Petition must be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Forfeiture Act authorizes the forfeiture of money that is \"furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance in violation of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act[\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Drug Act) ], and all proceeds traceable to such exchange.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(i)(A). Money that is \"used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of [the Drug Act]\" is also subject to forfeiture. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(i)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a forfeiture proceeding involving money, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a substantial nexus between the money being forfeited and a violation of the Drug Act.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. $2,523.48 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"475521\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/538/551/\">\n    538 Pa. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"475521,7872763\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/649/658/\">\n    649 A.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660 (1994). Under Section 6801(a)(6)(ii) of the Forfeiture Act, \"money and negotiable instruments found in close proximity to controlled substances possessed in violation of [the Drug Act]\n   <em>\n    shall be rebuttably presumed to be proceeds derived from the selling of a controlled substance in violation of [the Drug Act].\n   </em>\n   \" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(ii) (emphasis added). When the rebuttable presumption is triggered, \"the Commonwealth satisfie[s] its evidentiary burden by using the presumption.\"\n   <em>\n    $259.00 Cash U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146159\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/860/228/#p231\">\n    860 A.2d at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once the Commonwealth establishes that the money is forfeitable, the burden shifts to the person claiming the money to establish that he owns the money, he lawfully acquired it, and the money was not unlawfully used by him, i.e., that he is an \"innocent owner\" of the money. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6802(j) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    $2,523.48 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"475521,7872763\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/649/658/\">\n    649 A.2d at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In general, our Courts have held that cash found within arm's length of controlled substances is in sufficiently close proximity to trigger the rebuttable presumption.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. $6,425.00 Seized from Esquilin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"687717\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/583/544/\">\n    583 Pa. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936770,687717\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/523/\">\n    880 A.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532 (2005).

(Hr'g Tr. at 14-15, R.R. at 31a-32a.) Specifically, the bags containing the cash were found underneath the plastic molding where the front passenger seatbelt bolts into the frame of the vehicle. (Hr'g Tr. at 14-15, R.R. at 31a-32a.) It is also undisputed that four tablets of ecstasy were found inside of the cigarette outlet in the center console area of the vehicle and four small plastic bags containing marijuana were found \"in the right rear passenger door, underneath the cigarette ashtray.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 16, 18, R.R. at 33a, 35a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    Esquilin,\n   </em>\n   the cash and drugs found in the vehicle were within sufficiently close proximity of each other to trigger the rebuttable presumption set forth in Section 6801(a)(6)(ii) of the Forfeiture Act. Here, both the marijuana and cash were located on the passenger side of the vehicle. Moreover, the cash, found in the area of the vehicle where the front passenger seatbelt is attached to the frame of the vehicle, was located across the passenger front seat from the ecstasy located in the center console.

It is common knowledge that the area of the vehicle where the seatbelt is attached to the frame is within arm's length of both the right rear passenger door as well as the center console area of the vehicle. Because the cash was found within arm's length of both the ecstasy tablets and the marijuana, under\n   <em>\n    Esquilin\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the drugs and cash were in close proximity to each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That Lugo was only charged with possession of a small amount of ecstasy and marijuana for personal use, rather than possession with intent to sell, is not relevant. Similarly irrelevant is the lack of evidence regarding how the $34,440.00 was bundled, that a drug dog alerted on the cash, or that placing the cash in the B pillar is a known means for drug dealers to hide their proceeds. Although such facts might have been relevant had the Section 6801(a)(6)(ii) presumption not been triggered, which would have required the Commonwealth to rely on\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   factors to meet its initial burden of proof, that is not the case here. Section 6801(a)(6)(ii) does not require, for the presumption to arise, someone be charged or convicted with possession with intent to sell, a particular quantity of controlled substances, a particular storage locale for the cash or controlled substances, or a particular manner for the money to be bundled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   All that it\n   requires is that the \"money [be] ... found in close proximity to controlled substances possessed in violation of [the Drug Act].\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the cases Falette relies upon,\n   <em>\n    Fontanez, Burke\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    $15,000.00 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   did not involve situations where the money was found in close proximity to any controlled substances; indeed, no drugs were found in those cases.\n   <em>\n    Fontanez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562546,837197\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/152/\">\n    739 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   153-54 ;\n   <em>\n    Burke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20542\">\n    49 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   544 ;\n   <em>\n    $\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    15,000.00 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7276639\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/31/768/\">\n    31 A.3d at 770-71, 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In so doing, the Commonwealth met its burden of proving a substantial nexus between the cash and unlawful activities under the Drug Act. Falette did not rebut that presumption with credited evidence.

Forfeiture Petition, \u00b6 7, I. In his verified answer, Lugo confirmed that he was not \"the owner of the currency seized from his vehicle on August 7, 2009\" or that it was ever \"in [his] possession.\" Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6. Lugo denied that he was tailgating when stopped. Answer, \u00b6 7, a. Finally, Lugo denied knowledge of the cash; that it was going to be used to purchase drugs; or that it was the \"fruits of such an exchange.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In his verified answer to the forfeiture petition, Rafael Falette claimed ownership of the seized cash. Attached to his answer were two checks. The first check, dated June 17, 2009, was in the amount of $14,496.22, and the second check, dated July 16, 2009, was in the amount of $23,303.33. Answer, Exhibits 1 and 2. The checks were drawn on the account of a law\n   firm, Corradino &amp; Papa, LLC, with the notation \"Settlement Proceeds to Client.\" The checks, which represented the proceeds of Falette's settlement of a personal injury lawsuit, were issued within weeks of the August 7, 2009, vehicle stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At the April 17, 2014, hearing, Falette testified that upon receiving his settlement of $37,799.55, he quickly spent a substantial amount. Thereafter, he decided to \"stash\" the remainder,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   $34,440, inside the B pillar of the vehicle in question, which belonged to Lugo's sister and which Falette regularly borrowed. Reproduced Record at 45a. Falette stated that he did not know that Lugo would so quickly borrow his sister's vehicle to go tailgating in Pennsylvania. Falette acknowledged that he exercised extreme poor judgment in hiding his cash in the B pillar of his friend's vehicle. Falette attributed this lapse to his youth; he was 23 years old at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Commonwealth presented no evidence to refute Falette's case. It did not challenge Falette's answer to the forfeiture petition,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that Falette had received $37,799.55 in a settlement of a tort claim, a matter easily investigated. It did not present any evidence to refute Falette's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court took the matter under advisement. One month later it granted the forfeiture petition, holding that the Commonwealth established a \"nexus between the seized currency and unlawful activity.\" Trial Court op., May 15, 2014, at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It explained its holding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Pursuant to the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Lugo was charged and convicted of possession of marijuana for personal use, in an amount too small to authorize the forfeiture of the vehicle Lugo used to engage in \"tailgating.\" Lugo's drug offense has been adjudicated, and it is a matter of court record that he possessed but did not sell marijuana. Accordingly, the statutory presumption that the cash was derived from the selling of controlled substances was unavailing. Falette argues that the Commonwealth established, at most, a suspicion that the cash was in some way related to a drug offense, and a suspicion does not warrant a forfeiture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Forfeiture Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Forfeiture Act abolishes any property right in cash used to purchase or sell contraband drugs.

Accordingly, it held that the presumption was rebutted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the statutory presumption may be rebutted by record evidence relating to the specific fact of whether the seized currency represents the proceeds of a drug exchange. If the presumption is rebutted, as in\n   <em>\n    Tate,\n   </em>\n   it provides no assistance to the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    O'Brien,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545876\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/212/383/#p387\">\n    212 F.2d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court misstated the language of the Forfeiture Act. It stated that the presumption establishes an unspecified kind of \"drug trafficking,\" but the presumption speaks to one kind of drug offense: the\n   <em>\n    sale\n   </em>\n   of illegal drugs. The trial court stated that because the Commonwealth demonstrated \"a nexus ... to unlawful activity,\" the cash could be forfeited. \"Unlawful activity\" is not a statutory ground for forfeiture. The trial court's deviations from the actual language of the Forfeiture Act are excused by the majority as mere imprecision. Majority op. at 109 n. 10. \"Imprecision\" is not consistent with a strict construction of a statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Likewise, the majority does not address the adjudicated fact that Lugo possessed controlled substances for personal use and was not the owner of the cash. According to the majority, this evidence is \"irrelevant.\" Majority op. at 109. It believes that the only way to rebut the statutory presumption is by the innocent owner defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respectfully, I must disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Commonwealth's forfeiture petition stated that Lugo was charged with \"Possession of a Small Amount of Controlled Substance, Personal Use.\" Forfeiture Petition, \u00b6 7, J. Its petition also stated that Lugo was not the owner of the cash.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7, I. As in\n   <em>\n    Tate,\n   </em>\n   the record evidence rebutted the presumption that Lugo amassed the $34,440 by selling drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The record does so in two ways. First, Lugo, the owner of the drugs, was not the owner of the currency, according to Trooper Felsman's testimony, the forfeiture petition and Lugo's verified answer. The Commonwealth presented no evidence to connect Lugo to the cash, such as fingerprints. Second, it has been adjudicated that Lugo possessed, not sold, drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Taking away the presumption, the Commonwealth's other evidence was inadequate to warrant a forfeiture. The trial court recited, in conclusory fashion, a list of factors that have been used to support a forfeiture. However, some of these recited factors have no support in the record, and others lack any probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The trial court noted \"unusual behavior,\" such as the passengers \"pretending\" to be asleep during the traffic stop; cash stored in a place not intended for that use by the car's manufacturer; packaging of cash in black plastic bags; and the fact that the vehicle was not registered to the driver. Trial Court op., May 15, 2014, at 1. The trial court also stated that the occupants of the vehicle made \"inconsistent statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, the trial court did not identify the inconsistencies in the passengers' statements, and Trooper Felsman's testimony did not report any. Second, the Commonwealth offered no evidence that drug dealers are known to secret the proceeds of their drug sales in the B Pillar of a vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the Commonwealth showed the cash was organized by denomination but not how it was packaged,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   in bank wrappers or rubber bands. The difficulty of squeezing a large amount of cash into a small space suggests that the cash was in bank wrappers. The color of and material of the bag holding the cash is meaningless, as is the \"unusual behavior\" of Lugo's passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To be sure, $34,440 in cash is a large amount, but \"it is not against the law to carry cash.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. $9,000 U.S. Currency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7285095\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/379/#p388\">\n    8 A.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010).

Any kind of \"unlawful activity\" is not a statutory ground for a forfeiture. Further, the trial court did not find that the seized cash was the \"proceeds derived from the selling of a controlled substance,\" and this factual finding was necessary before it could order the forfeiture. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(ii).
