In May 2002, the City's Controller informed his widow, Pamela Cimino (Widow), that she was entitled to a death/survivor benefit of $1,949.11 per month, which was 50% of Decedent's annual compensation at the time of his death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This death benefit was reconfirmed in a July 2003 letter from the City's Controller to Widow. Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 1b-4b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time of Decedent's death, Section 1 of Article XXIV of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the City and its officers' bargaining representative, the Wage Policy Committee of the City of Arnold Police Department (Union), stated that \"[p]olice officers who have completed twelve (12) years of full-time service shall be entitled to vest his/her pension....\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 35. Additionally, Section 5 of Article XVII of the CBA stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   All pension benefits not in conflict with any sections of this Article and adopted by ordinance and in existence at the time of the signing of this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference into this Agreement including but not limited to ...

Additionally, Section 6.01(b) of Article VI of Ordinance 6 states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   If a Participant dies before becoming entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit, a Death Benefit shall be paid as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b) If the Participant dies, while an Employee of the Employer but not as the direct result of the performance of duties as an Employee of the Employer, a Death Benefit shall be paid monthly in an amount, ... in the case of a Participant who has completed ten (10) Years of Service or more, equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount which is equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Average Monthly Compensation of the Participant as of the Date of Death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63.

In February 2014, the City's Police Pension Board (Pension Board)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   determined that, pursuant to Section 6.01(b) of Ordinance No. 6, Widow was only entitled to a monthly death benefit of $974.55, or\n   50% of 50% of Decedent's average monthly compensation. R.R. at 15. As a result, the Board reduced Widow's benefit to $974.55 per month and determined that she had received an overpayment of $138,386.10 that would be recouped at $10.00 per month until she dies or the overpayment is repaid in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Union grieved the Pension Board's action on Widow's behalf pursuant to the CBA and the matter was submitted to an arbitrator. Initially, the arbitrator rejected the City's assertion that the grievance was not arbitrable, explaining that \"[t]he parties have agreed to submit any dispute to arbitration and have incorporated into the CBA by reference all pension plans and benefits. Thus this dispute is within 'any dispute' as provided in Article XVIII [of the CBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] Moreover, the City did not raise any issue of arbitrability at any stage of the grievance process or [when] select[ing] an arbitrator.\" R.R. at 5. Ultimately, the arbitrator sustained the grievance, concluding that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   the City's conduct in 2002 and 2003 was intended to provide the 50% benefit to [Widow] and the City at that time interpreted Ordinance 6 to provide that benefit.

Regardless of the City's later reinterpretation, its conduct in 2002 and 2003 and in submitted AVRs with the 50% benefit included ... created a term or condition of employment covered by the CBA and the City cannot now unilaterally alter that term or condition of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The City filed a petition to vacate the award that the trial court denied. The trial court first determined that \"no issues have been raised by [the City] regarding the regularity of the proceedings in this matter, nor have any issues been raised regarding the deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Trial Court 7/22/15 Opinion at 4. The trial court next found \"that this matter does fall within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court explained \"that there is a dispute regarding the interpretation of the [CBA] and Pension Plan provisions, as evidenced by the numerous issues raised by [Widow] during arbitration. Therefore, this matter does fall within the\n   jurisdiction of the arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the trial court determined that the arbitrator did not exceed his powers in the award by mandating that the City perform an illegal act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The trial court noted that the Third Class City Code specifically permits the City to provide Widow \"with the death benefit pension plan that she has been receiving.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The City then filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Initially, we note that an appeal of a grievance arbitration award under Act 111 is reviewed under a narrow certiorari standard which permits inquiry only into the following four areas: (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitrator; (2) the regularity of the proceedings; (3) an excess of the arbitrator's powers; or (4) the deprivation of constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police v.

The claimant was notified by letter dated January 5, 1978, that his benefits would be terminated by his employer, the Pennsylvania State Police, effective February 22, 1978, and his request for a hearing on the termination was denied. The claimant filed a petition for review on March 3, 1978, invoking this Court's original and appellate jurisdiction. We determined that the letter informing the claimant that his benefits would be terminated was an adjudication under Section 101 of the Administrative Agency Law because it was a final determination of his property rights and that his appeal to this Court was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days. We also held that the claimant's action in our original jurisdiction was barred because of the availability of the appeal from the adjudication terminating his benefits.
