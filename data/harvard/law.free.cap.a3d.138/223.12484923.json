The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress his statements made (1) at the crime scene and (2) later at the police station during his booking. Because we conclude that the public safety exception applied, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural background are relevant to the defendant's claim. \"On the night of March 9, 2010, the victim, Justin Molinaro, was driving his Audi [A6] in the vicinity of Maplewood Terrace, a public housing complex in Middletown known to be a high crime area. As he drove past the complex, two unidentified men flagged him down and informed him that his cousin, the defendant, wanted to speak with him. The victim drove his car into a parking lot at Maplewood Terrace, where he saw the defendant get into the backseat of another car. The victim exited his Audi and asked the defendant what he wanted. While the victim was waiting for the defendant, he saw Tykeem Privott, who was also in the car with the defendant. The victim noticed\n   that Privott had a supply of marijuana on his lap and began to chastise Privott for his drug use. As the victim talked to Privott, the defendant got out of the car wielding a Louisville Slugger aluminum baseball bat, which he used to strike the victim on the head. The blow knocked the victim to the ground, and the victim asked the defendant, '[W]hat the hell is going on?' The other occupants of the vehicle then exited the car and began to kick and punch the victim as he lay on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Privott picked up the Louisville Slugger and swung it at the victim, striking him on the back of his neck. The defendant choked the victim and told him to 'go to sleep, motherfucker.' The defendant ordered his accomplices to go through the victim's pockets, which they did, taking his cell phone, wallet, and the keys to the Audi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"As the assailants left, the victim stumbled to his feet. He found his car keys in a patch of grass near the parking lot. The defendant, however, reappeared and said, 'What, you didn't have enough yet?' and pointed a black handgun in the victim's face. The defendant took the keys to the Audi and said, 'This shit is mine.' The\n   victim then saw Privott, who was now also holding a handgun. Privott asked the defendant, 'Do you want me to pop this motherfucker?' The defendant then turned and left in the Audi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The victim walked to a nearby house and called 911. He reported to the dispatcher the details of the assault and carjacking. While on the telephone with the dispatcher, the victim saw the Audi double back, headed in the direction of Maplewood Terrace. He told the dispatcher that six people were returning in his car with guns, and he asked the dispatcher to send help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The police arrived on the scene, and police officers attended to the victim [who flagged them down]. One\n   police officer later stated that the victim looked 'like an alien' because the area around his left eye was bloodied, swollen, and disfigured. The swelling around the victim's eyes rendered him nearly blind. The victim was gasping for breath and making statements to the effect of, 'I don't want to die.' When asked what happened, the victim responded, 'Dante Smith and Tykeem Privott did this. Dante had a bat and Tykeem had a gun.' The victim faded in and out of consciousness and his respiration was irregular. Emergency workers arrived and transported him to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"After treating the victim, the police processed the crime scene and secured the area surrounding Maplewood Terrace, where a crowd had gathered. Approximately forty minutes after the assault took place, a black male calmly approached [Detectives] Dan Smith and Nicholas Puorro [of the Middletown Police Department]. As he drew near, he stated, 'I am Dante Smith, my grandmother said the police were looking for me.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"On the basis of the information provided by the victim, the police had reason to believe that the defendant was involved in an assault that involved both firearms and a baseball bat. The police informed the defendant that they had to place him in handcuffs for safety reasons, and that they had an obligation to protect both themselves and the surrounding crowd. The defendant stated that he understood, and that he also understood that he was not under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The police asked the defendant whether he had any weapons; he replied that he did not. The police frisked the defendant, but found no weapons. The defendant was asked whether he knew where the weapons were, to which he responded, 'What weapons?' When asked about Privott, the defendant denied knowing him. The defendant was then asked what happened that evening. The defendant stated that he had been involved in a\n   fight with the victim, and that he and the victim were cousins. He told the police that the victim had called him and wanted to go for a ride. The defendant stated that once he was in the car with the victim, the victim wanted to go and buy drugs. The defendant stated that he did not want to buy drugs and wanted to get out of the car. When the victim did not stop the vehicle, the defendant stated that he punched the victim in the face several times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Upon hearing the defendant's narrative, the police informed him that it appeared as if the victim had been struck with a baseball bat, and that the injuries occurred to the left side of his face, which was inconsistent with the defendant's story that the victim was driving. The defendant grew frantic and stopped cooperating with the police, stating, 'Do what you got to do, arrest me, arrest me.' The defendant was placed under arrest and transported to police headquarters.\" Id., at 151-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20A.3d%20524\">\n    86 A.3d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A hearing on the motion to suppress was held during which the defendant argued that the statements he made to the police while he was handcuffed at the crime scene should be suppressed because he was in police custody and interrogated without having received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\" (Citation omitted.)

Consequently, because the questioning at the crime scene of the defendant was justified, the Appellate Court found the doctrine articulated in\n   <em>\n    Missouri v.

This certified appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal to this court, the defendant contends that he was not lawfully detained under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   and was, instead, the subject of custodial interrogation at the crime scene. He further contends that the public safety exception did not apply to the interrogation, and that his statements were inadmissible. Due to the impropriety of the crime scene interrogation, the defendant argues that his statement made at the police station was also inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Seibert.\n   </em>\n   The state counters that the public safety exception applied and thus a determination of custody is unnecessary, and that the propriety of police conduct at the crime scene defeats the\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   claim with regard to the defendant's statements at the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We conclude that the public safety exception applied and, accordingly, we need not decide whether the defendant was in custody for the purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We\n   further conclude that, because the crime scene questioning was legitimate, the defendant's argument regarding the police station statements fails as the\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   doctrine is inapplicable. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Our standard of review of a trial court's findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record....

Instead, it appears to have credited the evidence only insofar as it established the presence of a single gun, as the court repeatedly and exclusively referred to \"a gun.\" \"Missing accomplices cannot be equated with missing guns in the absence of evidence that the accomplice presents a danger to the public 'requiring immediate action by the officers beyond the normal need expeditiously to solve a serious crime.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, this question did not on its face or in context plainly relate to the current whereabouts of these accomplices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are numerous instances in which police officers have varyingly framed a question to properly accomplish that end.

In fact, the officers' conduct suggests the contrary. One officer, describing the situation at the\n   time of the defendant's return, indicated that, \"[b]y this time, the craziness of the scene had died down.\" The officers \"were kind of milling around, doing a neighborhood canvass.\" Although neighborhood residents also were \"milling around,\" there is no indication that the police advised them to return to their homes. The fact that the assailants had left the victim's car running with the door ajar indicated that the assailants had fled the scene.

The defendant's crime scene statement was largely redundant in light of his subsequent, more detailed statement at the police station that was admitted into evidence through the officer's testimony who took the statement. The defendant's sole claim with regard to harm is that a few inconsistencies between his statement at the scene and his police station statement or his trial testimony undermined his credibility. I am not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendant admitted at the police station and at trial to having assaulted the victim. At trial, the defendant claimed to have acted in self-defense. The jury had before it a plethora of evidence other than the defendant's crime scene statement from which it could have concluded that the defendant's theory was not credible, including physical evidence that conflicted with the defendant's account of the altercation, the absence of a claim of self-defense in the defendant's statement at the police station, and various inconsistencies between his police station statement and his trial testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the limited\n   inconsistencies\n   between the defendant's crime scene statement on the one hand and his police station statement and trial testimony on the other hand were minor in comparison to other evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the defendant was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, we have recognized that \"statements obtained in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda,\n   </em>\n   if not the product of improper police coercion, are admissible for impeachment purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court found that the officers who interrogated the defendant at the scene \"at no time engaged in any coercive police activity whatsoever....\" I am not persuaded that this finding was clearly erroneous. The state was therefore entitled to use the defendant's crime scene statement to impeach the defendant. The state did just that when it recalled the officers who interrogated the defendant at the crime scene and elicited some of the very inconsistencies that the defendant claims were harmful. Although a state's witness commented on one of these inconsistencies during the state's case-in-chief, the jury nevertheless properly heard that same evidence in the state's rebuttal. I am therefore compelled to conclude that the admission of the defendant's statement in response to the question \"[w]hat happened?\" was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

It is important, therefore, to identify the basis for an inference that he, or his accomplices, could have done so. Such an inference is supported in the present case under the totality of the following considerations: the victim's ability to name the defendant and some of his accomplices as his attackers; the possibility that the victim's attackers saw him on his cell phone as they returned to the scene and assumed that the police had been summoned; and an officer's trial testimony that perpetrators often discard or secrete their weapons after committing a crime.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    As I explain later, the officers' conduct at the scene makes clear that they were not under the impression that the victim's assailants were then present at the scene or likely to return to the scene.

The defendant and his accomplices thereafter left the vehicle at the scene.
