Buhl, from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which reversed the defendant's conviction for breach of the peace in the second degree and affirmed her conviction for harassment in the second degree.\n   <em>\n    State v. Buhl,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20140\">\n    152 Conn.App. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    100 A.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In its appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant's breach of the peace conviction. In her appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly: (1) concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support her harassment conviction; and (2) declined to consider her constitutional claims on the ground that they were inadequately briefed. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court. Specifically, we conclude that the Appellate Court: (1) improperly determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant's breach of the peace conviction; (2) properly concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support her harassment conviction; and (3) did not abuse its discretion in determining that her constitutional claims were inadequately briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. In June, 2010, the defendant, a journalist, was involved in a romantic relationship with P and working on an investigative story about underage drinking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant had been dating\n   P for two years, and she frequently visited P's home, often several times per week. P was divorced, and M, his seventeen year old daughter from his previous marriage, resided with him\n   for one half of each week. M testified that her relationship with the defendant was \"tense\" and \"uncomfortable.\" M kept handwritten diary entries in a drawer of a nightstand in her bedroom at P's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 23, 2010, the night of M's high school graduation, M received a telephone call from a friend, B, who stated that he had seen a \"fake\" profile on Facebook, a social networking website, with posts about her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because B had received and accepted a friend request from the person who had created the fictitious account, M logged into Facebook through B's account to view the posts. M located the profile, which was created under the name \"Tasha Moore.\" The profile contained a post that read: \"[M] gets so drunk at parties that boys know she is an easy hook up. In April ... she gave [O] a blow job [at a party] and then threw up. [O] calls her that deep throat JAP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [M] told her friends she\n   thought giving the best [blow job] would help make [O] her boyfriend. You wonder why some [of the] girls [at M's high school] never learn how to behave around boys.\" (Footnote added.) That post also contained a photograph of M. A second post contained six photographs of diary entries from M's nightstand, which the author of the post called M's \"[c]onfession [l]etter.\" The diary entries described M drinking alcohol at a party and performing oral sex on a boy. Although \"Tasha Moore\" sent friend requests to seven or eight of M's friends from school, several of whom accepted the requests, she did not send a friend request to M herself. M was too upset to go out that night to celebrate her graduation. She continued to receive telephone calls from \"most people\" she knew from school that night asking about the posts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of June 24, 2010, M sent a message to \"Tasha Moore\" via Facebook asking her to take down the posts and\n   warning her that, if they were not removed, she would go to the police. When the posts remained on Facebook, M brought copies of them to the police station and explained what had happened to Officer Daniel Gulino. M then told her parents what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that afternoon, P received an anonymous envelope, sent by overnight mail, which contained copies of M's diary entries-the same ones that had been posted on Facebook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A typed, unsigned cover letter read as follows: \"[P], I am a casual friend of your daughter [M]. I told my mom about the story you'll read in this letter that [M] shared with us this spring and she said I should share it with you. [O], the guy [M] hooked up with, has been bragging to my boyfriend and other senior guys about what [M] did with him that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   He's not really a nice guy. She just gets so drunk so fast sometimes I don't know if she even remembers hooking up with guys. I know she wanted [O] to be her boyfriend but he hardly talked to her after that night. She only showed a few of us these letters.... Please don't tell her one of her friends wrote you but my [m]om said it is best if you read them.\" P and M returned to the police station with these materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next night, on June 25, 2010, P had dinner with the defendant and told her about these events. He explained how \"shocked\" he was that such a \"crazy thing\" was going on, and stated that a police investigation was pending. P \"got no reaction\" from the defendant. Two days later, however, the defendant told P that she had sent the anonymous mailing. She explained that a friend of M's had contacted her because she was concerned about M, and the friend had produced copies of M's diary entries. The defendant claimed that she convinced that friend to turn the copies over to her along with a cover letter explaining the circumstances. When P asked for the friend's name, the defendant refused to reveal that information, stating that she had promised to keep it confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   P informed Officer Gulino of the identity of the anonymous mailer. At this point, Officer Gulino already had concluded that the person who took M's diary entries was someone P or M knew, because the doors to P's home were kept locked and there were no signs of forced entry. When Officer Gulino spoke with the defendant over the telephone, she told him that she was doing an investigative story on underage drinking in the area, but \"adamantly denied\" posting M's diary entries on Facebook. When asked if she was \"Tasha Moore,\" the defendant responded, \"I'm Teri Buhl, not Tasha Moore.\" Officer Gulino then turned the investigation over to Sergeant Carol Ogrinc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sergeant Ogrinc served an ex parte order on Facebook for the disclosure of the Internet Protocol address (IP address) associated with the \"Tasha Moore\" profile. After receiving this information, Sergeant Ogrinc then served an ex parte order on Cablevision, an Internet service provider, seeking the disclosure of the person associated with the IP address she was investigating. Cablevision reported that person was the defendant. See footnote 19 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged, relevant to these appeals, with breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a)(4), and harassment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state alleged\n   that the defendant committed harassment by posting M's diary entries on Facebook or sending the anonymous mailing to P. The state based the breach of the peace charge on the Facebook posts only. After a court trial, the court convicted the defendant of both offenses, and sentenced her to a total effective sentence of nine months incarceration, execution suspended after thirty days, followed by one year of probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant appealed from both convictions to the Appellate Court, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to support her breach of the peace conviction because the state had not proven that: (1) the Facebook posts were \"publicly exhibit[ed]\"; (2) she posted M's diary entries on Facebook; or (3) she intended to \"inconvenience, [annoy] or alarm\" M by posting the diary entries on Facebook. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a). The defendant further contended that there was\n   insufficient evidence to support her harassment conviction, based on the anonymous mailing, because the state had not proven that she intended to \"harass, annoy or alarm\" P or M by sending the mailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a)(2). Embedded within these sufficiency arguments, the defendant also asserted several constitutional claims based on the first amendment to the United States constitution and the due process clause set forth in the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Appellate Court determined that the defendant had properly set forth sufficiency arguments with respect to both convictions, but had not adequately briefed her constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    State v. Buhl,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20140\">\n    152 Conn.App. at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    100 A.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support her breach of the peace conviction because the state had not proven that the Facebook posts were publicly exhibited.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    Id., at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    100 A.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court did not address the defendant's arguments with respect to the other elements of the crime.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 155 n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    100 A.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reviewing the defendant's harassment conviction, the Appellate Court concluded that sufficient evidence demonstrated her intent to \"harass, annoy or alarm\" P or M by sending the anonymous mailing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    Id., at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    100 A.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court, therefore, reversed the defendant's breach of the peace conviction and affirmed her harassment conviction. Id., at 161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%206\">\n    100 A.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These\n   certified appeals followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state claims in its appeal that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that\n   there was insufficient evidence to prove that the Facebook posts were publicly exhibited with respect to defendant's breach of the peace conviction. In response, the defendant argues to the contrary. We agree with the state. We further conclude that the breach of the peace conviction must be reinstated because the trial court reasonably could have found that the state had met its burden of proving the other elements of the crime at trial, namely, that: (1) the defendant was the person who posted M's diary entries on Facebook; and (2) the defendant intended to \"inconvenience, [annoy] or alarm\" M by posting her diary entries on Facebook. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a). The state preemptively raises these claims in the event that we agree that there was sufficient evidence to prove that the Facebook posts were publicly exhibited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties do not dispute that our well known standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence claims applies to these appeals, both as to the construction to be given the evidence at trial and the inferences that can be drawn from that evidence.

Davis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730100\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/280/#p329\">\n    283 Conn. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 329-30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=929%20A.2d%20278\">\n    929 A.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant argues in response that the Appellate Court properly determined that expert testimony was required to prove the public nature of the posts, given the trial court's lack of knowledge of Facebook, and properly determined that M's testimony on this point was contradictory. We agree with the state, and conclude that there was sufficient evidence of a public exhibition of the Facebook posts at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. The state's evidence regarding the public nature of the Facebook posts came primarily from M's testimony. Toward the beginning of her testimony, when the issue of Facebook arose, the trial court stated, \"I should forewarn counsel, I don't keep a Facebook page, so please feel free to explain the significance of different Facebook issues as we get to them because I will not necessarily appreciate them.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Id., at 158,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20962\">\n    49 A.3d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . M subsequently explained how to \"friend\" someone on Facebook-by sending them a friend \"request\" or invitation to become friends-and how, if the person accepts the request, the two users become Facebook \"friends.\" M further explained that a user's profile may be accessible to\n   the public, or only to his or her network of \"friends,\" depending on the user's privacy settings. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Specifically, with respect to the \"Tasha Moore\" profile, M testified that she initially viewed the profile through the account of B, who had become friends with \"Tasha Moore,\" but later viewed the exact same content through her own profile, even though she had never become friends with \"Tasha Moore.\" Because M could access the posts without becoming friends with \"Tasha Moore,\" M stated her belief that the profile was \"unprivate\" and, thus, any member of the public could view the profile and the posts about M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Appellate Court concluded that this evidence was insufficient to establish that the Facebook posts were publicly exhibited\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   for two primary reasons: (1) expert testimony\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   was required to establish the public nature of the posts, given the trial court's apparent unfamiliarity with Facebook; and (2) M's testimony on this point was contradictory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the first half of this exchange, M stated that she viewed \"Tasha Moore's\" profile through a friend's account\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   through her own account, though she was never friends with \"Tasha Moore.\" She subsequently responded to a compound leading question that contained two assertions, namely that: (1) she had not been \"invited\" to become friends with \"Tasha Moore\"; and (2) she had not viewed \"Tasha Moore's\" profile through anyone's Facebook account other than B's. M answered \"[r]ight,\" but clarified that\n   she was only responding to the first assertion by stating that \"everybody else had been invited except me.\" Defense counsel then asked another two part leading question, asserting that: (1) Facebook friend requests are \"private invitation[s],\" which only the invitee\n   can view; and (2) one must be \"invited in\" to view a user's profile, or, perhaps, the \"Tasha Moore\" profile specifically. It is unclear to which assertion M directed her answer of \"sure.\" Regardless, our review of the trial transcript makes clear that the trial court subsequently resolved, to its satisfaction, any ambiguity in this portion of M's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In particular, the trial court evinced its understanding of M's testimony as being that she could view the posts through her own account even though she was never friends with \"Tasha Moore.\" During closing arguments, when defense counsel continued to argue that the posts were \"private,\" the court inquired:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"The Court: Didn't ... she say that she saw [the profile] initially signing in [through a friend's account]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"The Court: And then later she was able to see it ... signing in as herself, or as a member of the public?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: She did say....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The Court: So there I think the issue is credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Most tellingly, at the hearing on the defendant's postverdict motions, prior to her sentencing, the trial court expressly rejected the notion that M's testimony was unclear as to whether the posts were publicly accessible. The court inquired of defense counsel as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"The Court: Wasn't there testimony by [M] that she was not friended? That she viewed this not only ... using the Facebook page of a friend who had been friended, but that she directly viewed this under her own identity? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: [T]here was ... testimony, I think, that was unclear....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"The Court:\n   <em>\n    How is that unclear?\n   </em>\n   ...

The defendant visited P's home frequently, often several times each week, and M kept diary entries in her bedroom in P's home. The police suspected that the person who took the diary entries was someone with access to P's home, because the doors to the home were kept locked and there were no signs of forced entry. Although M's friends had access to P's home, M testified that only her close friends would come over, and that she felt she could share anything with them. Moreover, the diary entries were posted on Facebook during M's graduation ceremony, which most of her friends attended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court could reasonably infer that the defendant possessed the diary entries when they were posted on Facebook. The defendant admitted to sending the anonymous mailing, and she, therefore, possessed the diary entries at one time. Given the timing of the Facebook posts and mailing, the trial court could further infer that she possessed them when they were posted on Facebook. The diary entries were posted on Facebook\n   on June 23, 2010, at approximately 6 p.m. and P received the mailing with the diary entries the following day by overnight mail. Thus, the trial court could reasonably infer that the defendant possessed the diary entries on the night of June 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The trial court could also reasonably infer that the defendant had a motive to commit the crime. Consistent with her theory of defense, the defendant testified that she was working on an investigative story about underage drinking at the time, and the diary entries concerned a seventeen year old girl drinking at a party. Additionally, M testified that she had a \"tense\" and \"uncomfortable\" relationship with the defendant, and that she believed that the defendant tried to \"make [her] life miserable.\" P confirmed that M and the defendant never had a close relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The defendant, however, points to the fact that she had a financially beneficial, nontumultuous relationship with P and, thus, no motive to harm P or M. Indeed, P and the defendant had been dating for more than two years by June, 2010, and P helped pay for her apartment and living expenses. P testified that their relationship was \"good\" with no long periods of animosity, that P trusted her, and that they had an \"open line of communication.\" M testified that P and the defendant \"got along fine\" and that she did not perceive any tension between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This evidence related to the quality of the relationship between P and the defendant, however, does not diminish the reasonableness of the inference that the trial court did make, namely, that the defendant had a motive to commit the crime based on her troubled relationship with M. \"In evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant's innocence.... The trier [of fact] may\n   draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.

The defendant could have brought the diary entries to P, her boyfriend of more than two years, directly, but she instead, as she admitted, sent them anonymously. The anonymous nature of the mailing served to increase P's and M's anxieties because they did not know who had intruded into M's bedroom and copied her diary entries, how the mailer had obtained the entries, or who else might have access to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   P, in fact, testified that he felt \"violated\" that M's diary entries were in \"someone else's hands.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, when the defendant had the opportunity to admit to sending the mailing, she did not do so, and instead hid this information for another two days. On June 25, 2010, P explained to the defendant what had happened, including his receipt of the anonymous mailing, stating how \"shocked\" he was that such a \"crazy thing\" was going on. He, however, \"got no reaction\" from the defendant. The defendant did not admit to sending the mailing until two days later, after learning that a police investigation was pending. Her delayed confession prolonged P's and M's anxieties about the mailing, and further revealed her intention to harass them. The trial court reasonably could have declined to credit the defendant's explanation that she was trying to protect her \"source\"; see part I B 1 of this opinion; as equally unpersuasive in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The contents of the mailing also show an intent to harass, annoy, or alarm P or M. The package contained copies of M's private diary entries, which described her drinking heavily at a party and performing oral sex on a boy. As the trial court noted, any parent receiving such a mailing would reasonably find it \"incredibly distressful, disturbing, and abhorrent.\" P not only learned this information from a purportedly anonymous stranger, but realized that an unknown person had been in his home-specifically, his daughter's bedroom-rifled through her belongings, and made copies of her private diary entries. He was reasonably \"shocked,\" \"surprised,\" and \"outraged\" by the contents of the mailing, and felt \"violated\" that an unknown person had been in his home. Additionally, with respect to M, mailing such content to a person's parents could reasonably evince the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm that person, especially if the person is a minor. The defendant may also have had a motive to harass M based on their strained relationship. See part I B 1 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We acknowledge the defendant's argument that the cover letter from a \"friend,\" if believed, could show concern for M and her well-being, rather than an attempt to harass P or M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Crews v.
