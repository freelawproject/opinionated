The Appellate Court affirmed the defendant's conviction of intimidating a witness notwithstanding the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of that offense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state argued, rather, that the defendant committed the crime of attempt to interfere with an officer merely by\n   asking his friend not to give a statement to the police, expression that the state acknowledges is constitutionally protected and, therefore, outside the purview of \u00a7 53a-167a (a). Indeed, because the state never argued that the defendant's text message was a true threat, the trial court did not instruct the jury on the definition of such a threat, as it would have been constitutionally required to do if the state had made such an argument. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

With respect to the defendant's appeal, we conclude that the evidence supported his conviction of intimidating a witness. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found. \"On November 4, 2011, Jazmyn Lopez-Gay, accompanied by the defendant and other friends, visited a nightclub in [the city of] Danbury. While at the nightclub, her cell phone was stolen. The following day, she used an application on her computer to track the cell phone's location that indicated that it was near the Danbury [Fair] [M]all [mall]. She then called the Danbury\n   police, who went to look for the cell phone but were unable to find it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That same day, November 5, 2011, the defendant called Ian Mason, an acquaintance, and asked him to pick him up and drive him to the ... mall. During that trip, the defendant sold Mason the cell phone. Because the cell phone was password protected, Mason was unable to access its functions or its contents. Seeking to gain access, Mason contacted Michael Barbour, a friend who used to perform work servicing cell phones, and brought the cell phone to his home in [the town of] Newtown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Meanwhile, occurring parallel to these events, Lopez-Gay again used the tracking application on her computer, which indicated that her cell phone was located at Barbour's home.... Lopez-Gay then called the Newtown Police Department, [which] sent ... [O]fficer Michael McGowan to that location. Once there, McGowan spoke with Mason, who relinquished the cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Later that night, Mason went to the Newtown Police Department. He was questioned by a police officer and eventually\n   provided a sworn, written statement recounting how he came to possess the cell phone. Around this time, Mason sent a text message to the defendant telling him that he was at the police station. In response, the defendant sent a text message to Mason telling him not to write a statement and to 'keep [his] mouth shut.' The message scared Mason and caused him to hesitate before making his statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"At some point, the defendant discovered that Mason had made a statement to the police. On November 12, 2011, the defendant sent Mason a series of threatening Facebook messages. The messages shared similar content. In one message, the defendant wrote: 'U wrote a statement regardless. Hearsay is nothing they can't\n   arrest u unless they have a statement and that's what u did u wrote a fucking statement.... I thought we were straight and u wouldn't be dumb enough to write a statement after telling u that day what we did to the last snitch. Ur a snitch kid that's what it comes down to and ur gonna get treated like a snitch u wrote that statement u best be ready for the shit u got urself into. U think it's a fuckin game and all this is fine and [we're] gonna be cool cause u got scared when the cops pressed u and u folded like every other snitch when they had NOTHING on either of us. U fucked up I'd watch out if I were u my boys are real pissed at u for this knowing I'm already in enough shit [as] it is.

The charge alleging that the defendant had intimidated a witness was based on the November 12, 2011 Facebook messages that he sent to Mason after he learned that Mason had given a statement to the police. Although the Facebook messages were admitted into evidence, the text message was not. The assistant state's attorney (prosecutor) questioned Mason about the contents of the text message, however, during the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Q. ... After you texted the defendant and told him that you were at the police station, what did he respond with?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"A. He asked me not to write a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Q. Did he tell you to keep your mouth shut?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"A. Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, during closing arguments, the prosecutor, in addressing the charge of attempt to interfere with an officer, argued that, when Mason \"[went] down to the police station, [he] ... indicates to the defendant that he is ... there and ... they have some sort of conversation, through text message, and the defendant indicates to him, you know, don't give a statement to [the] police.\" The prosecutor then explained that, in order to find the defendant guilty of attempt to interfere with an officer, the jury must find that, \"when the defendant sent those text messages to ... Mason, he was attempting to hinder [the] investigation [by telling Mason], 'don't cooperate with the police....' [T]hat's a substantial step; he didn't complete it, but he took that step. He is guilty of attempt to interfere with an officer.\" The prosecutor further argued that \"the defendant is charged with attempted\n   interference; he's not charged with interfering, and this is important because no one in this courtroom, especially me, is going to claim that the defendant was successful in his attempt to interfere with this investigation. In fact, he was unsuccessful, which led to the Facebook messages, which I'll be getting to a little bit later....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With respect to the charge of intimidating a witness, the prosecutor argued that, to find the defendant guilty of that offense, the jury must find that the defendant believed that an official criminal proceeding was about to be instituted and that he threatened Mason with physical harm in order to prevent him from testifying in that proceeding. The prosecutor argued that the defendant's Facebook messages established both elements of this offense because they demonstrated that the defendant was aware that a criminal proceeding was\n   pending or about to be instituted and that he threatened Mason with physical harm to prevent him from testifying in that proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsequently, the jury found the defendant guilty of attempt to interfere with an officer and intimidating a witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court thereafter rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict and sentenced the defendant to one year incarceration on the interference charge and six years incarceration, execution suspended after three years, followed by five years of probation, on the intimidation charge. The sentences were to be served consecutively for a total effective sentence of seven years incarceration, suspended after four years, and five years of probation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In light of that determination, the Appellate Court did not reach the defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of attempting to interfere with an officer because \u00a7 53a-167a does not proscribe conduct directed at someone who is not an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Appellate Court, however, rejected the defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of intimidating a witness. The court concluded that the November 12, 2011 Facebook messages were more than sufficient to sustain a finding that the defendant believed that the police were preparing to charge him with the theft of the cell phone, that he believed that Mason would be called to testify at the defendant's criminal trial, and that he threatened Mason to prevent him from testifying in that proceeding. See id., at 598-99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20A.3d%20910\">\n    98 A.3d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal to this court following our granting of certification, the state argues, inter alia, that the Appellate\n   Court incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 53a-167a as excluding from the statute's purview all forms of unprotected speech except fighting words. In the alternative, the state asks this court to \"modify\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ' gloss to allow \u00a7 53a-167a to proscribe all forms of unprotected verbal conduct, including 'true threats'....\" In his appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the evidence supported his conviction of intimidating a witness because the state failed to present evidence that the defendant believed that an official proceeding was about to be instituted or that he had a specific intent to influence, delay or prevent Mason's testimony at such a proceeding when he sent him the Facebook messages. We address each appeal in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We first address the state's contention that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that \u00a7 53a-167a does not proscribe true threats or, alternatively, that this court should expand\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ' gloss to encompass such threats. The state also argues that, if this court concludes that \u00a7 53a-167a proscribes true threats, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of attempt to interfere with an officer because the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant's text message, when viewed in light of the defendant's Facebook messages and certain other evidence, constituted a serious expression of an intent to physically harm Mason if he gave a statement to the police. The defendant contends, inter alia, that the state is attempting to salvage a conviction on the basis of a theory of guilt that was not alleged and was never presented to the jury, in violation of the defendant's right to due process of law. Specifically, the defendant argues that, because the state did not proceed under a theory that the defendant interfered with the police by threatening Mason with physical harm if he gave a statement to them, this court cannot\n   evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence on the basis of such a theory. The state responds that its theory of guilt has always been \"that the defendant attempted to interfere with police questioning of Mason by sending Mason a text message that was intended to frighten Mason out of speaking with the police,\" and, therefore, the defendant's contention that it has changed its theory of guilt on appeal is without merit. We agree with the defendant.\n   The following principles guide our analysis of the state's claim. Section 53a-167a (a) provides in relevant part that \"[a] person is guilty of interfering with an officer when such person obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers any peace officer ... in the performance of such peace officer's ... duties.\" We previously have interpreted \"\u00a7 53a-167a to cover some acts of verbal resistance as well as acts of physical resistance. Although the statute does not explicitly define the nature of the acts that fall within its ambit, 'resistance,' as commonly understood, encompasses both verbal and physical conduct.... The inclusion of verbal conduct does not, per se, leave the statute so open-ended that it lends itself to arbitrary enforcement. The statute's requirement of intent limits its application to verbal conduct intended to interfere with a police officer and excludes situations in which a defendant merely questions a police officer's authority or protests his or her action.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state asserts that, although the prosecutor maintained in his closing argument that the defendant committed the crime of attempt to interfere with an officer by instructing Mason, via text message, not to cooperate with the police, \"[t]his one statement ... does not constitute an exclusive theory of guilt disavowing the circumstances surrounding the text messages that demonstrated the true threatening nature of the text message and explained Mason's intense fearful response to it.\" The state also contends that, because the prosecutor referred to Mason's fear and one of the defendant's threatening Facebook messages while discussing the interference charge, he \"[implicitly] presented\n   [the] theory that the defendant's attempt to interfere was based on his attempt to frighten Mason out of providing a statement to the police.\" The state's contention is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A review of the record reveals that, although the prosecutor made reference to Mason's fear and one of the Facebook messages in his closing argument, both references were made in the context of rebutting defense counsel's argument that the state had failed to prove that it was the defendant and not someone else who sent the November 5, 2011 text message to Mason, not to demonstrate that the text message was intended to communicate a serious expression of an intent to harm Mason if he cooperated with the police. Specifically, the prosecutor argued: \"[A]s we're thinking about credibility ... Mason told you that he was receiving these text messages [from the defendant] and that is consistent with what the officers told you, that he was receiving texts and that he was, in fact, frightened.... And, also, let's go back to the Facebook messages, as [they relate] to this charge, referring to the Facebook message that this defendant sent ... on November 12, 2011, [telling Mason] 'never write a statement, ever, I talked with you about that that day'.... And, so, [we have] ... consciousness of guilt. This defendant said, 'I told you that day not to write a statement.' Why is that important? Because ... Mason told you he was receiving those text messages. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the equivalent of a confession to attempt to interfere with an officer.\" The prosecutor's explanation as to why the Facebook messages were relevant to the interference charge is consistent with his response, earlier in the trial, when asked by the court whether the Facebook messages were being offered solely in relation to the larceny\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and intimidation charges. The prosecutor responded\n   that they were also\n   relevant to the interference charge because, in one of the messages, the defendant \"basically admits to sending the text and telling [Mason] not to write a statement....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At no time did the prosecutor suggest that the Facebook messages-or any other evidence for that matter-were relevant to the interference charge because they helped to prove that the defendant's November 5, 2011 text message, although neutral on its face, was intended to communicate a serious expression of an intent to harm Mason if he cooperated with the police.

Indeed, the prosecutor never uttered the words \"threat\" or \"threatening\" in relation to the text message, even though, as the state acknowledges, under a true threat theory of guilt, the state bore the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the text communicated such a threat. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Krijger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"[When] a communication contains language [that] is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one threatening, and the other nonthreatening, the government carries the burden of presenting evidence serving to remove that ambiguity. [In the absence of] such proof, the trial court must direct a verdict of acquittal.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.] ). Rather, as we previously indicated, the prosecutor referred to the November 5, 2011 text message exchange between Mason and the defendant as \"some sort of conversation\" in which \"the defendant indicates to [Mason], you know, don't give a statement to [the] police.\" According to the prosecutor, it was that statement-\"don't give a statement to [the] police\"-that constituted the actus reus of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As we have explained, however, and as the state concedes, \u00a7 53a-167a does not proscribe such verbal conduct, and, therefore, the defendant's conviction under that statute cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our determination that the state did not pursue a theory of guilt predicated on threatening language is strongly reinforced by the fact that the trial court did not instruct the jury on the true threat doctrine. Of course, the trial court never gave such an instruction because the state never claimed that the defendant's text message constituted a true threat. A true threat instruction is required, however, in any case in which the defendant's threatening speech forms the basis of the prosecution because only a true threat may be prosecuted under the first amendment. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Moulton,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20337\">\n    310 Conn. at 367-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%2055\">\n    78 A.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a defendant whose alleged threats form the basis of a prosecution under any provision of our Penal Code ... is entitled [under the first amendment] to an instruction that he could be convicted as charged only if his statements ... constituted a true threat\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Accordingly, and for the reasons previously set forth in this opinion, the state cannot prevail on its claim that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of attempt to interfere with an officer based on the theory that the defendant's November 5, 2011 text message constituted a true threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We next address the defendant's appeal, in which he claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of intimidating a witness in violation of\n   \u00a7 53a-151a (a). The defendant argues that, although the evidence supported a finding that he threatened Mason for \"snitch[ing],\" it did not support a finding that he believed that an official proceeding was imminent when he did so, or that his\n   intention was to prevent Mason's testimony in such a proceeding. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 53a-151a (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of intimidating a witness when, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted, such person uses, attempts to use or threatens the use of physical force against a witness or another person with intent to (1) influence, delay or prevent the testimony of the witness in the official proceeding....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-146 (6) defines \"witness\" as \"any person summoned, or who may be summoned, to give testimony in an official proceeding.\" In\n   <em>\n    State v. Ortiz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20551\">\n    312 Conn. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%201128\">\n    93 A.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), this court explained that the phrase \"believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted,\" as used in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the witness tampering statute, is satisfied \"as long as the defendant believes that an official proceeding will probably occur, [and] it does not matter whether an official proceeding is actually pending or is about to be instituted.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In light of the close relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 53a-151 (a) and 53a-151a (a), it is appropriate to give the same phrase in each statute the same meaning. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the Appellate Court explained, \"[i]n one Facebook message, the defendant acknowledged that the police were 'getting warrants' and 'building a case' against him. In a different message, the defendant wrote, 'I'll eat the charge....' In yet another message, the defendant told Mason that he was 'already in enough shit [as] it is.'

The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on that count, however, and the court declared a mistrial as to that charge, which is not the subject of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    See footnote 8 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 (a) provides: \"A person is guilty of tampering with a witness if, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted, he induces or attempts to induce a witness to testify falsely, withhold testimony, elude legal process summoning him to testify or absent himself from any official proceeding.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    We previously have observed that \"the purpose of part XI of the Connecticut Penal Code, in which \u00a7 53a-151 (a) [and \u00a7 53a-151a (a) are] found, [is to] punish those who interfere with the courts and our system of justice.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State v.
