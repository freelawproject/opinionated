The PSP asserts the ALJ erred in determining it did not sustain its burden of proof in denying Slaughter a firearms purchase when Slaughter was prohibited from possessing firearms based on a prior involuntary commitment under Section 302 of the MHPA. It also argues that the order of a court in Virginia that purportedly restored Slaughter's right to possess a firearm is unenforceable and is not entitled to full faith and credit in Pennsylvania. Upon review, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2014, Slaughter attempted to purchase a firearm. He was prohibited from doing so after a search of the PICS database revealed that he was disqualified from owning or possessing a firearm. Slaughter filed a PICS challenge. Among other things, the challenge form asks: \"Were you ever adjudicated incompetent or involuntarily committed?\" Certified Record (C.R.), Item # 6, ALJ's Hearing, 10/22/14, Ex. A at 2. In response to this question, Slaughter stated \"unknown see attached[,]\" and he attached a document titled \"Mental Health Record\" that indicated he was subject to an \"[i]nvoluntary [c]ommittal\" at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. C.R., Ex. A at 2, 6. The PSP subsequently denied Slaughter's PICS challenge pursuant to Section 6105(c)(4) of the UFA based on a 2005 involuntary commitment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Slaughter appealed to the OAG. A hearing ensued before an ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing, the PSP presented the testimony of Stephanie Dunkerly (Dunkerly), a legal assistant supervisor in the PSP's PICS Challenge Section, as well as the telephonic testimony of Regina Mary O'Neill (O'Neill), Deputy City Solicitor for the City of Philadelphia, Counsel for the Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services. The PSP also presented a packet of documents relating to Slaughter's PICS challenge, which included, among other things, mental health records from the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services as well as a petition to extend the length of Slaughter's involuntary treatment, which was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Slaughter testified on his own behalf and presented documentary evidence, including letters from O'Neill and Temple University Hospital regarding the results of their searches for additional records relating to Slaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dunkerly testified she processed Slaughter's PICS challenge, and she prepared a packet of documents relating to the PICS challenge in preparation for the hearing. Within that packet, was an Act 77\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   notification form the PSP received regarding Slaughter, which indicated that in October 2005, Slaughter was involuntarily committed at the Temple University Hospital, Episcopal Campus. Dunkerly also\n   identified certified records pertaining to Slaughter from the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services, which indicated Slaughter was committed pursuant to Section 302 of the MHPA. Dunkerly also identified a petition for a commitment under Section 303 of the MHPA, together with an order scheduling a hearing, through which a request was made to extend Slaughter's involuntary commitment. That document indicated Slaughter was informed of his rights and an examination occurred. Dunkerly also identified an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, which stated the petition filed pursuant to Section 303 of the MHPA was withdrawn, without prejudice, after Slaughter agreed to a voluntary commitment under Section 201 of the MHPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On cross-examination, Dunkerly acknowledged the packet of documents did not contain a copy of the actual petition completed pursuant to Section 302 of the MHPA. Additionally, Dunkerly identified a letter from O'Neill to Slaughter's counsel, which indicated that, in response to Slaughter's counsel's request for a copy of the 302 petition, O'Neill was only able to locate the 303 petition, which was withdrawn after Slaughter agreed to be voluntarily committed. Dunkerly also identified a document from Temple University's Medical Records Department, which indicated there was no record of Slaughter being seen at Temple University Hospital. Also, she identified a document from Temple University Health System, Episcopal Campus, which indicated it was unable to answer a records request because the records sought were beyond its retention policy of seven years and records older than seven years old were destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For her part, O'Neill testified that she was unable to locate any records for Slaughter other than the records from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, which consisted of a copy of the petition filed pursuant to Section 303 of the MHPA, and the order marking the petition withdrawn after Slaughter agreed to a voluntary commitment. O'Neill testified that, based on her experience, a Section 303 petition would not be filed unless a prior petition under Section 302 was filed. Based on the documents she was able to locate, O'Neill explained that, after the Section 303 petition was filed, Slaughter agreed to remain at the facility voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On cross-examination, O'Neill testified she could not locate a copy of the Section 302 petition, but the petition was beyond the seven-year period in which such records would be retained. O'Neill also explained that, unlike a Section 303 proceeding, which requires a court hearing, a 302 petition is completed by a physician at a hospital and is provided to the delegate of a county mental health department. O'Neill also explained that if an individual voluntarily seeks psychiatric help at a hospital and later wishes to leave, the hospital can involuntarily commit that individual for further evaluation for up to 120 hours by filing a Section 302 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For his part, Slaughter testified that his family currently resides in Richmond, Virginia. Slaughter explained that in 2005 he was 22 years old and living in Philadelphia. He indicated that in October 2005 he was in a difficult place in his life, and on the date at issue, \"[he] had a lot to drink and [he] made a suboptimal decision.\" C.R., Item # 6, ALJ's Hearing, 10/22/14, Notes of Testimony (N.T.) at 89. Realizing he made a mistake, he dialed 911 and asked for help, and emergency medical technicians transported him by ambulance to Temple University Hospital where he received treatment. Sometime later, he recalled being in a room where individuals\n   sitting across from him asked if he wanted \"continued emotional mental treatment.\" N.T. at 90. He indicated that he wanted such treatment, and he remained at the facility for a period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On cross-examination, Slaughter indicated that he has alcoholism. He stated that on the date at issue, in addition to consuming a lot of alcohol, he ingested a handful of aspirin. He testified he vaguely remembered being transferred from one hospital to another hospital as well as meeting with a public defender. Slaughter also indicated he vaguely recalled meeting with a mental health review officer. At that time, he indicated he wished to undergo further psychiatric treatment. When asked if the incident was a suicide attempt, Slaughter responded he \"would call it a cry for help from a very lost, scared young man....\" N.T. at 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On re-direct examination, Slaughter identified a document issued by the Henrico General District Court in Virginia, which restored his right to purchase, possess or transfer a firearm in Virginia. As to the 2005 incident in Philadelphia, Slaughter testified he did not recall being informed of the rights of a person subject to a Section 302 petition. He further testified he was not informed he was being involuntarily committed, and he did not communicate to hospital personnel that he was not there voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On re-cross examination, Slaughter explained that after he unsuccessfully attempted to purchase a firearm in Virginia, he was arrested and charged with unlawfully attempting to do so, based on the involuntary commitment in Philadelphia in 2005. He testified that because the underlying document showing he was involuntarily committed was never produced, the charges were dismissed with prejudice. Slaughter testified he subsequently filed an unopposed petition to restore his right to possess a firearm in Virginia, which was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the hearing, the parties filed briefs in support of their respective positions. Ultimately, the ALJ issued the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW THIS\n   </strong>\n   15th day of May 2015, having heard the appeal of [Slaughter], reviewing the briefs of counsel and applying applicable case law to the denial of relief by the [PSP], dated April 21, 2014 the request of [Slaughter] for Relief is hereby\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINED.\n   </strong>\n   [PSP] is hereby ordered to amend the PICS database within 30 days so as to remove, as it pertains to [Slaughter], the disability imposed by Subsection (c)(4) of Section 6105, 18 Pa.C.S. [\u00a7] 6105(c)(4). A petition for review of this decision in Commonwealth Court must be filed within 30 days of the date of this order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C.R., Item # 10. The PSP filed a petition for review to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Slaughter subsequently filed an application for remand on the ground the ALJ did not issue a written decision containing findings of fact and a statement of reasons for his decision. The PSP filed an answer in which it did not object to the requested remand. As a result, the undersigned issued an order remanding the matter to the ALJ for preparation of an opinion containing findings and reasons for the ALJ's order. We directed the ALJ to re-certify the record with the opinion, and we retained jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thereafter, the ALJ issued an opinion in which he determined the PSP did not meet its burden of proving Slaughter was properly denied the right to purchase a firearm. In particular, the ALJ determined the PSP did not present the certification of an examining physician to show inpatient care was necessary or that Slaughter was\n   committable. The ALJ also stated that, based on this determination, it was unnecessary for him to address Slaughter's argument that he is entitled to the full faith and credit of the Henrico General District Court order, Henrico County, Virginia, which restored Slaughter's right to purchase, possess or transport a firearm in Virginia. This matter is now before us for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the PSP argues the ALJ erred in determining that the PSP did not sustain its burden of proof in denying Slaughter the purchase of a firearm where Slaughter was prohibited from possessing firearms based on an involuntary commitment under Section 302 of the MHPA. Additionally, the PSP asserts the Virginia court order purporting to restore Slaughter's right to possess firearms is not enforceable and is not entitled to full faith and credit in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prohibition Under Section 6105(c)(4) of the UFA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The PSP first argues the records presented at the hearing established by a preponderance of the evidence that the PSP properly denied Slaughter's purchase of a firearm based on his commitment under Section 302 of the MHPA. It asserts the records from the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services revealed: (1) Slaughter was committed pursuant to Section 302 of the MHPA on October 3, 2005; (2) the initial exam facility was Temple University Hospital; (3) the individual who petitioned for the commitment was Sean Lehman, M.D.; and, (4) the person committed bears the same last name, date of birth and Social Security Number as stated on Slaughter's PICS challenge form. C.R., Item # 6, Ex. A at 11-12. The PSP contends the documents also indicated the reason for the commitment was a suicide attempt: \"22YO male states he is having problems. He took a large quantity of aspirin in a suicide attempt. PT has a large aspirin level in his blood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Slaughter corroborated this information at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The PSP further maintains the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas records presented at the hearing established that Slaughter was involuntarily committed. The records indicated the Chief Medical Officer at the Temple University Hospital, Episcopal Campus, petitioned the court to extend Slaughter's treatment pursuant to Section 303 of the MHPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20. The PSP argues the request for certification states that Slaughter was already committed under Section 302 of the MHPA, and after further examination, he was found to be in need of continued treatment. The PSP asserts there could not have been a Section 303 proceeding without a prior Section 302 commitment under the MHPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Slaughter responds that the PSP did not-and cannot-prove a firearms disability under Pennsylvania law because it did not-and cannot-produce what does not\n   exist: the required certification from a physician that Slaughter was involuntarily committed. Slaughter argues that the PSP deliberately chose not to require the necessary form as part of its records. Recognizing that this failure is fatally defective to its claim that Slaughter suffers a firearms disability, Slaughter asserts, the PSP attempts to make an end-run around the law by using other documents to justify rank speculation about what happened over a decade ago. Slaughter contends this attempt fails for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, he argues the PSP asserts the wrong burden of proof. The PSP's burden of proof here is clear and convincing evidence, not a mere preponderance. Additionally, Slaughter maintains, the PSP's position is impermissible under Pennsylvania law, which requires certain specific forms and statements within those forms, and which does not permit any deviation. Further, Slaughter contends, the documents relied on by the PSP are inherently unreliable and lack credibility because they are incomplete and rife with errors and inconsistencies. Finally, he argues, permitting the PSP to impose a firearms disability on such flawed proof violates his constitutional rights to bear arms and to due process. For these reasons, Slaughter asserts this Court should affirm the ALJ's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The PSP rejoins that Slaughter's assertion that the PSP could not prove the existence of a Section 302 certification by way of extrinsic evidence is misplaced. First, Section 505 of the Administrative Agency Law allows the PSP to introduce all relevant evidence so long as it has probative value. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 505 (\"Commonwealth agencies shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence at agency hearings, and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received....\") Consistent with this statutory provision, the PSP maintains, it presented documents and testimony, all of which had probative value in determining whether Slaughter was involuntarily committed by way of a doctor's certification pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6105(c)(4). Additionally, the PSP argues, in a recent, unreported opinion, this Court acknowledged that the PSP could meet its burden of proving a prohibition under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6105(c)(4) through the use of circumstantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pa.

Specifically, our review of the documentary evidence that the PSP submitted before the ALJ reveals that Philadelphia County notified the PSP of Slaughter's involuntary commitment on a form devised by the PSP, which was submitted to the PSP by Michael Covone, Deputy Director of the Office of Mental Health. C.R., Item # 6, Ex. A at 7. The form indicates Slaughter was involuntarily committed at the Temple University Hospital, Episcopal Campus, and that Dr. Ning Herron certified the necessity of involuntary commitment pursuant to Section 6105(c)(4) of the UFA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Philadelphia County Office of Mental Health also transmitted records to the PSP indicating that a Section 302 application was filed for Slaughter based on a suicide attempt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.

That record indicates that, pursuant to Section 303 of the\n   MHPA, William Dubin, Chief Medical Officer at the Temple University Hospital, Episcopal Campus, petitioned for an extension of Slaughter's \"Current Commitment Under Section 302\" (which was set to expire on 10/8/2005).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The record states that Dubin indicated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Nathan Slaughter has acted in such manner as to cause a responsible party to believe that he/she is severally mentally disabled as specified in the attached 302 form. He/she was admitted to Episcopal Campus Temple University Hospital for involuntary emergency examination and treatment on October 3 2005 at 11:30AM under Section 302.

That record also states that, after examination, Javed Joy, M.D., attested: \"I hereby affirm that I have examined Nathan Slaughter on 10/05/2005 to determine if he/she continues to be severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment[,]\" and that the \"\n   <strong>\n    TREATMENT NEEDED\n   </strong>\n   \" was \"\n   <em>\n    Continue inpatient hospitalization for next 20 days.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 (emphasis added). Dr. Joy further stated that Slaughter \"continues to be severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Based on an examination of Slaughter, Dr. Joy made the following findings: \"Guarded, suspicious, semi cooperative, anxious at times, mood 'OK', affect blunted,-SI/HI even though status post suicide attempt,-psychosis even though doesn't want to answer most of my questions, poor insight/judgment, refusing medications[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, on a form entitled \"\n   <strong>\n    NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE A PETITION FOR EXTENDED INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT AND EXPLANATION OF RIGHTS (303)\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" Dr. Joy indicated that he also informed Slaughter that \"Episcopal Campus Temple University Hospital intends to file an application with the Court of Common Pleas\n   <em>\n    to extend your involuntary treatment for up to 20 more days.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (emphasis added).

While the PSP was unable to present a copy of the actual 302 petition or the Temple University hospital records regarding Slaughter because those records, which are older than seven years, no longer exist,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the documents the PSP presented are sufficient to satisfy its burden of showing that the record of Slaughter's disqualifying involuntary commitment was accurate. To that end, the records the\n   PSP submitted at the hearing show Slaughter was involuntarily committed for inpatient care and treatment under Section 302 of the MHPA, and an examining physician certified that inpatient care was necessary or that Slaughter was committable as required by Section 6105(c)(4) of the UFA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R., Item # 6, Ex.

The PSP contends that enforcing the Virginia court order would be contrary to a strong public policy in Pennsylvania to protect its citizens from the possession of firearms by prohibited persons. Additionally, the PSP asserts that enforcing the Virginia order would impose on the PSP a restriction for which the Virginia court lacked authority to adjudicate. The PSP maintains Pennsylvania has its own procedure for restoring an individual's right to possess firearms after an involuntary commitment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6105(f), 6111.1(g)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Section 113 of the MHPA, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7113. The PSP notes that the ALJ did not address this issue based on his determination that the PSP did not meet its burden of proving Slaughter was disqualified from owning or possessing a firearm under Section 6105(c)(4) of the UFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Slaughter counters that this Court should give full faith and credit to the Virginia court order restoring Slaughter's firearm rights because the Virginia court system fully vetted the adequacy of the disability the PSP claims exists here and found that the disability could not legally be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
