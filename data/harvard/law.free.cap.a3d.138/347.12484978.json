The defendant now appeals, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the conclusion of the defendant's trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    B. Fischer, J.,\n   </em>\n   made the following findings of fact: \"[The defendant] is thirty-four years old, he's been a firefighter for approximately ten years. He was injured at work in 2011. He injured his shoulder. He was put on restrictions of light duty for a period of time, off and on.... He did have surgery as I recall in December of ... 2011.... He did file a workers' compensation case in conjunction with his work related injury and he alleged in the summer of [2012], which is in evidence, that ... [Assistant Chief Patrick] Egan interfered inappropriately in his comp[ensation] case by going to the doctor's office.... [A]nd this court does make a finding that ... within [the claim] that his ... attorney ... then filed [with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO) ]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... [the] request for relief concerning the actions of ... Egan, the inappropriate actions, discriminating against an employee with a workers' comp [ensation] case ... [sought an award of] damages or potential awarding of damages to the defendant. The defendant in June of 2012 alleged in a twelve page affidavit, which was part of his CHRO complaint, and the complaint consists of forty-three separate paragraphs in his affidavit which goes into great detail about his allegations of racial discrimination and other discrimination imposed upon him by ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Egan and others at the ... New Haven Fire Department and the city of New Haven....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court also made the following findings of fact: \"[Corey] Bellamy has been a New Haven firefighter for ... nine or ten years. He is friends with [the defendant]. They had a good relationship. There were some phone calls ... between the two in June [2012], I don't know the extent of those phone calls but there were phone calls there. The defendant at a point in time did tell Mr. Bellamy about a pending lawsuit he has or was preparing with the assistance of his attorney against the city of New Haven, and specifically ... Egan and some others in the city of New Haven and the fire department. On August 24, 2012, Mr. Bellamy did go to the New Haven Police Department and gave a statement concerning this matter to Detective [Lynn] Meekins of the New Haven Police Department....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The statement that he gave was close in time to the events of June and July [of] 2012. The statement was given in a reliable setting, it was given in the New Haven Police Department and it was given to a police officer. And ... Bellamy should know, or would have known that giving a false statement to a police officer is a crime and he could have been arrested for a felony if it was proven that he gave a false statement to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Now, what Mr. Bellamy did when he came in front of this judge to testify in this trial is he got on the\n   stand and he raised his right hand and he told me that everything he told the police back [o]n August 24, 2012, was a lie.... [A]s far as [a] bribe or alleged bribe he indicated to this court that everything he said was a lie....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"I don't find that credible. I do find credible what he gave in his statement to the police department [o]n August 24, 2012. And what that statement indicates and I find ... is that he was present when Assistant Chief Egan asked the defendant to put gas in his truck or car, that the defendant didn't like this order from Egan, and eventually what happened shortly after that, again ... we're not good on the dates, but shortly after that the defendant offers to ... Bellamy 2 or 3 percent of [any] potential proceeds of a lawsuit to tell courts or attorneys the situation that happened with Assistant Chief Egan, and this was done on the phone. Several days after that firefighter Bellamy then goes to his supervisor ... [Faustino] Lopez, and he indicates to ... Lopez that the defendant ... offered him 2 to 3 percent that he would give to Bellamy [because] he was supposed to get a chunk of money if this lawsuit works out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"So [Bellamy] was consistent with his comments to Lopez, the phone call that he received from the defendant, and he was consistent when he told the police, in this court's opinion, his statement on August 24, 2012....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Lopez ... is friends with the defendant.... There were numerous calls in June [2012] initiated by the defendant to him in a two week period of time.... [B]ellamy reported to ... Lopez that the defendant did give-offered to give him 2 or 3 percent of proceeds of a claim against Egan and the city of New Haven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[Lopez] was a witness to an incident where ... Egan had asked the defendant ... and ... Lopez at some time at work where they were going, so Lopez was there present for that episode. [The defendant] did take some offense to that\n   inquiry by [Egan] concerning the question about where they were going. The defendant then offers Lopez the same 2 to 3 percent payout of the proceeds or payout of a claim, claimed lawsuit, or proceeds from litigation.... Lopez declines this offer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequent to that the defendant then calls up Lopez on the phone and he asks him to reconsider the 2 to 3 percent payout. Again, Lopez declines that. In late June ... Lopez [has] a brief meeting with ... Egan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"And I'm going to read from [the state's] Exhibit [2] concerning evidence that I am discussing, and I'm on page ten ... which says as follows, and ... this is Lopez' statement: 'Something coming up real soon, that was imminent, as far as a lawsuit, and maybe something was going to take place in the media and that [the defendant] wanted ... me to testify in his behalf, even after I told him that I didn't have any evidentiary value for the testimony 'cause I didn't believe he was harassed at that time. And he, that's why he approached me with the monetary percent and said, \"If you were to kind of alter your testimony I will pay you to do that.\" ' ... And on page twelve of the ... statement it goes as follows: 'He wanted to include me in that and he wanted me to testify. Once I told him I didn't believe it was that there-that there was a way that I wouldn't have anything to offer. That's when he said, well, what if I give you-what if I give you 2 or 3 percent, whatever you want of any monetary settlement I get from the case that I'm going to file, coming up pretty soon.' The detective then [asked] did he suggest to you [what] he wanted you to say, and this is Lopez' response: 'Yes, he said that he wanted me to say that he believed that\n   he was being harassed by Chief Egan, [and] that I felt that it was a direct harassment, [and] that I [didn't] really get asked those questions by Chief Egan, where I was going and what I was doing. That's what he wanted me to basically say.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"So we have testimony from two of the defendant's friends, Lopez and Bellamy, that the defendant offered a benefit to them to testify on his behalf. There is no motive or bias that either of these witnesses have against the defendant ... there's no reason that this court finds that they would fabricate the story. It's not like ... Egan came in here and said that, where there's obviously, to say the least, hard feelings between [him and the defendant].... But what we have in front of this court is two individuals with, in this court's opinion, no axe to grind, who were ... approached by the defendant on separate dates and offered the same benefit to testify in official proceedings by the defendant, again, with no axe to grind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"I don't find credible at all that [the defendant] did not offer a monetary benefit to witnesses Bellamy and Lopez.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After making these findings, the court concluded that the state had proved both that Bellamy and Lopez were witnesses in an official proceeding and that the defendant had offered each a benefit. With regard to the offer of a benefit, the court found that \"the defendant offered to both witnesses Bellamy and Lopez ... a 2 to 3 percentage share of any proceeds the defendant would receive from the defendant's\n   legal claims against the city of New Haven and ... Egan....\"\n   As to whether the state had proved that the defendant intended to influence testimony, the court found that the state had carried its burden as to Lopez only. \"[T]he defendant requested that the witness ... Lopez alter his testimony and that the defendant would pay him to do it concerning alleged harassment by ... Egan. Therefore, as to this count the court finds that the state has met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant specifically intended to influence the testimony of Mr. Lopez. So as to count two this court makes a finding of guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 1, 2014, the court denied the defendant's motion for a new trial and his motion to vacate his conviction and for a judgment of acquittal. On the same date, the court imposed a sentence of one year of imprisonment, execution suspended after nine months, and one year of conditional discharge. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. His claim is twofold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, he argues that the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied by reviewing courts of this state denies a defendant due process of law because it permits the affirmance of a conviction so long as there is \"some evidence\" supporting each element of the crime and, consequently, renders toothless the concept of reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, he argues that there was insufficient evidence in the present case to sustain the trial court's\n   findings that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that he specifically intended to influence Lopez' testimony and (2) that he offered Lopez a benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant first claims that the sufficiency of the evidence standard that reviewing courts of this state apply is too malleable to guard adequately a defendant's due process right not to be convicted except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that under the existing standard, rather than review the evidence to ensure that it proves each element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, an appellate court invariably will uphold a conviction so long as there is some evidence to support each element of that offense. He appears to argue that we should reformulate this standard to protect more adequately the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We are unpersuaded, and, in light of Supreme Court precedent binding us to the current standard, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We set forth this well-established standard as articulated by our Supreme Court. \"In [a defendant's] challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence ... [w]hether we review the findings of a trial court or the verdict of a jury, our underlying task is the same.... We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly\n   found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.... In assessing the defendant's claim that the evidence\n   against him was insufficient to establish his guilt ... we must look to the trial court's findings of fact.... [W]e give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"In evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant's innocence.... The trier [of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.... As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt ... nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier [of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal.... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier of fact's] verdict of guilty.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is sufficient if it were given with intent to influence his testimony or conduct. In the common acceptation of the term, the verb influence means to alter, move, sway, or affect....

Lopez alter his testimony and that the defendant would pay him to do it concerning alleged harassment by ... Egan.\" The court interpreted the term influence as meaning to alter. This interpretation comports with our Supreme Court's construction of the relevant statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendant also argues that there was insufficient evidence of an intent to influence because there was no evidence before the court of what Lopez was supposed to say or how it was different from the testimony he would have given.

Specifically, Lopez told Meekins that he told the defendant that he did not feel that Egan had harassed the defendant by asking Lopez where he was going when Egan saw Lopez with the defendant. Lopez stated that the defendant nonetheless wanted him to say that he thought Egan had harassed the defendant. In particular, the defendant wanted him to say that Egan normally did not ask him questions about his whereabouts or conduct and only did so because the defendant was present. The court credited Lopez' statements, noting that he had neither a motive to lie nor an \"axe to grind\" with the defendant. Indeed, the court found that after Lopez had told the defendant that he did not believe the defendant was harassed, \"the defendant requested that ... Lopez alter his testimony and that the defendant would pay him to do it....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing evidence, considered along with the record as a whole in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a reasonable fact finder could infer from Lopez' statements that the defendant sought to induce Lopez to testify more favorably than he otherwise would have testified. As the judges of our Superior Court often instruct jurors, \"[w]hether the burden of proof resting upon the state\n   is sustained depends not on the number of witnesses, nor on the quantity of the testimony, but on the nature and quality of the testimony.... [O]ne witness's testimony is sufficient to convict if it establishes all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Connecticut Criminal Jury Instructions (4th Ed.2008) \u00a7 2.2-2, available at http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/Criminal/part2/\n   2.2-2.htm (last visited March 31, 2016).

That testimony, he argues, rebutted the state's evidence that an offer took place. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant evidence presented at trial. The defendant presented the testimony of Charles Hewitt, a drill master in the fire department's training division at 230 Ella Grasso Boulevard, who testified that the defendant reported to him there for light duty during the week of June 18, 2012. According to Hewitt, the defendant was at the Ella Grasso location each day that week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Hewitt's testimony did not account completely for the defendant's whereabouts during work hours that week. Regular work hours were 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but Hewitt allowed the defendant to keep an earlier schedule and work from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Hewitt authorized the defendant's release from work on the morning of Monday, June 18, to attend his daughter's eighth grade graduation ceremony, which began at 10 a.m., and testified that the defendant reported to work at 1 or 1:30 p.m. that day. Hewitt himself was absent from work on Wednesday, June 20. Hewitt also testified that the defendant occasionally would go to physical therapy during the workday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Also, the defendant testified that he stopped by the fire marshal's office where Lopez was stationed at some point in time and that a discussion took place there in which Lopez asked him for a percentage of the proceeds from the defendant's upcoming lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The defendant argues, in essence, that Hewitt's testimony regarding the defendant's whereabouts during the week of June 18, 2012, was alibi evidence that precluded the court from reasonably concluding that the defendant made Lopez an offer. As noted, Lopez testified that\n   \"maybe the week of [June] 18\" the defendant had approached him with the offer of 2 to 3 percent of any future recovery in exchange for certain testimony.\n   Thus, the defendant contends that Hewitt's testimony was alibi evidence insofar as it was \"a rebuttal by the defendant of the state's attempt to prove that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime and committed or participated in the acts charged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In particular, the court credited Lopez' testimony\n   that the defendant had approached him with an offer of payment in exchange for altering his testimony and did not credit the defendant's denial of the same or his testimony that the purported offer was a joke. According to Lopez, the defendant approached him \"maybe the week of [June] 18.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The defendant also placed himself at the marshal's office where Lopez was stationed when he admitted\n   that he went there at some point in time and that the two joked about the potential payout from the defendant's lawsuit.

Viewing Hewitt's testimony against the backdrop of the other relevant evidence, and mindful that the state was not required to prove that the defendant made Lopez an offer at a precise time and date, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the court reasonably could find that a benefit had been offered, as Lopez testified, during the week of June 18.
