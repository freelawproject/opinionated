In his petition, the petitioner alleged that his criminal trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by failing to advise the petitioner adequately of the immigration consequences he faced by entering a guilty plea. Because the petitioner already has been deported to Jamaica, pursuant to a deportation order issued by the United States Immigration Court, and has failed to establish that any practical relief could be provided by this court, we conclude that his appeal is moot. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The petitioner is a native of Jamaica, who lawfully entered this country on January 8, 2007, on a visitor visa. He married a citizen of the United States and received permanent resident status in 2010. In 2012, the petitioner entered guilty pleas to charges of second degree assault in violation\n   of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a)(2) and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35(a). Subsequently, he brought this habeas petition alleging that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him adequately of the immigration consequences of his\n   plea. The habeas court denied his petition but granted certification to appeal, and the petitioner filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Several months after the petitioner had filed his appellate brief, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, on October 1, 2015, submitted to the Appellate Court clerk's office a letter that stated: \"The Commissioner respectfully requests that the clerk bring the following matter to the court's attention. During the pendency of this appeal, the petitioner has been deported from the United States to Jamaica pursuant to an immigration court deportation order.
