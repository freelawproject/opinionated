We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By way of an amended information dated December 18, 2013, the state charged the defendant with six offenses: as a principal in the felony murders of three individuals, namely, the victim, James Reid, and Basil Williams (counts one, two, and three, respectively), and as a principal in the kidnapping in the first degree for those same people (counts four, five, and six, respectively).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. For most of the time relevant to this case, Azibo Aquart\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   headed a criminal organization selling crack cocaine and marijuana in certain cities in southern Connecticut. As part of this operation, Azibo used certain\n   apartments at 215 Charles Street in Bridgeport, in particular using apartment 211 on the second floor to conduct transactions. Azibo considered the apartments his \"turf\" and had driven away competitors on prior occasions.\n   Azibo's enterprise involved a number of individuals in a variety of tasks. Two such confederates were Azibo's brother, Azikiwe Aquart,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Rodney Womble. Other individuals employed by Azibo included: Frankie Hodges, who sold crack cocaine out of apartment 211 at 215 Charles Street; John Taylor, who sold marijuana on Azibo's behalf in Norwalk; Lashika Johnson, the defendant's sister, who sold crack cocaine and marijuana on behalf of Azibo and, later, Azikiwe, and who was dating Azibo for much of the time relevant to this case; and the defendant, who purchased marijuana from Azibo both for personal use and to resell. A number of the individuals working for Azibo's drug enterprise either began as customers or were otherwise users of Azibo's product themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During much of August, 2005, the victim, Reid, and Williams lived in apartment 101 at 215 Charles Street. Both the victim and Reid used crack cocaine and regularly purchased it from Azibo's operation in apartment 211.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In early August, 2005, the quality of the crack cocaine that Azibo was selling in 215 Charles Street decreased substantially. At about this time, the victim stopped purchasing crack cocaine from Azibo's operation on the second floor and began selling crack cocaine out of apartment 101. As a consequence, Azibo began losing a number of customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Azibo was displeased by the victim's actions and subsequently attempted on at least two occasions to break\n   into apartment 101 with the assistance of various confederates. During one such instance, Hodges heard a knock on the door of apartment 211 in the middle of the night. Looking through the peephole, Hodges observed Azibo, who was wearing black clothing, a black bandana, and plastic gloves and motioning for Hodges to join him in the hallway. Azibo whispered to Hodges to go to the first floor and knock on the door to a specific apartment. As Hodges and Azibo headed downstairs, Hodges perceived that three people were in the second floor laundry room; although he avoided looking at the people's faces, he could see that all of them also were wearing plastic gloves. While Azibo hid in the stairwell, Hodges knocked on the door to apartment 101, but nobody came to the door. Relieved that no one had answered, Hodges informed Azibo and returned to the second floor while Azibo and the three other individuals went downstairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Taylor also was present for two of the attempts to enter the first floor apartment. In the first attempt, Taylor received a phone call from Azibo. Taking the train from Norwalk to Bridgeport, Taylor met up with Azikiwe and Azibo; at Azibo's direction, the group drove to a Walgreens store, where Azibo purchased duct tape. The three then drove to the diner near 215 Charles Street. By the time they arrived at the diner, it was dark outside. The group waited at the diner until Azibo got a phone call, at which point they went out to the parking lot. The defendant met the three men in the parking lot of the diner. He brought two bats with him, giving one to Azikiwe and retaining the other. The bats were the first weapons that Taylor observed among the four men. In the parking lot, Azibo told Taylor, Azikiwe, and the defendant that there were people selling drugs out of his building, \"[h]e had a problem\" with this, and the group was going to go in and \"confront them.\" The\n   four men voluntarily put on masks and latex gloves provided\n   by Azikiwe,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered the building, and waited down the hall while a young woman knocked on the door to apartment 101. When no one answered, Azibo, Azikiwe, and Taylor went upstairs, and the defendant left with the bats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A second attempt involving Taylor to enter apartment 101 occurred a few days after the first attempt. During the day on August 23, 2005, the defendant contacted Azibo about getting more marijuana. Azibo brought the marijuana over to the defendant and, giving the defendant two additional bags, stated that he might need a favor later. That evening, the defendant, with the assistance of Lashika and others, promoted a party at a Bridgeport club. Between approximately 1:30 to 2:30 a.m. on August 24, 2005, the group finished cleaning up and went to a restaurant in Orange. While there, Lashika received a phone call from Azibo, who asked to speak with the defendant. The defendant did not look upset after receiving this phone call. After finishing their meal, Lashika and the defendant left the restaurant in separate vehicles. Returning home, Lashika saw Azibo outside her apartment, though she did not see the defendant; after seeing Azibo, Lashika went to sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Taylor also received a phone call from Azibo and drove to Bridgeport that night, where he met up with Azibo and Azikiwe. Azikiwe drove the group to the parking lot underneath the apartments at 215 Charles Street. Exiting the car, Taylor saw the defendant walking up to them. The defendant again brought two bats with him, which were the first weapons that Taylor had observed among the four men on this occasion as well,\n   and all of the men put on latex gloves and masks provided by Azikiwe. Taking care not to be seen, the group went upstairs to apartment 101. During this period, Taylor observed that both the defendant and Azikiwe were armed with baseball bats, while Azibo had a gun. Once there, one or more members of the group forced open the door to apartment 101, and the four men entered the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Inside the apartment, Azibo instructed Taylor to stand by the living room window and to take a lookout position. Azibo and Azikiwe then proceeded to use duct tape to bind the victim and Reid in the first bedroom. While duct taping these two individuals, Azibo's gloves ripped, and he replaced them; Azikiwe similarly replaced his gloves while in the apartment. The defendant likewise participated in binding the victim's wrists and ankles to some degree. While in the apartment, Taylor also observed the defendant standing in the hallway by the bathroom near the first bedroom. Walking between the window at which he was stationed and the bedroom, Taylor saw both Azibo and Azikiwe strike the victim and Reid in the head multiple times with the baseball bats. At some point while the men were in the apartment, Williams was bound and injuries similar to those suffered by the victim and Reid were inflicted upon him. Additionally, one of the four participants inserted several screws into the doorjamb of the front door from the inside before leaving through the window. Again, Taylor did not observe the defendant being threatened\n   by, or try to stop, Azibo and Azikiwe during their time in apartment 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Eventually, the four left the apartment: Taylor and Azikiwe in one vehicle, and the defendant and Azibo in another. The defendant observed a black drill in a bag that Azibo brought with him to the car after leaving the apartment. The defendant, Azibo, and Azikiwe\n   reconvened at Lashika's apartment, where the defendant frequently stayed. Lashika was awakened by voices in her living room, two of which she was able to identify as the defendant and Azibo. Leaving her bedroom, she discovered the defendant, Azibo, and Azikiwe sitting in the living room. Azibo and Azikiwe were wearing only undershirts, shorts, and socks. Azibo asked Lashika to take the garbage bags and a black electric drill belonging to Azibo to a dumpster down the street. Lashika disposed of the bags as requested, wearing plastic gloves to move the items. When she returned, Azibo asked her to move his car and retrieve clothing for him from his apartment, which she did. Azibo, Azikiwe, and the defendant were all there when she came back from this second errand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that morning, the victim's son, Leroy Whittingham, attempted to call his mother multiple times, but was unable to reach her. At or about 10 a.m., he walked over to his mother's apartment; getting no response when he knocked on her front door, he walked around the side of the building to the window of her bedroom. Discovering the window open, Whittingham pushed the blinds aside and saw the victim and Reid. Both parties were bound in duct tape on the floor, and there was blood on the floor and ceiling. Whittingham entered the apartment and called 911 from his cell phone. An ambulance and police were dispatched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Karen O'Donnell, an emergency medical technician for American Medical Response, and her partner, Rosanna Mendoza, received the call at approximately 10:15 a.m. Driving toward the address to which they were directed, O'Donnell saw a person waving them down and pointing to the apartment building behind the diner. O'Donnell and her partner entered the building; while they were walking up the stairs toward the apartment, Whittingham kicked open the front door. Discovering the victim and Reid in the first bedroom and\n   Williams in the second bedroom, O'Donnell and her partner quickly determined that all three residents were deceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Investigators processed the apartment over the course of three days. They discovered the screws that had been affixed to the front door and door frame from inside the apartment, which would have prevented the door from being opened. Investigators also discovered various items and removed them from the apartment for further examination; these items included pieces of latex and latex gloves, samples of blood-like substances, the duct tape used to bind the head, hands, and feet of the three residents, and two plastic bags stuck together with duct tape. Additionally, after removing the duct tape binding the victim's wrists, investigators discovered a piece of latex attached to the inside of the duct tape. No weapons were recovered from the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The items collected were turned over to the state forensic laboratory, and forensic testing determined that many of the fingerprints that were discovered in the apartment or on the items seized as evidence were attributable to Azikiwe and Azibo. DNA was also extracted from the various gloves, latex fragments, and other items recovered from apartment 101, and was submitted for further testing. This testing compared DNA profiles developed from these recovered samples to profiles of\n   known samples taken from the involved parties. The profiles developed for each sample were then cross-referenced with a database, which allows the technicians to determine the frequency with which an individual within the three major population groups of Connecticut (African-American, Caucasian, or Hispanic) would be expected to be a contributor. This testing identified Azikiwe, Azibo, and the defendant as contributors to the various samples, while none of the\n   three of them or Taylor could be eliminated as a contributor to other samples.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only the defendant was a contributor to the sample of DNA taken from the latex fragment recovered from the duct tape binding the victim's wrists; each of the other known samples was eliminated. The expected frequency of a person being a contributor to that particular sample was one in seven billion individuals from the three population groups.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Frank Evangelista, associate medical examiner for the state, conducted the autopsy of the victim in August, 2005. External and internal examinations revealed profound and substantial injuries to the victim's wrist, face, skull, and brain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   These injuries, both external and internal, were consistent with blunt force trauma and would have required multiple blows. Consequently, Evangelista concluded that the victim's death had been caused by blunt head trauma inflicted by another party. The autopsies of Reid and Williams revealed that they had suffered similar injuries, which caused their deaths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A few days after August 24, 2005, the defendant went to a music concert with Lashika, Azibo, and Azikiwe, and when the defendant's sister drove him to Philadelphia a few weeks later, Azikiwe joined them. Although the defendant did not know that Azikiwe would be joining them on the trip to Philadelphia, he did not voice any reluctance about Azikiwe joining them. When Lashika eventually inquired about what happened at 215 Charles Street, the defendant responded that he\n   had not hurt or killed anyone, though he had \"roughed somebody up,\" that he had helped tie up someone, and that the group had gotten rid of the bats they had with them in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 6, 2007, the defendant was interviewed by Christopher Munger, a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), at its Bridgeport office. When asked about his involvement in the events at 215 Charles Street, the defendant changed his story multiple times. He first claimed that he had not been there for seven to nine years. When told that his DNA had been recovered from apartment 101, the defendant asked if he could \"start over.\" In his second version of events, the defendant told the agent that he had been asked by Azibo on August 23, 2005, to go up to the door and pretend to be interested in buying crack cocaine, that he got into a verbal altercation with the woman who opened the door, that during\n   this incident, he spit in her face, she slammed the door, and that he left afterward. When told that the DNA had been recovered from the latex glove fragment in the duct tape bindings, the defendant asked to start over again. This time, the defendant provided an account of his involvement that placed him in the apartment binding the victim's wrists and feet with duct tape on the day that she was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Over the course of the investigation, cell phones were seized from the defendant and Azikiwe, and investigating detectives became aware of a phone number that ultimately was attributed to Azibo. Information was obtained both from these cell phones, and from records of the associated service providers for these phones and numbers associated with Womble, Taylor, the victim, and Lashika. Analyzing this information, agents with the FBI were able to identify a number of calls during the days leading up to the murders between the phones associated with Azibo, Azikiwe, the defendant, and Taylor. In particular, this information showed that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   the phone seized from the defendant had been in contact with the phone associated with Azibo seven times on August 24, 2005, the first time being at 1:47 a.m. and the last at 5:50 a.m.; the last phone to call the phone associated with Azibo was the phone associated with Taylor; there was no contact between the phone associated with Azibo and any other phone between 5:04 and 5:43 a.m.; and the first number that the phone associated with Azibo called after 5:43 a.m. on August 24, 2005, was the phone associated with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of felony murder and kidnapping involving the victim; the jury also found the defendant not guilty as to all other charges and lesser included offenses. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Kavanewsky, J.,\n   </em>\n   sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifty years imprisonment. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts will be discussed as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, the defendant claims that the evidence did not support his convictions for felony murder or kidnapping in the first degree, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to show that he possessed the requisite intent to commit an assault or kidnapping, respectively. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant brought baseball bats to a meeting among Azibo, Azikiwe, Taylor, and the defendant, at which Azibo articulated his issues with the victim's selling drugs in his building and his intention \"to confront\" the victim. Importantly, all four participants were involved in Azibo's drug operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Subsequently, the defendant was involved in at least two attempts to enter the apartment on the first floor. Each of these attempts occurred late at night, and the group took efforts to evade detection or identification, including the use of masks and latex gloves and hiding from another resident of 215 Charles Street. During the first attempt in which both Taylor and the defendant participated, the group left when it became apparent that no one was going to answer the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, although the defendant contended that he had not seen a weapon prior to entering apartment 101, the jury heard testimony that the defendant brought baseball bats to, and was armed with, one of these bats during at least two attempts to enter apartment 101, including the attempt that ultimately resulted in the deaths of the victim, Reid, and Williams. The jury also heard testimony that the group entered apartment 101 on August 24, 2005, only after Azibo kicked down the door. The jury reasonably could have relied on this evidence of a violent entry in determining that the entry into the apartment was for the purpose of an assault. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

During this period, both the defendant and Taylor served as lookouts, with the defendant positioned outside the bedrooms in the hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Further, Taylor testified that he did not observe any of the four participants threatened or ordered to participate during either attempt, and that no one in the group tried to stop the beatings in the apartment. Lashika also testified that although she had never received a call from Azibo when he was trying to reach the defendant prior to August 24, 2005, the defendant did not look upset after getting such a call at the restaurant. She also stated that, when she inquired after the fact about what had occurred at 215 Charles Street, the defendant\n   admitted that \"he roughed somebody up\" during the incident. Although he testified that he was merely present on the night that the murders occurred and that he participated only out of fear for his own safety, the defendant also agreed with the prosecutor that he knew that \"trouble was coming\" for the residents of apartment 101 and that, based on the size of the group and the dark clothing that they were wearing, that \"[s]omething that ain't right\" was about to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Taken as a whole, the evidence demonstrates that: the defendant brought baseball bats to a meeting after dark near the 215 Charles Street apartments; at this meeting, Azibo explained to the defendant and the others in attendance that he intended \"to confront\" the victim for selling in his building; subsequent to learning this, the defendant knowingly participated in two attempts to enter apartment 101; during each attempt, the participants took considerable pains to avoid identification or interference prior to entry into the apartment; and, during the second attempt to enter the apartment, the baseball bats that the defendant brought were used to beat the victim and Reid after the defendant assisted Azibo and Azikiwe in binding the victim's wrists and while the defendant stood as a lookout in the hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In support of his contention that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had the necessary intent, the defendant notes that there is no evidence\n   that he knew, or had any particular vendetta against, the residents or that he personally committed any assaults directly on their person, which he argues weighs against a finding that he had a specific intent to commit an assault in the apartment. Neither proof of motive\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor\n   the actual commission of the intended crime on which a burglary conviction could be based\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   is required, however, to find that the defendant had the specific intent to commit an assault at the time of his unlawful entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendant further contends that merely bringing the baseball bats to apartment 101 does not prove his intent to commit an assault therein and that any reckless or negligent state of mind that could be proved is insufficient for the defendant to be liable for the crime alleged in the information. In support of these arguments, the defendant relies on two cases,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Both of these cases are distinguishable from the facts before the court, as the evidence in each case demonstrated that, although the defendant or one of his associates was armed at the time of the illegal entry into the residence, the purpose of the invasion was to deprive the residents of property. Thus, the assault that occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the entry into the residence with the weapon meant to facilitate that purpose was not enough to show that the assault was intended or planned\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the time of entry.

On December 17, 2013,\n   defense counsel submitted proposed jury instructions in court, which included an extensive charge on each element of felony murder. With respect to the third element, the defendant's proposed instructions provided in relevant part: \"The third element of felony [murder] is that the defendant or another participant caused the death of Tina Johnson (as to Count One) James Reid (as to Count Two) and Basil Williams (as to Count Three) while in the course of, and in furtherance of, the commission or attempted commission of the crime of burglary in the third degree, or, in the immediate flight from the crime. This means that as to each count, the death occurred during the commission of the burglary and in the course of carrying out its objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \" 'In the course of the commission' of the burglary means during any part of the defendant's participation in the burglary. The phrase 'in the course of the commission' is a time limitation and means conduct occurring immediately before the commission, during the commission or in the immediate flight after the commission of the burglary. Thus, the respective deaths of Tina Johnson, James Reid, and Basil Williams must have occurred somewhere within the time span of the occurrence of the facts which constitute the charged burglary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On December 18, 2013, the court stated on the record that it had e-mailed portions of its proposed charge to counsel the prior evening and that full copies of the charge were being printed for counsel to review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   At about noon, the court indicated that it would dismiss the jury until 2 p.m. and that, during this break, it would meet with counsel to discuss the full charge and provide copies to them. Subsequently, the parties met in chambers, where defense counsel attempted to articulate\n   certain objections to the court's charge, and the trial court indicated that it would hear\n   these objections on the record during the charge conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   When court reconvened later that afternoon, the court stated that it had e-mailed much of its proposed charge to counsel on December 17, 2013, that counsel had been given a full copy of the charge during the lunch recess, and that the court would make a few changes to its instructions. It then reviewed its proposed instructions with counsel and sought comments from counsel. In response to defense counsel's contention that she had only a few objections, the court noted that any objections covered by the defendant's written request to charge did not have to be restated. Consequently, defense counsel expressed concern only with the court's intention to give instructions on consciousness of guilt, which the court withdrew after closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On December 19, 2013, the court indicated on the record that it had made some changes to its felony murder charge suggested by defense counsel; the court, however, did not articulate those changes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then charged the jury. During its charge on felony murder, the court recited the statutory language of \u00a7 53a-54c\n   and charged the jury on each of the elements of felony murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Following its charge, the court inquired whether either party had any exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The prosecutor had none. Defense counsel, however, took exception to several aspects of the charge. She excepted to the court's charge on accomplice testimony. Defense counsel also excepted to the charge concerning the third element of felony murder, noting that it had included proposed language on both the \"in the course of\" and \"in furtherance of\" aspects, and that the court improperly had added the language \"in the course of carrying out its\n   objective\" to its instructions defining the former aspect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Immediately following this exception and as defense counsel was about to articulate her exception to the instructions on the affirmative defense to felony murder, the trial court indicated that it considered preserved any requested instruction contained within the defendant's submitted request to charge that had not been given as proposed, regardless of whether the deviation concerned the omission of, or an addition to, the instruction as proposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of these statements by the court, defense counsel briefly excepted to the court's instructions on the statutory defense to felony murder, duress, and kidnapping; the court then overruled the defendant's exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-16, \"[a]n appellate court shall not be bound to consider error as to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken by the party appealing immediately after the charge is delivered. Counsel taking the exception shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of exception....\" Thus, \"a party may preserve for appeal a claim that an instruction, which was proper to give, was nonetheless defective either by: (1) submitting a written request to charge covering the matter; or (2) taking an exception to the charge as given....

The record also suggests that the court made changes to the felony murder charge, but it did not explain the extent of those changes, and the partial and complete charges that the court distributed to the parties prior to this statement have not been provided to this court.

With respect to the defendant's first claim of error, the defendant contends that the court erred by including the phrase \"and in the course of carrying out its objective\" when defining how this prong could be met. With respect to the second claim of error, he argues that the court's unequivocal statement that \"the objective [of the burglary] was an assault\" took away a disputed factual issue from the jury's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"Our analysis begins with a well established standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   When reviewing the challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that\n   a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts.... [T]he test of a court's charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"It is ... constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged.... The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.... Consequently, the failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"[I]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court's instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.... The test is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.... We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.... A jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.... An instruction that fails to satisfy these requirements would violate the defendant's right to due process of law as\n   guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.... The test of a charge is whether it is correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury.... The primary purpose of the charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find to be established....

In particular, the court instructed that \"[t]he phrase, in the course of the commission, is a time limitation and means conduct occurring immediately before the commission or during the commission of the burglary....\" It also stated that the death \"must have occurred somewhere within the time span of the occurrence of the facts which constitute the burglary....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Further, under the facts of this case, there is not a reasonable possibility that any error in including this language could have misled the jury for two additional reasons. First, the phrase that the court used is expressed in the conjunctive rather than the disjunctive; therefore, under the defendant's theory that \"in the course of carrying out its objective\" requires proof comparable to \"in furtherance of\" prong, the state would be required to prove both the \"in the course of\" and the \"in furtherance of\" prong to prove the \"in the course of\" prong. Thus, the inclusion of this language does not mandate reversal, either in that its inclusion would have no effect on the outcome because proof of meeting, or failing to meet, this prong similarly would meet or fail to meet the \"in furtherance of\" prong, or, in the alternative, because it benefits the defendant by imposing a heavier\n   burden on the state than is required.

He has not presented any argument to the contrary on appeal. We also note that all of the evidence presented at trial indicates that the victim's death occurred inside apartment 101 and was committed while either the defendant or one of his associates was present. Therefore, we conclude that there is not a reasonable possibility that the inclusion of this language misled the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defendant's second claim is that, by stating unequivocally that the objective of the burglary was an assault, the trial court committed error because the determination as to what the defendant, Azibo, Azikiwe, and Taylor intended in entering the apartment is solely within the province of the jury. He claims this instruction prejudiced his defense because it removed from the jury's consideration the possibility that the purpose of the burglary was a robbery and limited the defendant's ability to persuade the jury that he lacked the\n   objective to commit an assault although he was present at the scene. We are not persuaded by this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In the present case, the court instructed the jury on the third element of felony murder, framing this element as follows: \"The third element is that the defendant or another participant caused the death of the decedent named in each count while in the course of and in furtherance of the commission of the crime of burglary. This means that the death occurred during the commission of the burglary and in the course of carrying out its objective. And that objective was an assault.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To begin, we note that the statement by the court \"that [the] objective [of the burglary] was an assault\" followed the court's reading of the amended information and the immediately preceding statements concerning the third element generally; thus, this statement would have been understood by the jury as relating the general elements of the crime to the specific allegations contained within the amended information in a manner that illustrated what the state had to prove. The risk that this statement would be perceived as an unequivocal direction to the precise purpose of the alleged burglary was also undercut by both the court's earlier instructions as to the state's general burden to prove each material element of any crime alleged and its detailed instructions on the state's specific burden to prove that the defendant committed the predicate burglary in the manner alleged by the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the particular\n   language at issue, the trial court again reminded the jury that the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each of the four elements of felony murder. Finally, with the exception of the statement at issue, which, as previously noted, is equivocal in context, there were no other definite statements by the trial court that reasonably could have compelled the jurors to believe that the court was instructing them that the objective of the burglary\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   have been an assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For these reasons, this case is distinguishable from those relied upon by the defendant.

The defendant argues\n   that the charge that the court gave provided insufficient guidance to the jury as to a key aspect of his defense. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In this case, the defendant requested the following instruction concerning the requirement that the death be in furtherance of the underlying felony: \" 'In furtherance of' the burglary means that the killing must in some way be causally connected to or as a result of the burglary, or the flight from the burglary. The state would have to prove that the deaths of Tina Johnson, James Reid, and Basil Williams were caused by the defendant or another participant in the burglary in the course of, and in furtherance of the crime of burglary. The phrase 'in furtherance of such crime' imposes the requirement of a logical nexus between the felony and the homicide. The connection between the underlying felony and homicide must be more than the mere coincidence to time and place. The nexus or connection must be one of logic or plan. This means that the felony murder statute excludes those deaths which are so far outside the plan of the felony and its execution as to be unrelated to them. In other words, a felony murder does not include any killing incidentally committed with the felony but only includes those felonies in the attempted execution of the felony of burglary. Although the homicide itself need not be in the common design, the act which results in death must be in furtherance of the unlawful purpose. In other words, the victims' deaths must have been caused in furtherance of committing the burglary and not merely incidental to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \"For instance, a murder for personal motive is an example of a death that is so far outside the ambit of the plan of the felony and its execution as to be unrelated to them. A murder for personal motive, then, is not a death 'in furtherance of' the underlying felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   At trial, the court gave the following instruction to the jury: \"In furtherance of the burglary means that the killing must be in some way causally connected to or as a result of the burglary. The actions of the defendant that caused the death of the decedent named in each count must be done to aid the burglary in some way or to further the purpose of the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \"It does not matter that the act that caused the death may have been committed unintentionally rather than with the intention to cause.

The court's remaining instructions concerning the elements of felony murder, which either are unchallenged or which we already have determined were not in error; see part II B 2 of this opinion; included a direction that, to find that the defendant participated in the crime of burglary, he must have knowingly and unlawfully entered the apartment with the specific intent of committing an assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Finally, the court instructed the jury on the defendant's affirmative defense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54c\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   on his claim of duress,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   both of which advanced the concerns of the defendant's proposed\n   instructions that he did not share the motivations of Azibo and Azikiwe in their execution of the burglary. Therefore, because the jury necessarily accepted that the defendant entered the apartment intending to commit an assault and there was evidence from multiple sources that the baseball bats that the defendant brought were likely the instruments causing the deaths of the residents, we cannot conclude that there was a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled because the act that caused the residents' death-specifically, being repeatedly struck by baseball bats\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   -would have remained within the reasonable contemplation of the participants to this burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The victim is unrelated to the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The defendant was acquitted as to the counts arising from the felony murder and kidnapping of Reid (counts two and five) and Williams (counts three and six).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Azibo is known by a number of nicknames, including \"Dee\" and \"Dready.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Like his brother, Azikiwe was known by a number of nicknames, including \"Z,\" \"Ziggy,\" and \"Ozzie.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Taylor did not observe anyone threatened, forced, or ordered to put on the gloves or masks.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    It is unclear whether the incident that Hodges observed was, in fact, the same unsuccessful attempt in which Taylor participated.

First, it corroborates Taylor's testimony that the group's entry into apartment 101 was accomplished by force, but merely changes the precise manner in which that entry was achieved. Second, in the context of appraising an accessory's liability for an assault accomplished or attempted by another, this court has held on two prior occasions that the accessory intended harm to the victim where he or she knew of the principal's motive and knew that the principal was armed, but nevertheless accompanied that principal to the victim's residence and attempted to get the victim in a favorable position for the principal to act.

It is conceivable that the evidence adduced in a particular case would be so inconclusive that without evidence of motive a judgment of acquittal might be required because the jury could not rationally find that the state had proved the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In such a case, a judgment of acquittal might be required not because motive was an element of the offense, but because evidence of motive would strengthen the state's otherwise insufficient evidence of an element of the offense, such as identification or intent.
