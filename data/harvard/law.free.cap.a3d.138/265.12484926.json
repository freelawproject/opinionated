Connor, to the trial court with direction to reconsider the defendant's competency to represent himself in light of a new standard that this court adopted in the defendant's direct appeal. Following that remand, the trial court concluded that the defendant had been competent to represent himself, and the defendant challenged that decision before the Appellate Court as an abuse of discretion. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the time of the defendant's trial, our courts were bound by federal case law that had indicated that \"a [criminal] defendant who has been found competent to stand trial as a matter of state law ... also is competent to waive the right to counsel.

While the defendant's appeal was pending, however, the United States Supreme Court clarified that individual states may adopt standards for determining whether a defendant is competent to represent himself that are more demanding than the standard used for determining whether a defendant is competent to stand trial. See\n   <em>\n    Indiana v.

[at] 825 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20A.2d%20539\">\n    661 A.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], but to permit the defendant to represent himself once it was determined that he was competent to stand trial. We therefore do not know whether Judge Espinosa would have granted the defendant's request to represent himself if she had had the authority to deny the request in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   and our holding in the present case. Consequently, the case must be remanded for a determination by the court,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa, J.,\n   </em>\n   as to whether the defendant then was competent, notwithstanding any mental disability, to conduct the trial proceedings by himself. In making this determination, the trial court, which ... is 'best able to make [such a] fine-tuned mental capacity [decision], tailored to the individualized circumstances of a particular defendant';\n   <em>\n    Indiana v. Edwards,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677287\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/164/#p177\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   554 U.S. [at] 177 [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677287\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/164/#p177\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] ; should consider any and all relevant information, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the defendant's competence to represent himself may have been affected by mental illness, by the stroke that he had suffered, and by any memory problems that he may have experienced as a result of that stroke. The court also should evaluate the extent to which the defendant may have been feigning mental problems. Because of\n   the defendant's refusal to cooperate with the various evaluation teams that had been assembled to assess his competency, it is difficult to discern whether the defendant suffered from a mental illness that, alone or in combination with his stroke, may have rendered him incompetent to represent himself. Accordingly, the trial court may seek to have the defendant examined again if it appears that such an examination would be helpful in resolving the issue presented on remand.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court noted that, if the trial court elected to do an evaluation and the defendant persisted in refusing to cooperate, \"the trial court would have no choice but to make a determination concerning the defendant's competency to represent himself at the trial that is limited generally to its recollection of the proceedings and its review of the trial transcript and arguments of counsel.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%20627\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 529 n. 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%20627\">\n    973 A.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2011, Judge Espinosa began the remand proceedings, but was elevated to the Appellate Court before they could be completed. See footnote 2 of this opinion. In September, 2011, Judge Schuman assumed responsibility for the remand proceedings. In January, 2012, Judge Espinosa executed an affidavit based on her recollections of the defendant's trial. Judge Espinosa's affidavit stated, inter alia, that the defendant had \"appeared to be engaged in every aspect\" of his trial, had \"demonstrated an understanding of the evidence presented,\" and had \"carried out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense in a manner similar to other self-represented\" parties that had appeared before her. She acknowledged that the defendant had made certain \"irrelevant\" statements, but opined that they appeared to be calculated attempts to elicit sympathy from the jury. Judge Espinosa further attested that the defendant had \"demonstrated that he was sufficiently capable of\n   carrying out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense without the assistance of counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge Schuman subsequently held two hearings. At the first hearing, Judge Schuman outlined his plan to make a determination regarding the defendant's competency to represent himself on the basis of the trial transcripts, Judge Espinosa's\n   affidavit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and oral argument from the parties. At the end of the hearing, Judge Schuman appointed counsel for the defendant because he was unresponsive. At the second hearing, the court granted defense counsel's request to admit the defendant's medical records from the Department of Correction. At no point did anyone object to Judge Schuman conducting the proceedings or to the procedure proposed by Judge Schuman to make the competency determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Judge Schuman thereafter issued a memorandum of decision in which he determined that the defendant had been competent to represent himself at the time of his trial. Judge Schuman first set forth a summary of the defendant's conduct during trial, gleaned from the trial transcripts. He then turned to the defendant's medical records and explained why he had declined to give them any weight. He noted that the medical professionals who had formed opinions about the defendant's competency to stand trial had not observed the defendant at trial and would not be helpful in assessing the legal question of whether the defendant could adequately represent himself despite any mental impairment. Finally, he set forth Judge Espinosa's observations, as reflected in her affidavit. In his analysis, Judge Schuman acknowledged that the transcripts had revealed some\n   troubling issues regarding the defendant's ability to represent himself. Nonetheless, he concluded that the most serious charges against the defendant were not readily defensible and noted Judge Espinosa's opinion that some of the defendant's actions may have been attempts to gain sympathy from the jury. In conclusion, Judge Schuman noted: \"Judge Espinosa has made the critical finding that the defendant, while lacking technical proficiency, could perform the basic tasks needed to defend himself without the assistance of counsel. That finding establishes that the defendant's performance has met the ultimate standard that applies in this context.... The court must give considerable deference to this finding because Judge Espinosa heard the trial. Reading the transcript is no substitute for the opportunity, which only Judge Espinosa had, to observe whether the defendant had a reasonable understanding of how the trial process worked, to assess whether his occasional unorthodoxy represented fumbling ineptitude or wilful strategy, and to measure just how well the defendant interacted with the jury. Based largely on Judge Espinosa's first hand assessment of the defendant's performance, the court concludes that the defendant was competent to represent himself at trial.\" (Citation omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment, claiming in his brief to that court that \"the trial court abused its discretion when it erroneously concluded that the [defendant] was competent to represent himself at trial despite his mental illness or mental incapacity.\" Specifically, the defendant argued \"that the evidence in this case ... presents a substantial basis for the [trial court] to have found that [the defendant] was incompetent to represent himself at trial.\" In support of that claim, the defendant cited the behavior and diagnoses documented in his medical records, the fact that his competency had been questioned on numerous\n   occasions prior to trial,\n   and his behavior at trial evidenced in the trial transcripts. In its brief, the state responded by contending that the evidence, particularly Judge Espinosa's affidavit, established that the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was competent to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Appellate Court reversed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the trial court \"did not conduct a meaningful hearing to evaluate retrospectively the competency of the defendant. Indeed, the indeterminate state of the record precluded the court from retrospectively determining the defendant's competency with the degree of reliability that would have accompanied a competency determination contemporaneous with the defendant's trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Appellate Court denied the state's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We then granted the state's petition for certification to appeal to this court, limited to the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1) \"Did the Appellate Court properly consider whether the trial court's remand hearing was procedurally flawed?\"; and (2) \"If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant's convictions must be vacated?\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude that the defendant did not raise the issue on which the appeal was decided, and, therefore, the Appellate Court raised it sua sponte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history relevant to our resolution of this issue. The remand hearing proceeded before Judge Schuman without the defendant or his counsel interposing any objections. Other than his medical records, admitted over the state's objection, the defendant did not attempt to introduce any new documentary evidence or witness testimony. Defense counsel acknowledged that they had sought out mental health professionals to evaluate the trial transcripts, but those professionals had indicated that they would be unable to render any kind of a significant opinion on that basis. The defendant never sought to have Judge Espinosa testify, nor did he argue that her affidavit was lacking in any way. Indeed, defense counsel argued before Judge Schuman \"that we have before us the affidavit of Judge Espinosa, on one hand, and the transcripts on the other, and in between are medical records from the Department of Correction, which I would suggest to the court ... would put to rest the idea ... whether or not\n   [the defendant] was, at the time, suffering from any mental illness.\" At the close of the hearings, in response to the state's reliance on Judge Espinosa's affidavit, defense counsel stated: \"I suppose the simplest thing for the court to do here, because [the case] was remanded specifically to Judge Espinosa for a finding, is to just ... accept her affidavit at face value and move on.\" Nonetheless, defense counsel noted that he disagreed with the conclusions that Judge Espinosa had drawn from the conduct displayed by the defendant. When Judge Schuman later asked how much deference he should give to the affidavit, defense counsel stated: \"I am under no illusion that you won't give deference at all; as I said, I disagree with it. I disagree with it heartily, but she was the judge and it was returned to her for her opinion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following Judge Schuman's decision, the defendant claimed in his brief to the Appellate Court that \"the trial court abused its discretion when it erroneously concluded that the [defendant] was competent to represent himself at trial despite his mental illness or mental incapacity.\" In support of that claim, the defendant argued \"that the evidence in this case ... presents a substantial basis for the [trial court] to have found that [the defendant] was incompetent to represent himself at trial.\" The defendant cited the information documented in his medical records, the fact that his competency had been questioned\n   on numerous occasions prior to trial, and his behavior at trial as evidenced by the trial transcripts. The defendant argued that the evidence in his case was comparable to that in\n   <em>\n    Indiana v. Edwards,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677287\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/164/#p177\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677287\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/164/#p177\">\n    554 U.S. at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677287\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/164/#p177\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   wherein the trial court had concluded that the defendant was not competent to represent himself despite his competency to stand trial. In the present case, the defendant's analysis of his claim made no reference to Judge Espinosa's affidavit; he simply acknowledged its filing and conclusion\n   in his preliminary statement of the facts and procedural history of the case. The state's responsive brief contended that the evidence, particularly Judge Espinosa's affidavit, established that the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was competent to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its opinion, the Appellate Court initially broadly framed the issue before it as whether the trial court \"improperly determined that [the defendant] was competent to represent himself....\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Connor,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20780\">\n    152 Conn.App. at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court then noted that, although such determinations ordinarily would be made at a time substantially contemporaneous with a mentally ill or incapacitated defendant's request for self-representation, that did not happen in the present case. The Appellate Court noted that retrospective (or nunc pro tunc)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   competency determinations are generally disfavored and only permissible when they are the product of a meaningful hearing.

The Appellate Court further explained: \"In the present case, by way of remanding the matter to the trial court with direction to render a nunc pro tunc competency determination, our Supreme Court implicitly determined that it was permissible for the trial court to render such a determination at that time. The implied permissibility of the nunc pro tunc competency determination, however, was predicated on the assumption that Judge Espinosa would conduct the remand proceedings, as was plainly set forth in our Supreme Court's mandate to the trial court.... Judge Espinosa, however, did not conduct the remand proceedings.... Our Supreme Court's mandate to the trial court did not\n   account for such a contingency and, consequently, in order to resolve the defendant's claim on appeal that the competency determination was improper, we must examine the basis of and grounds of Judge Schuman's determination that the defendant was competent to represent himself....\" (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.)

The court reasoned that \"[b]ecause the judges of our Superior Court do not have a collective consciousness, Judge Schuman's conclusion as to what Judge Espinosa would have done in a circumstance that she never contemplated would not have been an exercise of discretion, but a legal fiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In considering whether Judge Schuman had conducted a \"meaningful,\" and therefore permissible, retrospective competency hearing, the Appellate Court defined a meaningful hearing as one in which \"the state of the record, together with such additional evidence as may be relevant and available, permits an accurate assessment of the defendant's condition at the time of the original ... proceedings.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 804,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court explained that the \"primary object\" of its inquiry into whether the defendant had received a meaningful hearing was \"to determine whether the quantity and quality of the evidence would have permitted the court on remand to reliably reconstruct the defendant's competency at the time of trial.\" Id., at 805,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Appellate Court then proceeded to analyze whether the remand hearing had been meaningful by applying a four factor test often used by federal courts to determine whether a nunc pro tunc hearing to determine a defendant's competency to stand trial is meaningful. Id., at 804-805,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Appellate Court considered: (1) the amount of time that had elapsed between the defendant's trial and the competency determination; (2) the availability of medical evidence that was contemporaneous with the trial; (3) statements by the defendant in the trial record; and (4) the availability of individuals who were in a position to interact with the defendant before and during trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Applying this test, the court first noted that the competency determination occurred approximately six years after trial. Id., at 805,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then effectively determined that the defendant's medical records were not reliable evidence as to his competency to represent himself because they were from a time period preceding his trial, they included many illegible entries, and they contained other entries using medical terminology that could not be understood without the aid of expert testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 805-806,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court next determined that the defendant's statements at trial were \"of minimal utility without a proper understanding of [the defendant's] mental state at that time,\" which it concluded could not have been accurately assessed given the state of the contemporaneous medical evidence that was available to the court. Id., at 806-807,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Insofar as some of the defendant's statements seemed to indicate that he may have been competent to represent himself, the Appellate Court reasoned that those statements could have been the product of mental illness. Id., at 807,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Appellate Court determined that, although Judge Espinosa had\n   observed the defendant during the relevant time, her \"live testimony would have been necessary insofar as her affidavit set forth what we can characterize only as conclusory statements regarding the defendant's ability to represent himself during trial....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The court noted that Judge Espinosa's affidavit had been made without knowledge of the defendant's subsequently admitted medical records and that her ultimate opinion conflicted with her statements at trial regarding the defendant's competency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 808-809,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In balancing these factors, the Appellate Court ultimately concluded that the trial court had not conducted a meaningful hearing. Id., at 809-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   From our review of this record, it is apparent that, although the Appellate Court's initial framing of the issue-whether the trial court \"improperly determined that [the defendant] was competent to represent himself\"-was consistent with the parties' dispute at its broadest level; id., at 795,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20877\">\n    100 A.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; its decision was based on an issue that was not raised by the parties. The defendant\n   challenged the substantive basis of Judge Schuman's decision, claiming that certain evidence proved that he was not competent to represent himself. By contrast, the Appellate Court decided whether, in light of the fact that Judge Espinosa had not presided over the remand proceedings, any other trier of fact could have made a determination regarding the defendant's competency given the substantial amount of time that had passed and the state of the record. The Appellate Court effectively concluded that, although this court had approved the making of a competency determination on the basis of a review of the trial transcripts, oral argument of the parties, and Judge Espinosa's personal observations, those same considerations constituted an inadequate basis to afford the defendant a meaningful competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant never questioned Judge Schuman's ability to make a competency determination, whether because a significant amount of time had elapsed since the defendant's trial or because Judge Schuman had not presided over that trial. The defendant never claimed, either before the Appellate Court or the trial court, that the evidence was insufficient or unreliable such that Judge Schuman\n   <em>\n    could not\n   </em>\n   make a determination regarding his competency. Indeed, the defendant conceded that Judge Schuman properly could afford substantial deference to Judge Espinosa's conclusions in her affidavit, arguing only that the court should find the evidence contained in the defendant's medical records a more compelling basis to reach a contrary conclusion. The defendant did not, nor could he claim, that Judge Schuman improperly precluded him from introducing evidence relevant to his competency. Therefore, any such claims would have been waived by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In other words, the parties focused exclusively on whether the trial court properly determined that the defendant was competent to represent himself on the\n   basis of the evidence properly before it, whereas the Appellate Court analyzed as a threshold matter whether the circumstances and evidence allowed the trial court to make\n   any competency determination at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Appellate Court considered the evidence that the parties cited, it did so through the lens of whether the evidence provided the defendant with a meaningful hearing, not whether the trial court made a proper determination on the basis of that evidence. Indeed, the Appellate Court weighed this evidence against the passage of time, a consideration that neither party raised at any stage of the proceedings. We therefore are compelled to conclude that the Appellate Court decided the appeal on the basis of an issue that it raised sua sponte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of this conclusion, we turn to the question of whether the requirements for raising an unpreserved issue sua sponte were satisfied. As previously noted, we review the Appellate Court's decision as to this matter for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Blumberg,\n   </em>\n   supra, 311 Conn. at 167-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the state contends that none of the\n   <em>\n    Blumberg\n   </em>\n   requirements was satisfied, we focus on two of them: (1) whether the parties were given an opportunity to be heard on the issue; and (2) whether there was unfair prejudice to the state, the party against whom the issue was decided.

Prior to oral argument, the Appellate Court did not order the parties to file supplemental briefs on the question of whether the defendant had been given a meaningful hearing. The Appellate Court did not issue an order directing the parties to be prepared to discuss that issue at oral argument. The issue arose for the first time during the state's rebuttal argument through questions by the Appellate Court panel. The panel questioned the state, for example, on whether there had been any discussion of making Judge Espinosa available for cross-examination and whether there had been any objection to the manner in which her affidavit was received. The Appellate Court thereafter did not instruct the parties to file supplemental briefs concerning these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Blumberg\n   </em>\n   specifically phrased the requirement that a party be heard on an issue as \"an opportunity ... to be heard\n   <em>\n    by way of supplemental briefing\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)

Moreover, the Appellate Court's questions in the present case did not make clear that it intended to decide whether a retrospective competency proceeding was permissible and that it would make such a determination under a test that had not been raised in the briefs of either party. Accordingly, the Appellate Court failed to provide the state with an opportunity to be heard on the dispositive issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   If the absence of such an opportunity was the only concern in the present case, we could remand the case to the Appellate Court to afford the parties that opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. Middletown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20471\">\n    306 Conn. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20880\">\n    50 A.3d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The state also contends, however, that it was unfairly prejudiced by the fact that this issue was never raised before the trial court. The state argues that it would have proceeded differently had the defendant objected to the procedure used by Judge Schuman. Specifically, the state contends, if the defendant had objected to having any judge other than Judge Espinosa conduct the remand proceedings, it would not have objected to Judge Espinosa\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   conducting the proceedings or would have actively sought to have her do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Unfair prejudice may be found \"when a party demonstrates that it would have presented additional evidence or that it otherwise would have proceeded differently if the claim had been raised at trial.... Moreover, because it may be difficult for a party to prove definitively that it would have proceeded in a different manner and, as a result, would suffer unfair prejudice if the reviewing court were to consider the unpreserved issue, once that party makes a colorable claim of such prejudice, the burden shifts to the other party to establish that the first party will not be prejudiced by the\n   reviewing court's consideration of the issue.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Blumberg,\n   </em>\n   supra, 311 Conn. at 156-57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the present case, the state has made a colorable claim that it was unfairly prejudiced. Had the state known that it should have sought to have Judge Espinosa preside over the remand proceedings, it thereby could have alleviated the Appellate Court's concerns regarding the substance of her affidavit. General Statutes \u00a7 51-197c (f) provides a mechanism that would have allowed Judge Espinosa to preside over the remand proceedings notwithstanding her elevation to the Appellate Court. Section 51-197c (f) allows Appellate Court judges to preside over trial court matters with the permission of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when \"the public business may require it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendant has failed to advance any argument as to why the state could not have sought to have Judge Espinosa preside over the proceedings or why such an attempt would have been futile. The defendant has accordingly failed to meet his burden to overcome the presumption that the state was unfairly prejudiced. We conclude, therefore, that the Appellate Court abused its discretion by deciding the appeal on the basis of an unpreserved issue because the requirements articulated in\n   <em>\n    Blumberg\n   </em>\n   were not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the claim raised by the defendant in his appeal to that court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The charges included kidnapping in the first degree, robbery in the third degree, robbery involving an occupied motor vehicle, larceny in the third degree, and stalking in the first degree.
