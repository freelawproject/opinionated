Grine (Grine) and Magisterial District Judge (MDJ) Kelley Gillette-Walker (Gillette-Walker), (collectively, the Judges). Specifically, the trial court enjoined the County from responding to requests submitted under the Right-to-Know Law (RTKL)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for \"judicial records.\" It further directed the County to refer any requests for judicial records to the open records officer designated by the relevant judicial agency. The County argues the injunction precludes it from fulfilling its statutory duty under the RTKL. It contends the records at issue are public regardless of which agency receives the request. Upon review, we affirm the trial court's orders with modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Judges filed complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the County from responding to RTKL requests for \"judicial records\" related to their activities. The trial court sealed the pleadings and issued special injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The litigation stems from the County's response to prior RTKL requests implicating cell phone usage by members of the unified judicial system and District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller (DA Miller). As to Gillette-Walker, the request sought \"records of all telephone calls, text messages, instant messages, email ... and/or any other form of electronic communication;\" as to Grine, the request sought \"all to and from cell phone/call records[,] and to and from text messages from [DA Miller and/or an assistant DA] and [Grine].\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 85a, 87a (collectively, the \"Prior Requests\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the County paid the cellular telephone bills for the Judges' usage, and the County contracted with Verizon to provide cellular service, the requests were directed to the County Open Records Officer. The County had access to records, including invoices that contained usage of cellular phone services by the Judges (Phone Records). The Phone Records identified telephone numbers of callers and recipients of calls. The County responded to the Prior Requests without notifying the Judges or the trial court's open records officer. In granting access, the County released parts of the Judges' telephone numbers, and it created a color-coded spreadsheet that tracked cell phone usage between DA Miller and the Judges. Although the response disclosed communications occurred between DA Miller's telephone number and the Judges' numbers, the response did not reveal the content of the communications. The response also did not contain the cost of cellular services or include any dollar amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2015, the trial court consolidated the cases for a hearing on the preliminary injunctions. The County presented evidence establishing the following facts. The County contracted with Verizon for a bulk plan allowing for a reduced rate for wireless service. Under the plan, the County purchased minutes that it then distributed to various departments and individuals, including the trial court. Certain members of the judiciary, including Grine, used the County-paid plan. Gillette-Walker did not use the County-paid plan; she used her personal cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Relevant here, Grine testified regarding the Court's policy for handling RTKL requests. R.R. at 113a-14a. Any requests for records of a judicial agency are governed by Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial Administration (Pa. R.J.A.) 509.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ultimately, the trial court granted preliminary injunctive relief to the Judges. Specifically, the trial court \"enjoined [the County] from making any response to any request made pursuant to the [RTKL] for judicial records relating to [Grine or Gillette-Walker]. The [County] shall direct any request received to the [Prothonotary or the District Court Administrator] for a response.\" Notice of Appeal, (Dkt. No. 854 2015), Ex. A; Notice of Appeal, (Dkt. No. 855 C.D. 2015), Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its initial opinion, the trial court held the Judges met the criteria for a preliminary injunction. It reasoned that records relating to activities of the Judges pertain to a judicial agency. Under the separation of powers doctrine, the County lacked jurisdiction to release the Phone Records. Tr. Ct., Slip Op., 5/7/15, at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The County filed two appeals, one as to Grine and one as to Gillette-Walker. In response to the County's concise statement of the errors complained of on appeal, the trial court supplemented its opinion under Pa. R.A.P.1925(a). Therein, the trial court emphasized it \"did not pay attention to\" the County's argument that the Phone Records were \"of the [C]ounty ... and financial records and thus public records under the RTKL.\" Tr. Ct., Slip Op., 6/26/15 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court consolidated the County's two appeals as to the Judges. However, we denied the County's motion to consolidate this matter with the appeals involving records of DA Miller, docketed at Nos. 856 C.D. 2015 and 857 C.D. 2015. The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts filed a friend-of-the-court brief aligned with the Judges. After briefing and oral argument, the matter is ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the County argues the preliminary injunction precludes it from providing the County's financial records, which are public as a matter of law. Essentially, the County contends there is no violation of a clear right necessitating a preliminary injunction because the Phone Records are public financial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Judges counter that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting injunctive relief. The preliminary injunction ensures the County complies with the RTKL by directing any requests for records of the judiciary to the open records officer designated for the appropriate judicial agency. The Judges assert the Phone\n   Records reflect communications of personnel of the unified judicial system, and they are not County records. As a result, the County violated the separation of powers doctrine by exercising control over records of the judiciary and responding to the Prior Requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This consolidated appeal underscores the dilemma agencies face when a RTKL request seeks records that document an activity of more than one agency. The Phone Records document the County's payment for services as well as the Judges' use of services. The Judges do not dispute that financial records of a judicial agency are public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their concern lies with maintaining control over records of a judicial agency when they are in another branch's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

With these principles in mind, we assess the trial court's conclusion that the Judges established the prerequisites for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Clear Right\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Judges frame their right to relief in terms of compliance with the RTKL and preserving the judiciary's control over its records. In analyzing the clear right to relief element, we consider two aspects of the RTKL: (1) the substance or nature of a record; and, (2) the procedure or means of accessing a record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Record \"of\" an Agency; Substance of Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The RTKL increased access from its predecessor statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   not only as to the types of records, but also by expanding the types of agencies subject to its terms. In addition to the Commonwealth and local agencies historically subject to open records laws, the current RTKL permits access to certain records of legislative agencies and judicial agencies. The RTKL offers the most limited access to records of a judicial agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Pursuant to the RTKL, a \"judicial agency\" is defined as, \"[a] court of the Commonwealth or any other entity or office of the unified judicial system.\" Section 102 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.102. As members of the judiciary, the Judges are part of a judicial agency. By contrast, the County qualifies as a local agency under the RTKL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We hold a record qualifies as \"of\" an agency when that record \"documents a transaction or activity of the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Allegheny Cnty.

Section 305(a) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.305(a). Pursuant to the presumption of openness, Commonwealth and local agencies are required to provide access to any record to which an exemption does not apply. Section 701 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.701. Section 102 of the RTKL defines the term \"record\" broadly as:\n   <em>\n    \"Information,\n   </em>\n   regardless of physical form or characteristics,\n   <em>\n    that documents a transaction or activity of an agency\n   </em>\n   and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the agency....\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.102 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In discerning whether records qualify as records \"of\" a particular agency, we consider the subject-matter of the records.\n   <em>\n    Meguerian; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Office of Atty.

There is no legal basis for defining the limitation that way. Rather, we evaluate whether a record documents an agency's activity or operations. Here, the activity is use of cellular phone services. The Prior Requests sought records that showed the use of cellular phones by and between DA Miller and the Judges. Responsive records would include the records showing the billing and payment of invoices for cellular phone services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The County contends that as the agency that pays the invoices for the use of services, it is the sole agency whose activities are documented by responsive records. Some cases decided under the predecessor to the RTKL relate to this contention. But, after closer examination, those decisions do not control the current controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The RTKL is designed to afford greater access than its predecessor, resulting in \"a dramatic expansion of the public's access to government documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Levy v.

The City of Pittsburgh initially paid the phone bills, but the officials subsequently reimbursed the City. We held the officials' reimbursement did not negate the disbursement of public funds, which rendered the records public. Again, we held the City had a duty to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Critically, however, the County's reliance on these cases is selective. Although both cases support the proposition that an agency must disclose records documenting payment of phone bills, the County disregards that the records at issue in those cases did not reveal activities of the judiciary or any other agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, the County does not acknowledge the redactions from the records in\n   <em>\n    Bodack.\n   </em>\n   Regarding the telephone numbers contained in responsive records, the\n   <em>\n    Bodack\n   </em>\n   Court held the callers and recipients of calls had an expectation of privacy in their personal telephone numbers.

As a result, telephone numbers were properly redacted from responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   These cases teach us that records of an agency's usage of cellular phone services are financial records to the extent they contain information dealing with the disbursement of agency funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, we reject the County's argument that records showing DA Miller's use of cellular phone services constitute a financial record\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   of the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the Phone Records involve the usage of cellular phone services by the Judges. The County concedes the records document the Judges' activities in that they reveal their identities as the caller or recipient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 22. However, to some extent the Phone Records\n   also document the County's payment of Verizon invoices for service.

Separation of Powers; Procedures for Access\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The dual status of the records as documenting activities of the County and of the judicial agency is central to this dispute. The RTKL affords different levels of access to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   non-exempt records of a local agency, such as the County, but it allows access\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to financial records of a judicial agency. Adding to the complexity, the trial court enjoined the County from responding to requests for \"judicial records,\" a term which is not defined in the RTKL. For clarity\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and consistency with RTKL terminology, we recast this phrase as \"records of a judicial agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Lackawanna County CCP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We previously addressed a conflict involving a request for records to which a county and a judicial agency shared access in\n   <em>\n    Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna Cnty. v.

Ultimately, we concluded that Lackawanna County's possession of the records did not alter that the records pertained to activities of a judicial employee. Relevant here, we held \"any record produced by a judicial employee is a record of a judicial agency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289597\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/2/810/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289597\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/2/810/\">\n    at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To preserve the separation of powers, a requester was unable to access records of activities of a judicial employee by seeking the records through a county.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289597\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/2/810/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Allowing another agency to direct a judicial employee violated the separation of powers because it interfered with the judiciary's oversight and supervision of judicial employees.

Such activities are under the exclusive oversight of our Supreme Court. Following\n   <em>\n    Lackawanna County CCP,\n   </em>\n   the trial court concluded records documenting the Judges' use of cell phone services were not accessible through the County. In so doing, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The County attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Lackawanna County CCP\n   </em>\n   because that case involved the content of communications of a judicial employee, and content is not at issue here. However, our holding that records of a judicial employee are records of a judicial agency, and so beyond OOR's jurisdiction, did not depend on the\n   content of the records. Our rationale was based on the need for the judiciary to retain supervisory control over its personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Assertion of No Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Nevertheless, we consider the County's assertion that the allegedly innocuous content of the records requested is material to whether the County retains a duty of disclosure under the RTKL. In essence, because the RTKL mandates access to financial records of a judicial agency, the County contends there is no harm in the County responding to a request for financial records that are both of a judicial agency and of the County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 46 (\"Telephone billing records are financial records that are required to be disclosed under the RTKL, regardless of whether they are determined to be records 'of' the judiciary or the County.\").

Indeed, the Judges do not contest that cell phone records in the format produced by Verizon are financial records that are subject to disclosure. Still, that does not end the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Judicial agencies may review requests to discern whether the requested records qualify as financial records that are subject to disclosure. By contrast, a local agency must presume the requested record is public and respond knowing it bears the burden of proving an exemption applies. The presumption does not apply to a judicial agency until it is established that the record meets the definition for financial records. Section 305(b) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.305(b). These different approaches may lead to substantively different responses to the same RTKL request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Other provisions in the RTKL also allow an agency to exercise discretion in responding to a request. For example, Section 506(c) of the RTKL authorizes agencies to exercise their discretion \"to make any otherwise exempt record accessible for inspection and copying.\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.506(c). The RTKL precludes such discretionary disclosure only if disclosure is prohibited by another law, judicial order, or the record is privileged. When no such prohibition exists, the \"agency head\" may provide for disclosure if he or she \"determines that the public interest favoring access outweighs any individual, agency or public interest that may favor restriction of access.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890148\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/110/1076/6890148/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, an agency may release certain records or parts of records in its discretion, resulting in varied responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Also, an agency may create a record in order to ease review of requested information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 705 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.705. Further, an agency may redact protected information from a record and disclose the public portions. Section 706 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.706. These options in implementing the RTKL illustrate the importance of directing a RTKL request to a concerned agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Here, the County did not disclose its contract with Verizon for cellular phone services. It also did not disclose the pertinent pages of the 500-plus page detailed Verizon invoice corresponding to Judge Grine. Rather, it created a color-coded spreadsheet showing calls between the Judges and the DA's office. Each color corresponded to a different individual, one of the Judges or DA Miller and her staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Further, the County did not redact the Judges' telephone numbers in their entirety. It chose to release information that exceeded financial parameters of an itemized cell phone bill.\n   <em>\n    Bodack.\n   </em>\n   The records disclosed did not contain content of communications, but they also did not contain any indication of cost or other financial information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Had the Phone Records solely been records \"of\" the County, the County would have been authorized to create a record (Section 705) and selectively redact the records disclosed (Sections 706 and 506(c)). However, the Phone Records showing usage of services by the Judges are also of the judicial agency. As a result, the County misapplied the RTKL in responding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Of special significance, the RTKL also sets forth a separate appeals process for each branch of government. An appeal from a judicial agency is addressed by an appeals officer designated by the judicial agency. Section 503(b) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.503(b). As to local agencies like the County, the RTKL confers jurisdiction on appeals officers within OOR to render determinations regarding records disputes. Section 503(a) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.503(a). However, OOR lacks jurisdiction over appeals involving records of a judicial agency.\n   <em>\n    Faulk v.

Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In short, based on the options available to responding agencies, and the different procedures and presumptions that apply, the type of agency to which a RTKL request is directed matters. The County thus ignores the critical role the type of agency plays in handling RTKL requests and the resulting disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, the RTKL provides a mechanism for redirecting requests to an appropriate agency. Pursuant to Section 502(b) of the RTKL, an open records officer \"shall receive requests submitted to the agency under [the RTKL],\n   <em>\n    direct requests to\n   </em>\n   other appropriate persons within the agency or to\n   <em>\n    appropriate persons in another agency\n   </em>\n   \" when responding to RTKL requests. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.502(b) (emphasis added). The RTKL thus mandates an open records officer direct a request to another agency when records are \"of\" another agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Considering the foregoing, the Judges established a clear right to relief to ensure the judiciary retains control over records showing the activities of uniform judicial system personnel. The trial court did not err in determining the County's Open Records Officer, who knew the Phone Records pertained to the judiciary, was required to direct the request to the open records officer designated by the judicial agency for a response pursuant to Section 502(b) of the RTKL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To avoid a potential separation of powers violation, the trial court properly enjoined the County from responding to requests for records \"of\" a judicial agency. Regardless of whether responsive records are simultaneously of a county and of a judicial agency, a county must defer to the judicial agency for a response. Here, because the Phone Records document activities of judicial personnel, which was clear on the face of the Prior Requests, the RTKL mandates the County Open Records Officer direct the request to the appropriate judicial agency.\n   <em>\n    Lackawanna County CCP.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For these reasons, the trial court did not err in finding the Judges established a clear right to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The harm\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   articulated here is a violation of the statutory scheme in the RTKL and a potential violation of the separation of powers. Further, both Judges voiced concerns that the County's continued provision of access to records of their activities compromises the judiciary's record management.

The preliminary injunction properly precludes the County from continuing to jeopardize the judiciary's control over its records by responding with over-inclusive information, which may not be limited to financial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To avoid a potential separation of powers violation, the County Open Records Officer shall direct requests for records of a judicial agency to the designated open records officer for that judicial agency. Accordingly, the trial court's entry of a preliminary injunction to that effect is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The trial court's order necessitates clarification in that it requires requests for \"judicial records\" to be redirected to a judicial agency. We affirm the trial court's order with modification to replace the phrase \"judicial records\" with the phrase \"records of a judicial agency.\" We also reinforce the public status of financial records of a judicial agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Judge COHN JUBELIRER did not participate in the decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW,\n   </strong>\n   this 13th day of April, 2016, the orders of the Centre County Court of Common Pleas are hereby\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED,\n   </strong>\n   as set forth in the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Honorable Stewart Kurtz, a Senior Judge with the Huntingdon County Court of Common Pleas, specially presided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Act of February 14, 2008, P.L. 6, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101 -67.3104.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Appellate \"review of a trial court's order granting ... preliminary injunctive relief is 'highly deferential.' \"\n    <em>\n     Warehime v.
