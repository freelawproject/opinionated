The court further found that all seven grounds for termination delineated in \u00a7 17a-112 (k) existed.

The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Frazzini, J.,\n   </em>\n   heard argument on the respondent's motion and permitted the respondent to file a posthearing brief on the issue of standing. The court subsequently raised the issue of mootness and ordered both parties to provide supplemental briefing on it. It then determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness, finding that because the proceedings the respondent claimed were pending at the time of the adoption had subsequently been decided\n   adversely to her, her claim was moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The respondent claims on appeal that she has standing because the adoption has the effect, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-719, of preventing her from filing any further motions to open the termination of parental rights, and that her motion to open is not moot because the court could open the adoption and stay its enforcement pending resolution of her challenges to the termination of parental rights, or in the alternative that an exception to the mootness doctrine applies. The petitioner claims that the respondent lacks standing, and, therefore, the dismissal was proper. We conclude that the court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, but we do so on standing,\n   rather than mootness, grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion.

The definition of termination of parental rights itself states that its purpose is to cut off the legal rights of a parent so that an adoption can occur. It would be antithetical to this purpose if the adoption statutes or the statute that governs a motion to open a termination of parental rights gave the respondent rights that the termination of parental rights statute is intended to terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The respondent claims that she still has an interest in the adoption due to the potential that her motion to open the termination of parental rights could eventually be granted. The respondent's various attempts to open the termination of parental rights judgment do not make the judgment any less final. Our Supreme Court and\n   this court have previously noted this in other contexts. \"[T]he fact that the trial court has the power to open a judgment ... does not mean that the judgment is not final for purposes of appeal....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc. v.

These same principles apply here; as long as the motion to open the termination of parental rights has not been granted, the parental relationship between the child and the respondent, with all its rights and responsibilities, has been severed, and the child is free for adoption.
