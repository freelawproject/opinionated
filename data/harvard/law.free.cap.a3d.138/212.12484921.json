We conclude that the trial court should not have dismissed the appeal on the ground that the hearing officer correctly determined that the trust was an asset available to the plaintiff. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts, as found by the trial court, are relevant to this appeal. \"In 1989, John Pikula, the plaintiff's father, executed a will containing a testamentary trust for his two daughters: Dorothy McKee and the plaintiff. When John Pikula died in 1991, the trust became effective and the Probate Court appointed a trustee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The testamentary language creating the trust provided as follows: \"A. Until [the plaintiff] shall die, the [t]rustee shall pay to or spend on behalf of [the plaintiff] as much of the net income derived from this trust fund as the [t]rustee may deem advisable to provide properly for [her] maintenance and support and may incorporate any income not so distributed into the principal of the fund at the option of the [t]rustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"B. I hereby authorize and empower the [t]rustee in his sole and absolute discretion at any time and from time to time to disburse from the principal for any of the trust estates created under this [will], even to the point of completely exhausting the same, such amount as he may deem advisable to provide adequately and properly for the support and maintenance of the current income beneficiaries thereof, any expenses incurred by reason of illness and disability. In determining the amount of principal to be so disbursed, the [t]rustee\n   shall take into consideration any other income or property which such income beneficiary may have from any other source, and the [t]rustee's discretion shall be conclusive as to the advisability of any such disbursement and the same shall not be questioned by anyone. For all sums so distributed, the [t]rustee shall have full acquittance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March, 2012, the plaintiff entered a long-term care facility. At that time, she applied for financial and medical assistance under Medicaid. At the time she applied for Medicaid benefits, the trust value was approximately $169,745.91. In May, 2013, the department denied the plaintiff's application for Medicaid benefits on the ground that her assets, including the trust, exceeded the relevant asset limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff then requested a hearing to contest the department's decision. The hearing occurred in October, 2013. Thereafter, on December 20, 2013, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding the department's denial of the plaintiff's Medicaid benefits because the trust was an asset that was available to her and, therefore, her assets exceeded the regulatory limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff subsequently requested reconsideration of the decision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a (a)(1)(A). Her motion was denied. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-61 and 4-183, the plaintiff appealed from the hearing officer's decision to the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In her complaint, the plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that, under the terms of the department's policy manual and applicable case law, the trust assets are not available to the plaintiff. Specifically, the plaintiff asserted that, under the terms of the trust, the assets of the trust are not available to her because she is not entitled to receive trust principal and the trustee has sole and absolute discretion regarding trust expenditures and his decisions\n   cannot be challenged by anyone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, concluding that the hearing officer properly determined that the trust in this case was an available asset and that, therefore, the plaintiff's assets disqualified her from Medicaid eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff appealed from the trial court's judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199(c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly upheld the hearing officer's conclusion that the trust was an asset available to the plaintiff as defined by relevant Medicaid regulations. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the testator intended to create a discretionary, supplemental needs trust, the assets of which should not be considered available for Medicaid purposes. The department, however, contends that the testamentary language indicates that the\n   testator intended the trust to provide for the plaintiff's general support, in which case it would constitute an asset available to the plaintiff. We agree with the plaintiff that the testator intended to create a discretionary, supplemental needs trust and, therefore, we further agree that the trust corpus and income may not\n   be considered to be available to the plaintiff for the purpose of determining eligibility for Medicaid benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin by setting forth our applicable standard of review.

The program, which was established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act and is codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201396\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.

The federal government shares the costs of [M]edicaid with those states that elect to participate in the program, and, in return, the states are required to comply with requirements imposed by the [M]edicaid act and by the [S]ecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services....

Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-262 and 17b-10, the department has developed Connecticut's state [M]edicaid plan and has promulgated regulations that govern its administration....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The [M]edicaid act requires that a state's [M]edicaid plan make medical assistance available to qualified individuals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a)(10).

Participating states are required to provide coverage to certain groups and are given the option to extend coverage to various other groups. The line between mandatory and optional coverage primarily is drawn in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a)(10)(A) : mandatory coverage is specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a)(10)(A)(i) ; and optional coverage is set forth in subsection (a)(10)(A)(ii). In [M]edicaid parlance, individuals who qualify for [M]edicaid benefits pursuant to those subsections are referred\n   to as the categorically needy because, in general, they are eligible for financial assistance under Titles IV-A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) or XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled) of the Social Security Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Under the [M]edicaid act, states have an additional option of providing medical assistance to the medically needy-persons who ... lack the ability to pay for their medical expenses but do not qualify as categorically needy solely because their income exceeds the\n   income eligibility requirements of the applicable categorical assistance program.... The medically needy become eligible for [M]edicaid, if the state elects to cover them, by incurring medical expenses in an amount sufficient to reduce their incomes below the income eligibility level set by the state in its [M]edicaid plan.

The trust established\n   by [the testator's] will clearly recognizes the obvious incapacity of his daughters to care for themselves. As the amount held under trust, approximately one-half of his entire estate, indicates, the [testator] was a person of modest means. Presumably, the funds under the trust would not provide for general support of his daughters in an institution for much more than a few months.

Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Zeoli\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Corcoran,\n   </em>\n   this court identified and examined\n   several factors that are useful in determining whether a particular testamentary trust is intended to be a general needs trust or a supplemental needs trust-namely, the amount and nature of the trustee's discretion with regards to trust income and principal, any limitations or guiding principles within which the trustee must operate, and the factual circumstances regarding the establishment of the trust, including the amount of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With these factors in mind, we examine the language of the testamentary trust in the present case. The relevant portions of the testamentary trust in the present case provides as follows: \"I give, devise and bequeath all of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatever nature and wheresoever situated, including all property that I may acquire or become entitled to after the execution of this will to [the trustee] in trust, nevertheless ... for the benefit of ... [the plaintiff] ... and [McKee].... Said [t]rustee shall hold, manage and control all of the afore-said property as a trust estate with all of the rights and powers subject to limitations herein enumerated for the following uses and purposes:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"A. Until [the plaintiff] shall die, the [t]rustee shall pay to or spend on behalf of [the plaintiff] as much of the net income derived from this trust fund as the [t]rustee may deem advisable to provide properly for [her] maintenance and support and may incorporate any income not so distributed\n   into the principal of the fund at the option of the [t]rustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"B. I hereby authorize and empower the [t]rustee in his sole and absolute discretion at any time and from time to time to disburse from the principal for any of the trust estates created under this [will], even to the point of completely exhausting the same, such amount as he may deem advisable to provide adequately and\n   properly for the support and maintenance of the current income beneficiaries thereof, any expenses incurred by reason of illness and disability. In determining the amount of principal to be so disbursed, the [t]rustee shall take into consideration any other income or property which such income beneficiary may have from any other source, and the [t]rustee's discretion shall be conclusive as to the advisability of any such disbursement and the same shall not be questioned by anyone. For all sums so distributed, the [t]rustee shall have full acquittance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, the language set forth previously in this opinion indicates that the trustee in the present case need only use as much income from the trust \"as the [t]rustee may deem advisable\" to the plaintiff. The testamentary language further provides that any unused income may be returned to the trust principal. Although the language in the present case indicates that the trustee may use the net income for the maintenance and support of the plaintiff, the fact that the trustee is only required to use as much income as he \"may deem advisable\" to provide for such maintenance, indicates that the testator intended for the trustee to have complete discretion in determining what, if any, of the income was to be used for the plaintiff's maintenance. Furthermore, the fact that the trust provides that any unused income may be returned to the principal of the trust indicates that the testator did not intend to provide for the general needs of the plaintiff. The trust was only valued at approximately $169,745, therefore, it is unlikely that the income of the trust would have been significant enough to provide for the plaintiff's maintenance at the time the testator executed his will in 1989 or when the trust was established in 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Furthermore, the testamentary language in the present case provides that the trustee has \"sole and absolute discretion\" to make disbursements from the principal\n   of the trust. The trust further provides that the trustee's discretion \"shall be conclusive as to the advisability of any such disbursement and the same shall not be questioned by anyone.\" Furthermore, the trust provides a release from liability for the trustee regarding any distributions of principal. On the basis of the foregoing, it is clear that no person can compel the trustee to disburse any principal to the plaintiff. We conclude that the language regarding the discretion of the trustee in the present case is analogous to the language providing absolute and sole discretion to the trustee in\n   <em>\n    Zeoli.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, we examine whether the trust in the present case contains any limitations or guiding principles within which the trustee must operate. In the present case, the trust mentions \"support\" and \"maintenance\" in both the section providing for expenditure of the income and the section addressing disbursement of principal. Nevertheless, in each of these sections the \"support\" and \"maintenance\" language is followed or preceded by language allowing the trustee broad discretion to do so only if he deems it advisable. Unlike the language of the trust in\n   <em>\n    Corcoran,\n   </em>\n   nothing in the present trust mentions a standard by which the trustee shall make the expenditures or distribution. In\n   <em>\n    Corcoran,\n   </em>\n   this court relied on language that the trustees shall \"hold, manage, invest and reinvest\n   said share as a [t]rust [f]und, paying to or expending for the benefit of [the plaintiff] so much of the net income and principal of said [t]rust as the [t]rustees, in their sole discretion, shall deem proper for her health, support in reasonable comfort, best interests and welfare....\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Corcoran v.

In\n   <em>\n    Zeoli,\n   </em>\n   this court considered the fact that the testator's estate was a modest $9500 in 1975.

Indeed, the trust assets in the present case consisted mainly of the plaintiff's primary residence, the testator's home. In March, 2012, after the home was sold, the trust assets totaled $169,745.91. Much like the situation in\n   <em>\n    Zeoli,\n   </em>\n   the assets of the present trust would be quickly exhausted if they were applied to the expenses related to the plaintiff's impairment for which she has sought residential placement. Accordingly, we conclude that the factual circumstances surrounding the establishment of the trust in the present case further bolster our conclusion that it is a supplemental needs trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court improperly dismissed the plaintiff's appeal from the decision of the hearing officer determining that the trust in the present case is a general support trust and that, therefore, the assets are available to the plaintiff.

The trial court determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar the hearing officer from determining that the trust was a general needs trust for the purpose of determining the plaintiff's eligibility for Medicaid benefits. On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court improperly determined that the hearing officer was not collaterally estopped from determining that the trust was a general needs trust.
