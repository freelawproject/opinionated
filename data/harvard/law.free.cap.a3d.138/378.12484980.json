On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court erred (1) in not finding that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance, as set forth in count three of his petition, by failing to call several available alibi witnesses during the petitioner's criminal trial and (2) by sustaining certain evidentiary objections by the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner), which led to the court's granting of the commissioner's motion to dismiss counts one and two of the petition for failure to make out a prima facie case. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As recited by this court on direct appeal, the facts which the jury reasonably could have found concerning the petitioner's underlying conviction are as follows: \"On the morning of October 23, 1996, a fire occurred at a three family home located at 16 Clover Place in New Haven as a result of arson. Earlier that morning, Katherine Hutchings was walking to a store and witnessed the [petitioner] with Terrance Newton walking toward the area located between 16 and 18 Clover Place. The two men were carrying a large object with a handle that resembled a bucket or jug. Hutchings called out to the [petitioner] and Newton as they went toward the back of the houses to ask them why they were up so early. She continued walking when they did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"While walking home from the store, Hutchings heard a 'big boom,' and when she turned the corner she saw\n   that the house at 16 Clover Place was on fire. She also saw the [petitioner] and Newton on Clover Place running toward Truman Street. Newton was wearing a coat that was on fire. Hutchings saw Newton drop the coat onto the ground as he ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Edith Hunter, who lived at 18 Clover Place, also heard a loud sound that she described as 'a big boom.' Hunter ran to her front porch and saw Newton stumbling and running from the porch of the house that was on fire wearing or carrying a smoldering coat. Although Hunter did not see the [petitioner] running from the house ...\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   she saw the [petitioner] on Clover\n   Place after the fire started, but before the fire department arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"At approximately 7:45 a.m., Napoleon Gunn, an off-duty firefighter, noticed smoke coming from 16 Clover Place. Gunn shouted to a passerby to call 911 as he attempted to enter the burning house. The New Haven fire department responded to the fire immediately. There was a tremendous volume of fire, which began to ignite ... Hunter's home next door. Lieutenant James Robinson testified that the volume of the fire in such a short period of time indicated that it was the work of an arsonist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Lieutenant Thomas Heinz and two firefighters went into the burning house equipped with bottled oxygen and air masks. Heinz testified that even through his oxygen mask, he could detect a strong odor of gasoline in the house. The men made their way up to the third floor where a firefighter fell through the floor that had been weakened by the fire. He was trapped momentarily until the other firefighters eventually pulled him from the hole in the floor. The firefighters then were forced to retreat from the third floor. Heinz also testified that the use of an accelerant like gasoline increases the risk posed to firefighters because it accelerates the rate of burn, causes floors to weaken more quickly when poured onto them, and causes the flames to explode and flare when hit with water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"New Haven Fire Marshal Frank Dellamura also responded to the fire. He discovered four or five areas in 16 Clover Place where gasoline had been poured but did not ignite. Additionally, in three rooms on the first floor, Dellamura found six or seven plastic milk containers that were partially melted with scorch marks near each of them. Dellamura opined that the fire was the result of an arsonist who had attempted to cause an explosion and to burn the house down. Dellamura also opined that because the fire originated in several areas, it must have been set by more than one person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The [petitioner] was charged by information with arson in the first degree and conspiracy to commit arson in the first degree. The [petitioner] and Newton were tried together. The [petitioner] moved for a judgment of acquittal at the end of the state's case. The motion was denied, and the [petitioner] was subsequently convicted.\" (Footnote added.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal, this court affirmed the judgment of conviction.

In count two, the petitioner claimed in the alternative that his trial counsel, Michael Dolan, had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain that information concerning Hutchings' relationship with the police that could have been used to impeach her credibility. In count three, the petitioner asserted that Dolan had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present a viable alibi defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner's habeas trial began on October 1, 2010, at which time the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    T. Santos, J.,\n   </em>\n   heard the testimony of Dolan, the petitioner's uncles, Jashon Spearman (Jashon), and Stacey Spearman (Stacey), and the petitioner's cousin, Shane Hawkins. The trial was continued several times, with the testimony of the petitioner being heard on June 22, 2012, and it concluded with the testimony of the petitioner's cousin, Yvalesse\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nelson (Yvalesse), formerly Yvalesse Spearman, on July 10, 2012. Numerous exhibits were received into evidence, including transcripts from the petitioner's criminal trial, reports completed by the officials who had investigated the fire, and photographs of the\n   front and side of the residential building known as 11 and 15 Clover Place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the presentation of the petitioner's case, the commissioner made an oral motion to dismiss counts one and two pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 15-8, which the court granted. With respect to the third count alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for Dolan's failure to present an alibi defense, the court, in its memorandum of decision filed June 4, 2013, held that the petitioner had failed to satisfy either prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   test, and thus denied the habeas petition. The petitioner then filed a petition for certification to appeal from the court's judgment, which the court granted. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The petitioner's first claim on appeal is that the habeas court erred in concluding that Dolan did not render ineffective assistance of counsel despite his failure to call several available alibi witnesses whom he believed to be credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin with the standard of review applicable to this claim. \"The habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.... Historical facts constitute a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators.... Accordingly, [t]he habeas judge, as the trier of facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony....

Examining the substance of the proffered witnesses' alibi testimony, the petitioner contends that their accounts render the testimony of the primary state's witness, Hutchings, extraordinarily implausible or impossible. The commissioner counters that the habeas court's determination was legally correct because none of the proffered alibi witnesses were entirely neutral or disinterested, their accounts were contradictory in some respects, and their testimony left open the possibility that the petitioner had set the fire and run across the street to his home before the alibi witnesses first saw him in the home. The commissioner argues that because the habeas court's factual findings are not clearly erroneous, this court must uphold the habeas court's determination that Dolan's decision was not unreasonable. After our thorough review of the record, we disagree with the petitioner that the habeas court erred in finding that Dolan lacked a strategic basis sufficient to justify his failure to present any alibi testimony and, therefore, we conclude that counsel's performance was not deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin by noting that our review of an attorney's performance is especially deferential when his or her decisions are the result of relevant strategic analysis. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Michael T. v.

Our Supreme Court has clarified that in Connecticut, the crux of the alibi defense is to create a reasonable doubt as to key elements of the state's case. \"[A]lthough an alibi is sometimes spoken of as a defense, it operates, in this state, to entitle an accused\n   to an acquittal when he has so far proved his alibi that upon all the evidence a reasonable doubt of his guilt has been raised. While the state is bound to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the crime charged, including proof of the presence of the accused at the scene of the crime, where an alibi is asserted and relied upon as a defense, the accused is entitled to have the jury instructed that the evidence offered by him upon that subject is to be considered by them in connection with all the rest, in determining whether he was present, and that if a reasonable doubt upon that point exists, it is their duty to acquit.\" (Internal quotation marks\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Attorney Dolan utilized a private investigator, Daniel Blackman, a retired New Haven police officer, who interviewed eyewitnesses and potential alibi witnesses, took statements and prepared a report of his investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The potential alibi witnesses were family members of the petitioner. Attorney Dolan testified that he met with some or all of these potential alibi witnesses and found them to be credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defense strategy eventually formulated by Attorney Dolan focused on showing that Ms. Hutchings, a frequent police informant whose statement to the police was the sole link connecting the petitioner to the arson, was concocting a story to gain good will with the police and\n   obtain some financial benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial strategy did not exclude calling alibi witnesses and, therefore, Attorney Dolan filed a notice of intention to offer an alibi defense that disclosed that the petitioner was at 11 Clover Place, the Spearman residence across the street from 16 Clover Place, where the arson occurred, at the time of the alleged offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Attorney Dolan, as well as counsel for [the] codefendant, Newton, effectively utilized cross-examination to bring out and highlight inconsistencies between Ms. Hutchings' trial testimony and her written statement to the police. Attorney Dolan indicated that he did not call any of the petitioner's family members as witnesses because Ms. Hutchings had not testified well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of putting on separate versions of events (i.e., the state's versus the petitioner's), Attorney Dolan thought it more\n   prudent to hold the state to its burden of proof and attack the credibility of the sole witness linking the petitioner to the offenses. Attorney Dolan also took into consideration the good cross-examination skills of the prosecuting attorney and that the petitioner's witnesses were family members who, although he found them credible and anticipated them placing the petitioner in their residence after the fire was underway across the street, could not provide an alibi for the time period in which the fire was set and started aside from the petitioner being asleep in his room. Thus, concern for family members' [possible] bias, the very close proximity of the petitioner's residence to the crime scene, and the inability of family members to provide a firm alibi led Attorney Dolan to conclude it was strategically better to not open the door to cross-examination that highlighted the aforementioned concerns. Thus, according to Attorney Dolan, he made the decision after the state rested to not call the petitioner's family members as witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The first witness presented by the petitioner in support of his claimed alibi defense was Jashon Spearman.... Jashon Spearman testified that he was in the bathroom getting ready for work, heard an explosion, and about one minute later exited the bathroom and saw\n   the petitioner coming out of his room. The petitioner looked as though he had just woken up and was wearing clothing that one would sleep in (e.g., shorts or long johns). According to Jashon Spearman, Yvalesse Nelson was downstairs and was calling for the petitioner to move the car. Jashon Spearman testified that he saw the petitioner run to get the car keys and then go outside to move the car, which he identified as belonging to his brother, Stacey Spearman. Jashon Spearman then went to the upstairs living room window, looked outside to view the fire and later went downstairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Stacey Spearman ... was the second family member to testify before this court in support of the petitioner's claimed alibi. Stacey Spearman testified that he was in the family room located in the basement when he heard his niece, Yvalesse Nelson, yelling. He then went upstairs, saw the fire across the street and heard Yvalesse Nelson tell the petitioner to move the car. According to Stacey Spearman, he saw the petitioner come downstairs after he himself had come up from the basement. On cross-examination, Stacey Spearman indicated that he did not go upstairs for several minutes, perhaps as [many] as seven minutes, before he went to the first floor to look out the window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The next potential alibi witness was Shane Hawkins.... Hawkins testified that he was in the basement when he heard Yvalesse Nelson scream and yell that there had been an explosion and for his uncle, Stacey Spearman, to move his car. Hawkins was aware that the petitioner had used Stacey Spearman's car the night before and, because Yvalesse Nelson did not know that the petitioner had used the car the previous night and still had the keys, darted upstairs to let the petitioner know to move the car. According to Hawkins, he went up to the first floor and to the outside door, which he said was unlocked, that led upstairs to the second floor. Hawkins went upstairs and saw the petitioner, who\n   appeared sleepy, come out of his room, but did not see his uncle, Jashon Spearman. Hawkins told the petitioner that he needed to move the car. The petitioner found the keys and went downstairs, and Hawkins also went downstairs and opened the gates so that the petitioner could pull the car into the driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The petitioner testified next that he was asleep in his upstairs bedroom on the morning of the fire. According to the petitioner, at approximately 8 a.m. he heard a noise, which he described as sounding like an explosion and thought it was his television set that he had left on all night, and which prompted him to reach for the remote and turn off the television set. The petitioner heard someone yelling his name and for him to move his grandmother's car,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   which he had used the night before and thus still had the keys, and that was parked in front of the house. He then went to the window, which faced the front of the house, and saw flames coming from the house across the street. The petitioner further testified that he ran downstairs dressed in whatever he was\n   wearing at the time he jumped out of bed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   got in the car and backed it up off the street into the driveway. He then stayed on the first floor, inside, and watched the fire and the firefighting efforts with other family members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner also testified that he knew Newton's family and some of its members, but not Terrance Newton, and that he knew Katherine Hutchings from her hanging around the neighborhood.\n   As to discussions with Attorney Dolan about presenting an alibi defense, the petitioner testified that he and counsel discussed presenting an alibi defense and calling alibi witnesses, both prior to trial and after the state rested. Attorney Dolan, according to the petitioner, informed him that he was not calling alibi witnesses because he thought the state's case was weak. Lastly, the petitioner acknowledged that he had a physical relationship with a woman who had lived in the house where the fire was set and that she had problems with her roommate, who had lived at the same location, had moved out, but returned periodically to retrieve her mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"The final witness presented by the petitioner was Yvalesse Nelson.... Ms. Nelson testified that at about 7 a.m. on the day of the offense, she was getting ready for work and looked out the window. Ms. Nelson then testified that she saw 'two males carrying a box, and they were walking down the street. They were coming from Truman Street, and they looked pretty suspicious. I mean, it was seven in the morning. They were two black males with dark clothing on. They approached the house across the street. I seen them because the house is vacant. And they went up to the second floor, and I seen them pouring something around with their hands; and then all of a sudden, there was, boom, an explosion. They started running out. They ran down Clover Place onto Truman Street; and when he was running, his coat got caught on the fence.' ... Ms. Nelson indicated that she could not identify the two males and that neither was the petitioner. Ms. Nelson further testified that she went downstairs to let Stacey Spearman know that his car needed to be moved. She described a brief conversation about the car and the keys being in the petitioner's possession, which led her to go upstairs and bang on the outside door, which she indicated was locked, that led to the upstairs to\n   wake him up. The petitioner came downstairs appearing sleepy, went outside and moved the car into the gated driveway after Stacey Spearman opened the gates.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted; footnotes altered.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following the trial on the amended petition in the present case, the habeas court did not make any explicit credibility determinations or engage in an evaluation of any potential or actual bias on the part of these alibi witnesses. Rather, it stated that, even assuming that the witnesses were credible and that there was no bias whatsoever, the petitioner had not demonstrated deficient performance because \"the contradictions and inconsistencies between the various renditions of the events and activities vindicates Attorney Dolan's concerns\n   about rigorous cross-examination by an experienced and effective prosecutor. Attorney Dolan's concerns about these inconsistencies contained within the petitioner's family members' rendition of events were well founded. Their versions of events would have done little, if anything, to undermine the state's case, as none of the petitioner's alibi witnesses can account for his whereabouts, aside from presumptively being asleep in bed, while the fire was being set, leaving open the opportunity for the petitioner to have helped set the fire, run across the street and go upstairs before the explosion and ensuing fire.\" Consequently, the court \"agree[d] with Attorney Dolan's assessment that the focus of his defense efforts was better concentrated on attacking the credibility of Ms. Hutchings and showing her potential financial gain for cooperating yet again with the police. The petitioner has not shown that the testimony presented to this court would have been helpful in establishing an alibi defense sufficient to raise reasonable doubt in the jury's minds. In other words, this court concludes that Attorney Dolan's strategy and the decisions made in furtherance thereof were reasonable in light of all the circumstances.\"\n   Neither party contests that Dolan's decision was a matter of strategy made at trial, and we can adduce no basis in the record for a contrary determination. The issue presented, therefore, is whether this strategic decision was reasonable. To address this question, we must consider the choice under all the circumstances as they existed at the time that Dolan made the decision, evaluating that choice in light of the legal principles governing alibi defenses and with a strong presumption that the choice was reasonable.

Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143479\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/502/#p510\">\n    290 Conn. at 512-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=964%20A.2d%201186\">\n    964 A.2d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To address the petitioner's claim, additional facts concerning his criminal trial are necessary. At trial, the state presented numerous witnesses who testified about the fire and likely arson at 16 Clover Place on October 16, 1996. Only two witnesses, however, claimed to see anyone going into or running away from 16 Clover Place near the time of the fire. The first eyewitness, Hunter, testified that she had been making breakfast at approximately 7:45 a.m. in her first floor apartment at 18 Clover Place when she heard the explosion. Running from her kitchen to the living room and out onto the porch, she witnessed a man stumble off the porch and run past her house toward Truman Street. She yelled at him and was able to get a look at the man when he looked back; he eventually turned the corner and headed in the direction of the Truman School. She identified this man, both in a photographic array subsequent to the fire and at trial, as Newton. Although testifying that Yvalesse smiled or laughed in response to her questions soon after Hunter saw Newton run away, Hunter also stated that she did not see anyone else at 11 Clover Place when she saw Yvalesse. Further, she stated that she did not see the petitioner running off the porch or down the street with Newton, though she had been focusing on Newton, and could only affirmatively state\n   that she saw the petitioner after the fire had started when he moved a car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The second eyewitness was Hutchings. On direct examination, she testified that she needed certain items for her children and walked to a store soon after 7 a.m. Turning onto Clover Place from Truman Street, she noticed both Newton and the petitioner (whom she knew only as \"Little Man\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   carrying a big jug or bucket into the house. She crossed the street and saw\n   the two of them enter the side of 16 Clover Place. After seeing the two men, Hutchings kept walking to the store; upon discovering her intended destination was closed, she went to another store, completed her errands, and headed back along the route from which she came.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Hutchings further testified that, on her return trip, she was on Washington Avenue and about two houses from the corner where Washington Avenue meets Clover Place when she heard an explosion. Turning the corner, she saw the petitioner and Newton about two and one-half houses from the corner where she was standing and running down the street toward Truman Street. She lost track of Newton when he turned onto Morris Street and headed in the direction of the Truman School, and the petitioner when he went between two brown houses on Clover Place. She then traveled down Clover Place to Truman Street, which she took to head home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After taking her children to school, she passed by Clover Place roughly twenty minutes later, and although briefly interacting with the firefighters and police officers on the scene, she did not have a full conversation with them at that time. She also stated that she called on her neighbor, Carrie Crenshaw, and told her what she had seen. Finally, she testified, both outside of the jury's presence and once the jurors were recalled, as\n   to two allegedly threatening encounters in which the petitioner and people seemingly acting on his behalf had pulled up in front of her house and told her to mind her own business a few days before she began testifying. She also admitted that she previously had acted as an informant for a New Haven Police Department officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On cross-examination, inquiries were made by both Dolan and Newton's attorney, Lawrence Hopkins, as to several aspects of Hutchings' testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two particular aspects of the cross-examination of Hutchings merit further comment. First, in response to Dolan's questions about whether she had returned to 16 Clover Place within two weeks and seen a reward sign posted there, she responded that she had not. Second, Hutchings offered conflicting testimony concerning when and how she turned the corner from Washington Avenue onto Clover Place after hearing the explosion. During the state's direct examination and Dolan's cross-examination, her testimony suggested that she turned the corner almost immediately after the explosion and then paused there for a few minutes. In response to Hopkins' cross-examination, however, Hutchings testified that after hearing the explosion, she was stunned and waited three to four minutes before turning the corner onto\n   Clover Place, where she stopped for another few minutes while watching\n   the petitioner and Newton run away from the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Subsequent to Hutchings' testimony, the state called several such witnesses, but no other witness offered testimony as to the petitioner's location before, during, or after the fire at 16 Clover Place had started. Four witnesses, however, testified as to the timing of certain statements by Hutchings and various aspects of the investigation into, and the arrest of, the petitioner. Detective John Bashta testified that, on the day of the fire, Hutchings told him that she saw what happened and could help out with the investigation. He testified that he spoke with her again a few days after the fire, at which point she informed him that Newton and someone named \"Little Man\" had been involved in the fire, and two weeks later, when she informed him that \"Little Man\" lived on Clover Place across the street from the fire. He eventually took her official statement, and she made a positive identification of the petitioner in a photographic array in December, 1996. He clarified that, when taking the statement, he had not asked certain questions concerning which store she originally had planned to go to on the morning of the fire and whether she actually had gone inside. He also testified that reward posters were posted within one day of the fire at 16 Clover Place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dellamura testified that he was with Bashta when the latter spoke with Hutchings a few days after the fire when she implicated both Newton and the petitioner in the arson. He also stated that at some point during the investigation, he drove down a street parallel to Clover Place and observed that the petitioner's residence had a back door. Crenshaw testified that she was a neighbor and friend of Hutchings. Crenshaw affirmed that, on the date of the fire, Hutchings had stopped by her house\n   that morning and stated that she had observed the parties responsible for the fire, that one of them had a can, and that she had called out their names, though Crenshaw did not know them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, Quincy Freeman, a patrol officer with the New Haven Police Department, testified that while on patrol, he saw the petitioner. Knowing about the arrest warrant charging the petitioner with arson, Officer Freeman approached the petitioner and asked for identification. The petitioner gave a fake name, after which Officer Freeman arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After the state rested, the court considered, and denied, motions for acquittal by both defendants. Dolan called one witness, Carl Baab, who testified as to certain incidents that had occurred at the nearby Truman School on the morning of the fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With this context, we consider the petitioner's claims, examining the testimony of the habeas witnesses with the same assumption of credibility and lack of bias that the habeas court attributed to it. With respect to\n   Yvalesse, we conclude that the record demonstrates that Dolan reasonably could have decided not to call her for a variety of reasons. Her testimony appears to be inconsistent with that of Hawkins and Stacey in several important respects. Stacey asserted that he first headed upstairs from the basement to the first floor of 15 Clover Place to see what was going on after hearing Yvalesse, his niece, yelling downstairs and that he went upstairs \"to see what was going on.\" Yvalesse, on the other hand, recounted coming downstairs and having an exchange with Stacey about the car's location, and suggesting that they went upstairs together to move the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Similarly, Hawkins testified that, after hearing his cousin, Yvalesse, yelling down to Stacey about moving the car, he ran upstairs to the first floor from the basement of 15 Clover Place and out the front door, then headed upstairs to let the petitioner know that he had to move the car. Hawkins stated that he was able to get upstairs immediately because the door leading to 11 Clover Place was unlocked, as it usually was. After Hawkins told the petitioner that the car needed to be moved, the petitioner started looking for the keys as Hawkins went back downstairs to open the gate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yvalesse stated that the door remained locked until the petitioner came downstairs to move the car, and, although she mentioned that she was waking up her cousins, she did not mention seeing Hawkins during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, if Yvalesse had testified at trial, she would have been exposed to two additional types of impeachment not faced by the other alibi witnesses. First, Hunter-one of only two witnesses called at trial who\n   testified that she saw the party or parties responsible for setting the fire-testified that she saw Yvalesse outside on the porch of 15 Clover Place soon after the explosion. She stated that she yelled to Yvalesse, asking if Yvalesse had seen what had just occurred and that Yvalesse had smiled or laughed in response. Yvalesse challenged these statements in her habeas testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, a report prepared by the police during their investigation contains a statement attributed to an \"Ydalesse Spearman,\" who is listed as residing at 11 Clover Place. Although the declarant recounts seeing two men running away immediately following the fire, there is no indication in the statement that she saw either of the two men prior to the explosion. Although Yvalesse testified that several aspects of the statement were inaccurate and that she did not recall making it, she also affirmed that she gave a statement to an \"investigator\" a few days after the fire, but could not recall the name of the investigator or whom he represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Yvalesse testified that she saw two people enter the building at about the same time that Hutchings arguably would have seen them. She also, both in her testimony and in her statement taken by the police on October 29, 1996, affirmed that she saw not one, but two people running away from 16 Clover Place toward Truman Street after the explosion. Given\n   that Dolan's primary trial strategy was to discredit Hutchings' testimony, offering evidence\n   <em>\n    corroborating\n   </em>\n   a portion of Hutchings' account could have had the opposite effect. Thus, a review of the record reveals that it was not unreasonable for Dolan to decide that, on balance, Yvalesse's testimony would have hurt the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Jashon testified at the habeas trial that he was awake and preparing for work on the morning of the explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As he exited his room a minute after hearing the explosion, he saw the petitioner exiting his bedroom, looking as if he had just awakened. Jashon further testified that he heard Yvalesse yelling to the petitioner two or three minutes after the explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Hawkins testified that, hearing Yvalesse yelling downstairs about the fire, he ran upstairs to the first floor of 15 Clover Place, out of its front door, then to the front door of 11 Clover Place, and upstairs to the second floor apartment. Once inside the second floor apartment, Hawkins stated, he also saw the petitioner emerge from his bedroom, looking dressed for bed and as if he had just awoken. Hawkins testified that it took a minute or two from hearing Yvalesse yelling downstairs for him to reach the outside of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although Jashon's testimony on the morning of the fire would appear to place the defendant in his room in 11 Clover Place just after the explosion, the timing of his observations was tied directly to the loud exclamations of Yvalesse, in that he heard her yelling for the defendant to move the car in the immediate aftermath of the explosion. Therefore, although his testimony, if believed, could have raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the petitioner started the fire, it could not have done so without eliciting the flawed testimony of Yvalesse, which Dolan reasonably might have sought to keep away from the jury. Similarly, although Hawkins' testimony, if believed, might have cast doubt on the state's version of the facts, he testified that he had not heard the explosion, but ran upstairs only after hearing Yvalesse yelling downstairs. Thus, the presentation of his testimony would have made it necessary to call Yvalesse, which Dolan might reasonably have sought to avoid doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   After a thorough review of the record, including the testimony identified by the petitioner, and applying the\n   relevant legal principles governing our review, we conclude that the habeas court did not err in determining that Dolan did not provide deficient representation by not calling the defendant's relatives as alibi witnesses. The habeas court, which assumed that these relatives were credible, found substantive inconsistencies in their testimony. These inconsistencies would have been subject to, and most likely highlighted on, cross-examination. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Briggs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1950118\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/179/328/#p333\">\n    179 Conn. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20A.2d%20298\">\n    426 A.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (\"[w]here a defendant proposes an alibi as his defense, one permissible method of determining whether the alibi was fabricated is to inquire into the specific details and the surrounding circumstances of the alibi on cross-examination in an attempt to show inconsistencies in the testimony of the various alibi witnesses, since the claim of alibi is subject to searching scrutiny\"), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212696,6213012\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/912/\">\n    447 U.S. 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.%20Ct.%203000\">\n    100 S.Ct. 3000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20862\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). Thus, although another fact finder, hearing and analyzing Dolan's testimony, might have made different findings, a habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and the habeas court in this case was well within its authority to find that there were substantive testimonial inconsistencies and to accord them the weight that it did. See\n   <em>\n    Tuccio v. Zehrung,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"507087\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/172/350/#p354\">\n    172 Conn. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20A.2d%201044\">\n    374 A.2d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (\"the trier of fact is the judge of ... the\n   weight to be accorded to ... testimony, and this is true whether there is a contradiction between different witnesses or in the testimony of a single witness\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the habeas court found that Dolan reasonably was concerned about offering the alibi testimony because none of these witnesses were able to provide an alibi for the petitioner before the fire, and it was not disputed that the petitioner's house was in close proximity to, and easily accessible by the petitioner from, the site of the arson. In particular, Dolan testified that cross-examination might potentially have exposed the possibility that the petitioner \"[c]ould ... have woken up and went out the back door and returned ....\" Although the alibi witnesses testified that only the first floor apartment at 15 Clover Place was accessible by the back door and that there was no way short of going outside to get between the two apartments, there was trial testimony from multiple witnesses that the petitioner lived across the street from the site of the arson. Further, Hunter's testimony confirmed that the petitioner was in the vicinity of the fire shortly after it had begun when she saw him outside of 11 Clover Place moving a car before the fire department arrived. Each of the proposed alibi witnesses' testimony would have corroborated the evidence offered by Hunter as to the petitioner's proximity to the fire close to the time that it began. None of the proffered alibi testimony, even if believed, established that the petitioner was in bed in 11 Clover Place either sufficiently prior to, or at the precise moment when, the fire was started.

Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052625\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/107/181/#p185\">\n    107 Conn.App. at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=944%20A.2d%20429\">\n    944 A.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Vazquez' girlfriend testified that he was in bed with her at time of crime).

Consequently, the commissioner contends, \"[t]he habeas court correctly concluded that this incomplete and inconsistent testimony 'would [not] have been helpful in establishing an alibi defense sufficient to raise reasonable doubt in the jur[ors'] minds' and did not '[undermine] ... the outcome of the criminal jury trial'....\" We agree with the commissioner that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate the requisite prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   With respect to a failure to call alibi witnesses, we have refused to find prejudice when the alibi defense is contrary to considerable evidence in the record as to the petitioner's location at the relevant time.

Following a trial in which both sides called a considerable number of witnesses, Jorge Sanchez was convicted of, inter alia, murder for his participation in a gang related shooting.

Reviewing Sanchez' claim that his attorney had rendered constitutionally defective assistance by not calling two further witnesses, the court held that the strength of the state's case, the considerable and numerous problems with Sanchez' witnesses, and the intended effect of the proffered testimony-specifically, discrediting one of the three witnesses-had already been primarily accomplished at trial and that this prevented him from demonstrating the necessary prejudice. Id., at 607-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20A.3d%20954\">\n    103 A.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Addressing Sanchez' arguments that his case was similar to\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

Additionally, those witnesses were neutral, uninvolved parties who either provided their accounts contemporaneously with the crime at issue, or gave a sound and credible reason for not having done so. Here, in stark contrast, the habeas court found [the two proffered witnesses]\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   credible, a finding that is amply supported by the evidence.... Finally,\n   aside from issues of credibility, the substance and quality of the testimony offered by the two men differs significantly from that provided by the witnesses in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   : unlike the testimony in those cases, the testimony of [witnesses here] was not particularly detailed, and it did not directly concern the ultimate issues in the case, such as whether the charged crime actually occurred, whether a third party instead of the petitioner committed the crime or whether the petitioner could not have committed the crime because he was elsewhere when it occurred.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

At his habeas trial, Ayala presented two witnesses who could have testified at his criminal trial as to the nature and frequency of his habitation in the couple's residence.

On appeal, this court upheld the habeas court's determination that the two witnesses would not have aided Ayala's defense sufficiently because: the married couple had known him, had called the police, had positively identified him, had testified against him at trial, and although subject to extensive cross-examination on their own drug use, criminal activity, and prior recantation, they were believed by the jury; there was evidence that Ayala had lied to the police and attempted to disguise his appearance at the time of arrest; and the habeas testimony of the witnesses and the trial testimony of the couple was mostly\n   reconcilable.

Further, even assuming the credibility of the petitioner's alibi witnesses, the habeas court found them not to be helpful, as they provided no direct evidence of the petitioner's location prior to or when the fire began. As the habeas court was in the best position to make these determinations, we must accord them considerable weight. See\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v. Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra, 314 Conn. at 617,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20A.3d%20954\">\n    103 A.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Further, the habeas court reasonably could have concluded on the basis of the record before it that the testimony of the alibi witnesses would have, at most, a minimal negative effect on the credibility of Hutchings' trial testimony for several reasons. First, many of Hutchings' credibility problems and issues already had been placed already before the jury, in that both Dolan and Hopkins highlighted the apparent bias and inconsistencies in Hutchings' testimony. Second, the petitioner was known by Hutchings. Third, the testimony of the proposed alibi witnesses did not contradict Hutchings' testimony that she had seen the petitioner and Newton carrying a large container into 16 Clover Place about one hour before the fire began, and that she had spoken to them at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, although there was no physical evidence tying the petitioner to the arson and only one eyewitness, Hutchings, directly tied the petitioner to the arson, other evidence concerning the guilt of the petitioner, wholly unaffected by the proposed alibi testimony, was offered at both the criminal trial and the habeas trial. At the criminal trial, Hutchings testified that the petitioner had attempted to intimidate her a few days before she was to testify at his trial, and a police officer testified that the petitioner had used a false name when the officer attempted to arrest him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Evidence that an accused has taken some kind of evasive action to avoid detection for a crime, such as flight, concealment of evidence, or a false statement, is ordinarily the basis for a [jury] charge on the inference of consciousness of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

At no point did he receive any documents related to her activities as a confidential informant or information concerning her involvement in either past crimes or complaints that were later uncorroborated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Toddy then showed Dolan exhibits twenty-two through twenty-nine and asked whether he had seen the reports at issue; he testified that he had not. Following the initial objection by the commissioner, Toddy explained that each of these police reports predated the petitioner's arrest, involved situations where Hutchings either had been arrested for certain incidents or had reported crimes against third parties that were uncorroborated, and, in all of the cases, there were no records of a conviction. Her ultimate theory was that, if Dolan had this information, \"he could have inquired in such a way to show the jury in\n   support of his defense theory that the witness perhaps received consideration from the police in that she wasn't prosecuted sometimes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   On this ground, she argued, the admission of the reports was required for the court to determine whether the information that they contained was material and, therefore, either should have been provided or should have been discovered and used by Dolan to prepare his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Articulating further the grounds for his objections, the commissioner noted that these reports were irrelevant because they had nothing to do with the petitioner and involved unrelated incidents of police conduct. Explaining why the threshold issue of relevancy had not been demonstrated, he noted that one cannot inquire about past arrests that do not result in a conviction and, thus, having this extrinsic information would\n   be irrelevant because it could not be used. Arguing that the contents of the reports constituted hearsay and that parties cannot use extrinsic evidence to impeach, the commissioner contended that, regardless of whether Dolan could or could not have discovered the reports on his own, \"if he can't ask the questions based on the reports ... there can be no relevance to this case....\" After hearing the parties' arguments and expressing concerns about the relevancy of the documents, the court sustained the commissioner's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We begin by noting that, although the petitioner argues that dismissal of counts one and two for lack of a prima facie case was in error, his entire position is based on the habeas court's ruling that the reports were inadmissible because they were irrelevant. Therefore, we limit our review to the relevancy determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \"All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the constitution of the United States, the constitution of this state, the [Connecticut] Code [of Evidence] or the General Statutes.

Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (5th Ed.2014) \u00a7 6.32.3, p. 398.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The petitioner divides these reports into two categories: reports where leniency allegedly was demonstrated because Hutchings was arrested, but either no charges were filed or they were nolled (exhibits twenty-two, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine);\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   and reports where Hutchings accused another party of misdeeds and the other party apparently was not prosecuted (exhibits twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, and twenty-six).\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   These reports, which range from early 1993 to late 1995, involve alleged crimes wholly separate from those about which she testified in the petitioner's criminal trial and, with the exception of Hutchings herself, do not involve any other witness or party from the petitioner's criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although portions of the submitted reports are redacted, we note that, apart from these reports, no other evidence showing any explicit understanding or agreement with Hutchings on the part of the police or the prosecutor was offered. Further, for most, though not all, of the reports, there was also no evidence concerning any actions subsequent to the incidents in the reports that could explain the reasons why no charges were brought against Hutchings or against those people accused by her. Therefore, whatever Hutchings' subjective beliefs about the nature of her relationship might have been,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   the connection between these reports and a demonstration that she received consideration from the police is extremely tenuous. Additionally, while recognizing the discretion of a police officer generally to determine whether to take action, to warn instead of to arrest if taking action, and to determine initial charges, we note that it is prosecutors, not the police, who wield the discretion ultimately to determine\n   whether, when, and what charges to pursue.

On this record, we do not conclude that the excluded evidence likely would have produced information that was relevant to the claims before the court. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly sustained the commissioner's objection. Further, a failure to find the reports relevant to the materiality prong of the petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim in count one of his amended petition necessarily renders those reports irrelevant to demonstrating prejudice as to his\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim in count two.

We note that the petitioner does not base his appeal on these aspects of the habeas court's decision, and we refer to these two reports as exhibits twenty-three and twenty-four for the purpose of clarity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Toddy also admitted, however, that due to redacted information it was unclear in several of these reports what had transpired.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Although a subsequent habeas attorney for the petitioner raised other objections during the habeas court's consideration of the motion to dismiss at trial, the petitioner has not pursued these objections on appeal. We, therefore, consider them abandoned. See\n    <em>\n     Keating v.
