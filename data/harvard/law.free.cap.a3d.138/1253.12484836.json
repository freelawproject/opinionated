For the reasons that follow, we answer that question in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 16, 2010, Petitioner, Cynthia Keller-Bee, appeared in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Harford County pursuant to an order requiring her to show cause why she had not answered post-judgment interrogatories in an action in which judgment had been entered against her. For an unknown reason, the judgment creditor did not appear at that hearing, causing the court to dismiss the show cause order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ironically, nine months later, the judgment creditor filed a motion requesting that Petitioner be found in contempt for her alleged failure to appear at the hearing on April 16, 2010, and seeking a body attachment against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Administrative Judge for the District Court signed the body attachment. On the morning of January 27, 2011, it was executed upon Petitioner\n   and she was taken into custody. That same afternoon, Petitioner was brought before a Court Commissioner who released her on her own recognizance with the advisement that she would receive notice of a court date to address her alleged failure to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 4, 2011, Petitioner went to the District Court Clerk's Office to ask why she had been arrested and detained. Following that office's investigation, Petitioner was advised that she should not have been arrested because she had appeared at the hearing as ordered and, for that reason, she would not need to appear again in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 27, 2013, Petitioner filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a two-count complaint against the State of Maryland. The complaint alleged \"negligence and malfeasance of one or more of the State's employees in the District Court System for Harford County in presenting body attachment papers to [the Administrative Judge] for signage and issuance.\" Count I alleged that \"drafting\n   and or presenting body attachment papers to [the judge] for issuance of the same\" constituted negligence on the part of some unnamed \"employee/agent or employees/agents\" of the District Court of Maryland. Count II alleged that those same acts violated Petitioner's rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Petitioner further alleged that \"she was harmed and lost her liberty\" and \"experienced severe mental anguish, pain and suffering, loss of freedom, liberty, and/or other recoverable losses and damages associated with the violation of her rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of absolute judicial immunity. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court denied the motion. While noting that a clerk would be entitled to the defense of absolute judicial immunity if acting at the direction or under the supervision of a judge, the Circuit Court questioned whether the clerk was acting with such authority based upon the time that had elapsed between Petitioner's appearance in court and the clerk's generating the body attachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State first points out that issuance of a body attachment is a \"judicial act\" protected by judicial immunity and, as such, \" 'cannot form the basis of a recovery against the State under the Tort Claims Act.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995344\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/271/#p277\">\n    337 Md. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995344\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/271/#p277\">\n    653 A.2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The State argues that, \"because the gravamen of Ms. Keller-Bee's complaint consists of harm she claims to have suffered from [the judge's] issuance of the body attachment-a judicial act protected by judicial immunity-this suit against the State is barred by the rule recognized in\n   <em>\n    Parker.\n   </em>\n   \" It therefore follows, the State further argues, that, \"to uphold the dismissal of the complaint brought against the State based on absolute judicial immunity, this Court need not look beyond the but-for cause of Ms. Keller-Bee's injury, which was [the judge's] judicial act of issuing the body attachment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The State argues, in the alternative, that \"judicial immunity extends beyond judges to protect other individuals whose public duties are 'necessary to the proper administration of justice,' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    D'Aoust v.

According to Petitioner, that we chose not to address whether a clerk would have been entitled to immunity \"speaks volumes\" and \"would strongly suggest the clerks at issue herein were not automatically entitled to absolute immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Petitioner asserts that the unidentified clerk should be held responsible because he or she \"negligently failed to note [Petitioner's] appearance and then negligently forwarded the file to the judge's chambers for issuance.\" Petitioner also hypothesizes that, \"even after [the judge] signed the order, the clerk's office had one additional chance to catch the error but failed to do so,\" and the judge \"would have appreciated\n   the error being caught before the order went to the sheriff.\" Although implicitly acknowledging that the order would have no legal significance without the judge's signature, Petitioner argues that the clerk nevertheless had an independent responsibility to determine the merits of the request for a body attachment because \"a judge can and must rely on the employees who work with or for her or him not to allow the judge to make an obvious error in carrying out his or her duties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Petitioner's concession that it is the\n   <em>\n    judge\n   </em>\n   who made the error is fatal to her claim. We need not decide in this case whether clerical employees are entitled to absolute judicial immunity to the same extent as judges, or even whether the clerk at issue here was acting at the direction or under the supervision of a judge, because the clerk did not cause Petitioner's injury. Petitioner's complaint alleges that the erroneously-issued body attachment was \"the result of the negligence and malfeasance of one or more of the State's employees in the District Court System for Harford County in presenting body attachment papers to [the judge] for signage and issuance.\" Implicit in that allegation, however, is the acknowledgement that the judge's act of signing and issuing the body attachment was the act that caused Petitioner's injury, not whatever action by a clerk preceded the judge's signature. We agree with the State that \"the true source of Ms. Keller-Bee's grievance and injury is the issuance of the body attachment by [the judge], unquestionably 'a judicial act' subject to absolute judicial immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In short, this case begins and ends with our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   that the issuance of an arrest warrant is a judicial act that is shielded from civil liability by absolute judicial immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995344\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/271/#p277\">\n    337 Md. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995344\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/271/#p277\">\n    653 A.2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Petitioner, evidently recognizing that a suit against the judge would be unsuccessful, has attempted to shift the blame to the unidentified clerk who generated the body attachment and presented it to the judge, there is no dispute that the body attachment would not have led to Petitioner's arrest absent the judge's signature. The judge's issuance of the body attachment was\n   therefore the operative act that caused Petitioner's wrongful arrest. Because we are concerned with \"the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it,\"\n   <em>\n    Forrester,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p229\">\n    484 U.S. at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p229\">\n    108 S.Ct. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it matters not that Petitioner has chosen to bring an action against the clerk instead of the judge.
