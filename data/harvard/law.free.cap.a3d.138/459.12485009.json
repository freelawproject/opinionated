Day, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of assault of a correctional officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims on appeal that (1) his right to effective assistance of standby counsel was violated; (2) his right to due process was violated when the trial court discussed on the record a prior acquittal of the defendant in another unrelated matter; (3) the court erred in failing sua sponte to strike a question posed to him by the prosecutor on cross-examination; (4) his right to due\n   process was violated because the jury panel did not represent a fair cross section of the community; (5) his right to due process was violated when the court denied his request to use during closing argument an exhibit marked for identification only; (6) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction; (7) the court erred in failing to include in its jury instructions any reference to a Department of Correction directive concerning employee conduct; (8) the sentence imposed was vindictive; (9) he was denied his right to due process when he was not provided copies of the state's evidence until the first day of trial; and (10)\n   he was denied due process and his right to confrontation when the court ordered his standby counsel to subpoena from the Department of Correction an unedited version of a videotape only after the state had introduced as a full exhibit an edited portion of the tape. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 27, 2011, the defendant was incarcerated at Northern Correctional Institution in Somers (Northern) in cell number 221. On that day, a nursing supervisor at Northern noticed an odor coming from the defendant's cell. She noted that the defendant had a history of severe lower leg infections and had continued to refuse medication, dressing changes and medical appointments. At approximately 7:30 p.m., Captain Bryan Rae, a shift commander who had authority to transfer inmates, ordered that the defendant be moved to the infirmary. Correction Officer Michael Torkington, who was in uniform, was assigned to assist in the move; he was to provide the defendant with plastic bags so that the defendant could take his personal belongings with him to the infirmary. As Torkington opened the trap on the defendant's cell door to pass him the plastic bags, the defendant put his hand through the door and,\n   from a Styrofoam cup, flung liquid and fecal matter at Torkington, hitting him in the chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    Solomon, J.,\n   </em>\n   granted the defendant's motion to represent himself and appointed Attorney Douglas Ovian as standby counsel. Following trial, the defendant was found guilty of assault of a correction officer and sentenced to eight years incarceration consecutive to his current term of life without parole. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Several of the defendant's claims lack an adequate record for review. His claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be reviewed on direct appeal on the basis of the record before us. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

The longer video was never admitted as a full exhibit. The court, however, extended the defendant some latitude during closing argument to discuss the contents of the video. It was not improper for the court not to permit the defendant to use exhibit N for identification during closing argument. Because the DVD in question was never admitted into evidence as a full exhibit, the jury could not properly consider it in reaching its verdict. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Stuart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708163\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/113/541/#p549\">\n    113 Conn.App. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549-54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%20532\">\n    967 A.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (error to submit to jury exhibits marked for identification only), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146504,4148179,4146564\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/922/\">\n    293 Conn. 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20914\">\n    980 A.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Accordingly, the court did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights by not permitting him to show the DVD during his closing argument. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Gamble,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059757\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/119/287/#p303\">\n    119 Conn.App. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=987%20A.2d%201049\">\n    987 A.2d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (condition of defendant's hand not part of evidence; thus, not proper subject of defendant's closing argument), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303760,4304697,4303836\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/915/\">\n    295 Conn. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20867\">\n    990 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel may not, however, comment on or suggest [in closing argument] an inference from facts not in evidence.\" [Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ).\n   The defendant also claims that he did not receive the case file, specifically the security footage, until the first day of trial. He argues that the video was edited and was not the original unedited video. We have viewed the security footage, of more than twenty hours, in its entirety. It depicted: from approximately 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. on May 27, 2011, the west south side of Northern, which contained the defendant's cell; from approximately 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. on May 27, 2011, the medical cell in which the defendant was placed; and from approximately 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. the same medical cell on May 29, 2011. We cannot discern how seeing this footage of the hours before and after the incident could have materially assisted in preparing the defense, and thus conclude that the defendant suffered no prejudice by being provided the footage of the hours surrounding the incident at the time of trial rather than prior to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant's claim that his due process rights were violated when the court mentioned a prior acquittal of him that occurred in a previous, unrelated matter is unpreserved, and the defendant has not demonstrated a violation of a constitutional right. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Elson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20726\">\n    311 Conn. 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20A.3d%20862\">\n    91 A.3d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (affirmative request in main brief for\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   review of unpreserved claim not required as long as record is adequate for review and defendant demonstrates violation of fundamental constitutional right). The record nevertheless reveals that the prior acquittal was mentioned only outside the presence of the jury and for the purpose of assessing\n   his ability to represent himself in light of his past experience with self-representation, which resulted, in that instance, in acquittal. The defendant has not established\n   a cognizable due process violation. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Tatum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523965\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/721/#p742\">\n    219 Conn. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%20322\">\n    595 A.2d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (due process right to fair trial not violated where court's comments at issue occurred outside presence of jury because \"any misconduct that occurred outside the presence of the jury could not possibly have had an impact on its verdict\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant further argues that during cross-examination, the prosecutor asked him an improper question regarding his prior acquittal and that the court erred in failing sua sponte to strike the question. During direct examination, the defendant opened the door by testifying that in his twenty-three years in jail this was \"the first time I've ever come to court on this type of charge.\" The court permitted the prosecutor to conduct a limited inquiry as to the defendant's history regarding prior threats and assaults and, on cross-examination, the prosecutor did so. The prosecutor asked the defendant if he had been punished for assaults or threats on certain dates. On redirect, the defendant explained the incidents in some detail. The question\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the defendant claims to have been improper, was never asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because Torkington was not acting in the performance of his duties, and Torkington had been without authority to order the defendant to be moved to the infirmary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury\n   reasonably could have found that Torkington was acting in the performance of his duties on the basis of testimony that Torkington was on duty and in uniform and that Captain Rae, who had authority to transfer inmates, made the decision to have the defendant moved to the infirmary and gave Torkington the task of providing the defendant with plastic bags so that the defendant could take his personal belongings with him to the infirmary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We have reviewed the defendant's claim that the sentence imposed was vindictive and we find it to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a)(5) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of assault of public safety ... personnel when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable ... employee of the Department of Correction ... from performing his or her duties, and while such ... employee ... is acting in the performance of his or her duties ...
