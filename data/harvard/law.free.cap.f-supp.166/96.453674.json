The statutory court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The proceeding is filed under Sections 1336, 1398, 2321, 2322 and 2323 of the United States Code, Title 28, which provides, inter alia, for suits to enjoin, set aside, annul, and suspend orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It \u25a0came on to be heard before a specially constituted court, pursuant to provisions of Title 28 U.S.C.A. Sections 2284 and 2321-2325.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The complainant asks for the setting aside and enjoining the enforcement of an order of the Commission, entered March 20,1958, in which the Commission dismissed the complaint in a proceeding before it, Docket No. 31264, Koppers Company, Inc., The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., et al., 301 I.C.C. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">No material issues of fact have been raised by the pleadings, and the original parties and all intervening defendants have filed Motions for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">We find that the statutory court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this suit, that the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $3,000 exclusive of interest and costs, and that venue is properly laid because the plaintiff, Koppers Company, Inc., has its principal offices within this district. 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1398.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Motions for Summary Judgment presented by the complainant, respondent and intervening defendants have been heard through extended arguments, and briefs have been submitted by counsel for all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-18\">Whenever a charge is made before the Commission that varying proportional rates constitute an \u201cunjust discrimination\u201d or \u201cundue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage\u201d within the respective meanings of Sections 2 and 3(1), the burden is on the complainant to es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tablish, if he is alleging a violation of Section 2, that the railroad is charging him a greater compensation for doing (1) a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of (2) a like kind of traffic (3) under substantially similar circumstances and conditions. Similarly, if a violation of Section 3(1)'is charged, the burden is on the complainant to establish also that the railroad is subjecting him to an undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The facts are not in substantial dispute and may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Koppers owns and operates a merchant coke plant at Kearny, New Jersey, hereinafter referred to as the New York Seaboard. One of its competitors, the Connecticut Coke Company, owns and operates a merchant coke plant at New Haven, Connecticut hereinafter referred to as the New England Seaboard. Coal is the basic raw material which is converted into coke and other products at these plants. Both of these companies acquire their coal from the same southern mines and transport said coal over the same southern railroads to Hampton Roads. This rail transportation is regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission under 49 U.S.C.A. See.. 1(1) (a). The coal is then trans-shipped by water carriers from Hampton Roads to the New York and New England Seaboards. The water transportation is not subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 49 U.S.C.A. Sect. 903(b). The service which the southern railroads perform with regard to this coal is identical between southern mines and Hampton Roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The coal is billed from the mines to Hampton Roads to Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates. Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates not only pay the coal producers for the coal, but also the railroad charges. Contractual understandings exist between Koppers, its competitors and Eastern whereby Eastern sells the coal on both the New York and New England Seaboards. Eastern directs the railroads to dump the coal into colliers owned by a subsidiary of Eastern and uses the same ocean-going facilities whether the destination of the coal is the New York Seaboard or New England Seaboard. Although Koppers and its competitors do not pay the railroad charges or the cost of the coal, or the payment of the water transportation charges directly to those performing the services or producing the commodity, each of the consignees on either the New York or New England Seaboard absorb said charges and costs paid or furnished by Eastern or its subsidiary to the competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Prior to May 2, 1952, the rates charged; the plaintiff and its New Haven competitor for the southern mines-Hampton Roads transportation of the coal was the same. Since May 2, 1952, with the permission of the Commission, the railroads, have been charging Koppers twenty cents per ton more for the southern-mines-Hampton Roads transportation of coal destined for the New York Seaboard than they have been charging the Connecticut Coke Company as to coal destined for the New England Seaboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The plaintiff contends the rates permitted by the Commission are illegal and discriminatory on two separate and distinct legal theories:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">1. They are illegal under Section <em>2 </em>because they impose a higher rate on complainant Koppers than they impose upon their competitors for the same rail service. That the commission in allowing this differential bottomed its decision upon impermissable grounds; the different ultimate destinations, and commercial and competitive circumstances affecting the movement of the traffic after\" it leaves the terminal at Hampton Roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">2. The rate is illegal under Section 3(1) because it causes plaintiff an undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage by the higher rate it charges above the rate of its competitors and, in particular, above the rate of the Connecticut Coke Company, which higher-rate has lost complainant business and has caused it to suffer a loss of profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">The defendants and intervenor defendants contend:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>1. The Interstate Commerce Commission has long recognized the lawfulness of varying proportional rates and the essential role which such rates perform in the nation\u2019s rate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">2. The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held that proportional rates which vary depending upon circumstances or origin, destination, competition and commerce are not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">3. Proportional rates which vary depending upon the origin or destination of traffic are integral parts of the rate structure at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">4. Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the varying proportional rates here in issue violate Section 3(1) of the Act is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">5. Varying proportional rates, such as those here involved, are a necessary instrument of the national transportation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Under either of these two sections issues of fact are presented for the determination of the Interstate Commerce Commission. If the Commission find that, in light of all the circumstances and conditions surrounding the transportation, there is no violation of these sections, and if its findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole and furnish a rational basis for its conclusion, then the Commission\u2019s determination is unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The proportional rates which provide a 20% per ton lower charge for the movement of southern coal ultimately destined to New England Seaboard than for that destined to New York Seaboard resulted from the authority of the Commission. Ex parte 175, Increased Freight Rates, 284 I.C.C. 589, dated April 11, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The Sections of the Act involved contemplate that there shall be a tribunal capable of determining whether in given cases the services rendered are like and contemporaneous, whether the respective traffic is of a like kind, and whether the transportation is under substantially similar circumstances and conditions. Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. I. C. C., 162 U.S. 197, 213, 218, 219, 16 S.Ct. 666, 40 L.Ed. 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The Interstate Commerce Act does not attempt to define an unlawful discrimination with mathematical precision. Instead, different treatment for similar transportation services is made an unlawful discrimination when undue, unjust, unfair, and unreasonable. The courts have always recognized that Congress intended to commit to the Commission the determination by application of an informed judgment to existing facts, of the existence of forbidden preferences, advantages and discrimination. United States v. Chicago Heights Trucking Co., 310 U.S. 344, 352, 353, 60 S.Ct. 931, 84 L.Ed. 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">Under the provisions of the Act in question, which provides that charges must be reasonable, that discrimination must not be unjust, and that preference or advantage to any person, firm, corporation or locality must not be undue or unreasonable, it is necessarily implied that strict uniformity is not to be enforced; but that all circumstances and conditions which reasonable men would regard as affecting the welfare of the carrying companies, and of the producers, shippers and consumers, should be considered by the tribunal authorized and empowered to carry into effect and enforce the provisions of the Act. Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. I. C. C., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">A violation of Sections 2 and 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act is not established by proof that the rail rate for transporting like commodities between identical points varies depending on the primary origins or ultimate destinations of the commodities since rate variations under such circumstances are not per se illegal, but, on the contrary, are characteristic of the rail rate structure. It is not necessarily unlawful to charge different rail rates, depending on the primary origins or ultimate destinations of the traffic, for performing the same physical transportation in moving like commodities between identical points. I. C. C. v. Inland Waterways Corp., 319 U.S. 671, 63 S.Ct. 1296, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>L.Ed. 1655; John J. Serry v. Southern Pacific Co., 18 I.C.C. 554, 556 (1910); Erickson Co. v. C., M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co., 29 I.C.C. 414, 416 (1914); Scott-Mayer Commission Co. v. C.R.I. and P. Ry. Co., 28 I.C.C. 529 (1913); Export Rates on Grain and Grain Products, 31 I.C.C. 616, 619 (1914); State of Iowa v. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., 46 I.C.C. 595, 599 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On the contrary, the burden is on the complainant, Koppers, to prove that in light of all the circumstances attendant on the entire transportation involved in each instance \u2014 not simply the segment of the hauls for which the proportional rates are fixed \u2014 the rate variations constitute an unjust discrimination (Section 2) or undue prejudice (Section 3(1). State of Iowa v. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Although the court is not bound by the construction placed on the Act by the Interstate Commerce Commission, where the construction is not doubtful, a definitely settled administrative construction is entitled to the highest respect; and, where acted on for a number of years, such construction will not be disturbed except for cogent reasons. United States v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 278 U.S. 269, 280, 49 S.Ct. 133, 73 L.Ed. 322; United States v. American Trucking Associations, 310 U.S. 534, 549, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345; United States v. Alabama G. S. R. Co., 142 U.S. 615, 12 S.Ct. 306, 35 L.Ed. 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Complainant contends that its legal question is supported by the following authorities: Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, 330 U.S. 567, 67 S.Ct. 894, 91 L.Ed. 1102; James McWilliams Blue Line, Inc., v. United States, D.C., 100 F.Supp. 66, affirmed I. C. C. v. James McWilliams Blue Line, Inc., 342 U.S. 951, 72 S.Ct. 626, 96 L.Ed. 707; Wight v. United States, 167 U.S. 512, 17 S.Ct. 822, 42 L.Ed. 258; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 225 U.S. 326, 32 S.Ct. 742, 56 L.Ed. 1107; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 57, 59, 41 S.Ct. 24, 65 L.Ed. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Each of the cases can be distinguished from the facts and circumstances to the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In Re: Mechling; it was held that in the absence of greater costs to the railroad, the Commission could not permit or require railroads to charge higher proportional rates for the transportation of grain east of Chicago where it was transported to Chicago by barge, than where it came to Chicago by water or railroad shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Blue Line held, where coal was transported by rail and then by water to the New England Seaboard, a higher proportional rate was not sustainable where the sole basis therefore was the fact that the coal was transported from the New England port to the interior by barge rather than by rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">Wight held, where a railroad transports the same commodity for two shippers under the same circumstances, a rebate cannot be given one consignee for cartage from the railroad facility to the consignee\u2019s warehouse unless a similar rebate is given to all similar consignees. (In this decision the Supreme Court did not discuss or refer to their prior ruling in Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co., supra. It can be reasonably concluded that it was not intended to limit the prior holding that a difference in primary origins or ultimate destinations of shipments was a different circumstance justifying a difference in rates.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Baltimore &amp; Ohio held, it was discriminatory for a railroad to charge a lower rate to railroads for the hauling of coal which was to be used by them as fuel than what was charged for a similar haul for other users of coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">Seaboard did not involve the validity of proportional rates depending upon the ultimate destination of the traffic. It held unlawful a railroad absorbing switching operations for shippers when using competitive lines but not when shippers used the railroad\u2019s own lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">A study of the authorities which have reviewed proportional railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>rates leads to the conclusion that rate structures are not designed merely to favor the revenues of producers and carriers. The Commission has the consumer interest to safeguard as well. And when it undertakes to accommodate the interest of the three, great complexities are often encountered. The economics of the bituminous coal industry have baffled even experts. We would depart from our competence and our limited function in this field if we undertook to accommodate the factors of transportation conditions, distance and competition differently than the Commission has done in this case. That is a task peculiarly for it. In fashioning what the Commission called a differentially related and finely balanced rate structure for this coal, there is no place for dogma or rigid formulae. The problem calls for an expert, informed judgment on a multitude of facts. The result is that the administrative rate-maker is left with broad discretion as long as no statutory requirement is overlooked. Yet that is, of course, precisely the nature of the administrative process in this field. Board of Trade of Kansas City, Mo. v. United States, 314 U.S. 534, 548, 62 S.Ct. 366, 86 L.Ed. 432; New York v. United States, 331 U.S. 284, 347-349, 67 S.Ct. 1207, 91 L.Ed. 1492; Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, 335 U.S. 573, 69 S.Ct. 278, 93 L.Ed. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It appears since Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co., supra, it has been recognized that varying proportional rates are an integral part of the railroad rate structure. That it is the duty of the Commission to consider not only the wishes and interests of the shippers and merchants, but to also consider the desire and advantage of the carrier, the interest of the public, and competitive factors in the origin or terminal territories. Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, supra; New York v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Commission found various conditions and circumstances that distinguished the New England Seaboard from the New York Seaboard area in giving approval to the proportional rates in this proceeding:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">(a) The substantial diminishing movement of coal from the southern mines to New England Seaboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">(b) The lack of production of coal in New England areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">(c) Shipments of coal to New England areas from southern mines, rail and oceanic transportation, shipments of coal from Pennsylvania and West Virginia by rail routes and rail-water routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">(d) No southern steam coal shipped by rail-oceanic transportation to New England.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">(e) No market of southern mines for steam coal in New York Seaboard area \u2014 all such coal shipped from northern mines.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The complexities and involvements of railroad rates are not to be shifted from the shoulders of the experts commissioned to handle them to the backs of the judiciary; nor are the broad powers of judgment conferred upon the experts to be unduly hampered. Western Paper Makers\u2019 Chemical Co. v. United States, 271 U.S. 268, 46 S.Ct. 500, 70 L.Ed. 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">How well the Commission utilized the evidence before it or what weight it assigned to its various parts is not a matter upon which the court may rule. I. C. C. v. City of Jersey City, 322 U.S. 503, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 88 L.Ed. 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">Correctness of reasoning, soundness of conclusion or basis for determination under the overall problem of rate making are not to be inquired into by the courts. Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 47 S.Ct. 222, 71 L.Ed. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">So in a case of alleged discrimination, findings of fact made by the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the likeness of contemporary transportation services rendered by carriers to different shippers and as to the substantial similarity of the circumstances and conditions in which they were ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>dered, cannot be disturbed by the courts where the action of the Commission is neither arbitrary nor in excess of its authority. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">It is our judgment the Commission acted within the provisions of law in fully considering all the circumstances and conditions which reasonably applied in the promotion of commerce, i. e., the interests of the southern coal operators, the railroad carrying companies, traders and shippers in the competitive economic areas, and the welfare of the communities and public generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The questions posed as to whether the proportional rates are unjust or discriminatory under the circumstances which here exist create facual matters to be determined by the Commission and not the courts; and its findings on those questions will not be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We must, therefore, determine if substantial evidence exists in the record to support the findings and conclusions of the Commission. If there does, the proceeding is without legal foundation. If there does not, the complainant is entitled to some relief either before the Commission or the statutory court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The general principles applicable in determining the adequacy of the findings of the Commission and the sufficiency of the supporting evidence are well established. The requirements of the law are met if the Commission\u2019s findings include the ultimate ones specified by the statute and provide a rational basis for its decision, and if the findings are in turn supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 145-146, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. 1147; Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., v. United States, 292 U.S. 282, 286-287, 54 S.Ct. 692, 78 L.Ed. 1260; Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The weight given to an administrative finding is well established. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. Co., 222 U.S. 541, 547, 32 S.Ct. 108, 56 L.Ed. 308. The court cannot consider the expediency or wisdom of the order, or whether, on like testimony it would have made a similar holding. United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, 327 U.S. 515, 535-536, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821, It is not the court\u2019s province to inquire into the soundness of the Commission\u2019s reasoning, the wisdom of its decisions, or the consistency of its conclusions with those reached in similar cases. Georgia Public Service Comm. v. United States, 283 U.S. 765, 775, 51 S.Ct. 619, 75 L.Ed. 1397. Furthermore, as stated in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Jersey City, supra [322 U.S. 503, 64 S.Ct. 1134], \u201cthe Commission\u2019s order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity.\u201d In short, the findings of an administrative body should not be set aside unless the record \u201cclearly precludes\u201d the decision of the administrative body \u201cfrom being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 466, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">It is likewise well established that while the essential findings of the Commission must be supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, consideration of the weight and value of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom are matters for the Commission alone. New England Divisions Case (Akron, C. &amp; Y. R. Co. v. United States), 261 U.S. 184, 204, 43 S.Ct. 270, 67 L.Ed. 605; I. C. C. v. Union Pacific R. Co., supra, 222 U.S. at page 547, 32 S.Ct. at page 111; Capital Transit Co. v. United States, D.C., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>97 F.Supp. 614, 619, 621; Lang Transp. Corp. v. United States, 75 F.Supp. 915, 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In addition, it is not necessary that the findings be precise and detailed for \u201cso long as the agency makes amply clear the factual basis upon which it has proceeded, there can be no ground for complaint.\u201d Capital Transit Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Complainant Koppers has failed to establish that the varying proportional rates have caused unjust discrimination under Section 2, or undue prejudice to it or unreasonable preference to its competitors under Section 3(1). Nor has complainant met the burden as required by law as to the financial losses alleged to have been sustained as the proximate result of the proportional rates permitted by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">It is our considered judgment the Interstate Commerce Commission has properly carried out the powers and duties conferred upon it by the Interstate Commerce Act, that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are fully supported by substantial evidence, and that the Commission has properly interpreted and supplied the \u2022 applicable principles of law. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied, and motions of defendant and intervening defendants for summary judgment should be granted, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The court makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">1. This cause came on to be heard before a duly constituted statutory court which was convened pursuant to statute, 28 U.S.C.A. Sections 2284(1) and 2325, to hear and determine the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">2. By agreement of the parties the issues were submitted upon final hearing, upon the pleadings and upon the complete record of the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">3. Ex Parte 175, 284 I. C. C. 589, 663, the Commission on April 11, 1952 permitted the proportional rates which are the subject of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">4. The Railroad published the permissive increases authorized by the Commission, which became effective on May 2, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">5. On May 8, 1952, the complainant filed a petition for intervention and modification of the order issued by the Commission on April 11, 1952, in which it was charged that the proportional rates were in violation of Sections 2 and 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">6. The Commission by Division Two on March 10, 1954 denied relief. 292 I.C.C. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">7.
