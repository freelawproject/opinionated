The administrator, if be was in doubt as to the right of the creditors of .Dare, ought to have retained the fund and filed a bill of interpleader. As two of the plaintiffs Sloan and Lindsay, were sureties on the debt of R. M. Lindsay, to which the administrator applied the fund, he is entitled to a credit as against them, fo\u00ab* a rateable part of that debt; that is such as they were bound to pay upon contribution with the other sureties of Dare.</p>\n<p id=\"b6-5\">There will be a reference to ascertain this amount and show the sama to which the plaintiffs are respectively entitled\u00bb ' * \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
