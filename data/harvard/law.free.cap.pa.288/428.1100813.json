Houston owned a tract of land in Philadelphia, fronting 565 feet on Morris Street and extending in depth to the right-of-way of a railroad. A part of the land was sold subject to the following restriction : \u201c (a) For the period of 25 years from the date hereof, not rpore than two houses and two stables or garages shall be erected on said premises, (b) That at no time shall any house be erected within forty feet of the line of Morris Street, or any stable or garage within one hundred feet of the line of Morris Street, and no building within ten feet of the side lines of said lot. (c) That no building shall be erected or. used on said lot for a hotel or tavern, or for manufacturing purposes, nor for any other purpose offensive to the owners or occupiers of other property......nor shall, said lot or land be used for such offensive purposes, (d) That stables or garages for the exclusive use of- the occupiers of the dwelling houses erected on the lot of ground shall not be deemed offensive or be hereby prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Plaintiffs, as owners of 250 feet on Morris Street, contemplated erecting a six story apartment house. A dispute arose as to the scope of the restriction above mentioned, and the parties hereto agreed to submit its determination to the court for a declaratory judgment. The court below found that an apartment house would be \u201coffensive to the owners or occupiers of other [adja<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>cent] properties,\u201d not because an apartment house is generally offensive to residents, but for the reason that it possesses \u201cmost of the inconveniences and annoyances of a hotel\u201d which had been specifically interdicted as being offensive. This conclusion of the court below was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">Covenants restricting the use of land are construed most strictly against one claiming their benefit and in favor of free and unrestricted use of property; a violation of the covenant occurs only when there is a plain disregard of the limitations imposed by its express words: DeSanno v. Earle, 273 Pa. 265, 270; Johnson v. Jones, 244 Pa. 386, 389; Crofton v. St. Clement\u2019s Church, 208 Pa. 209, 213. It does not extend to limitations arising by implication: Taylor v. Lambert, 279 Pa. 514; St. Andrew\u2019s Lutheran Church\u2019s App., 67 Pa. 512; Francis v. Dean, 80 Pa. Superior Ct. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Under clause (a) of the restrictive covenant, only \u201chouses\u201d could be built upon the property. \u201cHouse,\u201d in common speech, embraces \u201cevery form of structure for hjiman habitation\u201d: Caddy v. I. R T. Co., 195 N. Y. 415, 420, 88 N. E. 747. In a legal sense, however, it is more comprehensive and may mean a building regardless of habitation: 30 C. J. 472 ; 4 Words &amp; Phrases, 3351. Here it is used in conjunction with the phrase, \u201ctwo stables or garages.\u201d These words do not explain or modify \u201chouses,\u201d which precedes them, so as to confine its meaning to dwellings for single families. Stables and garages are used in connection with houses not' places of habitation, as, for illustration, a hospital. Clause \u201c(d)\u201d states that \u201cstables or garages for the exclusive use of the oceupiers of \u2018said dwelling houses,\u2019 shall not be deemed offensive.\u201d This is the first use of the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d in the covenant; assuming that \u201cdwelling houses\u201d refers to \u201chouses\u201d in clause \u201c (a),\u201d we have held that \u201cdwelling house\u201d does not mean a single dwelling for one family, but is a more comprehensive term. Thus, in Johnson v. Jones, supra, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>apartment house was held not repugnant to the restriction \u201cdwelling house,\u201d though designed to admit of several families dwelling separately in house-keeping flats. We said (p. 389, 390): \u201cThe governing word......is \u201cdwelling house\u201d......[It] is [not] used in [a] qualified or restricted sense......A dwelling house is a house occupied as a residence in distinction from a store, office or other building. Neither the character of the structure here proposed, nor the use to which it is to be put, suggests anything that would bring [an apartment house] within any of these distinctions.\u201d In Hamnett v. Born, 247 Pa. 418, the restriction \u201cone dwelling house\u201d was held not to forbid the erection of an apartment or duplex house. In Taylor v. Lambert, supra, we held that \u201cprivate dwelling house\u201d had a more restricted meaning than \u201cdwelling house,\u201d and excluded all buildings used for residential purposes of a public character, including an apartment house.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The purpose of clause \u201c(d)\u201d was to prevent stables or garages from being held nuisances or \u201coffensive\u201d under clause \u201c(c).\u201d It was not intended to broaden or lessen either the meaning of the terms to which they were applied, or to change the meaning of \u201chouses\u201d or \u201cbuildings\u201d used in \u201c(a)\u201d and \u201c(c).\u201d A restrictive covenant cannot be varied by implication or inference from other sections in the deed, unless a clear intent and purpose is apparent. That the words \u201cstables or garages\u201d were not intended to restrict the character of structure to which they were attached becomes clear when we consider paragraph \u201c(c).\u201d It expressly refers to a building coming within the meaning of \u201chouses,\u201d as used in clause \u201c (a),\u201d but which is clearly not such a structure to which the. words \u201cstable or garage\u201d are said to refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Clause \u201c(e)\u201d limits the primary term \u201chouses\u201d by forbidding the erection of any building for a hotel or tavern or for manufacturing purposes. This is a further restriction upon the ordinary use of the property. Had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201chouses\u201d meant dwellings for single families, this section would be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">The clause goes on to prohibit any other type of building \u201cfor any other purpose offensive to the owners or occupiers of other properties on......Morris Street.\u201d It has been uniformly held that an apartment house is not a hotel, but is a building used as a dwelling for several families, each living separate and apart. While each family uses the main hall for entrance to the building, it may be regarded as stepping from the street through the doorway into a modern home: Scanlan v. LaCoste, 59 Colo. 449, 149 Pac. 835; Waitt Construction Co. v. Chase, 188 N. Y. Supp. 589, affirmed 233 N. Y. 633, 135 N. E. 948; Alsberg v. Lucerne Hotel Co., 92 N. Y. Sup. 851. A hotel is a building held out to the public as a place where all transient persons who come will be received and entertained as guests for compensation, 32 C. J. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">A limitation in a conveyance, coming after a prior grant of an unlimited right, will not avail to cut down the unlimited right unless the intent to do so is clearly expressed. Restrictions in deeds deal with property rights. They do not arise, nor can they be enforced, unless they appear in express terms. They do not arise by implication and where a right ordinarily appertaining to a grant is limited by an instrument in express language, a subsequent clause to extend the scope of the operation of the restriction must be expressed in clear and explicit language. No such intention is clearly expressed in this deed. The court below, in holding that an apartment house has many of the objectionable elements of a hotel, overlooks the fact that other buildings, even private dwelling houses, may have some of them. In balancing the various activities that go to make up dwellings, hotels, and apartments, the characteristics appertaining to the latter, resemble those of dwelling houses much more than hotels. The salient features of the two are alike. The apartment is devoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>exclusively to tenants by long term leases. The great bulk of hotel business is transient and a hotel is primarily a public house. The court below was quite correct in saying that the word \u201chotel\u201d does not comprehend an apartment house, because a hotel and an apartment house are distinct and well known types of buildings. In common speech one is not confounded with the other. The learned judge should have stopped at this point. We hold the language \u201ca building for any other purpose offensive to the owners or occupiers of other properties\u201d is not sufficiently clear, explicit or definite in use or reference to restrict the use permitted under clause \u201c(a)\u201d on the word \u201chouses\u201d which concedes the right to erect an apartment house.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The decree of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted with instruction to enter a decree in conformity to this opinion, costs to be paid by appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
