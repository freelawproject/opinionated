Bonsall and to determine the effect upon it of the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The testament provided for the creation of a trust of one-half of the residuary estate, the income from which was to be paid to a granddaughter, Florence Bonsall Judge, during life; upon her death the principal was to go to her child or children, but if she should die \u201cwithout leaving child or children surviving or children of deceased child or children, then and in such case the principal monies of said Trust Fund shall go to and vest in my lineal descendants according to the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d Florence Bonsall Judge [DeHaven] did so die. Are the lineal descendants to be ascertained as of the date of testatrix\u2019s death or the death of the life beneficiary? The orphans\u2019 court adopted the latter date applying as the rule of construction the provisions of the act to which we have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The statute, dropping unnecessary words, provides, \u201cHereafter when,......by the provisions of any...... will,......property...... shall be______ devised...... in trust, for the use......of any person._____for life, ......and which shall provide therein that upon, the termination of the estate......for life,......the remainder over shall vest in the......testator\u2019s heirs or next of kin or the persons thereunto entitled under the intestate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>laws, <em>or other similar or equivalent phrase, </em>the same shall be construed as meaning the person or persons thereunto entitled at the time of the termination of the estate.....for life......under the intestate laws...... as they shall exist at the time of such termination; and such phrases shall not be construed as meaning the person or persons who were the heirs or next of kin...... at the time the testator died\u201d; with a proviso against a construction preventing a testator from expressly or by necessary implication directing otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Are the words \u201cmy lineal descendants according to the intestate laws\u201d a \u201csimilar or equivalent phrase\u201d to \u201ctestator\u2019s heirs or next of kin or the persons thereunto entitled under the intestate laws\u201d? The appellant contends they are not; the court below thought otherwise and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The statute uses the words \u201csimilar or equivalent,\u201d and some effect, if possible, must be given to each of them. They should not be declared tautological unless such a conclusion is without escape. In the New Standard Dictionary, \u201csimilar\u201d is defined as \u201cbearing resemblance to something else; being alike in quality, nature, degree, purpose or other characteristics, <em>hut not the same or </em>identicalAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, it means \u201chaving a marked resemblance or likeness; of a like nature or kind.\u201d In Webster\u2019s International Dictionary the definition is \u201cnearly corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a general likeness.\u201d On the other hand, the Oxford Dictionary defines \u201cequivalent\u201d as \u201chaving equal or corresponding import, meaning or significance; what is .virtually the same thing; identical in effect.\u201d According to Webster it means \u201cequal in worth or value, force, power, defect, import and the like; alike in significance and value; of the same import or meaning.\u201d The synonym given is \u201cidentical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Judicially, \u201csimilar\u201d has been defined as \u201cnearly corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>alike; having a general likeness\u201d (Frankel v. German, etc., Co., 121 Mo. App. 51, 97 S. W. 961); not \u201cprecisely alike\u201d but \u201cwith more or less resemblance\u201d (State ex rel. Sigsbee v. Birmingham, 160 Ala. 196, 48 So. 843; Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 U. S. 278). In Rhode Island State Hospital Trust Co. v. Olney, 16 R. I. 184, 13 Atl. 118, the court said that \u201csimilarity is not identity, but resemblance between different things.\u201d \u201cEquivalent\u201d means \u201cof equal value\u201d (Robinson v. Noble\u2019s Adm\u2019s., 8 Pet. 181, 199), or \u201cequal in value, force, power, effect, import and the like\u201d (McLean v. Moran, 38 Mont. 298, 99 Pac. 836).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Judge Gest speaking for the majority of the court below well said: \u201cSome tangible meaning must be given to the word \u2018similar\u2019 in order to accomplish the evident purpose of the act, which says \u2018similar or equivalent\u2019 thus excluding the interpretation that \u2018similar\u2019 means the same as \u2018equivalent\u2019; and that \u2018descendants\u2019 are similar to the other classes named, of heirs, next of kin and persons entitled under the intestate laws, is, in our opinion, reasonably clear. \u2018Lineal descendants according to the intestate laws\u2019 is even more similar to \u2018persons entitled under the intestate laws\u2019 than the words \u2018lineal descendants\u2019 would be standing alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">It may be very safely concluded that the legislature could not foresee every possible wording which a testator might use to define classes of persons to take in remainder (such as \u201cissue,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d \u201cgrandchildren,\u201d \u201cdescendants\u201d and the like) and determined to cover them all by the expression \u201csimilar or equivalent phrase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Construing the statute in this manner, we have a rule applicable to all cases where there has been a limitation over after the termination of a life estate, and where the language of the gift is analogous to that of the statute. We think this will carry out the real purpose and intent of testators in almost every instance, and, as it does in this case, will keep the title of property in the hands of those of testator\u2019s own blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The decree is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
