The circuit court of the city of Richmond has no equity jurisdiction except in certain cases specified in the statute, in which tiie state is interested or some of the officers and boards representing the state are necessary or proper parties; and in such cases its jurisdiction is exclusive.

Upon the facts of this ease held that tiie Board of Public Works of the state was a necessary party to a suit brought by parties claiming to be stockholders in the Petersburg Railroad Company, against the Company, the city of Petersburg, Ragland and others, to set aside certain acts of the railroad company done in favor of Ragland as tiie holder of a large amount of tiie stock of the company which he purchased from the city of Petersburg.

The state having returned the stock to the city of Petersburg, and it being held by the city as collateral security for tiie debt Ragland owed for the stock, and his note having fallen due, the city sued him upon it, and advertised the stock for sale. Rag-land then filed his cross-bill in the first suit to enjoin the suit aud sale until the questions in the first suit as to the character of the stock which the state had held, whether preferred or \u2022common, should be settled.

The second bill asking for relief against the City of Petersburg, which could not be given on the pleadings and proceedings in the original bill, but which was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>upon grounds involved in that ease, it was the proper subject of a cross-bill; but the relief sought by it being outside of the original bill, the dismissal of the original bill did not involve the dismissal of the cross-bill.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b426-10\">2. If tlie cross-bill is to be treated as an original bill in the nature of a cross-bill, all the parties being before the court, and the case having been matured, it was proper to proceed to decide it upon tlie merits. And certainly Rag-land is not to be heard to question tlie jurisdiction of tlie court after having had the determination of the question brought by him into the ease.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-11\">In July, 1873, A. J. Broadnax, W. E. Broadnax and E. \"W. Wilkins instituted a suit in the circuit court of the city of Richmond, against the Petersburg Railroad Company, Reuben Ragland, the Board of Public Works, and several other persons; and the City of Petersburg after-wards became a party defendant in the cause. The plaintiffs, in their bill, say they are the owners of four hundred and forty shares of the capital stock of tire Peters-burg Railroad Company, and they file the bill not only for themselves, hut for all other stockholders of the company, and such holders of tlie mortgage debt of the company as may become parties to the suit and contribute to the cost of its prosecution. They set out the action of the stockholders of the company by which they directed to he issued to Reuben Ragland and other persons named 4,852 shares of preferred stock, and that the board of directors and treasurer of said company pay to the holders of said stocks three <em>per centum per annum </em>thereon out of the gross receipts of the company, in addition to their dividends out of the net profits of said company; and that they should pay to Reuben Ragland two hundred and forty-nine thousand three hundred and fifty dollars, in satisfaction of all arrears claimed by him to be due upon 4,490 shares of the so-called preferred stock held by Mm, and that in addition thereto that the said Ragland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>as president of tlie company, be paid tlie sum of $12,000 <em>\u25a0per annum </em>in monthly instalments. They deny that the stock was preferred stock entitled to the payment of three <em>per cent, </em>out of the gross earnings of tlie company; or that this stock was, in addition to this three <em>per cent. </em>out of the gross earnings, to be paid equally with the other stock of the company dividends out of the net earnings; or that Ragland was entitled to receive these dividends if they were properly payable, which fell due before he purchased the stock. They charge that Rag-land having purchased a majority of the stock of the company, he controlled the action of the stockholders when this action was taken. And they refer to the acts of assembly upon which tlie claim of Ragland was founded, and the action of the common hall of the city of Petersburg, by which the stock was sold to Ragland. These are given in the opinion of the court delivered by <em>Christian, </em>J. And they ask for the appointment of a receiver for the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\">Ragland answered the bill. He charged that the plaintiffs were not the owners of any stock in the Petersburg railroad company; that though they had at one time owned the shares they claimed, they had disposed of them, and that the suit was in fact carried on in their names by John M. Robinson, a citizen of Baltimore, who was president of the Seaboard and Roanoke railroad company and several other companies he named, and that the object was to defeat the efforts the defendant was malting to attract freight to his road, which would interfere with the interests of the companies managed by said Robinson. He denies that the meeting of the stockholders was packed, and says one of the plaintiffs was present at the meeting, acting for himself and as proxy for one other of the plaintiffs, and voted for everything that was done. And he insists that the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>stockholders was proper; that the stock was preferred stock, and that the holders thereof were entitled to three <em>per cent, per annum </em>out of the gross earnings of the company, and an equal dividend out of the net earnings; and that these net earnings, unpaid when he purchased the stock, passed with the stock to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-10\">In September, 1875, Reuben Ragland tiled what is called a cross-bill in the cause. lie made the City of Petersburg, the Seaboard andRoanoke Railroad Company, the Petersburg Railroad Company, the Board of Public Works of Virginia, the plaintiffs in the first bill, and the other defendants thereto, defendants. The object of this bill is to enjoin the city of Petersburg from proceeding in an action which had been commenced by said city of Petersburg against himself and others upon a note for $249,982, with interest, which had been given by them for 3,500 shares of the stock of the Petersburg railroad company, and to enjoin the sale of said stock by the city of Petersburg for the payment of said debt, the said stock having been left with the city of Petersburg as collateral security for the payment of said debt. After setting out the nature of the stock, 3,235 shares of which he claims to be preferred stock, and its purchase by Rag-land, and the circumstances of that purchase, and the objections made in the original suit to Ragland\u2019s claims, he states the points he asks to have settled:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-11\">First. Are the 3,235 shares of stock, common stock, or preferred and guaranteed stock, in the hands of the present owners thereof ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-12\">Second. If the said 3,235 share be preferred and guaranteed stock, what is the measure of the preference and guaranty ? Is it, first, a preferred and guaranteed dividend of one and a half <em>per centum </em>for every six months, out of the gross receipts of the road, without participation in the full amount of dividends declared out of - net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>profits, or is it a preferred and guaranteed dividend out of gross receipts as aforesaid, with participation in the full amount qf dividends declared out of net profits in addition thereto ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-4\">The City of Petersburg answered the bill contesting the claims of the plaintiff as to the character of the stocks and the dividends to be paid upon it, and insisting that there was nothing in their agreement with Ragland, as he had insisted in his bill, which forbade the city to sue upon the note and to sell the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">The two causes came on to be heard on the 19th of April, 1876, when the court being of opinion that the plaintiffs in the first suit had so disposed of their stock that they had no appreciable interest in the subject in controversy, dismissed their bill with costs. In the second case the judge\u2014 Wellford\u2014delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">The dismissal of the original bill does not, however, relieve the court from the duty of passing upon some of the matters set out therein, for they are necessarily involved in the action which must be had upon the cross-bill. That bill must be regarded in many respects as an original bill, and the court having assumed jurisdiction and awarded an injunction to the complainant therein, cannot content itself with a simple dissolution of the injunction and dismissal of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">It appears from the cross-bill that a considerable portion of the purchase money of the stock of the Petersburg railroad company sold to Ragland by the city of Peters-burg, is unpaid, and that as a security therefor the city of Petersburg holds the note of Ragland and other parties for the sum of $249,982, due upon its face August 1st, 1875, with the pledge of 3,500 shares of the stock now in the possession of the city as' collateral security; that suit has been instituted by the city on the note, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that a sale of the stock has been ordered by the city. The prosecution of the suit and the sale of the stock has been enjoined by the court, not upon any hearing of the parties or any judicial determination of the matters at issue, but upon the <em>ex parte </em>application of the complainant. I am of opinion now, as I was when the preliminary injunction was issued, that it wras providently awarded. The bill presents grave questions, and opportunity was afforded the city of Petersburg to be heard as to the propriety of considering the application for the preliminary injunction in advance of a determination of those questions upon full presentation thereof, by counsel, for all the parties in interest. That presentation was then promised and expected at a very early date, and the determination thereof by the court has been delayed without its default. It is claimed by the. complainant, Ragland, that the city of Petersburg, by an ordinance of the council, passed March 5th, 1872, in accepting the note of Ragland and his associates, bound itself not to demand or require payment of the principal of the debt for which said note was given, so long as the stock, or the greater part thereof, should continue to be held by the said Ragland and his then partners, or either of them, or by any other <em>bona fide </em>citizen or citizens of Petersburg. The ordinance is very awkwardly expressed, but this construction imputes to the common council which enacted it such a gratuitous extension of credit to the obligors that it cannot be accepted if the bungling pihraseology of the ordinance admits of any other interpretation. I think that it does, and that read in the light of surrounding circumstances and the contemporaneous acts of all parties, its meaning and interest is very clear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">It will be observed that the obligation of Ragland, &amp;c., bound them to pay on the 1st day of August, 1875, if not paid sooner. \"When the obligation was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the stock was held by the state of Virginia as security for a debt due by the city of Petersburg, and could not then be delivered; but in contemplation of its release by the state and surrender to the city prior to the maturity of the obligation, the obligors hound themselves, upon the tender of the stock and demand of payment by the city, to anticipate the maturity of the obligation and make payment in full after four months\u2019 notice. The provision of the ordinance for a waiver of right to demand payment was very clearly intended to be limited to this contemplated anticipation of the agreed pay -day, and to relieve the obligors from any apprehension that they would he required to pay before August 1st, 1875, so long as they or any citizens of Petersburg as assignees continued to hold the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">Put even conceding the construction claimed by Rag-land, his purchase since the passage of the ordinance of the entire interest of his then partners, and his own removal from the city of Petersburg has absolved the city from the obligation of its waiver; for it cannot be pretended that the stock is now under the control of \u201c any party or parties <em>bona fide </em>holding the same as a \u25a0citizen .or citizens of the city of Petersburg,\u201d and in such \u2022contingency the city reserved in the ordinance the right to enforce payment of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-10\">It appears that Ragland purchased from the city of Petersburg 4,755 shares of stock of the Petersburg railroad company: that 1,255 shares were transferred and delivered to him, and that the remaining 3,500 shares are now in the possession of the city of Petersburg, hypothecated as security for the unpaid purchase money. Of these 3,500 shares, 3,235 were derived by the city of Petersburg from the state of Virginia, and have been heretofore known and recognized as preferred stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>While this stock was held by the state and by the city, the only preference claimed was the right to annual dividends of three <em>per cent., </em>whether any dividends was or-was not declared upon the other stock, and to no more unless a dividend of more than three <em>per cent, </em>was declared upon the other stock, and in such event only to an equal dividend with the other stock. When the stock was purchased by Ragland he was advised by learned counsel that this stock was much more valuable, that it was entitled not merely to the dividend of three <em>per cent. </em>in any contingency, but to shfire equally in any and all dividends declared upon the other stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">This construction of the law not merely made this stock much more valuable, that <em>in futuro </em>the holders should receive these dividends, but imposed upon the company a heavy liability for arrearages clue to the stock for unpaid dividends of thirty previous years. Furthei\u2019more it appears that under authority of an act of assembly, passed in 1861, the company increased its capital stock to the extent of fifty <em>per cent., </em>and it was also-claimed by Ragland under the like advice that the fifty <em>per cent, </em>additional stock accruing to the holders of this preferred stock, partook of its character, and was entitled to the full extent with the original stock to the benefit of these peculiar privileges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-11\">The stockholders of the company in general meeting, in 1872, recognized these claims to their full extent, and ordered the board of directors to pay to Reuben Ragland the arrearages claimed, and to issue to all the holders of the original preferred stock, or any dividend stock thereof, certificates for all their original and new stock, expressing on the face of the certificates that the stock was \u201cpreferred; \u201d and the board have, it appears, made payment to Ragland and issued some of these certificates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The original bill in this case complained of all this action of the company and the board of directors, and denied the validity of the claim asserted on behalf, not merely of this new stock, but also of the original stock, and as to the original stock not only denied the new claims asserted by Ragland, but insisted that it was entitled to no preference whatever over the other stock of the company. The views put forth in that bill were sanctioned and endorsed by counsel of ability and commanding professional influence. If sound, they impaired immensely the value of 3,235 shares of the stock held by the city of Petersburg as security for Ragland\u2019s note, and whether sound or not, pending the determination of that question in the courts, no sale could be made of the stock without the hazard of great detriment to all the parties in interest. The sale has been arrested by the order of this court. The city of Petersburg is entitled to have the sale made, and to realize, so far as it will be available, the full amount of her debt. But the sale can not be made without a determination by this court of the character and status of the stock, whether preferred or not preferred; and if preferred, a determination of the extent of its privileges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\">What, then, is the status of this stock ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">It appears that in 1843 the state of Virginia held $160,000 of common stock in tins Petersburg railroad company, and was a creditor of the company for $150,000 of principal money loaned, and $13,500 of interest in arrear. In view of this fact, an act was passed by the general assembly (Sess. Acts 1842-3, p. 71-2) increasing the capital stock of the company to the extent of its debt to the state, and authorizing the board of public works to subscribe the amount of the debt to the stock of the company upon certain conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The conditions so far as action was required were complied with, and the subscription made. Those conditions required a mortgage to be executed creating the first lien on the entire property of the company and all its nefc income; conditioned to pay the amount of the then debt of the state in full, whenever the company should fail to pay dividends of three per <em>cent, per annum </em>on all the stock of the state in the company. The act further required the officers of the company to set apart out of its gross receipts the amount of this three <em>per cent, </em>dividend, and to pay the same into- the treasury, reserved to the state the right in the event of default for thirty days to obtain judgment therefor against the company on thirty days\u2019 notice, and furthermore made the president, directors, and treasurer of the company liable for such default to a penalty of $1,000 each, recoverable by the board of public works on ten days\u2019 notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">Was the stock in the hands of the state of Virginia preferred stock ? It was more; it was guaranteed stock. It was $323,500 of stock, entitled in any and every contingency of the future fortunes of the company to a dividend of three <em>per cent, per annum-, </em>the punctuality of the payment of which was insured, as far as legislative sagacity could insure anything, as long as the company could maintain its corporate life; and in the event of overwhelming disaster to the company, to the extent of $163,500, more than fifty <em>per cent, </em>of its par value, the principal of the stock was secured by a first lien upon all its corporate property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\">The stock was valuable property to the State, and made annual returns into her treasury so long as she held it. But in 1869 the state transferred this stock to the city of Petersburg: The transfer was made with the avowed object of facilitating the construction of the Southside railroad, but it was not made without consicl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>eration on the part of the city of Petersburg. The act of assembly (Sess. Acts 1848-9, p. 107) indicates no contemplation of any benefaction designed to or any consideration moving from the Petersburg railroad company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-4\">It was the act of a proprietor transferring for value his interest in the stock of a railroad corporation. I know of no principle of law or of construction of statutes which would justify me in attributing to the state any purpose to withhold as assignor any valuable incident to this property which was susceptible ot transfer either in law or equity to the assignee. The act contemplated an absolute transfer, and carried with it necessarily, I think, all that made the property valuable in the hands of the assignor. It may be very well conceded that at the time the right was acquired by the state, it was not in the contemplation of either party that the state would ever transfer it. The same thing may be said by every improvement company to which the state in her former days subscribed her three-fifths of stock. It may be conceded further that there is difficulty and some apparent discord in enforcing for an assignee the securities reserved by the state. I think the difficulties suggested in argument are more apparent than real. But conceding that they are quite as formidable as suggested, I cannot see that the misfortune of the assignee in losing the benefit of one security which the state only could make available should be made the basis of an argument to deprive him of the benefit of other securities which are just as available to him as they could have been to the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">It is then a grave matter of inquiry to all the stockholders of this company to what extent are the privileges of this stock to be conceded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">The privilege attached to the stock was the creature of positive law, reserved to the state, and we may well pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sume that the board of public works was fully cognizant of the views of the general assembly in its enactment. Their contemporaneous construction of the law and their unchallenged action under it, for the several years in which they as the representatives of the state were charged with the duty of enforcing it, would have militated very much against any assertion of a contrary construction by the city of Petersburg when she first became a party in interest. But the city of Petersburg concurred, and for thirty years no question was suggested. I incline very much to think that this action of the holders of this stock, even if we could reduce it to the low grade of mere acquiescence, would estop any claimants under them from preferring a broader claim. But I do not rest my opinion upon this; with the utmost respect for the learning and ability of' the counsel under whose advice the action of the Petersburg company was had m recognizing the novel and startling claims of Mr. Bag-land, I am of opinion that the language of the statute (Acts 1842-3, p. 72), clearly condemn them. I see no necessity for any refinement of verbal criticism in seeking the intent of the law-maker; distinctly and clearly dividends to the amount of 3 <em>per centum, per annum, </em>payable <em>half-yearly\u2014i. e., </em>1J <em>per cent, </em>semi-annually\u2014are reserved; then we have the proviso \u201cnothing herein contained shall deprive the state of the full amount of any half-yearly dividend exceeding 1J <em>per cent., </em>which may be declared by the company on the whole amount of its capital stock.\u201d The insertion here of the words \u201c exceeding 1J <em>per cent.,\u201d </em>the exact amount reserved to the state in any contingency, seems to me utterly unintelligible, except upon the idea that the state proposed as soon as the interest upon her then debt which was commuted into stock should be realized, out of the dividend reserved as chargeable on the gross earnings of the company, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>place herself upon an equal footing with all other stock- , n , 1 <em>1 \u00b0 </em>holders m the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">I am of opinion that this stock in the hands of the pre sent holders or their assignees, as it was in the hands of the state, is entitled to a dividend of 1\u00a3 <em>per cent, </em>semiannually per share, to be paid out of any earnings of the company, and that in the event of any dividends being declared upon the common stock exceeding 1J <em>per cent. </em>semi-annually, it is entitled, in addition, to the 1J <em>per cent. </em>chargeable upon the gross earnings, to receive out of the net earnings a sufficient sum to make its aggregate dividend equal to that of the other stock, and that in the event of the default of the company, the board of public works may be required to foreclose the mortgage and to realize by sale of the corporate property the sum of $163,000, to be divided ratably among the 3,235 shares of stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-8\">The injunction, so, far as it restrains the city of Peters-burg from prosecuting her suit upon the note of Reuben Ragland and others, must be dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-9\">I do not think it would be proper to dissolve the injunction restraining the sale of the stock; but the city of Petersburg is entitled to have it sold, and a sale will be ordered by the court and commissioners appointed for that purpose, and the cause retained upon the docket with a view to the entry of any orders which may be necessary after the sale, to secure the purchaser or purchasers proper transfers and certificates of stock, with full recognition by the company of the peculiar privileges incident thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-10\">The decree dissolved the injunction so far as it prohibited the city of Petersburg from prosecuting their suit at law upon the note; but continued it as to the sale of the stock held as collateral security, and appointed commissioners to sell the same in the mode and upon terms \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>stated in the decree.

Acts, 1869-70, pp. 42, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">By this provision of the statute it is plain, that while the circuit court of the city of Richmond has no chancery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>jurisdiction outside of the specific powers indicated therein, yet, <em>within </em>these limits thus defined by the statute law, it has the same and equal powers with those of the other circuit courts of this state in respect to the jurisdiction of chancery causes; audit is equally plain that with respect to the before-mentioned classes of cases and persons the said circuit court of the city of Richmond has exclusive jurisdiction, even in a chancery cause, which is withheld from all the other courts of the commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In other words, by fair interpretation of the statute law, whenever one of the persons or classes named in the statute shall be a necessary or proper party, the circuit court of the city of Richmond has, whether it be in a common law or chancery cause, not only original but exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In order, therefore, to determine whether the circuit com\u00ed of the city of Richmond had jurisdiction to entertain the original bill of the plaintifis in this cause, it is only necessary to inquire whether the <em>board of public works </em>was a necessary or proper party to that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">It appears from an examination of- this record and the acts of assembly, that in the year 1843 the state held $160,000 of common stock in the Petersburg railroad company, and wras a creditor of the company for $150,000 of principal money loaned, and $13,500 interest in arrear.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">On the 25th March, 1843, an act was passed by the general assembly increasing the capital stock of the company to the extent of its debt to the state, and authorizing the <em>board of public works </em>to subscribe the amount of this debt to the stock of the company upon certain conditions. These conditions required a mortgage to be executed creating <em>the first lien </em>on the entire property of the company and all its net income, conditioned to pay the amount of the then debt of the state in full <em>whenever </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>company should fail to pay dividends of <em>three per cent. Pef annum </em>on all the stock of the state in the company. The act further required the officers of the company to ge^ apart ou^ 0f p-g <em>gross receipts </em>the amount of this three per cent dividend, and to pay the same <em>into the treasury of the state </em>to the credit of the board of public works. On default of such payment there is reserved, by the terms of the act, tire right to the state to obtain judgment, on thirty days\u2019 notice, for the same; and .furthermore, the president, directors and treasurer of the company are made liable for such default in the penalty of $1,000 each, recoverable by the board of public works on ten days\u2019 notice. See Sess. Acts 1842-43, pp. 71, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">On the 26th of January, 1850, an act was passed authorizing the state to guarantee the payment of certain bonds of the city of Petersburg to the amount; of $323,500 (see Sess. Acts, 1849-50, p. 57); and as indemnity against any loss which might result to the state in consequence of such guaranty, the said city of Peters-burg pledged and mortgaged to the board of public works 3,235 shares of the capital stock of tire Petersburg railroad company (Ho. 743, and dated-7th May, 1849).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">' It appears from the record that of the shares of stock in the Petersburg railroad company owned by the city of Petersburg and sold by said city to the appellant, Reuben Ragland, 3,235 shares had been pledged or mortgaged to the board of public works to indemnify the state for any loss it might sustain in consequence of its guaranty of the bonds of the city of Petersburg. The state was, therefore, doubly interested in any suit affecting the disposition of the stock or franchises of the company. <em>First. </em>Because by the act of-25th March, 1843, it retained a lien upon the entire property of the company and its net earnings, conditioned to pay its then debt whenever there was a failure to pay a dividend of <em>three per cent, per annum </em>on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>all the stock the state held, which was to be paid semiannually out of the gross receipts; and <em>second, </em>because the larger part of the stock sold to Ragland by the city of Petersburg was pledged to indemnify the state against any loss it might sustain in consequence of the guaranty by the state of the bonds of said city. In both cases the hoard of public works, standing towards the 'state and the railroad company and the city of Petersburg in the position of mortgagee, was a necessary and proper party.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">As to the <em>character </em>of this stock, as well as to its disposition and sale, the state had a certain and valuable interest, and the board of public works, as the representative of the state, charged with certain duties and responsibilities prescribed by the statutes referred to, was a necessary and proper part}'.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The court is therefore of opinion that the original bill in this suit was properly filed in the circuit court of the city of Richmond, and that there was no error in the refusal of said circuit court to dismiss the same for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">This disposes of the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The circuit court, however, after asserting, as we think, properly, its jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff\u2019s bill, dismissed the bill upon certain grounds not necessary to he considered by this court, because from that order there is no appeal, and of <em>that action </em>of the circuit court there is no complaint here.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">But it is insisted by the learned counsel for the appellants here, that the dismissal by the circuit court of the original bill necessarily carried with it a dismissal also of the cross-bill (so-called) filed by the appellant, Reuben Ragland; and it is insisted that it was error in said circuit court in not dismissing both bills, instead of making a decree upon the issues made by the cross-bill. The bill filed by Ragland (called in the proceedings a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>cross-bill), was filed for a <em>twofold </em>purpose; <em>first, </em>to restrain and enjoin the city of Petersburg from instituting suit upon a certain promissory note for the sum of $249,982,, executed by him, with others as Ms sureties, for 3,500 shares of stock in the Petersburg railroad company, sold to him by said city, upon the alleged ground that by express covenant of said - city with him, said city had agreed not to demand or require payment of the principal of said debt so long as said stock, or the greater part thereof, should continue to be held by him; and <em>second, to </em>enjoin and restrain the said city <em>of </em>Petersburg from selling said stock winch had been hypothecated as collateral security for the payment of said note, until it should be determined what was the character and nature of the-3,235 shares of stock sold and now held by said city as collaterals (above referred to), whether the same was common stock or guaranteed and preferred stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The formal prayer of the bill (after convening all the parties interested) was to enjoin and restrain the city of Petersburg both from instituting suit on said note and from selling said stock; and the court was asked to-enter its decree \u201c determining and establishing the true character and status of the aforesaid 3,235 shares of stock, and what are the rights and privileges, preferences and advantages appertaining and belonging thereto, and what are the rights and duties of the holders and owners of said 3,235 shares of stock, and of the Petersburg railroad company and its officers and agents in respect to the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">. An injunction was awarded in accordance with the prayer of this bill filed by Ragland, and after protracted proceedings and most voluminous depositions, the circuit court determined and adjudicated the very points submitted to it by said bill and proceedings under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>It is now insisted by Ragland, who filed this hill asking for an adjudication of these questions, and who, of all the parties, is the only appellant, that the circuit court erred in not dismissing his bill at the same time the original bill was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In other words, after invoking and receiving the extraordinary jurisdiction in his behalf of said circuit court by way of injunction, and asking the adjudication of the court upon the questions he submitted to it in his bill, he now insists the court had no jurisdiction to pass upon the questions submitted alone by him, and that the dismissal of the original bill carried with it the dismissal of his cross-bill also.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The court is of opinion, that the dismissal of the original bill in this case did not carry with it necessarily a dismissal also of the cross-bill. Indeed it would have been error to have dismissed the latter bill without adjudicating the questions therein submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Whether the bill filed by Ragland be regarded simply as a cross-bill, or as a cross-bill in the nature of an original bill, the circuit court had jurisdiction to pass upon and adjudicate the questions submitted to it in that bill, and to retain it for that purpose after the dismissal of the original bill; and such dismissal did not oust said court of its jurisdiction. A cross-hill is generally brought for one of two purposes, either to obtain a necessary discovery of facts in aid of the defense to the original bill, or to obtain full relief to all parties touching the matters of the original bill. A cross-bill is also necessary to enable a defendant to have a decree against a co-defendant. Story\u2019s Eq. PI. \u00a7\u00a7389, 392. In 2 Barb. Ch. Pract., p. 129, itissaid: \u201c The connection of the matter of across-bill, be it <em>per se </em>legal or equitable, with the subject matter of the original bill, gives the court jurisdiction of the cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>bill, 'of which it cannot he ousted by a dismission of the . . , , \u201e original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"ApK\">A cross-bill is proper whenever the defendants, or any Qr gp-pgj, 0f them, have equities arising out of the subject matter of the original suit which entitle them to affirmafive relief which they cannot obtain in that suit. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>14 Illi. R. 229; <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Wickliffe, </em>1 Dana R. 589. A cross-bill is always necessary when the defendant is entitled to some positive relief beyond what the scope of the complainant\u2019s suit will afford him. 2 Barb. Ch. Pr. 129; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Story, </em>2 Paige R. 594. The affirmative relief sought by Eagland, one of the defendants in the original bill and the sole plaintiff in cross-bill, was to enjoin the sale of the stock which he had hypothecated as collateral security with the city of Peters-burg, at least, until the character of that stock as \u201c preferred\u201d or \u201ccommon\u201d stock could be determined by adjudication of the court. This was so connected with the matter of the original bill as to be a proper subject of a cross-bill, but at the same time a matter of which the jurisdiction of the court could not be ousted by a dis-mission of the original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">It is insisted, however, by one of the learned counsel for the appellees, that the city of Petersburg, whom the plaintiff in the cross-bill seeks to enjoin, was not a party to the original bill, and that indeed the so-called cross-bill must be treated as an original bill, and has none of the features of a cross-hill, because it makes new parties and introduces new and independent matter. It is true that in the original bill the city of Petersburg is not formally made a party defendant and called upon to answer-; but the city of Petersburg does come in and answer the bill. \"Whether it filed a formal petition, as it might have done, and asked to be made a party to a suit in which its interest were so vitally affected, the record does not dis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>dose; but the record does show that an answer to the original bill was filed by the city of Petersburg, and that the case was brought on to be heard, among other papers in the cause, upon the answer of the-city of Petersburg, and throughout the case was treated as a party to the suit. But conceding that Kagland\u2019s bill must be held to be an original bill, and not a cross-bill; still,in the view we take of the case, the circuit court of the city of Biehmond had jurisdiction of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The argument is that if the bill be treated as an original bill at the time it was filed, the state of Virginia had parted with her interest in the stock in question, having released it in favor of the city of Petersburg, and that therefore the board of public works was not a proper or necessary party; and that there was nothing left to which the jurisdiction could attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">It is true that the state had in October, 1873, released its mortgage on the stock which was pledged by the City of Petersbnrg on the 27th of May, 1850, to indemnify the state against any loss it might sustain in consequence of its guarantee of the bonds of said city; but it is also true that the state held a mortgage \u201c on the whole property, real and personal, of which the Petersburg railroad company were the owners,\u201d authorized and required to be taken by the board of public works <em>under the act of March 25th, </em>1843. At the time of the filing of Bag-land\u2019s bill, whether there was a subsisting mortgage in favor of the state or not, the state being the mortgagee in a mortgage executed as directed by the board of public works, and whether it had been released or not, it was still a question in which the state was interested, and the board of public works was therefore a \u201cnecessary and proper party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The court is therefore of opinion that the circuit court of the city of Bichmond had jurisdiction to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>and adjudicate tlie questions raised in the cross-bill filed by Reuben Ragland, and that the dismission of the original bill by the court did not oust the jurisdiction of the court as to the matters presented by the cro.ss-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">It is a noteworthy fact, and one to us incomprehensible, that of all the parties to the original and cross-bills, the only one who now questions the jurisdiction of the circuit ccurt is the party who came into that court invoking its jurisdiction for relief, and asking its protection by way of injunction, and a determination of the character of the stock before it should be sold to prevent a sacrifice, <em>now </em>when the injunction has been awarded, and the very question submitted by his bill has been adjudicated, objects that the court was <em>without jurisdiction, </em>and that it was error in the court below not to have dismissed his own bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\"We think the circuit court was right in retaining the cross-bill and adjudicating the questions raised by it. All the parties interested were before the court. It had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties. It ought not, after protracted and costly litigation, to have dismissed the cross-bill and turned the parties over to another tribunal to litigate the same questions. In furtherance of a favorite maxim of courts of equity, it ought to have put an end to the litigation between the parties, having all the parties before it and doing justice to all. See <em>Rhea </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>28 Gratt. 678; <em>Mettart </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>18 Gratt. 231; <em>Ctarke </em>v. <em>Long, </em>4 Rand. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The court is further of opinion that there is no error in the decree of the circuit court in dissolving so much of the injunction order as enjoins and restricts the city of Petersburg from further poseeution of the action of debt brought by said city of Petersburg as plaintiff, aud now pending m the hustings court of the city of Peters-burg against Reuben Ragland, Lancaster, Brown &amp; Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>T.

And this court concurs with the circuit court of the city of Richmond in the opinion that the thirty-two hundred and thirty-five shares of the capital stock of the Petersburg railroad company, in the bill and proceedings mentioned and embraced in certificate number seven hundred and forty-three, issued by.said company, and now held by said city as collateral security for the note of said Ragland and others, and which was derived originally from the state of Virginia, \u2018is entitled to a dividend of one and one-half per <em>cent, </em>per share semi-annually, to be paid out of any earnings of the said company, and that in the event of any semiannual dividends being declared upon the common stock \u25a0of said company exceeding said one and one-half <em>per cent, </em>the said stock is entitled, in addition to said one and one-half per <em>cent </em>chargeable upon the gross earnings of said company, to receive out of the net earnings of said company a sum sufficient to make its aggregate dividend equal to that received by other stockholders, and that in ease of default of the company to pay said one and one half <em>per cent </em>semi-annually, the board of public works may be required to foreclose the mortgage made to secure said payment and to realize by a sale of the cor porate property in said mortgage mentioned the sum ox \u2022one hundred and sixty-three thousand five hundred dol lars, to be divided ratably among the holders of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>thirty-two hundred and thirty-five shares of the said stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">This court, adopting the views of the said circuit court . expressed in the clear and able opinion filed with the record in this cause, is of opinion that there is no error in the decree of the said circuit court, and that the same he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Staples and Burks, J\u2019s, concurred in the opinion of Christian, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
