Taylor, auditor of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>accounts, filed her bill in the circuit court of Charlotte county, in which it was stated that at the May term, 1874, of said court the Commonwealth suing at the relation of \"William Cardwell, late treasurer (since dead), recovered a judgment on the law side of the court against one Peyton E. Ford, collector of Madison township, in Charlotte county, and A. 13. Paris, A. D. Ford, J. O. Snell, C. M. Pugh, and F. G-. Uortli, securities on his official bond, for the sum of $1,354.29, with interest from the 2d of June, 1874, and $12.50 costs; that execution was sued out on this judgment, and returned no effects: that four of the defendants had personal estate and one of them real estate; and that Paris hacl left tlie state, leaving all his property encumbered by prior liens; that the said defendants, however, claim that their said estates are not liable for the said debt, judgment and execution, because of section 1, article xi of the constitution of the state, giving $2,000 homestead exemption to debtors, and they have filed their deeds-claiming the benefit of said provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-9\">The plaintiff claimed that the said judgment and fi. <em>fa. </em>constitute valid liens upon the property of these debtors, and making Peyton E. Ford and his said sureties defendants, prayed that they might be required to discover what estate they have, and what they had at the date of the execution aforesaid, both real and personal, and that the same might be subjected to the payment of the judgment aforesaid, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-10\">Peyton E. Ford answered the bill. lie insisted that the judgment against him was for Cardwell, and that he had made payments to Cardwell\u2019s administrator nearly equal to the balance due upon the judgment at Card-well\u2019s death. He insists that under the statute a collector of revenue is not authorized to settle with the auditor; that the collector is required to settle with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>treasurer of the county, from whom the collector receives the revenue, and to whom he gives his receipt; and it is made the duty of the treasurer to proceed against him when he is in default, to recover by execution or otherwise, and pay over in thirty days to the auditor. And, of course, if the treasurer dies before he finally settles with the auditor, it is the duty of his personal representative to do so; and of necessity the personal representative has the right to make the collector settle with him, since his decedent is charged with all taxes placed in the hands of collectors, and is required to account for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-4\">The sureties demurred to the bill for want of equity. They also answered, relying upon the payments made by their principal to the administrator of Cardwell, and insisting that if there was anything due upon the judgment it was due to Cardwell\u2019s administrator, and not to the .auditor of public accounts, and that the administrator alone had the legal power to enforce the collection of the same by law. They, also claimed their homestead exemption in the property set apart by them, and insisted that as sureties of the collector they did not come within any of the exceptions stated in the constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-5\">The evidence in the case is stated by Judge <em>Burls </em>in his opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-6\">The cause came on to be heard on the 25th of Sep- \u25a0 tember, 1877, when the court made a decree by which the demurrer to the bill was overruled; but it was held that the constitutional provision in relation to homestead exemptions applied to the state; and that the third exception to the xith article of the constitution was personal to the defaulting officers, &amp;c., and does not apply to their sureties. And therefore that the said sureties were entitled to their homestead exemption against the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>wealth of Virginia. And thereupon the Commonwealth suing, &amp;c., applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b710-9\"><em>The Attorney General </em>and <em>W.

The act adopts the language of the constitution, and need not be further noticed. It may be found in chapter 183 of the Code of 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The first section of the article is in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">\u201c \u00a7 1. Every householder or head of a family shall be entitled, in addition to the articles now exempt from levy or distress from rent, to hold exempt from levy, seizure, garnisheeing, or sale under any execution, order or other process, issued on any demand for any debt heretofore or hereafter contracted, his real and personal estate, or either, including money and debts due him, whether heretofore or hereafter acquired or contracted, to the value not exceeding two thousand dollars, to be selected by him; provided that such exemption shall not extend to any execution, order, or other process issued on any demand in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">\u201c 1st. For the purchase price of said property, or any part thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201c 2d. For services rendered by a laboring person or a mechanic. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201c 3d. For liabilities incurred by any public officer, or officer of a court, or any fiduciary, or any attorney at law, for money collected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201c 4th. For a lawful claim for any taxes, levies, or assessments accruing after the first day of -Tune, -eighteen hundred and sixty-six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201c 5th. For rent hereafter accruing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">\u201c 6th. For the legal or taxable fees of any public officer, or officers of a court, hereafter accruing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">The language of this section is certainly very broad and comprehensive, and the constitution, in express terms, requires that all the provisions of the article shall be construed liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof may be fully and perfectly carried out. (\u00a7 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">One of the intents, manifested in the plainest terms, was to apply the exemption right to debts contracted before the adoption of the constitution. This particular intent was defeated because the clause designed to give it effect, was to that extent in violation of the constitution of the United States. It was so held by this court in the <em>\u201cHomestead Cases,\u201d </em>22 Gratt. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Was it intended to embrace the state within these sweeping provisions ? It is a general rule of great antiquity, founded in the highest public policy, that general statutes do not bind the sovereign unless the intent be manifested by express words or by necessary implication; and while it is said that the sovereign is impliedly bound by statutes passed for the public good, the preservation of public rights aud the suppression of pulic wrongs, the relief and maintenance of the poor, the genial advancement of learning, religion and justice, or for the prevention of fraud; yet I apprehend that where such statutes are general, the implication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>unless irresistible, does not extend to divest the sovereign of any right, privilege, title or interest. Brown\u2019s Legal Maxims, 76, 77; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Herron, </em>20 Wall. U. S. R. 251, 263; <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Gratt. 494, 496; <em>Levasser </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>11 Gratt. 572, 577; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>8 Bush. Ky. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">This rule of construction applies as well to a written constitution, framed by delegates of the people in convention, as to an act passed bjT an ordinary legislature; and if there were no exceptions engrafted upon the section under consideration, standing alone, under the rule, notwithstanding the broad language employed, and the general intent manifested to secure a benefit to the more needy portion of the community, the state would not be construed to be within its operation; for such a construction would divest important public rights and interests, and the state is not embraced either by express words or by necessary implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">But we are not at liberty to apply the rule to the purview or body of the section without regard to the proviso attached to it. The whole section must be construed together, so as to give full effect, if possible, to every part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">\u201cThe proviso,\u201d says Chief Justice <em>Marshall, </em>\u201cis generally intended to restrain the enacting clause, and to except something which would otherwise have been within it, or in some measure to modify the enacting clause.\u201d <em>Wayman </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>10 Wheat. R. 1, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">Substantially the same definition is given by Mr. Justice Ba<em>ldwin </em>in 15 Peters R. 423. \u201cThe office of the proviso,\u201d says he, \u201cgenerally is either to except something from the enacting clause, to restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of it, as extending to cases not intended to be brought within its purview.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The proviso to section 1, article xi, contains six distinct clauses, each of which is plainly an exception to or limitation or qualification of something contained in the body of the section. The purview or enacting part confers the power or grants the right to claim exemption from levy, &amp;c., on <em>any </em>execution, order, or other process, issued on <em>any </em>demand for <em>any </em>debt (heretofore or) hereafter contracted. The proviso declares that <em>such </em>exemption shall not extend to <em>any </em>demand in the five cases enumerated, the fourth of which is \u201cfor a lawful claim for any taxes, levies, or assessments accruing after the-first day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.\u201d This clause (the fourth) excepts from the operation of the-general grant a lawful claim for <em>any taxes. </em>This exception by its very terms necessarily includes the Commonwealth, and therefore necessarily implies that under the wTords \u201cany demand for any debt\u201d in the enacting part of the section, it rvas intended to embrace the Commonwealth as well as her citizens; otherwise there would have been no necessity for the exception so far as the Commonwealth is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Ii was argued with much force by the attorney-general' that taxes assessed hy the commonwealth for the support of government and for the public needs, retained the-character of taxes from the time of assessment until paid into the public treasury; that they were no less taxes in: the hands of the tax-collector than they were in the hands of the tax-payer, and that the judgment in this case against the collector and his sureties was a claim fbr taxes within the meaning of the 4th section. I am not prepared to say that this is not a sound argument. The-demand of the state was for the amount due for taxes placed in the officer\u2019s hands for collection. Such wras the-tenor of the notice on which the motion was made, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>such the character of the judgment rendered. Why, then, is not the judgment \u201ca lawful claim for taxes ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">If, however, this demand of the state is not within the operation of the 4th exception (and I incline to think it is), I am still of opinion that it is within the third exception, which excludes the right to claim the exemption as against any demand for liabilities incurred by any public officer. The phrase, \u201cliabilities incurred by any public officer,\u201d refers to the demand to which the exception applies rather than to the delinquent. The demand is not described as a demand against the officer, hut it is \u201c any demand\u201d for the liabilities incurred, and therefore en\\braces a dema\u00f1d against any and all persons who share the liabilities. As soon as there is a breach of the condition of the officer\u2019s bond, he and his sureties, by one .and the same act, become liable to the party injured. The liability incurred by the officer is at the same time incurred by the surety. The same principle applies to the other classes mentioned in the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">The exclusion established by this clause and all the \u25a0other clauses of the. proviso, is not intended to punish the parties excluded, but manifestly to secure a benefit to others. The first clause is intended to protect the vendor of property by not allowing the withdrawal of such property from liability for \u201c the purchase price; \u201d the second, to favor the laboring person or mechanic; the third, to preserve the rights of creditors and claimants against officers and others named; the fourth, to ensure to the state, counties and principalities accountability for taxes, liens and assessments; the fifth, to protect landlords; and the sixth, to secure to officers their fees; and it is to be kept in mind that to these clauses we are required by\" the seventh section of the article to give the same liberal construction that we give to other parts of the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>It was held by this court in <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>that the surety of a public officer was not barred \u2022of his right to a discharge in bankruptcy, under the bankrupt act of 1841, by reason of the defalcation of liis principal; that the exception under said act against a \u2022defaulting officer was personal, and was intended to withhold from him a benefit given to other\u2019s, because he was a defaulter, and that the policy of the exception did not extend to the innocent surety. It is contended by the learned counsel of the appellees that the like construction should be given to the third clause of the proviso under consideration. \"We find no fault with that decision, but we think it does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The clause referred to (the third), as before stated, was not, in our judgment, intended to punish the defaulting \u2022officer or fiduciary, as in the case of the bankrupt, but rather to preserve the security of his creditors, and require \u25a0a fulfilment of his obligations to them, and in that view \u25a0and to that end should \u25a0 receive a liberal construction. Moreover, a very slight examination of that portion of the bankrupt act, to which the decision refers, will show that the exception as to the defaulting officer was manifestly intended to be personal as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The language of the act, describing persons who might become voluntary bankrupts, is \u201c all persons whatsoever residing in any state, district, or territory of the United States, <em>oxoing debts </em>which shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation <em>as a public officer,\u201d </em>&amp;e. Owen on Bankruptcy, Appendix, p. 49..</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">This exception could not be extended to the surety without doing violence to the language employed. The person excepted is the public officer owing debts created by his defalcation as such officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">It was further argued by the learned counsel for the appellees that the construction contended for by him has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>received legislative sanction in the act approved February 2d, 1875, (Acts of 1874-75, p. 53), requiring a waiver of the benefit of homestead exemption in the bonds of officers and fiduciaries. It is a sufficient answer to say that there has been conflict of opinion as to the proper construction to be given to the clause of the constitution under consideration, and it was therefore doubtless deemed wise and prudent by the general assembly, out of abundant caution, if for no other reason, that the waiver should be provided for. It could do no-harm at least, and, in certain contingences, might prevent much mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Our reasoning has led us to the conclusion that the sureties in this case are not entitled to their homestead exemptions against the appellant\u2019s judgment, that the circuit court of Charlottee county erred in its decree, holding that they were so entitled, and that said decree should therefore be reversed and annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Keaching this conclusion, the cause might be remanded without saying more, but for certain objections urged by the counsel for the appellees to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed with the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">The bill in this case was filed in the name of the Commonwealth, at the relation of \"William F. Taylor, auditor of public accounts. The appellees demurred to the bill, and also excepted in their answer to the prosecution of the suit by the auditor as without authority. If the judgment sought to be enforced by the bill is a judgment on behalf of the Commonwealth, there can be no doubt the auditor had the right to file such a bill as was filed to enforce payment thereof to the Commonwealth. Code of 1873, ch. 40. .</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">If I did not misapprehend the argument of the counsel for the appellees, they claim that the judgment was not a judgment on behalf of the Commonwealth, but in fact a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>judgment on behalf of William Cardwell, late treasurer of Charlotte county, and therefore it could not be enforced by the auditor as a judgment of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The judgment was recovered on motion in the circuit court of Charlotte. The record shows that the notice of the motion was given in the name of the \u201c Commonwealth of Virginia, <em>proceeding by </em>William Cardwell, late treasurer of Charlotte.\u201d This notice and motion were in strict conformity to section 23, chapter 46, Code of 1873, which, as far as necessary to be quoted, is in these words: \u201c If said taxes and levies are not paid and the insolvent lists returned, certified by the judge of the county, to the treasurer, by the first day of March, it shall be the duty of the treasurer to <em>proceed. </em>against the collector and his sureties upon his bond, by motion, if it be for taxes, <em>in the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia,\" </em>&amp;c. The section further provides that the motion shall be heard by the county or circuit court of the county upon ten days\u2019 notice in writing, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The first entry of the motion on the records of the circuit court gives the style of the case thus: \u201cCommonwealth for William Cardwell, treasurer of Charlotte county, against P. E. Pord, collector,\u201d &amp;c., (naming the \u2022other defendants). The style of the case in the judgment entered is, \u201c Commonwealth of Virginia for, &amp;c., .against P. E. Pord, collector,\u201d &amp;c., (naming the defendants as before). Then follows the judgment in these w-ords: \u201c This day came again the parties by their attorneys, and the defendants say they will not further defend this motion; therefore it is considered by the court that the <em>plaintif </em>recover against the said defendants the sum of $1,354.29, without damages, -with interest from 2d \u25a0day of June, 1874, till paid, and the costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>This is -a judgment on behalf of the plaintiff; the-Commonwealth is the plaintiff, and the judgment was-rendered by a court having jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">It is further objected that if the judgment is a judgment on behalf of the Commonwealth, the circuit court of Charlotte had no jurisdiction of the bill to enforce it. This position is not tenable. Except in cases where it is. otherwise specially provided, the Commonwealth may prosecute her suits in any of the courts in which other-parties may prosecute suits of like character. If the judgment in this case were a judgment on behalf of' 'William Cardwell, as contended, his personal representative could have filed a bill to enforce it in the circuit court of Charlotte. The judgment being on behalf of\" the Commonwealth, the suit to enforce it was properly brought in the same court. Code of 1873, ch. 166. The restriction imposed by the fourth clause of the 1st section of this chapter applies only to actions at law or suits, in equity instituted on behalf of the Commonwealth <em>in the name of the attorney^general, </em>or when it may be-necessary or proper to make certain public officers or public corporations defendants. This will be rendered apparent by reference to the act approved March 22, 1873, (Acts of 1872-73, ch. 215, p. 195, Code of 1873, ch. 166,) and comparing the 4th clause of section 1,-as-therein contained, with the corresponding clause and section of the Code of 1860. It will be seen that the-words \u201cor otherwise\u201d are omitted in the said act of March 22, 1873. The restriction in the 14th clause, section 1, chapter 166, Code of 1873, does not apply to a suit in equity, such as this is, in the name of the-Commonwealth, <em>at the relation of the auditor of public accounts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">It is further and finally objected, that the demurrer to the bill should have been sustained and the bill dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>missed, on the ground that the appellant\u2019s remedy was at law and not in equity. Under chapter 40, Code of 1873, the Commonwealth could doubtless have proceeded, as therein prescribed, by execution to seize and sell the property, real and personal, of the defendants in the judgment; but, under the circumstances of this case, we do not regard this a plain, complete and adequate remedy. 2 Rob. Prac. (old ed.) 1; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Juris. \u00a7 33. All of r the property was encumbered with homestead deeds, the claims under which involved questions of law which were new, and about which there was conflict of opinion in the circuit courts. To sell the property without first settling these questions and removing the obstructions to a fair sale, would have been prejudicial to the Commonwealth. It is very probable, indeed, that the property would have been sacrificed, and thus the debt of the Commonwealth might not have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The failure of the officer to comply with the 22d section of chapter 40, Code of 1873, did not affect the light of- the Commonwealth to pursue her remedy in a court of equity. Moreover, the right to sell the real estate of the defendants under execution did not deprive her of the right, if she elected to exercise it, to resort to a court of equity to subject such real estate to the lien of her judgment. Code of 1873, ch. 182, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">It would be premature for this court, at this stage of the case, to pass upon the claim of the appellees to credit on the judgment for payments alleged to have been .made.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The decree of the circuit court must be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to order proper inquiries and accounts, and for further proceedings, in order to final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Burks, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AUD6\">This day came again the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record of the decree aforesaid and the arguments of counsel, is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that the appellees, respectively, are not entitled under the constitution and laws of this state to hold any of their property or estate, real- or personal, \u25a0exempt from liability for the payment of the judgment \u25a0on behalf of the Commonwealth in the bill in this cause \u25a0mentioned, and that the several homestead deeds of the .appellees, respectively, set out in the record in this cause, .are void as to said judgment, and that the said decree is \u25a0wholly erroneous. It is therefore decreed and ordered, that the said decree be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellant the costs of the appellant expended in the prosecution of the appeal aforesaid .here; and this court, in the present condition of the proofs in the cause, not undertaking to decide and not \u2022deciding what credits, if any, the appellees are entitled to for payments alleged to have been made on said judgment, this cause is remanded to the said circuit court of \u2022Charlotte county, with instructions to order proper inquiries to be made and accounts to be taken touching .said alleged payments, and for further proceedings to be lad, in order to final decree in conformity with the \u25a0opinion and principles herein expressed and declared; which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court \u2022of Charlotte county.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
