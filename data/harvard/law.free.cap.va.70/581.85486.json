A motion was made to set aside the judgment as being contrary to the evidence, which was overruled; to which the defendant excepted and tendered her bill of exceptions, which was signed and sealed, and in which the court certified all the evidence adduced on the trial, which was in substance the following.

Taylor, one of the obligors on the bond; and said plaintiff introduced and read in evidence the statutes of the state of Texas, regulating the rate of interest at the date of tire bond and now, which allowed a rate of interest by \u2022contract of the parties not exceeding twelve <em>per centum per annum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-10\">The defendant introduced Fielding L. Taylor, a son of Fielding L. Taylor, one of the obligors to the bond, who testified that Thomas L. Taylor, who resided in Texas, came to Virginia in 1859 or 1860, when witness was about eleven years old, living wdth his father; that he understood that Thomas L. came to Virginia to borrow money; that his father went wdth Thomas L. to Texas about the last of January, 1860, but that John W. Backhouse did not go to Texas at that time; that he saw Backhouse every day or two while his father w-as in Texas, and that he could safely say that Backhouse was in Virginia at the date of the bond; that the waiting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tlie bond was in the handwriting of his father, and that his signature thereto was genuine; that he did not know whether Selden went to Texas when his father and Thomas L. Taylor went or not. The defendant then introduced a book containing printed forms of bonds and certain memoranda made upon the margin of the two-first pages, which the witness testified was the bond-book of his father; that it was .found at his late residence in Gloucester county, Va., and that the memoranda on the margin of the two first pages from which the bond was cut were all in the handwriting of his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-12\">The defendant also introduced Archibald Taylor, who-testified that his brothers, Thomas L. and Robert Tayloiy lived in Texas several years previous to 1860; that in-1859 they purchased land in Victoria county, Texas; that in the winter of 1859-60 Thomas L. came to Virginia to-borrow money to pay for this land; that he learned this-from conversations with his brothers, and also learned in the same way that Thomas did borrow money from Robert O. Selden and some from John <em>~W. </em>Backhouse, and that his brother, Fielding L., and said John 'W. Backhouse became his sureties; that his brothers, Thomas L. and Fielding, went away together about the last of January, 1860, but that Backhouse did hot go. He never heard of Backhouse\u2019s going to Texas. The bond-book showed that the bonds were cut from the first and second pages of said book, leaving the margins; that on the margin of the first page, on a line with the printed figures-\u201c18,\u201d was written the words \u201cJanuary 20th, \u201960;\u201d that immediately under the printed word \u201c dolls.\u201d was \u201c 1000; \u201d opposite the printed word \u201c drawer \u201d on the margin was-written \u201cThomas L.

Selden;\u201d and upon placing the printed bond in evidence in the book it was shown to have been cut from the second page thereof. It was admitted by the parties that Backhouse resided in the county of Gloucester, Va., and never went to Texas. It was also admitted that the obligor, Fielding L., was, in 1859 and 1860, a resident of Gloucester, and did not change his residence, and that Selden, at the time of the execution of the bond, was also a citizen and resident of said county of Gloucester, Va., and the court certified that this was all the evidence in the case. The defendant obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of said circuit court of Gloucester.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-7\"><em>M. B. Seawell </em>and <em>John S. Wise, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-8\"><em>Ould Carrington, Friend Davis, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b609-9\">Anderson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The court is of opinion, that the whole matter of fact and law in this case having been submitted to the court, neither party requiring a jury, and the judgment of the court being upon the evidence which is certified in the bill of exceptions as all the evidence in the cause, the bill of exceptions must be regarded as a demurrer to the evidence, by the plaintiff in error. <em>Hodge\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank, Richmond, 22 </em>Gratt. 51; <em>Dobson </em>v. <em>Cul</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>pepper, </em>23 Gratt. 352. And the plaintiff in error, the exceptor, must be taken to have admitted, as in case of a demurrer to evidence, all that could be reasonably inferred by a jury from the evidence given by the plaintiff below, and to have waived all the evidence on'his part which conflicts with it, or which tends to establish a case inconsistent with the case proved by it. <em>Tutt </em>v. <em>Slaughter's adm'r, </em>5 Gratt. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">And the court being further of opinion, that the evidence of the plaintiff below, taken by itself and unimpeached and unaffected by contradictory evidence, or taken in connection with so much of the defendant\u2019s evidence as is not in conflict with it, to-wit: that the principal obligor in the bond resided at Victoria, <em>Texas; </em>that the bond is dated there; that the drafts, which are the consideration of the bond, were received there, and that the money borrowed was used there in paying for land which he and his brother had purchased there, justified the court in the inference that the contract was made at Victoria, Texas, <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Lazier &amp; als., </em>11 Gratt. 481), and was-to be performed there, and was consequently controlled and governed by the laws of Texas, which allowed a rate of interest, by contract of parties, not exceeding 12 <em>per centum per annum. Arrington </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>5 Ired. Law R. p. 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">Undoubtedly the bond was executed by Thomas L. Taylor, the principal debtor, at Victoria, Texas, and it is obligatory on him to pay the stipulated interest, which did not exceed the rate of interest allowed by the law of Texas. The other obligors resided in Virginia. It is conceded that they executed the bond as sureties of Thomas L. Taylor, and it is impossible to suppose that they could have 'contemplated the payment being made here by them, and not at Victoria, Texas, by the principal. Li the nature of things they expected only to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>secondarily liable, and they are liable for what the principal had bound himself. <em>Ruffin, </em>C. J., in case cited, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The court is of opinion, therfore, without deciding other interesting questions which were raised in the argument by the learned counsel, that the plaintiff in error, upon whom the onus rested to establish her plea of usury by conclusive testimony, has wholly failed to establish it, and that there is no error in the judgment of the circuit court, and that the same be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Judgment arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
