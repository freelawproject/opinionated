The rule as to service of subpoenas is the same under equity rule 15 as it has been heretofore, and does not affect the procedure prescribed in \u00a7 787 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 608 as to service of process by the marshal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b261-12\">Same \u2014 Exceptions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b261-13\">2. The court will designate some other person than the marshal to serve process, where the marshal himself is a party; and it has been held that in special eases the court may have witnesses subpoenaed under the direction of the court; but the matter of expense is not one calling for such special order.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b261-14\">Opinion filed May 14, 1913.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-15\"><em>Mr. U.

This particular rule, however, is the same as has been heretofore prevailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The general rule is that prescribed in \u00a7 787 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 608, directing the marshal to serve all process directed by him. It has been held that the marshal is an executive officer of the court, and is to serve process in court proceedings. Schwabacker v. Reilly, 2 Dill, 127, Fed Cas. No. 12,501.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">There seems to be two exceptions to this rule: The first is when the marshal himself is a party to the suit. In that case the court will designate some other person to serve process on the marshal himself. Simkins, Fed. Eq. Suit, 2d ed. p. 309. The other exception, based on state practice, is that in some cases witnesses may be subpoenaed by others than the marshal, under the direction of the court. See I Fed. Stat. Anno. p. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Nothing is shown in this case to take the proceeding out of the general rule as to service by the marshal, and the motion is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
