Under these circumstances, the principle of Paulsen v. Feroglio and note (46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 629 [73 Wash. 417, 131 Pac. 1163]) does not apply. It is difficult to see how the ship could be held responsible to a stevedore for the acts of another stevedore, both under the same foreman. Following the principles laid down in the former opinion, the libel must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
