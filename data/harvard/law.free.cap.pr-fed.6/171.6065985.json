Tbe fact that she is physically in tbe island now would not make her a resident, and tbe court would therefore bold that, for tbe purposes of this motion, she is a nonresident. Now, what tbe effect of that is, it is not necessary to say, but, under \u00a7 342 of tbe Code of Civil Procedure and tbe rule of court, tbe court bolds that she is a nonresident.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Of course, counsel understand that tbe court has nothing whatever to do with tbe parties to any particular case. I simply enforce tbe law. How it cuts one way or tbe other I do not know, and it would be none of my business to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">The court will make tbe order that tbe plaintiff make a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>posit or furnish security for all costs which may accrue in this case, and it would seem only right to follow the suggestion in \u00a7 342 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that all proceedings are stayed until that is done. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
