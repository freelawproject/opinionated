At first sbe pleaded not guilty, and afterwards, on consulting an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ney, asked in open court to change the plea to guilty, and her counsel requested the clemency of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The facts as stated to the court by the district attorney and assented to by the defendant\u2019s attorney would not call for any exercise of clemency if the defendant were a man. It may be that the application is made to the court in hopes that, on account of her sex, the defendant may receive a nominal punishment. In fact it is requested by her attorney that a punishment be affixed, but that the sentence be suspended upon good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The sole reason for the exercise of clemency is that the defendant is a woman. No one is more reluctant than the judge of this court to sentence a woman, or to see a woman appear as a prisoner at the bar. The question, however, is not one of reluctance, but of duty. There may be occasions where her sex makes a woman more easily tempted, or more apt to commit some particular offense; and in such a case, this fact should and would be taken into account in the imposition of punishment. But forging a $15 money order is not one of such cases, and the court believes that the course suggested by the defendant\u2019s counsel would have a bad public effect. The court thinks that if the prisoner is guilty of the offense, she should receive, despite her sex, substantially the same punishment as a man under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> But before imposing punishment, the court will permit the defendant, if she is so advised, to withdraw her plea of guilty, and plead not guilty, as she did at first.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">And now in open court the defendant asks leave to withdraw the plea of guilty, and enters a plea of not guilty, and the case is transferred to the Ponce division for trial at the Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ary term, since it appears that tbe defendant and tbe witnesses in tbe case reside in and near Ponce. Defendant\u2019s bond is fixed at $1,000, and tbe marshal is directed to take ber to Ponce, and if tbe bond is not given, to keep ber in proper custody there.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
