Even the fact that they differ and sometimes clash is not a reflection upon either one or the other. It is the duty of the court to keep this within limits. In their earnestness in presenting their case, there will be differences, and there may be words spoken in heat which would not be spoken otherwise. Eliminate that from the case, if there has been anything of the sort, and let us get down to the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">As most of you are aware, there are two kinds of instructions which the court gives you, \u2014 first, relating to cases in general, and then as to this case in particular. The first need not be repeated in detail, but I will call your attention to some of them in passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> In the first place, counsel on both sides are very apt to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and I think in this case did, tell you their belief that so and so was not to be believed, and that such and such a fact they believed. This of court is immaterial. It makes no difference what counsel believe. We assume that each one believes his own case, but that has nothing to do with you. The question is what do you believe about the facts of the case. In every case the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff. The plaintiff must make out his case. The defendant has nothing whatever to do but sit still, and, if the plaintiff does not make out his case, that is the end of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">This particular case is somewhat as follows. Taking the \u25a0complaint, you must believe, in order to find for the plaintiff, that on the evening of March 1, 1913, the \u201e plaintiff with her stepmother and father were proceeding along the public road with all due care and diligence, in compliance with the requirements of law. (I am reading from the complaint.) That the employees of the defendants, under the instructions of defendants, were driving a large herd of bulls in a negligent and improper manner; that the horse attached to the plaintiff's vehicle became frightened, and the defendants\u2019 peons did not exercise reasonable care in attempting to control the cattle. That the horse in consequence of this ran away, overturning the carriage, the plaintiff being thrown on her head, causing her injuries. As a result of this fall, the plaintiff remained many weeks in a state of insensibility, and, as a result of such injury suffered damages, not exceeding $50,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> That is substantially the case which is before you. That has to be proved, or the plaintiff has not made out her case. You are to be made to believe this, of course, by a preponder-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>anee of evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, \u2014 that is only in criminal cases, and does not come up in this court for some weeks. -If there are contradictions in the evidence, you should try, as far as you can, as reasonable men, to reconcile them. Do not lightly assume that a witness is stating an utruth. If, however, gentlemen, you come to the conclusion from the demeanor of the witness or from what he or she says, that he or she is lying, then you may disregard the testimony of that .witness altogether. Hot that you have to do it, because even a lying witness may tell some truth, but you are at liberty to let the lie affect the whole, because you might not be able to discriminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The absence of material evidence on the part of either side, where you might expect that party to be in possession of the evidence and be able to place it before you, is something that you may take into account. And negative evidence, of course, yon realize has not the same weight as positive evidence. Just by way of illustration, but not to fix your mind upon that particular fact, if one witness said that there was a light either on the carriage or carried by the men with the bulls, and another witness equally credible did not see the light, you would attach more importance to the positive testimony than to the negative, provided the witnesses were equally credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> An unfortunate incident arose during this case, in which something has been said about the intimidation of a witness, and the court would like to say that there are two elements to it. If such a thing occurred, it is a contempt of court, and the court would take care of it. That part is hot for the jury at all. If there has been intimidation of a witness by a party,'\u2014 and here the allegation is that the father of the plaintiff .did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>this,- \u2014 if from the evidence which I permitted to he brought before you, you think that there was any such intimidation, you will not go as far as counsel has suggested and visit it upon the plaintiff. If the plaintiff's father did any such thing, it is a reflection upon the plaintiff's ffather, who was a witness. If he would do that, you would be at liberty to consider that he might do other things, and let that reflect upon his credibility, whether you would believe what he says; but the court charges you that this is not to be visited upon the plaintiff. The court is, of course, not passing upon the fact whether there is any intimidation or not. It is for you to say, for the present purposes, whether you believe there was any or not. If you think it has been explained by the relations of the two witnesses prior to this time, it need not affect your deliberations one way or the other. So much, gentlemen, for what perhaps I could call instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">How as to a charge relating to this particular case. This is a suit for negligence, or rather for damages caused by the negligence of the defendants, and, as usual, there are three elements to be taken into account. This comes up under \u00a7\u00a7 1803 and 1804, rather familiar sections, of the Porto Pico Code, which are what I think and hope is the law all over the world, that anyone'is liable for the results of his negligent acts. And in this particular case there is the variation or additional element that a person who is conducting a business is liable for the acts of his servants or his employees in the pursuit of that business, and that is the claim hex-e. There is no allegation that the defendants themselves went out and upset the plaintiff's carriage. It is the question of whether they are liable for the acts of certain people, who, it is alleged,. did this.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> There are three elements, then: Eirst, you must be satisfied that there was injury to the plaintiff; second, that the injury was due to the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants; and third, supposing those two are granted, but not unless they are proved, then what amount of damages would you allow to the plaintiff <em>% </em>And you observe, gentlemen, I am not here to say, and do not at all undertake to say, that there was negligence on the part of the defendants. In other words, I am not instructing you to find one cent. In discussing the matter of damages, as I shall, it is simply on the supposition that you do find the first elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> How as to the injury to the plaintiff. I hardly think it can be said to be a disputed fact in the case that th\u00e9 plaintiff was injured, injured seriously for a while. If there is any question about that, the undisputed evidence is such that the court would be justified in saying that the plaintiff was injured on this occasion, injured by being thrown from a carriage, and picked up insensible, and remained insensible for some time. So that that element, need not be discussed. We all agree that there was injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\"><bracketnum>7.</bracketnum> The more serious question for us perhaps is, Was this injury caused by the negligence of the defendants or the defendants\u2019 agents ? It was, of course, not caused by the defendants personally, as I remarked. The question then is, supposing the injury was caused by bulls, as alleged in the complaint, were the defendants liable for that? In the first place the defendants deny that the injury occurred at all in the way in which it has been alleged, \u2014 I read to you from the complaint. I could read to you from the answer to the effect that one defense set up is that the accident did not occur in that way at all; that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>tiff\u2019s father was driving the vehicle negligently through a herd of bulls, rapidly, and that whatever happened was due thereto. And that would bring up an interesting question as to how far the plaintiff would be liable for the acts of her father. It is a question which has come up, I think, while some of you have been serving on the jury, and it is a much mooted question, as to how far a person who has been injured can be affected by contributory negligence, in this case, of the father. But, for the purposes of this case, the court will charge you that the plaintiff was identified with her father in this matter. Her father was driving the vehicle, and the plaintiff was there with him, and there is no evidence that the plaintiff objected in any way to the method of procedure. While it may not be altogether free from doubt, the court thinks it is justified under the facts of the case in charging you that the plaintiff and her father at tire time of the accident are to be considered as identified, and that, if there was negligence on the part of the father in driving through the bulls in a reckless manner, that is not the fault of the defendants, and should not be visited upon the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">That would be one defense, as set up in the answer, \u2014 that the occurrence did not happen in the way alleged in the complaint at ally that it was due to the negligence of the plaintiff herself, or of one with whom she was identified. If you believe this, of course you would not find for the plaintiff. A person cannot take advantage of his own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\"><bracketnum>8.</bracketnum> Another defense set up is that the bulls did not belong to the defendants, and that therefore the defendants are not liable for what was done by the bulls, admitting that they did cause the running away of the horse. . The court would charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>you that that would not in itself be a good defense. In the first place, you would take into account whether the bulls did or did not belong to the defendants. There is evidence tending to show a sale of these cattle on this very day to someone else, and if that other party had taken possession of the property, and his men were in control of it, the third party was responsible, and it goes without saying that the defendants would not be responsible for what the third party did. But if you find from the evidence that the possession had not been turned over; if you find from the evidence that the sale was not complete, that the money had not been paid,' \u2014 if that was a condition of the sale, \u2014 then the ownership would not have passed. But, going further, if the ownership had passed, the court charges you still that if the bulls were in the custody of the agents of the defendants, even if they had been sold, it is a question of what the agents of the defendants, what the peons did, \u2014 not what the bulls did, but what the peons did. And an important question, one of the crucial questions in the case for you, gentlemen, is, Whose peons were those? There is evidence that they were spoken of by the defendant\u2019s manager as his peons. But if for the purposes of this sale these peons were those of the third party, \u2014 Betancourt I believe his name was, \u2014 if they had become in any way his peons, if he was paying them, for instance, if they were subject to his control, the defendants would not be liable. As to whether that was so, you of course will take all the evidence into account. If he did not pay them, but paid the defendants for the services of the defendants\u2019 peons, that is one thing which you may take into account. If this third party directed them and paid them and assumed complete control, they would, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>tlie purposes of this cas\u00e9, be bis, and not the defendants.\u2019 That is a question -which you will have to determine from all the facts of the case. To whose control were they subject? The fact that Betancourt paid the defendants for the time of the defendants\u2019 peons would not make them Betancourt\u2019s peons, if you find that that was a fact. If the defendants had for the time being lost control of these peons, they were no longer their peons, were not subject to them, the defendants would not be liable. Suppose, gentlemen, that while conducting the cattle, Betancourt and the defendants had come along, and had found anything, we will suppose, out of the way, whom would the peons have obeyed in case an order was given to rectify the error ? Would it be Betancourt, or would it be the defendants ? That is something that you may take into account in determining whose agents they were. You are liable for the acts of your agents. How whose agents were these peons in this particular case? That, then, is the secpnd element of the case. Were the defendants negligent?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><bracketnum>9.</bracketnum> The third is, assuming simply for the sake of argument that the first two elements are true, what would be the measure of damages. This complaint sets out that a large sum of money had been paid for medical attention and so on. The plaintiff, however, has proved nothing of that sort. He has proved the attendance of physicians, I think five of them at one time, but there is no evidence that they charged anything; so that you cannot allow anything for the services of the physicians. It is the plaintiff\u2019s business to prove whatever damages she suffered. And so as to hospital bills, and so as to any expenditures of cash. There is no evidence whatever of anything of that sort in this case, and you cannot take such a claim into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The complaint says that, as a result of her injury, plaintiff has received an injury to the brain which has caused her to become an idiot, and that such condition of idiocy will in all probability continue permanent This remains in the complaint and it is for yon to say as to that particular element whether there is proof of it. Idiocy yon have heard defined by physicians in a very interesting way, as to how it shows itself, what causes it, and that it is permanent, and it is for you to say under that evidence whether you think that the plaintiff is an idiot, or will very probably become an idiot.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">10. The remaining element of injury would be this, suffering, \u2014 physical and mental. It is hard to discriminate between physical and mental suffering. Our bodies and our minds are never disassociated, but nevertheless there is a distinction between the two, and the complaint alleges and one side of the proof tends to show suffering; in fact this could not be avoided. I may say there is no question that there was suffering, and it is for you to say what amount of damages, provided always that the defendant is liable, what amount of damages would under the Porto Eican law compensate for that suffering. Gentlemen, there is no scale for suffering. I could not tell you, if the facts were conceded, what such suffering amounts to in dollars and cents. But still it is a matter which the jury can and must entertain. To remain insensible for months, to have some resulting injuries still existing, if you find that such is the case, cause damage, and it is for the jury to put some reasonable money equivalent upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\"><bracketnum>11.</bracketnum> It is only fair, however, gentlemen, to say this, \u2014 that excessive damages in any case should not be allowed. It is a question, under the Porto Eican Code, of equivalents, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>would be a fair compensation for the suffering, not anything beyond that, but whatever you may think would be an equivalent ; and if anything excessive were allowed in any case in this court, it would be the duty of the court, of course, to set aside that verdict. So that, not on that account, but because you are twelve men sworn to do your duty, and I know you will do your duty in the matter. I leave that to you, knowing that you will do your duty, just as I hope to do mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><bracketnum>12.</bracketnum> I have been asked, gentlemen, to give some charges, a large number of charges, and I would like to say to counsel that I have refused a great many of them, not because they are incorrect, but for the simple reason that the Federal court is not bound to repeat charges if they have been given in the course of the general charge. Refusal is really an assistance to the jury, because they might think there was some contradiction. So because a good many of these charges have been given, they are now refused. They are embraced in the general charge I have given. In fact, even some that I will give are probably embraced in the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\"><bracketnum>13.</bracketnum> To constitute the relationship of master and servant in so far as the liability of the former for the acts of the latter is concerned, there need be no actual contract of employment nor payment for the services. The relation of master and servant exists where the employer selects the workman, and may remove or discharge him for misconduct, and may order not only what work shall be done, but the mode and manner of performance. The power to control the alleged servant is the test of the existence of the relationship. 26 Oyc. 1519, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">\u00c1 person who avails himself of the temporary use of the services of a servant regularly employed by another person may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>be liable as master for tlie acts of such servant during tbe temporary service. Tbe test is whether in tbe particular service which he is engaged or requested to perform the servant continues liable to the direction and control of his original master, or becomes subject to that of the person to whom he is lent or hired or who requests his services. It is hot so much the actual exercise of control which is regarded, as the right to exercise such control. To escape liability, the original master must resign full control of the servant for the time being, it not being sufficient that the servant is partially under the control of a third person. Subject to these rules, the original master is liable where the control of the servant is retained by him. 26 Cyc. 1522, and cases cited. Stewart v. California Improv.
