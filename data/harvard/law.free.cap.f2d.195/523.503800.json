Reference to, and examination of, the authorities cited by appellant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but serves to reinforce that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\">. This section fixes July 1st of each year as the date for filing a sworn corporation report with the Secretary of State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\">. This section obliges each corporation required to file a report to pay a filing fee or tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">. This section provides: \u201cAny corporation failing to comply with the provisions of this law for six months shall not be permitted to maintain or defend any action in any court of this state until such reports are filed and all fees due under this chapter paid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\">. Briefly summarized, they are:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">(1) On July 1, 1949, plaintiff\u2019s annual report became due;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">(2) On July 21, it filed this suit;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">(3) On Jan. 1, 1950, it became delinquent in the payment of its corporation capital stock tax, which became due July 1, 1949;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">{4) On May 15, 1950, defendant for the first time filed and served an answer containing its fourteenth defense, that plaintiff was so delinquent and had forfeited its corporate charter privilege and therefore could not maintain the suit;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">(5) On June 14, plaintiff filed a motion to strike this and other defenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-21\">(6) On Sept. 13, 1950, defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, and on the same day offered for consideration an affidavit of the Secretary of State, dated Aug. 30, 1950, showing that plaintiff was in arrears in the payment of its annual corporation capital stock tax;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-22\">(7) On Sept. 13, 1950, plaintiff offered a telegram from R. A. Gray dated that day showing that plaintiff\u2019s report and all taxes due had been received; the affidavit and the telegram, the verity of the facts in which are admitted, were presented to, and received by, the court on that day but no action was taken until nearly a year later when, treating the motion for judgment on the pleadings as a motion for summary judgment, the court found the foregoing facts to be true and 'based on that finding entered judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-23\">.
