Federal jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship. Upon the conceded facts each party moved for summary judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was granted, D.C., 98 F.Supp. 781, and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">The question presented involves the interpretation of the following paragraph of the contract of insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-22\">\u201c6. This insurance covers, irrespective of percentage, all loss, damage or expenses caused by or resulting from the following enumerated perils from the time the property insured hereunder comes into the custody of and is at the risk of the Assured continuing until said property is delivered to consignee at destination: * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atx-dedup-0\">There follow eight \u201cperils\u201d clauses, the one relied upon by the plaintiff being</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-23\">\u201cd. Collision of vehicle, overturning or other accident to the conveyance ;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-24\">Specifically the question is the applicability of the aibove-quoted clause \u201cd\u201d to the conceded facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">The plaintiff, a common carrier by motor vehicle, accepted a turbine for transportation from Trenton, New Jersey, to Boston, Massachusetts, and issued its uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>straight bill of lading to the shipper. The top of the turbine extended above the top of the truck on which it was being carried and during the transportation came into contact with an overhead bridge, spanning a highway near Trenton. No part of the truck struck the bridge nor was the truck damaged in any way, but the turbine sustained damage; and in discharging its legal liability as common carrier the plaintiff was obligated to pay, and paid, the sum of $3,766.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In seeking the meaning of clause 6d our first task is to define the word \u201cconveyance.\u201d . Some of the modern dictionaries define the word to mean the act of transporting as well as the means by which transportation is effected. But in its context we think \u201cconveyance\u201d is used merely as a synonym for vehicle. If it meant the act of transporting, \u201ccollision of vehicle\u201d would be an unnecessary specification, and \u201coverturning\u201d a wholly inappropriate word to inject into the final clause. However, \u201cother accident to the conveyance\u201d (meaning vehicle) must have been intended to add something to \u201ccollision\u201d and \u201coverturning.\u201d We must ask ourselves whether the phrase in its ordinary meaning would cover a situation in which the load struck a bridge and incidentally no doubt brought the truck to a stop by the force of. the contact. The truck driver might well describe what had happened as an \u201caccident\u201d to his truck, though we doubt if he would say that his truck had had a collision. If the force of the contact between the turbine and the bridge had caused injury to the truck, however slight, the case would plainly fall within the phrase \u201cother accident to the vehi-ele.\u201d Cf. Freiberger v. Globe Indemnity Co., 205 App.Div. 116, 199 N.Y.S. 310. Even though the truck sustained no injury whatever, we regard it as extremely unlikely that the parties would have desired to differentiate the two- cases had they been foreseen. Why should they? The insurance does not cover injury to the truck but only the carrier\u2019s liability for damage to the cargo. That liability is the same whether or not the truck was injured by the force that damaged its cargo. We believe it reasonable to construe the policy to cover this peril whether or not the truck sustains damage. Finally, we think the situation one within the doctrine <em>contra proferentem </em>which applies with especial force to insurance contracts. See Clott v. Prudential Ins. Co., 114 N.J.L. 18, 175 A. 203, 205, affirmed, 115 N.J.L. 114, 178 A. 747 ; 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Turning to the authorities, it is conceded that New Jersey law is controlling but no similar case seems to have been decided there. In other jurisdictions, several insurance cases have arisen concerning injury to the load with no damage to the truck. Some allow recovery; others deny it. They are about evenly divided. None of those denying recovery is precisely in point because the policy sued on was limited to collisions, etc., and did not contain the clause \u201cother accident to the conveyance\u201d upon which we have relied. The cases which have allowed recovery are <em>a fortiori </em>authorities in favor of the case at bar because they also were limited to \u201ccollision\u201d perils.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">. Cases in which the insured recovered: C. &amp; J. Commercial Driveway, Inc., v. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Fire Corp., 258 Mich. 624, 242 N.W. 789; Bucks County Construction Co. v. Alliance Insurance Co., 162 Pa.Super. 153, 56 A.2d 338; Gould Morris Electric Co. v. Atlantic Fire Ins. Co., 229 N.C. 518, 50 S.E.2d 295 ; Jorgenson v. Girard Fire and Marine Insurance Co., 229 Minn. 48, 38 N.W.2d 209; Continental Ins. Co. v. Griffin, Tex. Civ.App., 218 S.W.2d 350. Cases in which the insured did not recover: Mendelsohn v. Automobile Ins. Co., 290 Mass. 228, 195 N.E. 104; Hamilton Trucking Service, Inc., v. Automobile Ins. Co., Wash., 237 P.2d 781; Barish-Sanders Motor Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., 134 Neb. 188, 278 N.W. 374; Myers v. Continental Ins. Co., 72 Pa.Dist. &amp; C. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Compare Inman v. Life &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., 164 Tenn. 12, 45 S.W.2d 1073, 1074. There the policy insured against collision or \u201cany accident to any * * * automobile\u201d. The court denied the insured recovery when he was killed by an underpass while riding atop furniture loaded on a truck. No part of the truck or load touched the underpass. This suit, however, was on an accident policy on the life of decedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
