McLeod, deceased, hereafter called decedent, brought an action against appellee, the United States, to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>cover an overpayment of estate tax on decedent\u2019s estate. The parties agreed that the tax was overpaid, and that appellant was entitled to recover the overpayment, but they disagreed as to the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Appellant and decedent were married in California on October 5, 1934, and resided in California until decedent\u2019s death on May 12, 1946. At the time of decedent\u2019s death, ceitain property, hereafter called the joint property, was owned and held by appellant and decedent. Appellee contended that, in determining the value of decedent\u2019s gross v\u00e1state for purposes of the tax, the value of the joint property at the time of his death was includible to the extent of the interest therein held by him and appellant; which is to say, appellee contended that the entire value of the joint property was in-cludible. Appellant contended that the value of the joint property was includible only to the extent of the interest therein held by decedent, which she contended was a one-half interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">It was stipulated that, if appellee\u2019s contention was correct, appellant should have judgment for $1,553.07, with interest, and that, if appellant\u2019s contention was correct, she should have judgment for $3,344.44. The District Court agreed with appellee and accordingly gave appellant judgment for $1,553.07, with interest. From that judgment appellant appeals, contending that it should have been for $3,344.44, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The question here is, To what extent was the value of the joint property at the time of decedent\u2019s death includible in determining the value of his gross estate for purposes of the tax?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">It was stipulated that the joint property was acquired by appellant and decedent \u201cwith funds which consisted wholly of community property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2and were accumulated by them as community property,\u201d but that, at the time of decedent\u2019s death, the joint property was held by appellant and decedent as joint tenants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in effect, it was stipulated that the joint property was property which appellant and decedent had acquired as community property and had transferred to themselves as joint tenants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No part of appellant\u2019s or decedent\u2019s interest in the joint property or in the funds with which the joint property was acquired was shown to have been received as compensation for personal services actually rendered by appellant. Instead, it was stipulated that \u201csaid funds ini their entirety were derived originally from compensation for personal services actually rendered by the decedent during his said marriage to [appellant].\u201d Therefore, in determining the value of decedent\u2019s gross estate for purposes of the tax, the value of the joint property at the time of his death was includible to the extent of the interest therein held by him and appellant; which is to say, the entire value of the joint property was includible. See \u00a7 811(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by \u00a7 402(b) of the Revenue Act of 1942; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 81.22 of Treasury Regulations 105, as amended by Treasury Decision 5239,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> March 10, 1943, 8 F.R. 3024, 26 C.F.R., Cum.Supp. \u00a7 81.22; Estate of Heidt v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 170 F.2d 1021, affirming 8 T.C. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">Appellant contends that \u00a7 81.22 of Treasury Regulations 105, as amended, was inconsistent with \u00a7 811(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by \u00a7 402(b) of the Revenue Act of 1942, and hence was invalid. There is no merit in this contention. See Estate of Heidt v. Commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">Appellant contends that Estate of Heidt v. Commissioner, supra, was inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>with and was, in effect, overruled by Estate of Sullivan v. Commissioner, <em>9 </em>Cir., 175 F.2d 657; Rickenberg v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 177 F.2d 114; and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mills, 9 Cir., 183 F.2d 32, 19 A.L.R.2d 856. There is no merit in this contention. The Heidt case, like the case at bar, involved \u00a7 81.22 of Treasury Regulations 105, as amended by Treasury Decision 5239. That section was not involved, mentioned or referred to in the Sullivan case, the Rickenberg case or the Mills case. Hence the Sullivan, Rickenberg and Mills cases are not in point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">.
