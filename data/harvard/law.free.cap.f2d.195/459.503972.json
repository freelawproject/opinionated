This specification is in effect that the court erred in determining as matter of law, upon the basis of Exhibits \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d, that defendant was not responsible in damages for the acts of the crew of the Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-18\">Recognizing that the case is in small compass, appellant treats it in its brief as presenting only this single question: Does the General Agency agreement between ap-pellee and the United States relieve the agent of its liability at common law for its own negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-19\">The appellee does not at all contest the correctness of appellant\u2019s legal theory, that an agent cannot, by taking an indemnity from its principal, relieve itself from liability to a third person caused by its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>fault. It denies, though, that this is the issue for decision. Insisting, instead, that this statement of it not only hegs the whole question but flies in the face of the controlling authorities, dealing with agency agreements of the kind involved here, it urges upon us that the appeal presents two quite different questions. As it states them, these are:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">1. Whether appellant\u2019s remedy by suit against the United States under the Public Vessels and Suits in Admiralty Acts, <em>46 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 781 et seq., 741 et seq., is an exclusive one, precluding suits against an agent of the Government on account of acts alleged to be within the scope of its agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">2. Whether it is open to appellant, contrary to the interpretation given the government standard form GAA 4-4-42 agency agreement in Caldarola v. Eckert, 332 U.S. 115, 67 S.Ct. 1569, 91 L.Ed. 1968, and other cases following that decision to undertake to prove that a particular agent, appellee herein, is responsible for the acts of the Government\u2019s civil service master and crew whose supervision and control was outside the scope of its agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Pointing out that appellant has timely brought a valid suit against the United States, under the Public Vessels and Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C.A. 741, and setting out the statutes and regulations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it deems applicable, appellee argues with vigor and confidence: (1) that the acts furnish the exclusive remedy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the complaint should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction ; and (2) that if this is not so, the judgment was right because it is settled by the decisions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that, under the standard form of agreement employed in this kind of agency, the supervision and control of the civil service master and crew was outside the scope of appellee\u2019s agency, so that ap-pellee is not responsible for their acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Appellant, planting itself firmly on Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., 317 U.S. 575, 63 S.Ct. 425, 87 L.Ed. 471, and Hust v. Moore McCormack, 328 U.S. 707, 66 S.Ct. 1218, 90 L.Ed. 1534, urges upon us that the facts of this case bring in squarely within the rule of those cases, and the judgment dismissing the action must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">We do not think so. Putting to one side the fact that Hust v. Moore-Mc-Cdrmack has been expressly overruled in the McAllister case, and that the agency agreement, dealt with in Brady v. Roosevelt, supra, was of a completely different purport from that under which appellee was employed, we are in no doubt that the judgment must be affirmed because: (1) the remedy against the United States pn&gt;-vided by the Public Vessels and Suits in Admiralty Act is exclusive;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) if this is not so, the organization of government shipping operations excluded general agents, such as appellee, which was appointed to manage \u201cthe business\u201d as distinguished from \u201cthe operation\u201d of the vessel, from any authority and control over the civil service masters and crews who manned, navigated, and physically managed the vessels; and (3) nowhere in the GAA 4 4-42 general agency agreement, under which appellee acted here, is any language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>to be found amounting to a demise or delivery of the physical possession and control of the vessels to the general agent. Cf. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co. v. McAllister, note 4 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AdS\">Read and search it as one will, the agreement admits of but one interpretation, that the master, as the direct agent, and the employees of the United States, as operating owner, are in possession of the ship to the exclusion of the general agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">By the GAA 4 4-42 husbandry agreement, in contrast to the Roosevelt operating agreement, the United States retained navigation and management of the vessels for itself, and employed private operators, including berth agents, as well as general agents, not as independent contractors but as agents, only to&gt; operate certain aspects of the vessels\u2019 business, which may be assigned to it from time to time. The general agent, appellee here, was appointed to manage the \u201cbusiness of\u201d, not the \u201cvessels\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Only one who is owner or owner <em>pro hac </em>vice, operating the vessel, is liable for the acts of the master and crew in its navigation and management. Nothing in the undisputed facts, on which the motion for summary judgment was submitted and the judgment rested, supports or tends to support the view that appellee was such an owner, and so liable. Indeed, the showing made compelled a finding and judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-12\">.
