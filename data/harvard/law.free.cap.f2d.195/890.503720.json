The Collector answers that there was no such oral agreement, and moreover, that under Section 23(b) and the pertinent Treasury Regulations <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> no deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>tion is allowable where the bonds on which the state tax is paid do not contain a tax-free covenant; further that the payments in question we're not deductible as ordinary or necessary business expenses of the taxpayer under Section 23(a) (1) (A) of the Code \u2022since there was nothing in the record to show that the payments were ordinarily incurred or that they contributed to or benefited the taxpayer\u2019s business of publishing newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The District Court premised its judgment in favor of the Collector on the conclusion that the payments of the State tax were not \u201cinterest paid\u201d within the meaning of Section 23(b) because of the non-existence of a written tax-free covenant in the bonds and that further, the payments were not \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d under Section 23(a) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The facts as found by the District Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Taxpayer corporation was incorporated May 13, 1935, under the laws of Pennsylvania, its formation having resulted from the consolidation of two predecessor corporations (the Sharon Herald Publishing Company and the News Telegraph Company) which had been engaged in the publication of daily newspapers in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Four individuals held all of the capital stock of the Sharon Herald Publishing Company and three individuals held all of the capital stock of the News Telegraph Company. Upon incorporation, taxpayer corporation issued $117,500 seven per cent debenture bonds, 975 shares seven per cent preferred stock having $100 a share par value, and 2500 shares no par common stock to former stockholders of the predecessor companies. Three of the latter received all three securities; one received debenture bonds and preferred stock; one received preferred and common stock and two received only common stock.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The seven per cent debenture bonds did not contain a written covenant to pay the State tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">In 1937 taxpayer issued $215,000 new five per cent debenture bonds which were exchanged for the old $117,500 seven per cent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>bonds and $97,500 preferred stock. Since 1937 some of the original holders have died, their holdings being distributed to their heirs and estates, and additional bonds have been issued both to the original holders and to outsiders. During the taxable years taxpayer\u2019s outstanding bonds were held by approximately eighty individuals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">During the taxable years taxpayer paid the corporate loans tax imposed on its resident bondholders by the Pennsylvania Personal Property Tax Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The payments were made with the knowledge, consent and approval of the officers, directors, and stockholders of the taxpayer corporation. The five per cent debenture bonds did not contain a written covenant to pay the tax and the taxpayer did not by formal resolution agree to pay the tax imposed upon its resident bondholders by Section 17 of the Pennsylvania Personal Property Tax Act. The amounts paid were not tax payment levied or assessed against the corporate taxpayer by the Pennsylvania statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Existence of an agreement was not recognized in a formal manner until a resolution of taxpayer\u2019s\u2019board of directors, passed November 15, 1943, was formerly adopted by the stockholders on November 27, 1943. This action was taken to meet the objection raised by the Internal Revenue Bureau in disallowing the deductions for the taxable years. Thereafter, for the same purpose, a rider was attached to the outstanding debenture bonds stating that the state tax on the bond was assumed by the taxpayer corporation and would be paid by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">The amounts paid by taxpayer were paid from its own funds. The resident treasurer of taxpayer did not at any time assess the State tax against the resident holders of either the seven per cent or five per cent debenture bonds, nor did he notify, them that it had assessed and deducted the State tax on the bonds nor did it at any time deduct the amount of taxes from the interest due to the bondholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">The minutes of the taxpayer did not contain any reference to any undertaking by it to pay the State tax prior to adoption of the resolution in November, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The District Court found as a fact \u201c * * * the taxpayer orally obligated itself to pay the State taxes on the 1935 and 1937 bonds * * * and that the existence of such a corporate agreement has been established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">Further, in Paragraph 19 of its Findings of Fact the District Court specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-15\">\u201c19. The 5% debenture bonds issued by the plaintiff did contain an oral tax-free covenant to pay the tax imposed upon the resident bondholders by Section 17 of the Pennsylvania Personal Property Tax Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">With respect to the fact-finding stated, the District Court, however, concluded as a matter of law that under the pertinent Treasury Regulations the tax-free covenant had to be written on the bonds o'r attached thereto as a rider.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">The taxpayer\u2019s insistence here that the State tax is deductible as interest is premised (1) on the District Court\u2019s fact-findings that it had orally obligated itself to pay the tax and that the five per cent debenture bonds issued in 1937 contained \"an oral tax-free covenant to pay the tax\u201d; and (2) the contention that the Court erred as a matter of law in ruling that an oral covenant was not sufficient, and that a written covenant was imperative under the Treasury Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">On the latter score, we are of the opinion that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201ccontaining an appropriate tax-free covenant\u201d as meaning a written agreement is reasonable and correct. It is well-settled that a fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>requisite of a \u201ccovenant\u201d is that it be signed and sealed. Schram v. Coyne, 6 Cir., 1942, 127 F.2d 205, certiorari denied, 317 U.S. 652, 63 S.Ct. 48, 87 L.Ed. 525. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has for many years construed the word \u201ccovenant\u201d as used in the Regulations to mean a written covenant appearing on th.e bond or attached the'reto. The courts have repeatedly held that the administrative view of a regulation should be followed. Helvering v. Griffiths, 1943, 318 U.S. 371, 398, 63 S.Ct. 636, 87 L.Ed. 843; further, Treasury Regulations subsequently re-enacted in the same terms are considered to have received legislative approval and to have the force and effect of law. Helvering v. Griffiths, supra; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wheeler, 1945, 324 U.S. 542, 547, 65 S.Ct. 799, 89 L.Ed. 1166, rehearing denied, 325 U.S. 892, 65 S.Ct. 1182, 89 L.Ed. 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">As pointed out by the Collector, language identical to that used in the pertinent Treasury Regulations first appeared in Article 761 of Treasury Regulations 74 promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928, and 'has been repeated without change in successive Regulations issued under subsequent Acts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Notwithstanding our view as to the correctness of the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law, we are compelled to a further consideration as to whether there was any basis in the record for its fact-findings, because the Collector challenges them as erroneous and the taxpayer insists with equal vigor that they a're well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Consideration of the testimony makes it crystal clear that there was no basis for the District Court's fact-findings that (1) the taxpayer had orally obligated itself to pay the State tax on the five per cent debenture bonds in 1937; and (2) the latter bonds contained \u201can oral tax-free covenant\u201d to pay the tax. As to the latter finding, it is a contradiction in terms to speak of a Written instrument \u201ccontaining\u201d an oral undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Only two witnesses, called by the taxpayer, testified on the subject of the State tax payments. One was Lartz, taxpayer\u2019s general manager, and the other McDowell, its president. Their testimony justified a finding that there was -an agreement to pay the State tax on the original seven per cent debenture bonds issued in 1935, but just as clearly established that there was no basis for such a fact-finding with respect to the five per cent -bonds issued in 1937 involved in this litigation. McDowell was never even questioned nor did he testify -as to what transpired in connection with the 1937 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">The sum total of Lartz\u2019s testimony on that aspect follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">\u201cQ. (page 34 N.T.) Now, in your conferences prior to this action, was there anything agreed to as to the state tax on the 5 per cent bonds? A. I can\u2019t say that it was definitely mentioned, but it certainly was assumed \u25a0that if we paid it before on seven, we would naturally pay it on five.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">The latter part of the answer was stricken by the Court on motion of the Collector\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-12\">\u201cQ. (page 35 N.T.) Do you recall whether you discussed that question of the state tax on the new bonds with any of the other six involved in the two companies? A. I can\u2019t recall, Mr. McKay. That was a small detail in my book.\u201d Hi # Hs * H\u00ab H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-14\">\u201cQ. (pages 35-36 N.T.) What was your own understanding as to whether the original obligation of the corporation to pay the state tax out- of corporate funds was to continue on and be effective as to the five per cent bonds ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aij-dedup-0\">The Court\u2019 sustained an objection to this question and at the same time stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-15\">\u201cI can only draw one inference from the testimony \u2014 let\u2019s be frank \u2014 that ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>eryone agreed that the corporation would pay the tax as stated. I will make that a finding of fact. What other inference can I draw? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Up to that point, when the Court made the finding of fact mentioned, the only testimony as to the taxpayer\u2019s agreement with respect to five per cent bonds was as set forth above.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The testimony referred to inevitably leads to the conclusion that the District Court arrived at its disputed fact-findings on what can only be described as speculation or intuition and nothing else, and accordingly must be held to be clearly erroneous. We have in the past held that \u201cA finding of fact must have more substantial foundation than an intuition * * * and that while the trial court \u201c \u2018 * * * has the primary function of finding the facts in tax disputes, weighing the evidence, and choosing from among conflicting factual inferences and conclusions those which it considers most reasonable\u2019 it is well settled that speculation cannot be substituted for proof and 'the requirement is for probative facts capable of supporting, with reason, the conclusion expressed in the verdict.\u2019 \u201d In re Lueders\u2019 Estate, 3 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 128, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">It is apparent that the District Court made its fact-finding with respect to the 1937 bond issue on an inference that the taxpayer\u2019s obligation as to the 1935 issue carried over. The evidence, however, disclosed that there was no agreement entered into by the taxpayer with its stockholders to that effect in 1937. We agree with the Collector that there is no principle of law which would impute to a new bond issue a supplemental oral agreement in connection with the prior bonds, particularly, where, as here, only a part of the new bonds were issued in exchange for the old.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">As to the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in ruling that it was not entitled to a deduction from gross income for the State tax as \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d under Section 23(a) (1) (A) :</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">In our opinion the contention is without merit. This section of the Code provides that in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions \u201cAll the ordinary and necssary expenses paid or incurred * * * in carrying on any trade or business * * In Section 23(a) (I) (A) \u201cOrdinary has the connotation of normal, usual, or customary * * * the transaction which gives rise to it must be of common or frequent occurrence in the type of business involved.\u2019\" Deputy v. duPont, 1940, 308 U.S. 488, 495, 60 S.Ct. 363, 367, 84 L.Ed. 416. It was specifically held in Warner Co. v. Commissioner, 1948, 11 T.C. 419, affirmed by this Court, 1950, 181 F.2d 599 that Pennsylvania corporate loans tax, imposed by law on the individual stockholder, when paid by the obligor is not a business expense. As was held by the District Court, the fact that the taxpayer may have been required under the terms of the State statute to withhold and make the payments to the State on behalf of its bondholders, is not enough to establish them as deductible as business expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">Allowances as business expense must not only be obligatory but also must be such as are ordinarily incurred in carrying on the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1943, 319 U.S. 590, 63 S.Ct. 1279, 87 L.Ed. 1607, rehearing denied, 320 U.S. 809, 64 S.Ct. 26, 88 L.Ed. 489; A. Giurlani &amp; Bro. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 1941, 119 F.2d 852; Welch v. Helvering, 1933, 290 U.S. 111, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">In the instant case there was adequate basis for the District Court\u2019s fact-finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>that there was no showing that the State tax payments \u201cwere ordinary in character or that they were in any way related to the taxpayer\u2019s business of publishing newspapers\u201d and that they \u201cin no way benefitted anyone but the stockholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Fo'r the reasons stated the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-9\">.
