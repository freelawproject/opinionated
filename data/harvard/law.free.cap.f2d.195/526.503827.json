He was sentenced to imprisonment for a. term of ten years on Count One and imposition of sentence on Count Two was suspended and he was ordered to be placed on probation for a term of five years from the expiration of, or upon his legal release from the sentence imposed on Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">Hurst was received at the Leavenworth-Penitentiary on May 16, 1947, and began serving the ten year sentence. On March 19, 1948, he was tried on an indictment returned in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of -Oklahoma,, charging a violation of '12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 588b. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years, to begin, on the day of his release from custody on the sentence imposed on the indictment returned in the Western District of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-22\">In accordance with the provisions of 18' U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4161 the prison authorities aggregated the ten year sentence and the five year sentence as a basis for computing allowance for good conduct provided for in such section.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Hurst contends that he cannot lawfully be imprisoned on the five year sentence until he has been placed on probation for a period \u2022of five years following discharge from, or expiration of, the ten year sentence, or, \u2022according to his computation, until May 12, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">It has been held that an order denying permission to prosecute an action in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 is not a final order and is not appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Imposition of sentence on the second count of the indictment returned in the Western District of Oklahoma was suspended and no sentence was imposed on that \u25a0count. The five year sentence, by its terms, is to commence at the expiration of the ten year sentence. The ten year sentence and the five year sentence were properly aggregated for the purpose of computing good conduct allowance under 18 U.S.C.A. \u20221 4161.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The complaint seeking injunctive relief was clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-31\">.
