The court ruled that the claim was res judicata because of the judgment of the Court of Claims in Vicente Moreno v. United States, 93 F.Supp. 607, 118 Ct.Cl. 30. If the District Court had jurisdiction its action was correct for the reason it gave. If the District Court lacked jurisdiction by reason of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(d) which provides that \u201cThe district courts shall not 'have jurisdiction * * * of * * * (2) Any civil action to recover fees, salary, or compensation for official services of officers of the United States\u201d, its action was correct for that reason. Cf. Almour v. Pace, 90 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 193 F.2d 699. Since the question of jurisdiction does not affect the validity of the court\u2019s action we need not decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
