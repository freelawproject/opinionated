It is sufficient to say: that the record does not support appellant\u2019s view that the trial court\u2019s finding was without adequate basis; and that we cannot, and will not, disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">Upon the second point, we, of course, agree with appellant, indeed appellees in oral argument admitted: that the provision in the order for dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>exceeded the power of the court; and that the order must be reformed to read, on its face, as it already reads in law, <em>without prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-21\">Since, however, the order plainly declared that the dismissal was for want of jurisdiction and it is not, and cannot be, effective as a bar to another suit, the reformation will be without costs against appel-lees.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-22\">The order appealed from is reformed by striking out <em>with </em>and inserting <em>without </em>before prejudice, and, as reformed, it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-14\">. \u201cCome now * * * (the defendants) and move the Court to dismiss the complaint filed herein upon the following grounds, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">\u201c1.
