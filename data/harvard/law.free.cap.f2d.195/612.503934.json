(See Marten v. Hess, 6 Cir., 176 F.2d 834);</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">And it being the further view of the court that any damages suffered by the appellant, by reason of the acts complained of, are, regardless of the liability or non-liability of the appellees to it under the provisions of the statute, section 303(a) (1) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, section 187(a) (1), Title 29, U.S.C.A., contingent and entirely dependent upon certain contractual relations with its subsidiary, Deena Artware, Inc., which contractual relations did not exist, and accordingly are not recoverable in this action ;</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The motion of appellees to dismiss the appeal filed October 15, 1951, is granted; and the appeal is ordered to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
