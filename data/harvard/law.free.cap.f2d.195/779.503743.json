A divorce decree afterwards ordered the husband, in substantially the same terms, to make these payments \u201cduring the * * * minority\u201d of the children. The decree said that <em>it did so </em>\u201cPursuant to the written Agreement filed herein by and between the parties * * It provided \u201cThat the Articles of Separation filed herein are hereby adopted and made a part of this decree.\u201d It did not provide, expressly or by necessary implication, that payments would continue to accrue after the husband\u2019s death. In these circumstances we agree with the District Court that they ceased to accrue at his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
