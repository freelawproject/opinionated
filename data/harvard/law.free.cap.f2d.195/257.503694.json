This sum represented an indebtedness owing from the taxpayer to Hudson Coal Company which that company had gratuitously cancelled in 1938. Hudson Coal Company was the majority stockholder of the taxpayer\u2019s principal stockholder. The facts are stated in the opinion of the Tax Court, 15 T.C. 889, and need not be detailed here. The Tax Court in banc, three judges dissenting, held that the amount of the can-celled indebtedness was not includible in the taxpayer\u2019s equity invested capital. We hold <em>to </em>the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">Under the express terms of Section 718(a) (2) the cancelled indebtedness in question was required to be included in the taxpayer\u2019s equity invested capital if it was \"Property (other than money) previously paid in * * * as a contribution to capital.\u201d The indebtedness clearly was property within the meaning of Section 718(a) (2) <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>Under the Treasury Regulations in force in 1938<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as during the tax year involved<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> its gratuitous forgiveness, if it had been by a stockholder creditor, would have amounted to a contribution to the capital of the taxpayer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also settled that one who is not a stockholder and who- has no proprietary interest in a corporation may make a contribution to its capital within the meaning of Section 718(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here the Hudson Coal Company, although not itself a stockholder of the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>paj^er, was the majority stockholder of the taxpayer\u2019s own majority stockholder and thus a corporate grandparent, so- to speak, with a proprietary interest which a contribution to capital would enhance.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The Tax Court nonetheless held that the cancelled indebtedness did not represent property paid in to' the taxpayer since it was includible in equity invested capital under Section 718(a) (2) only \u201cin an amount equal to its basis (unadjusted) for determining loss upon sale or exchange\u201d and upon cancellation ceased to exist and therefore could have no such basis in the hands of the debtor. But the Tax Court failed to give effect to Section 113(a) (8) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code which provides that such basis for gain or loss in the case of property acquired after December 31, 1920 as a contribution to capital shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The interdependence of the two provisions has been'recognized by the Commissioner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The basis of the indebtedness herein question in the hands of Hudson Coal Company, the creditor-transferor, was $99,965.05. It was therefore includible in the taxpayer\u2019s equity invested capital in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The respondent argues that the indebtedness was wholly uncollectible because of the taxpayer\u2019s insolvency and for that reason could not be regarded as property paid in to the taxpayer as a contribution to capital. It does appear that the taxpayer was insolvent prior to the cancellation of the debt but the only evidence on the point in the record is the taxpayer\u2019s income tax return for 1938 and. that indicates that after the cancellation of the indebtedness of $99,965.05 the taxpayer had a net worth of $42,484.28. The Tax Court made no finding that the debt was worthless or wholly un-collectible and such a finding would clearly have been erroneous under the circumstances. For, assuming a pro rata distribution of the taxpayer\u2019s assets at their book value to the taxpayer\u2019s creditors before the cancellation of the Hudson Coal Company debt, that company and all the other creditors would have received a dividend of 84% of their claims. That the cancellation of the debt was of value to the taxpayer is obvious since it transformed an insolvency of $57,-480.77 into a net worth of $42,484.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The respondent\u2019s final contention is that Section 718(a) (2) is not applicable here because Hudson Coal Company did not intend to make a contribution to the taxpayer\u2019s capital.\" While there are no- findings by the Tax Court on the subject the facts were stipulated and it appears from them that the cancellation of the indebtedness by Hudson Coal Company was wholly gratuitous and motivated solely by its desire to aid the taxpayer in continuing in business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is sufficient evidence that the transaction was intended to be a contribution to capital.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">The decision of the Tax 'Court will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">. \u201c\u00a7 718.

I disagree with that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">First, as to the \u201cbasis\u201d: the record itself clearly establishes its non-existence. Since the majority in its opinion did not discuss what I deem to be the critical facts in the record on that score, it becomes necessary to do so here. The facts referred to are: On December 29, 1938, the Hudson Coal Company (\u201cHudson\u201d) owned 51 per cent and the Foedisch Coal Company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cFoe-disch\u201d) owned 49 per cent of the capital stock of the Middle Atlantic Anthracite Corporation. The latter corporation in turn owned 77.3 per cent of the outstanding stock of the taxpayer. Hudson mined and produced coal. Foedisch sold coal at wholesale and the taxpayer sold coal at retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Shortly before December 29, 1938, Foe-disch owed Hudson $303,151.15 for coal purchased and resold to the taxpayer; the latter owed $317,634.50 to Foedisch on account of its purchase of coal from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Orally, on December 28, 1938, and by letter on December 29, 1938, Foedisch advised Hudson that it was unable to make collections from the taxpayer, and proposed to Hudson that \u201can adjustment\u201d be made of its obligation to Hudson and that of the taxpayer to it. Foedisch specifically proposed that it assign to Hudson $100,000 of the taxpayer\u2019s indebtedness to it in consideration of Hudson\u2019s cancellation of $100,-000 of Foedisch\u2019s indebtedness to Hudson. Foedisch attached to the letter of December 29th an assignment of $99,965.05 of the taxpayer\u2019s indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">On December 29, 1938, Hudson wrote a letter to the taxpayer advising it of Foe-disch\u2019s proposal and stated that \u201cin view of the financial position\u201d of the taxpayer and to \u201caid\u201d it \u201cin continuing in business on a reasonable basis\u201d, Hudson was \u201ccancelling\u201d the amount of its indebtedness, viz., $99,-965.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">On December 30, 1938, Hudson by letter <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Foedisch, accepted its proposal and acknowledged receipt of the assignment. Of the utmost significance on the question of \u201cbasis\u201d is the statement made in this letter that \u201cIn consideration of the assignment above referred to, The Hudson Coal Company is willing <em>to forgive </em>$99,965.05 of the indebtedness of the Foedisch Coal Company to it, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">Foedisch treated the transaction in the same manner in its \u201cJournal Entry\u201d. It noted therein that Hudson \u201cforgives\u201d it \u201cof invoices due Hudson totalling $99,965.05, * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The record cited thus clearly establishes that Hudson did not regard or treat the assigned invoices as having any value either when they received them from Foedisch or when they cancelled them. It demonstrated this fact (1) by \u201cforgiving\u201d, at the very outset, Foedisch $99,965.05 of its indebtedness, and (2) by charging its surplus account with the amount of the assigned invoices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To say, under these circumstances, that Hudson had ever accorded any \u201cbasis\u201d to the taxpayer\u2019s invoices when they were received from Foedisch is manifestly unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Vital to the problem also, is the treatment which the taxpayer itself accorded to the cancellation transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It treated, on its books, the $99,965.05 cancellation as a reduction in its accounts payable \u2014 reducing the prior outstanding total of that item from $312,200.74 to $212,-235.69. At the same time it credited the cancellation to its surplus account \u2014 reducing the prior deficit in the latter from $257,-480.77 to $157,515.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">It is crystal clear from the above that in December, 1938, Hudson did not regard or intend the cancellation as a \u201ccontribution to capital\u201d of the taxpayer because had it done so it would have maintained it on its 'books as an asset instead of reducing its total asset position as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Similarly, the taxpayer did not treat the cancelled amount as a \u201cloan\u201d or \u201ccontribution to capital\u201d, because had it done so, it would have listed it as such instead of applying it in reduction of its accounts payable with an equivalent reduction of the deficit in its surplus account.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The indisputable insolvency of the taxpayer immediately prior to the time these transactions took place is fully explanatory of both the forgiveness of Foedisch\u2019s debt and the cancellation to the taxpayer. The record discloses that immediately prior to the transactions above recited the taxpayer\u2019s financial position was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">Its liabilities exceeded its assets by $257,-480.77; its accounts payable of $312,200.74 alone exceeded by $8,577.65 its total assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that connection it may be noted that included in assets was an item of $48,331.71 \u201cGood Will\u201d which would, of course, in the event of liquidation have been without value, so that in reality the accounts payable exceeded by $56,909.36 the $255,291.38 book value'of the actual assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">In addition to the accounts payable of $312,200.74, the taxpayer owed $44,000 to other creditors, $2,083.55 taxes and $2,819.-57 salaries, etc., making a total indebtedness of $361,103.86, exclusive of its $200,000 capital stock liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">It is, of course, true that after the cancellation took place the prior existing insolvency was wiped out, but it is equally true that there remained capital impairment of $157,515.72. As stated by the Tax Court, the cancellation did not create any surplus. I subscribe to the Tax Court\u2019s view that \u201c * * * the cancellation of indebtedness cannot increase the equity invested capital of a debtor corporation under section 718 (a) (2), even assuming that it represents a contribution to capital, since the property paid in or contributed is includible in equity invested capital under section 718(a) (2) only \u2018in an amount equal to its basis (unadjusted) for determining loss upon sale or exchange.\u2019 \u201d I subscribe also to the Tax Court\u2019s ruling that \u201cA debt, when cancelled, ceases to exist and the former debtor is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>in receipt of any property which can have a basis in his hands for gain or loss regardless of how the cancellation came about or of the basis the debt had in the hands of the creditor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Finally, in my opinion, LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, 1921, 256 U.S. 377, 41 S.Ct. 528, 65 L.Ed. 998<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is completely dispositive of the issue presented by this appeal. In that case the Court, in discussing the words \u201cinvested capital\u201d as used in the excess profits tax section, stated in 256 U. 5. at page 386, 41 S.Ct. at page 530: \u201cThe word \u2018invested\u2019 in itself imports a restrictive qualification. When speaking of the capital of a business corporation or partnership, such as the act deals with, \u2018to invest\u2019 imports a laying out of money, or money\u2019s worth, either by an individual in acquiring an interest in the concern with a view to obtaining income or profit from the conduct of its business, or by the concern itself in acquiring something of permanent use in the business; <em>in either case involving a conversion of wealth from one form into another suitable for employment in the making of the hoped-for gains. </em>* * *\" (emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Applying that statement to the problem presented here I find there was no \u201cconversion of wealth from one form into another\u201d in the cancellation of an indebtedness of an insolvent concern so as to constitute \u201cinvested capital\u201d within the meaning of the excess profits tax section as required in the ruling cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Further, there was no intention on the part of Hudson to' make the amount of the cancelled indebtedness an addition to capital of the taxpayer and such intention was indicated to be essential by the Supreme Court in Brown Shoe Co. v. Commissioner, 1950, 339 U.S. 583, 593, footnote 17, 70 S.Ct. 820, 94 L.Ed. 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Applicable to the question here presented is the ruling in Marshall Drug Co. v. United States, 1951, 118 Ct.Cl. 532, 95 F.Supp. 820, certiorari denied 1951, 341 U.S. 948, 71 S.Ct. 1015, 95 L.Ed. 1372. In that case trade creditors cancelled approximately $26,000.-00 of the taxpayer\u2019s merchandise indebtedness to them. Said the Court, at pages 821-822 of 95 F.Supp.: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s (taxpayer\u2019s) creditors were in business. When confronted with this situation * * * some cancelled part or all of their claims. These latter thought that full collection could not be made or, for one reason or another, was not worth while to seek. Some of them were motivated by the prospect of continued business with the reinvigorated Marshall Drug Co. (taxpayer) * * * These were business dealings. Each cancellation was the result of a creditor\u2019s individual business judgment. It was not a gift. The result to plaintiff was an increase in its net worth. <em>The cancellations clearly constituted income.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">Particularly relevant too, to the issue here, is the ruling in Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v. Westover, D.C.S.D.Cal.1949, 86 F.Supp. 644, where it was held that the gain to the taxpayer resulting from the release of its debt was not a contribution to taxpayer\u2019s capital under the excess profits tax section. The District Court gave particular consideration to the conduct of the parties at the time the transaction took place. In that connection the Court stated, at pages 649-650 of 86 F.Supp.: \u201cIn all cases of this character, the contemporaneous acts of the parties performed at the time when the effect of the transaction <em>on tax liability </em>was not uppermost in their minds should prevail over subsequent attempts to give to it a different interpretation.\u201d The Ninth Circuit affirmed in 1950, 183 F.2d 584 and held that the issue as to whether <em>a capital contribution </em>resulted from the transaction there or was income as held by the District Court, was \u201ca purely factual one\u201d, citing Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Jacobson, 1949, 336 U.S. 28, 51, 69 S.Ct. 358, 93 L.Ed. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">The rule is well settled that the fact finding of the Tax Court will not be reversed on appeal unless \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. We so held in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Penn Athletic Club Bldg., 3 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>1949, 176 F.2d 939, 943; Blum v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 281, 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It is just as -well settled that the Commissioner\u2019s determination is presumptively correct and that the taxpayer has the burden of establishing claimed increase in its invested capital. Walsh Holyoke Steam Boiler Works, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 185, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">It is for the reasons stated that I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">.
