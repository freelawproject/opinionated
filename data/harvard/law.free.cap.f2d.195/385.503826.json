Plaintiff also demanded money damages in the amount of the expenses incurred by it in maintaining such seamen and transferring them to Ellis Island, as well as an injunction against further such orders from the authorities. After a trial the District Court gave judgment for the defendant on the merits with a detailed opinion. D.C.S.D. N.Y., 101 F.Supp. 61. Plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The dispute concerns detention orders issued as to some fourteen alien seamen in the employ of plaintiff during the years 1947 and 1948. They were originally hired in New York while in possession of United States Coast Guard Seamen\u2019s documents qualifying them for service on vessels of American registry, and Department of 'Commence certificates of identification. Their articles of hire related solely to round-trip voyages from New York to foreign ports and return for discharge in this country. Following such voyages, the New York immigration inspector issued orders to the line to detain the seamen for inspection and, in some cases, deportation. Plaintiff contends that the issuance of these orders as to aliens hired in this country was not within the statutory authority of 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 167(a). The injury alleged is not only the \u201cinterference with the orderly operation of the vessels,\u201d but also the expenses attendant upon detention on Ellis Island, which, under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151, are borne by the shipping company.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">There can now be little question that a suit will lie against a defendant such as here for acting beyond his statutory authority, even though a subordinate, Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 701-702, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628; and the declaratory judgment, together with an enforcing injunction, furnishes a proper device to test the scope of this authority. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 139-140, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">On the merits, however, we think that 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 167(a) patently contemplates such orders as were issued. The statutory language is rather unusually direct: \u201cThe owner, charterer, agent, consignee, or master of any vessel arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof who fails to detain on board any alien seaman employed on such vessel until the immigration officer in charge at the port of arrival has inspected such seaman * * or who fails to detain such seaman on board after such inspection or to deport such seaman if required by such immigration officer or the Attorney General to do so\u201d shall be subject to certain penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> It is clear that Congress may require a shipping company to- maintain the expense of all those brought by it to this country who are denied admission. United States v. New York &amp; Cuba Mail S. S. Co., 269 U.S. 304, 46 S.Ct. 114, 70 L.Ed. 281. And we have previously upheld this very section in its general -application to alien seamen coming from abroad. Lloyd Royal Belge Societe Anonyme v. Elting, 2 Cir., 61 F.2d 745, affirming D.C.S.D.N.Y., 55 F.2d 340, certiorari denied 289 U.S. 730, 53 S.Ct. 526, 77 L.Ed. 1479; The Limon, 2 Cir., 22 F.2d 270. Since the seamen were clearly employed on a \u201cvessel arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof,\u201d they fell within the class thus defined against whom such orders may be issued. And the mere fact that they bore documents qualifying them as members of a crew on an American vessel may not be'held as creating a form of estoppel against federal, authority. U. S. ex rel. Lapides v. Watkins, 2 Cir., 165 F.2d 1017. The defendant\u2019s orders thus appear to be quite within the statutory grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Plaintiff, however, contends that a contrary construction should apply to alien seamen originally shipped on board in the United States, and relies on legislative history and upon a claimed definition found in \u00a7 3 of the Immigration Act of 1924, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203. The District Court found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>legislative history quite inconclusive, and we wholly agree. It is obvious that Congress wished to plug the loophole of improper entrance by seamen; it also apparently aimed to protect alien seamen properly within and shipping from America, first providing for their identification through a system of landing cards, a scheme ultimately abandoned. See, e. g., H.R.Rep.No.350, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.; Conf.Rep. to accompany H.R. 7995 (H.R.Rep.No.688, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.). But this shows merely general awareness of a problem barely touched on (or ignored) in the drafting of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 167(a), which &lt;was rather concerned with the device of using the steamship companies as an auxiliary means of control. There is nothing in the remarks in debate of various Senators and Representatives quoted to us from 65 Cong.Rec. 8568 et seq., 8638, 8640, to suggest restriction of this ingeniously useful scheme (government-wise) to only one group of the general class \u201calien seamen,\u201d while other remarks cited by defendant do seemingly tend to support the latter\u2019s contentions, e. g., 65 Cong.Rec. 5830, 6168, etc. As for the definition relied on, it is actually that of an \u201cimmigrant,\u201d and the argument has to rest upon a claimed negative implication too refined to be persuasive. The statutory phrase is far from one limiting (here or'elsewhere in the extensive Act) the phrase \u201calien seaman\u201d to one \u201cdeparting from any place outside the United States destined for the United States.\u201d Such an argument requires too extensive a manipulation of the statutory clauses \u2014 quoted in the note<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 to carry persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We conclude that no reason is shown why the statute should not be construed to mean what it appears to say. Christensen v. United States, 2 Cir., 194 F.2d 978. Our holding here is of course limited to the rights and obligations of the steamship company; it does not decide in any way the extent of the seaman\u2019s right to attack his particular detention. Where deportation becomes patently impossible or is barred by a prior residence in this country, the writ of habeas corpus provides an adequate remedy to test the individual\u2019s right to land. The Southern Prince, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 4 F.Supp. 190; Matsutaka v. Carr, 9 Cir., 47 F.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\">. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203: \u201cWhen used in this chapter the term \u2018immigrant\u2019 means any alien departing from any place outside the United States destined for the United States, except * * * (5) a bona fide alien seaman serving as such on a vessel arriving at a port of the United States and seeking to enter temporarily the United States solely in the pursuit of his calling as a seaman.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
