The collision killed the child and injured both husband and wife. The husband claimed damages for injuries to himself and his car, and for loss \u00a9f his wife\u2019s services. The wife \u25a0claimed personal injuries and sued as ad-ministratrix for the death of their infant \u25a0child. The defendant counterclaimed in the suit for damages, stipulated at $1,400.-\u00a100, to its tractor-trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Plaintiffs and defendant, respectively, told entirely different stories of the accident, and each claimed that the other side had been solely responsible. The judge .\u25a0submitted the issues of negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s damages to the jury, but told them that they need not consider the question \u00a9f damages if they found for defendant on his counterclaim, because defendant\u2019s -damages had been stipulated at $1,400, The jury came back with a \u201cunanimous verdict for defendant.\u201d The trial judge refused to set it aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence. No motion was made at that time to set it aside as incomplete or inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Plaintiffs now allege, however, that the jury, in its verdict, failed to dispose of each cause of action separately. As far as plaintiffs\u2019 claims are concerned, the verdict is open to only one unambiguous interpretation: the jury found that they could not recover on any of their causes of action. Indeed, neither plaintiffs\u2019 counsel nor the trial judge seemed at all confused on this point at the time the verdict was rendered; nor did plaintiffs\u2019 counsel seek to have the jury clarify its verdict. The plaintiffs urge, however, that, as the verdict said nothing about defendant\u2019s damages, the jury failed to find for defendant on his counterclaim, and that this failure to grant defendant recovery on his counterclaim is inconsistent with the failure to grant relief to Angland\u2019s child, for, if defendant were contributorily negligent in any way, then the child should have recovered. But this ignores two equally plausible explanations of the jury\u2019s verdict: (1) One is that the jury thought that neither side sustained its burden of proving the other side negligent, and so neither side could recover. (2) The other is that the jury fully intended by its \u201cunanimous verdict for the defendant\u201d to award recovery to' the defendant on its counterclaim; since the judge had told them that they did not have to consider the amount of his damages (because it was stipulated), they, naturally omitted to mention the stipulated amount in their verdict. As no judgment for damages in favor of defendant was entered, plaintiffs have no cause to complain about any ambiguity in the jury\u2019s manner of dealing with the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
