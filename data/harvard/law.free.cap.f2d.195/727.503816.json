The order in question directed that a hearing be held on January 28, 1952, upon what the Commission therein designated a \u201cdeclaration\u201d with respect to a proposed sale of the common stock of Washington Water Power Company by American Power &amp; Light Company, a registered holding company, to the petitioner Public Utility Districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The order recited that the hearing should relate not only to the question whether \u201csaid declaration should be denied effectiveness\u201d, but -also to the question whether the terms and provisions of an alternate plan for distribution of the Washington stock to the stockholders of American are fair and equitable and may appropriately be approved by the Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Upon application of petitioners this court granted a stay of the Commission\u2019s order. Thereafter the Commission moved to dismiss the petition for review and to vacate the stay upon the ground that the order in question is not final; that the questions stated therein are not ripe for judicial review 'but that the order merely commits the Commission to \u201clook into the matter\u201d and until the proposed hearing is held, no final reviewable order will exist. In general, it is asserted that the petition presents no substantial basis-for challenging the Commission\u2019s authority to take the action sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The petition discloses that in 1942 the Commission issued an order directing that the existence of American be terminated and that it be dissolved.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to that order American divested itself of the bulk of its assets and at the present time its principal remaining asset consists of the entire common stock of Washington Water Power Company (herein called Washington). In February, 1951, American filed with the Commission an earlier notice of a proposed sale of its Washington stock to these same Public Utilities Districts. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>consequence of that notice, the Commission held hearings upon the issues (1), \u201cwhether the Commission has jurisdiction * * * to require that a declaration he filed by American with respect to the proposed transaction\u201d, and (2), \u201cwhether if the Commission has such jurisdiction it vyould be appropriate in the light of the provisions of \u00a7 2(c) [15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79b(c)], and other applicable provisions of the Act, for the Commission to require that a declaration be filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">After the hearing the four participating Commissioners divided evenly in their votes and hence were unable to determine whether a declaration should be filed. On the same date the consummation of the proposed transaction was enjoined by the Superior Court of the State of Washington, and no appeal having been taken, that injunction became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">On October 15, 1951, the Commission approved a plan for the distribution to the holders of American\u2019s capital stock of its excess cash amounting to $2.00 per share. In the order the Commission noted that certain stockholders of American had urged an immediate distribution of Washington stock to American stockholders and requested the Commission to apply to an appropriate United States District Court to bring the dissolution previously ordered to a conclusion. The Commission also noted the time which had elapsed since the original order of dissolution had been made in 1942, and the differences of view among American\u2019s stockholders with respect to selling the stock of Washington to the Public Utilities Districts. It concluded that it was not justified in having recourse at that time to a court for the appointment of a trustee, and said: \u201cPlowever, we cannot permit this condition of stalemate to continue indefinitely. * * * Since it is recognized that a sale of the stock may not occur, we should guard against the risk that distribution may be delayed beyond the time actually necessary to explore the opportunities to effect a sale.\u201d It was ordered that : \u201cAmerican file with the Commission, within 20 days hereof, a plan which provides for the distribution of the Washington stock promptly after January 1, 1952, in the event American has not filed, by that date, a notification of sale <em>o\u00ed </em>the Washington stock pursuant to Rule U-44(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Complying therewith, American, on November 5, 1951, filed its alternative plan for distribution to its stockholders of common stock of Washington. It included a provision that the filing of a notice of sale to Public Utility Districts would constitute a withdrawal of its alternative plan. On December 26, 1951, American filed the notice of proposed sale to Public Utility Districts which is referred to m the order with respect to which review is sought here. It was filed pursuant to Commission Rule U-44(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notice recited: \u201cAmerican also believes that the Commission has no jurisdiction over the merits of any part of the proposed transaction.\u201d This statement was followed with an allusion to \u00a7 2(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79b(c), which provides: \u201cNo provision in this title shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State, or any political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned directly or indirectly by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, .agent, or employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.\u201d The notice also stated: \u201cIn the event that the Commission holds that American should file a declaration with respect to the proposed transaction, American, without waiving the contentions made above and expressly reserving the right to contest any determination by the Commission that it has jurisdiction over the merits of any part of the proposed transaction, stipulates that this notice may be treated as a declaration.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The filing of this notice was followed by the notice and order of January 18, 1952, of which review is sought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In attacking the order, the substance of which is set forth in footnote 2 supra, petitioners assert that it was definitive, final and reviewable because it amounted to a determination that the transaction in question, \u2014 the proposed sale from American to petitioners, \u2014 had the status of a transfer in respect to which the Commission could require a declaration. Petitioners say if the \u25a0Commission could require a declaration, it could require the same to be modified, or it could allow the declaration to become effective, or it could deny its effectiveness; that the Commission is completely lacking in jurisdiction in respect to these matters because of the provision of \u00a7 2(c) of the Act, quoted above, and because of part (b) (3) under Rule U-44 of the Commission, which excludes from the requirement that no registered holding company should sell any securities except pursuant to a declaration, \u201cany sale of securities or Utility assets to a federal or state government or to any subdivision, agency, authority, or in-stumentality thereof\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">The petitioners contend that they are aggrieved by the order in question in that it operates effectively to prevent the consummation of the proposed sale of the stock of Washington to petitioners who would be enabled to acquire the stock were it not for the attempted exercise by the Commission of a jurisdiction which it does not have either under the statute or under its own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>In arriving at their diverse views as to whether the Commission\u2019s order is sufficiently final to permit review here, the parties emphasize different portions of that part of the order which appears in note 2, supra. The Commission calls attention to the second and third paragraphs which recite: \u201cIt is hereby ordered that a hearing shall be held\u201d, and state the questions to be determined upon such hearing. The Commission says that this shows that the matters which petitioners seek to bring here are not \u201cripe for review\u201d; that petitioners must first exhaust their administrative remedies, and that until a hearing is had, there will be no final, reviewable order under the rule of Myers v. Bethlehem Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638, and Fed. Power Comm. v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 304 U.S. 375, 58 S.Ct. 963, 82 L.Ed. 1408.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">On the other hand, to support their claim that the order is \u201cripe for review\u201d, and that it has the requisite finality, petitioners have concentrated their attention upon that portion of the order which recites that the Commission \u201chas determined that American should file a declaration with respect to the proposed sale * * * and that * * * said notice is hereby treated as American\u2019s declaration\u201d. This, it is said, is an order presently determining the <em>status </em>of the transaction, and so viewed, the order has the requisite finality. Cases which have held orders determining status to be reviewable are Shields v. Utah Idaho R. Co., 1938, 305 U.S. 177, 59 S.Ct. 160, 83 L.Ed. 111; Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, 1939, 307 U.S. 125, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. 1147; and Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, 1942, 316 U.S. 407, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 86 L.Ed. 1563.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">It is possible that these words of the order that the Commission \u201chas determined that American should file a declaration\u201d should 'be construed as tentative only, prerequisite to the proposed hearing, at which hearing all relevant questions, including the question of the \u201cstatus\u201d of the transaction between American and petitioners, would be considered and determined. But for reasons which will presently appear, we think that possibility need not be considered here. We assume that this portion of the order is in truth a present determination of status, and hence must be treated as sufficiently final to warrant review.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The question, remains whether the petition presents any substantial grounds for review, \u2014 whether it states facts sufficient to constitute grounds for this court to exercise its original jurisdiction to review orders of the Commission. The sole basis for the prayer for review is the claim of the petitioners that they \u201cand the transaction whereby the stock of Washington Water Power Company is sought to be sold to your petitioners are exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission\u201d, and therefore the order is \u201cin excess of the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d In so asserting they rely upon the language of Section 2(c) quoted above, to the effect that \u201cno provision in this title shall apply to\u201d any state or federal agency.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">We think that \u00a7 2(c) cannot be made to carry so much weight. True, the language is that \u201cno provision in this title shall apply\u201d to the Public Utility Districts. But the districts are only one party to the proposed transaction. The other party is American, and the provisions of the Act most assuredly do apply to it, and so do the terms of the dissolution order upheld in American Power &amp; Light Co. v. S. E. C., supra. Of course the Commission cannot regulate what the districts may buy, but the Act contains adequate authority to the Commission to regulate what and how American may sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Rule U-44(c), (supra, note 4), under which the Commission has acted in requiring a declaration, has specific reference to registered holding companies which, like American, propose to \u201csell or otherwise dispose of any security, asset, or other interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>in any -business which it is required to dispose of by reason of any order of this Commission under \u00a7 11(b) of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Act contains abundant authority for the rule. Among other sections,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 12(d), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <em>791(d), </em>makes it unlawful \u201cfor any registered holding company * * to sell any security which it owns of any public utility company, or any utility assets, in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders regarding the consideration to be received for such sale, maintenance of competitive conditions, fees and commissions, accounts, disclosure of interest, and similar matters as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers or to prevent the circumvention of the provisions of this title or the rules, regulations, or orders thereunder.\u201d \u00a7 11(d), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79k(d), provides for disposition of assets of a company like American, after appointment of a trustee by the district court, \u201csubject to such rules, and regulations as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors\u201d. In like manner, \u00a7 11(e), 15 U.\u2019S. C.A. \u00a7 79k (e), plans for divestment are to be \u201cIn accordance with such rules and regulations or order as the Commission may deem necessary or \u2022 appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers\u201d. General power to make rules is granted by \u00a7 20(a), 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 79t(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We must assume that Congress contemplated that cases of this kind might arise. The circumstances of this case point to the practical reasons for believing that Congress did not intend to limit the Commission\u2019s control of such a divestiture by American, merely because a state agency proposes to purchase. The tentative character of the financial arrangements, and the expedients to which the petitioners will be obliged to resort in an effort to avoid another state court injunction, are disclosed by the petition. These circumstances make it apparent that the parties to the proposed arrangement have a long road to travel, and that there is fair reason for the Commission\u2019s proposed inquiry as to whether the transaction is \u201csusceptible of reasonably prompt consummation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">\u2022 The proposed contract of sale and purchase has not been signed by either party, although American, by its notice under Rule U-44(c), and petitioners by this proceeding, have made their several approvals thereof matters of record. The notice discloses that the source of the necessary funds has not yet been decided on, \u2014 whether the required $153,000,000' would be financed through a bank loan to the districts, or by a sale of the bonds of. the districts and of the non-profit corporation hereafter mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">In order to avoid another state court injunction based on ownership of utility assets outside the State of Washington, (a substantial part of Washington\u2019s assets are in Idaho), it is proposed as Washington stock is acquired, to cause that company to be partially liquidated by transferring all the properties in the State of Washington to the districts, leaving Washington owning only the Idaho properties. Washington\u2019s common stock, it is said, would then be sold to a non-profit membership corporation, which would issue some $51,000,000 in bonds for ' acquisition of the Washington stock and to increase the latter\u2019s capital sufficient to complete construction of a hydro-electric project now under way in Idaho. It thus appears that in essence the sale proposed, while nominally to the districts, is actually to 'be to the districts and to the yet unborn nonprofit corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">The Commission has called our attention to some of the difficulties and uncertainties which this suggested arrangement poses. Some of these are: the voluntary credit restraint program of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System which does not favor extension, of credit of the type which petitioners must seek, and which might dry up the sources of the needed financing; the argument made by some opponents of the proposal that the districts cannot avoid another state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>injunction, since the Washington Supreme Court might uphold a contention that the districts cannot acquire the entire common stock of Washington even although as to the portion representing the Idaho assets they would act merely as a conduit of title; whether the districts can acquire properties beyond those necessary to service their own territories, and hence whether they could service the many customers of Washington outside the district boundaries ;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is no provision in Idaho law for creation of a non-profit corporation, and if a corporation of this sort be arranged for, it would become a holding company under the Act, and be required to register and obtain 'Commission approval; the proposed capital structure of the non-profit corporation is such as to raise doubts of the saleability of the 'bonds of that company, which may possibly be a public utility under Idaho law, in which case issuance of its bonds would require approval of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">In the light of this factual situation, we cannot believe that \u00a7 2(c) was intended to tie the hands of the Commission whenever, as here, the company subject to an 11 (b) divestiture order, chooses to deal with a public agency. \u00a7 2(c), in providing that \u201cno provision in this title shall apply to\u201d any state or Federal public agency, did not say that no provision of the title \u201cshall apply to any registered holding company in respect of a transaction otherwise subject to the Act whenever the other party to the transaction is some public agency, state or federal.\u201d The Act is replete with mandates to the Commission that in respect to such divestiture as is now ordered to be accomplished by American, it shall issue such orders as it deems necessary or appropriate \u201cin the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.\" Whether the proposed sale is \u201csusceptible of reasonably prompt consummation\u201d is a consideration of vital importance to the investors who have their money in the enterprise, and whose possible interest in the alternative plan to distribute the stock should be a concern of the Commission. The numerous problems posed by the notice relate to the interests of consumers in the areas served by Washington. We cannot think that anything said in \u00a7 2(c) can have the effect of ousting the Commission of its necessary consideration of these matters merely because American chooses to attempt a sale to a state agency. The suggestion that \u00a7 2(c) cannot be given less than the force contended for by petitioners without violating the Tenth Amendment, is too wanting in substance to require discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">If, as we have previously suggested, the Commission, in ordering the declaration was doing so only tentatively, with the purpose of laying a foundation for the hearing ordered, at which the entire question of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction would be open for argument and decision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it might well be that the order here presented contains no determination of status. But viewing it as an order of that nature, we have concluded for the reasons stated, that the petition fails to state substantial grounds for invoking our original jurisdiction to review. Nothing in the petition suffices to disclose any ground for denying the Commission power to order the notice to be considered a declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider other questions as to our duty to entertain the petition for review, such as whether petitioners, who as yet have no signed contract of purchase, have \u201cstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ing\u201d here,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or what effect upon that \u201cstanding\u201d is wrought by the fact that the Commission might, at any moment, throw the whole matter into a district court, under \u00a7 11(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">It is sufficient to say that we find nothing in the petition which calls for the exercise of any present review on our part. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed and the stay is vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\">. \u201cSec. 24(a) Any person or party aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission under this title may obtain a review of such order in the circuit court of appeals of the United States within any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part. * * * \u00bb</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\">.
