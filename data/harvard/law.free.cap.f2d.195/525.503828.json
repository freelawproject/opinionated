Beginning his statement of the case thus: \u201cThis is a suit * * * to recover damages * * * for the enticing away of appellant\u2019s husband by the appellee.\u201d and ending thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-30\">\u201cStatement of Question Involved and Specification of Errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-31\">\u201cDoes the Florida statute which prohibits the action of alienation of affections also prohibit the action of enticement?\u201d he devotes his brief to this question, which, tendered for the first time here, is not before us for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-32\">Matters standing thus, though appellee has taken up appellant\u2019s gauntlet and invited us to judge the outcome of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>academic tilting, we must decline to do so. Addressing ourselves to the question before us: Did the judge err in dismissing the action ?, we find ourselves in no doubt, that he did not, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-18\">. \u201cThis cause is before the Court on Motion to Dismiss the Complaint filed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">\u201cThe complaint sets forth an action for alienation of affections. The State of Florida, by legislative enactment has specifically declared such actions to be against the public policy of the State. By reason thereof, this Federal Court, sitting in Florida, under the ruling of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, should follow the Florida law. It is therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"AQO\">\u201cOrdered that defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss be and the same hereby is sustained and the complaint is hereby dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
