But above the Corporation\u2019s signature were the words \u201cwithout recourse to maker.\u201d Since these words contradicted and canceled what would otherwise have been \u201can unconditional promise or order to pay a certain sum in money\u201d the note did not comply with the requirement of D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 28-102 that an instrument, in order to be negotiable, must contain such a promise. The note created no obligation, negotiable or non-negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">The nominal payee immediately endorsed the note \u201cwithout recourse\u201d and left it in the possession of the nominal maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">\u201cTo secure\u201d this note that obligated no one, the nominal maker, the Housing Corporation, immediately executed a deed of trust on certain real estate, hereafter called the property, to appellees Fuller and Solem as trustees. On the same day the Housing Corporation conveyed the property to one Wolfe \u201csubject to\u201d the deed of trust. Wolfe did not assume payment of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"A1eV\">On the same day, August 31, 1945, appellant Insurance Company issued to Wol'fe a 3-year standard fire insurance policy that contains the words: \u201cLoss, if any, on buildings, payable to Ben L. Fuller and Jos. A. Solem as mortgagee, subject to conditions of Standard Mortgagee Clause hereon. * * * If this Company shall claim that no liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner, it shall, to the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee, be subrogated to all the mortgagee\u2019s rights of recovery, but without impairing mortgagee\u2019s right to sue; or it may pay off the mortgage debt and require an assignment thereof and of the mortgage. * * * \u201d The attached Mortgagee Clause expresses the same option in other terms. It also provides that any loss under the policy \u201cshall be payable to. the aforesaid as mortgagee (or trustee) as interest may appear * *</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">On January 9, 1946 Wolfe sold and conveyed the property \u201csubject to\u201d the deed of trust. She retained no interest in it. Appellant was not notified of the conveyance. On February 29, 1948 fire damaged the property beyond the $8,000 limit of the policy. It is undisputed that after Wolfe\u2019s conveyance \u201cno liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner.\u201d Neither Wolfe nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>her grantee made proof of loss or asserted any claim against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Appellees made proof of loss and called upon appellant to pay them the amount of the policy. Appellant thereupon offered to pay them \u201cthe entire principal due on the mortgage with interest\u201d if they would \u201carrange with the party or parties secured to make the necessary assignment of the notes secured by the deed of trust and of all securities for payment of the same * Appellees did not accept this offer. After further correspondence, they sold the property at auction and sued appellant on the policy. They recovered judgment for $6,-084.90, with interest, as the \u201cbalance due\u201d on the note after crediting the proceeds of the auction sale of the property. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">If, as we have said, the note created no obligation, it follows that there was no balance due upon the note. It follows also, in our opinion, that appellees did not have a mortgagee\u2019s or trustee\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in the property within the meaning of the insurance policy. However that may be, appel-lees cannot deliver to appellant what the policy requires a mortgagee to deliver in return for a payment by appellant, and this relieves appellant of any obligation to pay appellees. Not only common usage but the policy itself contemplates that if there is a mortgage there is a \u201cmortgage debt\u201d so that appellant, by paying off the debt, can \u201crequire an assignment thereof and of the mortgage.\u201d The policy contemplates that the mortgagee has \u201crights of recovery\u201d against the mortgagor to which the appellant, not being liable to the mortgagor, will \u201cto the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee, be subrogated.\u201d The policy refers in absolute terms to \u201cthe mortgage debt\u201d and to \u201cthe mortgagee\u2019s rights of recovery\u201d; it does not refer to \u201cthe mortgage debt <em>if any\u201d </em>or \u201cthe mortgagee\u2019s rights of recovery <em>if any.\u201d </em>In the present case there is no mortgage debt, no mortgagee\u2019s right of recovery against the mortgagor, and nothing to which appellant can be sub-rogated. Appellees themselves say in their brief: \u201cno right to subrogation exists in the promissory note involved here, because the makers and the owners of the note are the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">It has been suggested that since appellant received a fire insurance premium it should bear a loss caused by fire. This amounts to saying that one who has been paid to do a thing in some circumstances should do it in other circumstances. Appellant did not undertake to pay all fire losses however and to whomever caused. The difference between what appellant promised and what appellees demand is substantial. As we read the policy appellant promised that, if not liable to the mortgagor, it would nevertheless pay a loss to the mortgagee provided the mortgagee had a claim against the mortgagor to which appellant would be subro-gated. In such a case the ultimate loss would not fall on appellant but on the mortgagor. It should fall on him because, by hypothesis, he would not be entitled to the benefit of the insurance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">. For myself only and not for the court, I add that requiring appellant to pay a loss to a mortgagee who has no claim against the mortgagor would not only be unfair to appellant but might lead to even more unfair results in other cases. The policy seems to make no pertinent distinction between cases in which the insurer\u2019s non-liability to the mortgagor is caused, as here, by his having sold the property, and cases in which it is caused by his having increased the risk. If a court disregarded the requirement that there be a mortgage debt to which the insurer will be eubrogated it would seem to follow that the mortgagor could, at the insurer\u2019s risk, turn the house into an explosives factory, despite the condition in the policy against increasing \u201cthe hazard\u201d. Though the insurer could not be required to pay a loss to the mortgagor in such a case it apparently could, if appellees\u2019 contention were sustained, be required to pay a loss to the mortgagee without possibility of recoupment against the mortgagor. It would be grossly unfair thus to deprive the insurer of protection against increases in the risk.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
