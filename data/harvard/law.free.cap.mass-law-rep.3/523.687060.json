(\u201cFoxboro\u201d), has appealed, pursuant to G.L.c. 30A, \u00a714, from a decision of the defendant, Massachusetts State Racing Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), determining that Foxboro arbitrarily excluded the horses of a licensed trainer Robert Beauregard (\u201cBeauregard\u201d) from races at its racetrack, and directing Foxboro to accept Beauregard\u2019s entries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons which follow, the Commission\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">Foxboro conducts harness horse racing at Foxboro Park pursuant to a license issued by the Commission. (R. II, 2-3.) Beauregard has been licensed by the Commission as a trainer of harness horses from 1983 to the present.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3. Throughout the 1992 racing season, Beauregard raced horses at Foxboro. (R. II, 5.) At the invitation of Larry Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d), the Foxboro Racing Secretary, Beauregard returned to Foxboro and raced horses from May through September 1993. (R. I, 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">On April 26, 1994, Miller advised Beauregard that Foxboro was accepting Beauregard\u2019s entries for upcoming races in Foxboro. (R. I, 82.) On April 27, 1994, an affidavit executed by Beauregard was introduced at a deposition in a civil lawsuit involving Foxboro. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83. Foxboro representatives were present at the deposition. <em>Id. </em>at 839 (R. II- 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">On April 28, 1994, Miller informed Beauregard that Foxboro was not accepting his entries as a result of a \u201cmanagement\u201d decision. (R. II, 4.) On May 9, 1994, Beauregard sent a letter to the Commission in which he claimed that the Foxboro management\u2019s decision not to accept his entries was based solely on the fact that he had provided a statement in a civil lawsuit involving Foxboro. (R. Ill, 15-17.) By letter dated May 20, 1994, the Commission notified Beauregard and Foxboro management that it had scheduled a hearing on Beauregard\u2019s complaint for June 8, 1994. (R. Ill, 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">At the hearing, Richard P. Dalton (\u201cDalton\u201d), President ofFoxboro, testified that he, rather than Miller, had made the decision not to do business with Beauregard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dalton denied any knowledge of Beauregard\u2019s affidavit at the time he made his decision to reject Beauregard\u2019s entries. (R. 1,20-21, 39-40.) Dalton testified that he rendered his decision, at least in part, on Beauregard\u2019s United States Trotting Association (\u201cUSTA\u201d) record. (1,18-19.) However, Dalton testified that he could not recall the nature of the violations on the USTA record, although he allegedly reviewed the USTA record three weeks prior to the hearing. (R. I, 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">In fact, Beauregard\u2019s USTA record contained five violations. (R. Ill, 19-20). After being refreshed as to the nature of the violations, Dalton conceded that three of the infractions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not threaten the integrity of racing or the reputation ofFoxboro. (R. I, 44-45.) Beauregard\u2019s other infractions were for racing a horse without Phenylbutazone and a violation involving a medication procedure. (R. II, 19.) Beauregard testified that the former violation resulted from a failure to file the proper paperwork. (R. I, 59.) Dalton admitted that he did not know the nature of the latter violation. (R. I, 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">Dalton testified that he placed more emphasis on Beauregard\u2019s reputation than upon his USTA record. (R. I, 38.) Dalton testified that several persons had informed him that one of Beauregare\u2019s horses had broken loose from a stall \u201cwith an extension cord taped to its neck.\u201d (R. I, 25-26.) Dalton inferred that Beauregard was \u201cprodding\u201d the horse. (R. Ill, 26, 28.) Dalton, however, could not recall the names of any persons who related this story to him, when he learned of it, or when or where it allegedly occurred. (R. I, 26, 35, 52.) Beauregard denied knowledge of or involvement in the alleged incident. (R. I, 60-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">Counsel for Foxboro further suggested that Foxboro acted out of concern that Beauregard was involved with illegal hypodermic needles. (R. I, 90.) Foxboro, however, presented no evidence on this point and Beauregard denied any involvement with such needles. (R. I, 61, 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">After the hearing, the Commission found that: (1) Foxboro did not substantiate its allegation that Beauregard was involved in the alleged extension cord incident (R. II, 6); (2) Foxboro had produced no evidence that anyone actually had a negative perception of Beauregard, id.; (3) Beauregard\u2019s record was \u201cunremarkable\u201d and contained only \u201cminor violations\u201d; and (4) Foxboro had produced no evidence to support the allegation that Beauregard was involved with hypodermic needles (R. II, 6). Accordingly, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>concluded that Foxboro\u2019s decision to refuse Beauregard\u2019s entries was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and not an exercise of \u201creasonable business judgment.\u201d (R. II, 9.) Foxboro now contends that the Commission applied an erroneous standard in its review of Foxboro\u2019s decision and that the Commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The party appealing an administrative decision bears the burden of demonstrating the decision\u2019s invalidity. <em>Merisme v. Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bds., </em>27 Mass.App.Ct. 470, 474 (1989); <em>Faith Assembly of God v. State Bldg. Code Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Mass.App.Ct. 333, 334 (1981), citing <em>Almeida Bus Lines, Inc. v. Department of Pub. Utils., </em>348 Mass. 331, 342 (1965). In reviewing the agency decision, the court is required to give due weight to the agency\u2019s experience, technical competence, specialized knowledge, and the discretionary authority conferred upon it by statute. <em>Flint v. Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416,420 (1992); <em>Seagram Distillers Co. v. Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988); <em>Quincy Hosp. v. Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>400 Mass. 745, 748-49 (1987). A court may not dispute an administrative agency\u2019s choice between two conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter come before it de novo. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley v. Housing Appeals Comm'n, </em>385 Mass. 651, 657 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Foxboro contends that the Commission erroneously applied an arbitrariness standard in reviewing Foxboro\u2019s decision to exclude Beauregard\u2019s entries. Both parties agree that <em>Catrone v. State Racing Commission, </em>17 Mass.App.Ct. 484 (1984), is the controlling Massachusetts case in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In <em>Catrone, </em>the Appeals Court acknowledged that \u201cMassachusetts decisions as yet have not determined the extent to which a racetrack has power to exclude licensed owners and trainers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489. Foxboro, in its memorandum, relies on this quotation and urges the court to conclude that a racetrack has \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d to exclude a trainer. However, in <em>Catrone, </em>the Appeals Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over a racetrack\u2019s decision to exclude a licensed trainer and the Commission\u2019s application of an arbitrary and capricious standard. Id..at 485. The Court held that as a licensee, a racetrack \u201cmust use reasonable business judgment in its . . . operation.\u201d <em>Catrone, supra </em>at 492, citing <em>Phillips v. Youth Dev. Program, Inc., </em>390 Mass. 652, 656-57 (1983). Thus, contrary to Foxboro\u2019s assertions, the Court did not purport to adopt an \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d standard for the Commission when reviewing the conduct of racetracks. Accordingly, the court concludes that the Commission did not err in reviewing Foxboro\u2019s conduct against an arbitrary and capricious standard and in determining that Foxboro\u2019s decision was \u201cnot reasonable and was not based on sound business judgment.\u201d (R. II, 9.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Foxboro further contends that the Commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. \u201cSubstantial evidence is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 317 (1976), citing G.L.c. 30A, \u00a71(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">At the hearing, Foxboro alleged that it relied on several factors in excluding Beauregard. Foxboro testified that it relied most heavily on the alleged \u201cextension cord\u201d incident. However, the Commission could reasonably have found that the \u201cextension cord\u201d story was unsubstantiated and, thus, unpersuasive. Foxboro identified no witnesses to the event, it did not know when or where it took place, and it did not know when it learned of the incident. Further, while Foxboro asserted that Beauregard had a bad reputation, it could identify no one with a negative perception of Beauregard. Foxboro also alleged that it relied on Beauregard\u2019s USTA record, but Dalton conceded that he couldn\u2019t recall the nature of the violations. Finally, Foxboro\u2019s counsel suggested that Beauregard was involved with illegal hypodermic needles, but could produce no evidence relating to this alleged activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Moreover, there was uncontroverted evidence that on April 26, 1994, Miller accepted entries from Beauregard; on April 27, 1994, Beauregard\u2019s affidavit was introduced into evidence at a deposition at which Foxboro representatives were present; and on April 28, 1994, Miller informed Beauregard that Foxboro would not accept his entries due to a \u201cmanagement\u201d decision. Although Dalton denied knowledge of the affidavit, the Commission could reasonably have rejected this portion of his testimony as incredible. An agency may make determinations as to the credibility and weight of the testimony at an administrative hearing. <em>Number Three Lounge, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Mass.App.Ct. 301, 309 (1979); <em>Maddocks v. Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>369 Mass. 488., 495 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">The court therefore concludes that the Commission could reasonably have found that Foxboro\u2019s alleged grounds for excluding Beauregard were pretextual. Thus, the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Foxboro\u2019s decision was arbitrary and not based on sound business judgment is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff Foxboro Harness, Inc.\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. The decision of the Massachusetts State Racing Commission is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-15\">Foxboro has fashioned its G.L.c. 30A, \u00a714 appeal in the form of a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-3\">Beauregard is also licensed in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maine. (R. II, 4-5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Dalton was the only individual to testify at the hearing on behalf of Foxboro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Nhe three infractions were as follows: (1) racing a horse without a properly licensed owner; (2) having his horse on the track after horses were called off; and (3) scratching a horse without permission. (R. I, 44-45.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Foxboro also appears to suggest that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to review Foxboro\u2019s decision to exclude Beauregard\u2019s entries, although it does not devote much of its brief to this argument. In <em>Catrone v. State Racing Commission, </em>17 Mass.App.Ct. 484 (1984), the Appeals Court dismissed a similar assertion by a racetrack, stating that \u201d[a]lthough the statutory grant of jurisdiction could have been made more explicit, we reject the racetrack\u2019s contention that the commission had no jurisdiction of this situation [in which a racetrack excluded a licensed trainer].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Accordingly, the court concludes that the Commission had jurisdiction to review Foxboro\u2019s decision in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Foxboro further contends that the Commission erred in placing the burden of proof on Foxboro to demonstrate that it did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. Foxboro appears to rely on <em>Jacobson v. Monmouth Park Jockey Club, </em>33 N.Y.2d 144 (1973), which held that a licensee complaining of a racetrack\u2019s action in excluding the licensee from participation in races has a \u201cheavy burden to prove that [exclusion]\u201d . . . \u201cwas not a reasonable discretionary business judgment but was actuated by motives other than those relating to the best interests of racing generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148-50. Massachusetts has not adopted the reasoning of <em>Jacobson. </em>Further, because the Commission\u2019s factual findings rejected the proffered basis for Foxboro\u2019s decision and embraced the uncontroverted evidence that Foxboro accepted Beauregard\u2019s entries on April 26 and rejected them on April 28, the Commission\u2019s decision did not turn on the allocation of the burden of proof. Thus, any error on the part of the Commission was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
