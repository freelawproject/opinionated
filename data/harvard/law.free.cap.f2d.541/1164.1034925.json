Vallejo contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence; and in refusing to allow an in-eourt experiment to test the arresting officer\u2019s ability to identify marihuana by smell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Vallejo\u2019s vehicle was searched at the Sarita, Texas checkpoint. The Border Patrolman was entitled to stop the vehicle at this permanent checkpoint for brief questioning concerning citizenship of the occupants. Having smelled marihuana emanating from the car\u2019s interior the officer had probable cause to search it. <em>Sifuentes v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1975 (unpublished), affirmed <em>sub. nona., United States v. Mar</em>tinez-Fuerte,-U.S.-, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116, (1976); <em>United States v. Kalie, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 538 F.2d 1201; <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 538 F.2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">At the trial, Vallejo\u2019s counsel proposed that some plastic baggies containing marihuana and four other substances be submitted to the arresting officer, to test his ability to differentiate the odor of marihuana. Vallejo contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow him to conduct this in-court experiment constituted an abuse of discretion and violated his Sixth Amendment rights. We disagree. The conditions of the proposed experiment differed substantially from those which existed at the time of the principal event. <em>See United States v. Squella-Avendano, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 478 F.2d 433, 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
