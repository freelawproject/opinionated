An employee of the United States Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) claims that her voluntary lateral transfer between jobs, each carrying a GS-4 rating, was induced by the misrepresentations of her supervisor. After exhausting her administrative remedies, she filed this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-20\">Rosemary E. Twiggs, the plaintiff herein, initiated formal grievance procedures by letter to the Assistant Administrator for Administration of the SBA. The hearing examiner, to whom the grievance was referred, advised Twiggs that he would conduct an inquiry by means of personal interviews as provided in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.116(d)(2) (1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> embodied in SBA Standard Operating Procedure \u00a7 37-71117(a). The hearing examiner accordingly denied the request of Twiggs\u2019 counsel for access to particular agency documents and for permission to question certain individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-21\">After the interviews were held, the hearing examiner transmitted the grievance file for review to Twiggs and her counsel, both of whom submitted comments. In his Report of Findings and Recommendations, the hearing examiner concluded that \u201cthe grievant has failed to establish a reasonable basis for her grievance\u201d and recommended that relief be denied. The Assistant Administrator for Administration adopted the recommendation of the hearing examiner and notified Twiggs and her attorney that his decision constituted final agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-22\">Twiggs timely filed this action in the district court under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district judge reviewed the agency decision according to standards set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>our case of <em>Charlton v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 390 (3d Cir. 1969). He found that the agency\u2019s action was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion and that \u201cthere is evidence to substantiate\u201d the agency\u2019s finding that there was no misrepresentation to Twiggs by her supervisor. Having so determined, the district judge concluded that the complaint failed to state a cause of action on which relief could be granted and entered summary judgment in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Because of error in the district court\u2019s review, we are constrained to reverse and remand. First, the judicial review mandated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1970) requires an examination of the administrative record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., Charlton v. United States, supra, </em>412 F.2d at 392. In this case, such a record would consist of the grievance file, including the comments of Twiggs and her counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the hearing examiner\u2019s Report of Findings and Recommendations, and the final agency decision. The Government filed the last two items as exhibits appended to its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. After a thorough search of the district court record,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> however, we must conclude that the grievance file with comments was not transmitted to the district court. Thus, the court had before it an incomplete record on which to review the agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">Not only did the district judge base his review on an insufficient administrative record, he also apparently looked outside the record <em>for </em>evidence to meet the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E). In his opinion, the judge referred to statements by Twiggs\u2019 supervisor made in a deposition taken for use in the district court action after the final agency decision had been rendered. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d to support an agency\u2019s action must exist in the administrative record itself; the reviewing court is precluded from considering extrinsic evidence in this regard. <em>Nickol </em>v. <em>United States, </em>501 F.2d 1389, 1390 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>Charlton v. United States, supra, </em>412 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">Furthermore, we believe the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard was improperly applied to the case <em>sub judice. </em>The express language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) makes that standard of review applicable only to agency action taken after a mandatory hearing. In <em>Charlton, </em>as Judge Stahl pointed out in his concurrence, 412 F.2d at 395, section 706(2)(E) was extended beyond its limiting language to review of a dismissal of a federal employee which was not accompanied by a statutory hearing. Since <em>Charlton </em>rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>resents an atypical application of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, it should be confined to its factual context, <em>i. </em>e., discharges of employees. Where, as here, the challenged action is merely a voluntary transfer with no loss in pay or grade, albeit allegedly induced by a misrepresentation, the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On remand, the district court, once it has before it the complete administrative record, should undertake a review of the procedural regularity of the agency\u2019s action and determine whether it is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion under the applicable provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-17\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.116(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-18\">The examiner shall conduct an inquiry of a nature and scope appropriate to the issues involved in the grievance.

We note that the district court has been unable to locate three documents which are part of a supplemental record in the district court. The docket entries reveal that these documents consist of a deposition of Twiggs and of her supervisor taken for the court action and not part of the administrative record, a copy of the hearing examiner\u2019s report, and a copy of the final decision of the agency. Although these documents were filed almost two months after the district judge had rendered his decision, the last two documents were already part of the record as Government exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
