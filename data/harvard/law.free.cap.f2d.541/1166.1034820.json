BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1231-21\">On late Friday, January 9, 1976, Noel Baum filed a petition in Federal Court for an Arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. On Monday, January 12, 1976, R. C. Anderson filed a foreclosure in Louisiana state court on the second mortgage he held on Baum\u2019s home. In a blunderbuss appeal which he penned in colorful terms Baum sought sanctions, including a running daily monetary penalty based upon \u00a7 2(a) 15 of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rules 770, 771, and 914 of Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a dismissal of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>foreclosure proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule ll-44(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He contends that the filing of a petition for an Arrangement requires the dismissal of all actions against the debtor filed subsequent thereto and a stay of those actions previously filed. The District Court affirmed the 'Bankruptcy Judge\u2019s dismissal of Baum\u2019s petition. We substantially affirm but reverse in part to assure an effective stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">There is conflicting testimony concerning whether Anderson was aware of the Arrangement petition at the time he filed his state court action. The Bankruptcy Judge found that Anderson\u2019s foreclosure petition was filed in good faith, and without his having any knowledge of the filing of the petition for Arrangement, as did the District Judge. We cannot find evidence in the record to warrant a reversal on clearly erroneous grounds so we accept the finding of facts by the Bankruptcy Judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Anderson has agreed not to proceed further with his foreclosure and his offer to stay that action is in the record. However, he would not agree to dismiss the foreclosure, the lower court did not order him to dismiss, nor did it impose compensatory damages, hence, this appeal was taken by Baum. The District Court apparently felt that the statutory stay was enough. And in no sense did it recognize the right of the foreclosing mortgagee to proceed further. Baum asserts that since it is uncontradicted that the XI proceeding was in fact commenced before the state foreclosure petition Rule ll-44(a) compels its dismissal, that a stay is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">The provision for automatic stay of actions against the debtor under Chapter XI is very similar to other provisions in the Bankruptcy Act. A survey of the Act and Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure (BRP) reveals that the drafters intended that the filing of a petition would in many cases effect an automatic stay of collateral actions. For example, Ch. X corporate reorganizations <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, Ch. XII real property arrangements<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and Ch. XIII wage earners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>plans <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> all contain provisions similar to that found in XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Additionally in the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure there are two more provisions for automatic stays found in Rule 401<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Rule 601<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> against certain actions on unsecured debts and lien enforcements, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">It is not by accident that the same provision reoccurs in the Act so frequently. The Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes contain the reason. Under the notes to BRP 10-601, 12-43, 13-401, 11-A4, and 401 we are told that these provisions are all intended to supplement and reinforce the policy of \u00a7 11(a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>. Section 11(a) provides for a mandatory stay until adjudication or dismissal of the petition of all actions founded on dischargeable debts which are pending against the bankrupt when the petition is filed. The stay in \u00a7 11(a) is primarily for the benefit of the bankrupt that he may avoid harassment which results from a creditor filing an action in another court with regard to the same debt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">It was not until 1973 with the advent of the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure that the stay of collateral actions became automatic. Prior to this time bankruptcy judges had discretion in granting or denying stays.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The intent of the drafters that stays should be automatic is buttressed by the adoption of Rule 9^4 which became effective in August of this year. Once again the provision for automatic stay is carried into another area of the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">Because we give full voice to the rules calling for an automatic stay our decision will have far reaching effects on all the Chapters of the Act. Our decision is made with the recent changes of the Act and the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes in mind. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>it does not reach the limits which Baum seeks. We hold that while there is no question that the action in the state court is and should be stayed until the settlement of the Arrangement, the lower court was entitled to decide that it was not mandatorily required by the rules to dismiss the state court foreclosure since the equivalent protection would be afforded by the automatic stay which we now require to be entered formally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">While literally the commencement of an action after the Arrangement petition is filed invokes the rule automatically as we have held, there are questions, depending on the circumstances whether there is any reasonable need to order a dismissal of the action; whether a stay is in fact adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Baum has received the benefits intended to be conferred by the Act and Rules either under \u00a7 2(a)15 or BRP 11 \u2014 44(a). He is not being harassed by the mere filing of Anderson\u2019s foreclosure petition (quite the contrary, Anderson has fully co-operated with the court and his Arrangement plan was not defeated by the Bankruptcy Judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss the foreclosure.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">The Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure cited above, 10-601,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 12-43,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 13-401,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 401,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 601,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and 9 \u2014 4<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> have more in common than just protection of the debtor from harassment or protection of the estate. To give the Bankruptcy Court ample leeway to meet all situations these Rules without exception grant the Bankruptcy Judge the power, for cause shown, to terminate, annul, modify, or condition the stay. This grant of power makes it unnecessary to agree with Baum\u2019s contention that the Court must dismiss every action filed subsequent to the XI petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-15\">The Bankruptcy Judge found, and the record does not dispute, that Anderson acted in good faith, filing his foreclosure petition without knowledge of Baum\u2019s XI petition. While some action must be taken to obliterate the effectiveness of the state court\u2019s order<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the sheriff\u2019s duty to act on it<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> all of these problems will be met by the issuance of a formal stay. We differ with the District Judge in a very limited degree to this extent, due to the interest of third parties such as the state judge, the sheriff and others dealing with the property, there was a necessity for entering a formal order staying the state court action. Although counsel for Anderson has conceded by way of a carbon copy of a letter to the sheriff and state court that the foreclosure action is stayed, this is not enough. The petition filed in state court under 6 LSA CCP Art. 2631 <em>et seq. </em>calls for the entry of an order requiring seizure. State court Judge Pickett, following this procedure, issued the order requiring the sheriff to take possession of the property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This order is still outstanding and no letter from counsel for Anderson can minimize the existence or validity of the order or the sheriff\u2019s obligation to execute on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-16\">We remand with directions to the District Court to enter a formal order staying the foreclosure pending the conclusion of the Arrangement or further order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-17\">MODIFIED AND AS MODIFIED AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">.

Rule 770. Judgment for Specific Acts; Vesting Title</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-14\">If a judgment directs a party to execute a transfer or to deliver a document or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court and the act when so done has like effect as if done by the party. On application of the party entitled to performance, the court shall issue a writ of attachment or sequestration against the property of the disobedient party to compel obedience to the judgment. In proper cases the disobedient party may also be held in contempt in proceedings under Rule 920. The court in lieu of directing a transfer of real or personal property may enter a judgment divesting the title of any party thereto and vesting it in others and such judgment has the effect of a transfer executed in due form of law. When any judgment is for the delivery of possession, the party in whose favor it is entered is entitled to a writ of execution or assistance upon application to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">Rule 771.

The court may at any stage in a particular matter direct that one or more of the other rules in Part VII shall apply. A person who desires to perpetuate his own testimony or that of another person regarding any matter that may be cognizable and relevant in a contested matter in a pending bankruptcy case may proceed in the same manner as provided in Rule 727 for the taking of a deposition before an adversary proceeding. For the purposes of this rule a reference in the rules in Part VII to adversary proceedings shall be read as a reference to contested matters.
