Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1157-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1157-13\">Jerry White, an Alabama prisoner convicted of second degree murder, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief. He alleges two bases for redress: (1) he was subjected to an impermissibly suggestive line-up in the absence of counsel; and (2) his initial arrest for vagrancy was pretextural, so that voice identification evidence obtained from a line-up held while he was in the unlawful custody of the police was inadmissible. On the basis of our decision in <em>Caver </em>v. <em>State of Alabama, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 537 F.2d 1333, a companion case to this appeal, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-15\">In Caver, White\u2019s co-defendant raised both of the contentions that White asserts here. We rejected his challenge to the line-up, noting that \u201c[wjhile the procedures used at this line-up are subject to criticism, we are convinced that no miscarriage of justice occurred in this case\u201d. 537 F.2d at 1335. Because the same line-up is involved, that result holds here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-16\">With respect to Caver\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, we concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>1976,-U.S.-, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067, would bar such a collateral attack on his conviction unless he could show \u201cthat the state failed to provide him with an opportunity for full and fair litigation of his claim\u201d. 537 F.2d at 1336. We vacated the dismissal of Caver\u2019s petition and remanded the case for further proceedings in order to afford him \u201ca chance to be heard upon the legal standard announced in Stone v. <em>Powell\", </em>537 F.2d at 1336. A similar disposition is warranted here, especially in light of the district court\u2019s failure to rule on, or even advert to, White\u2019s contention that his arrest for vagrancy was pretextural and was illegally used to subject him to the line-up in which the voice identifications were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-19\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
