We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-12\">Appellant first challenges the admission of his post-arrest oral statements allegedly elicited in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The arresting officer read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant said he understood them, and appellant then voluntarily made: the statements in question. Under these circumstances the district court did not err in admitting the statements into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">Appellant next challenges the government\u2019s response to a pre-trial discovery order. In accordance with Fed.R. Crim.P. 16, the district court ordered the government to disclose the substance of appellant\u2019s oral statements. The government complied, fully and accurately disclosing the substance of the statements appellant made to the arresting officer. The government did not disclose that in response to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings appellant said he understood his rights, but appellant\u2019s counsel did not request disclosure of that information, appellant himself was fully aware of the information as indicated by his testimony at trial, and appellant\u2019s defense could in no way have been impaired by the nondisclosure under the circumstances here. The government\u2019s response to the discovery order does not invalidate appellant\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Arcentales, </em>532 F.2d 1046 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-15\">Finally, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support the conspiracy conviction. We have carefully reviewed the record, and we find appellant\u2019s claim without merit. Moreover, the conspiracy sentence is concurrent with the sentence for the unchallenged possession conviction. <em>See e. g., United States v. Strickland, </em>509 F.2d 273 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
