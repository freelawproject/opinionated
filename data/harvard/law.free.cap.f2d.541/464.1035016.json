A careful examination of his several complaints \u2014 the major burden of which is that he was justified in refusing to provide the exemplars since they were sought for harassment, could have been obtained elsewhere, etc. \u2014 establishes that, with one exception, they are meritless. The order of commitment fails to recite that it is subject to the limitation, among others, of the life of the term of the grand jury, including extensions, before which his refusal to comply with the court order occurred. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 (1970). It should have so recited, for it is so limited. The order is modified to incorporate this additional limitation. Should the term of the subject grand jury already have expired, Shocker shall receive credit on the service of his unrelated criminal sentence, which was interrupted by his contempt incarceration, for any days served by him after the expiration of that term. As modified, the order below is</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
