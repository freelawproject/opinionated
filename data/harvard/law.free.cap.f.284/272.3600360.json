The appellee set up the defense that what it did was in pursuance of a license or agreement granted or made by the appellant. We are of opinion that the evidence adduced called for the conclusion that by a valid agreement or understanding between the parties the appellee acquired the right to do what was complained of by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">It follows that the appellant is not entitled to a reversal of the decree appealed from. That decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
