UNITED STATES.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b867-4\">(Circuit Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AF3S\">November 24, 1922.)</decisiondate>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b867-5\">No. 3852.</docketnumber>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b867-10\">J.

The record does not show any action of the court with reference to any warrant for the. arrest of the defendant. It is contended that the information was subject to be quashed because it was filed without being supported by oath or affirmation of the existence of probable cause. The ground of the contention did not exist in fact. The information referred to a transcript of proceedings and evidence had before a named United States commissioner as a basis for the charges made. Included in what was so shown to have been before the commissioner was an affidavit of one Stevens stating that, at the time and place alleged in the information, defendant and Sid Wells\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-15\">\"acting together in violation of sections 3, 6 and <em>18, title 2, </em>of National Prohibition Act [41 Stat. 305] did unlawfully manufacture, possess and sell certain intoxicating liquor, and did unlawfully possess certain utensils, contrivances, and machines designed and intended for use in the unlawful manufacture of intoxicating liquor, contrary,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Furthermore, an information, charging the commission of a misdemeanor, filed by a district attorney of the United States, is not required to be supported by an affidavit based on personal knowledge and showing probable cause, unless such information is made fhe basis of an application for a warrant of arrest. A defendant may be charged and tried for a misdemeanor on such an information not so supported. Weeks v. United States, 216 Fed. 292, 132 C. C. A. 436, L. R. A. 1915B, 651, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 524; 22 Cyc. 260. The court did not err in overruling the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Complaint is made of action of the court which is not presented for review. There was no reversible error in any ruling which is presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
