J. Shapiro (herein called the defendant), was convicted on a charge made by in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>formation that he unlawfully had in his possession described intoxicating liquor. There was evidence to prove the finding of such intoxicating liquor at a place in El Paso which was called \u201cShep\u2019s Auto Stand,\u201d that defendant was called \u201cShep,\u201d and that he was in possession and charge of that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">A witness for the prosecution was asked, \u201cWho is reputed to be the owner of Shep\u2019s Auto Stand?\u201d After the witness had answered: \u201cMr. Shapiro, I suppose,\u201d the defendant objected to the answer as being hearsay, and excepted to the action of the court in overruling the objection. The question gave notice that a responsive answer to it might be hearsay testimony. - This being so, it was not reversible error for the court to overrule the objection, which was not made until after the question was answered. Bailey v. Warner, 118 Fed. 395, 55 C. C. A. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The court properly overruled the defendant\u2019s motion for an instructed verdict in his favor, on the ground that there was no evidence that he was in possession of the liquor. Evidence adduced was such as to support a finding that the defendant was guilty of the offense charged. The record shows no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
