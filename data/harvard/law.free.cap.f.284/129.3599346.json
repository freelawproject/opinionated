Without order, an amended bill was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201cHad this bill been presented as directed, leave to file would have been denied, inasmuch as it is no improvement on the original bill either in form or in substance. The motion to strike it fromi the files will therefore be granted Pursuant to the views heretofore expressed on the motion to dismiss, that motion is sustained and the bill dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">On July 7, 1921, Judge Carpenter, one of the judges of said District Court, caused the following decree to be recorded in this cause in the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cThis cause eoming on to be heard on the motion to strike amended bill from the files, and also upon motion to dismiss said bill, all things considered, the motion to strike said amended bill from the files is denied, and the motion to dismiss said bill is allowed. It is therefore ordered that said amended bill be and it is hereby dismissed for want of equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">How and why Judge Carpenter\u2019s action was invoked does not appear from the record before us. \u00ab\u00a7</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">What the nature of Judge Mack\u2019s action was must be determined by considering the body of the record, not merely the label put upon it. So considered, we find th\u00e1t the record, embodies a final decree of July 5, 1921, dismissing the amended bill for want of equity apparent on its face. On behalf of appellee the United States district attorney interposes a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the petition for appeal, the order of allowance, and the assignments of error ape all directed exclusively to the entry made by Judge Carpenter on July 7, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">If it were permissible for us to examine the amended bill, we would start with the presumption of the correctness of Judge Mack\u2019s ruling, reinforced by the presumption of the correctness of Judge Carpenter\u2019s ruling. But we are constrained to sustain the district attorney\u2019s motion, on the ground that the cause was ended on July 5,1921, by a final decree from which no appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
