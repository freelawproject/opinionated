R. Lynn Shoe Company </em>v. <em>The Auburn-Lynn Company et </em>als., \u201d and reference to that report is made for a statement of the original contentions between the parties. Also see <em>W. R. Lynn Shoe Company </em>v. <em>The Auburn-Lynn Shoe Company, </em>103 Maine, 334, which is the same cause reported to the Law Court on questions arising after the aforesaid decision. After the decision reported in 103 Maine, 334, the master\u2019s report was recommitted solely, however, \"for further hearing and report upon the question of what damages, if any, should be awarded to the plaintiff for the losses in its own business, in the production and sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of its own goods, caused by the wrongful acts of the defendants,\u201d and after such hearing the master filed a second report which was accepted. A final decree was then entered, \"ordering the defendant company to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $7424.53 and taxable costs, and on August 4, 1909, the sum of $7974.13 was received by said plaintiff corporation, in accordance with the terms of said decree.\u201d The master\u2019s report covered the period between July 9, 1903, and January 15, 1906, the date when the decree on the original bill was filed enjoining the defendant and appointing a master. April 1, 1910, the plaintiff filed the bill under consideration in the present cause, praying that \"an account may be taken of all the profits of said business from said fifteenth day of January, 1906, resulting from the wrongful acts committed by the defendant company in its unfair competition with the plaintiff,\u201d etc. The defendant filed an answer with a demurrer therein inserted. The case was then reported to the Law Court for decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">The pith of the case is stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-6\"><em>Harry Manser, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-7\"><em>John A.

After careful consideration, we conclude that we must treat it as an original bill and that as such it is demurrable. It seeks an account of damages and profits independently of any other ground of equity jurisdiction, such as discovery or injunction. It alleges no fraud, no fiduciary relations, no mistake and asks no declaration or establishment of rights or liabilities. The rights of the plaintiff have already been defined by the decree upon the original bill. For profits and damages the remedy of plaintiff at law is plain, adequate and complete. <em>Titcomb </em>v. <em>McAllister, </em>77 Maine, 353, 357-358; <em>Piscataqua, etc., Ins.
