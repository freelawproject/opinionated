The vital question was whether the signature purporting to be that of one of the defendants, James Rowe, was genuine. He denied it. A careful comparison of his admitted signature with that upon the note so strongly corroborates his denial, that, in the opinion of the court, a new trial should be granted.</p><p id=\"Aqu\">Motion sustained.\u201d</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
