At the close of the testimony introduced at the trial, the presiding Justice ordered a verdict for the defendant. The case comes before this court on exceptions, first, to the ruling of the presiding Justice excluding the following question asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u2014\u2018After the buildings were burned after the loss, what if any sum did the Boston and Maine Railroad pay to you ;\u2019 and second, to the order of the presiding Justice directing a verdict for the defendant.</p><p id=\"b573-5\">\"1. It appears that there was no controversy in relation to the amount of damages if the defendant should be held liable. There was no offer to prove an admission of any material fact on the part of the defendant. The evidence excluded had no necessary tendency to prove it. The defendant might have been willing to buy its \u00abpeace by paying a sum less than the amount required to defend the suit. The evidence offered had no legitimate bearing upon the issue before the court. <em>Finn </em>v. <em>N. F. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>101 Maine, 279; <em>Beaudette </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>87 Maine, 534.</p><p id=\"b573-6\">\"2. After a careful examination of all the evidence in the case, it is the opinion of the court that the ruling of the presiding Justice ordering a verdict for the defendant was also unquestionably correct.\u201d</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
