Abele, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the Scioto County Common Pleas Court. The jury found Mark Wells, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">First Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by denying the defendant-appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request pursuant to Evidence Rule 612 to review written statements which the witness has used to refresh his recollection while testifying during the jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">Second Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the grounds that the prosecutor had failed to provide to the defendant evidence that was favorable to the defendant as required by Rule 16(B)(1)(f) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">Eric Lewis testified that while he was driving his car during the early morning hours of January 12, 1991, he noticed a pedestrian spit on the car. Lewis stopped, exited the car, and confronted appellant, the pedestrian. After the two men exchanged words and Lewis thought the incident was over, appellant struck Lewis \u201cunder the chin to the top of my head.\u201d Lewis then grabbed appellant and hit him two or three times. Appellant left the scene of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">Lewis noticed blood dripping down his face. He discovered appellant had used a knife to cut him from his chin to the top of his head. Lewis went to the hospital emergency room and received sixty-six stitches in the chin and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Lewis\u2019s friend, Larry Brunner, testified he was with Lewis during the incident. At one point, appellant pulled the knife on Brunner. Although Brunner admitted he did not see whether Lewis or appellant threw the first punch, Brunner testified Lewis did not attack appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Portsmouth Police Department Sergeant Bruce Barney investigated the incident. He testified appellant gave him a written statement denying he was involved in any altercation that night. Appellant also denied having any knowledge of how his jacket became blood-stained. An Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation agent testified the blood stains on the jacket matched Lewis\u2019s blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Appellant denied spitting on the car. He testified he knifed Lewis in self-defense. Appellant claims fear caused him to tell the police, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even around there at the time\u201d and that he \u201cnever saw any knife.\u201d Appellant admitted he threw the knife in a pile of clothes when the police arrived to question him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The two men who were walking with appellant when Lewis stopped his car testified Lewis accused appellant of spitting on the car. Donnie Hamilton further testified Lewis threw the first punch. David Kelly did not specify who threw the first punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The grand jury indicted appellant for felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). The jury found appellant guilty of the lesser included offense of aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts the court erred by denying his counsel\u2019s Evid.R. 612 request to review Lewis\u2019s and Brunner\u2019s written statements that Sergeant Barney used to refresh his recollection while testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Appellee argues appellant\u2019s attempted employment of Evid.R. 612 was merely a ruse to enable appellant to see the otherwise unavailable statements. Appellee notes the court had earlier determined, pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Lewis\u2019s statement was not inconsistent with his testimony. Appellee also notes the court had earlier determined, pursuant to Evid.R. 612, that appellant could not review the entire police file in Barney\u2019s possession as he testified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court reasoned that Barney did not refer to the entire file during his testimony, but only referred to two items in the file \u2014 a time summary and the arrest slip. Thus, appellee argues, appellant was not entitled to see the statements in that file.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We note appellant\u2019s attorney admitted he would ask Barney certain questions on cross-examination to force Barney to refresh his memory by looking at the statements. Appellant\u2019s attorney stated on the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u201c* * * I\u2019m sure I can go back in the court room and ask questions of such detail that it would require him to make further use of that file. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Appellant went back into the courtroom and asked detailed questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u201cQ. On the statement that * * * I assume you took a written statement from Eric Lewis?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\u201cQ. On that statement anywhere do the Miranda Rights appear?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">\u201cA. We have two different statement forms. One it does and one it does not. I don\u2019t recall at this time which particular form I used that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">\u201cQ. <em>Could you please check your file and review it to see whether or not there\u2019s any statement </em>* * * <em>Miranda statement on that, since you don\u2019t recall?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">\u201cMR. GRIMSHAW: May it please the Court, I\u2019m not sure what this line of questioning is leading to. The Court already reviewed Mr. Lewis\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think the question was what time the statement was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">\u201cMR. HALE: No. Whether there were Miranda Rights or Miranda Warnings on the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will overrule it at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">\u201cQ. Would you review your file?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">\u201cA. The voluntary statement that Eric Lewis filled out, yes, it does have the Miranda Warnings basically on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-19\">\u201cQ. I believe you also took statements from Larry Brunner?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u2018A. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201cQ. And does that statement contain Miranda Warnings on it? And do you know the answer to that?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u201cA. I would assume * * * I don\u2019t know the answer, but I assume I would have used the same statement form.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">.\u201cQ. <em>I don\u2019t want you to assume. You examine the statement of Larry Brunner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Okay. Yes, it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u201cQ. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u201cMR. HALE: Your Honor, again, for the record, since the witness has used those two statements to refresh his recollection, I would like to examine them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The court denied appellant\u2019s second Evid.R. 612 attempt to see Lewis\u2019s and Brunner\u2019s written statements in the police file.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Evid.R. 612 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\"><em>\u201cExcept as othenuise provided in criminal proceedings by Rule 16(B)(1)(g) and 16(C)(1)(d) of Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, if a luitness uses a uniting to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying, either: (1) while testifying; </em>* * * <em>an adverse party is entitled to have the uniting produced at the hearing. * </em>* * If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing <em>in camera, </em>excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">Evid.R. 612 requires the court to order delivery of the portions of a writing that an adverse witness used to refresh his recollection while testifying. The rule, however, expressly states it does not apply to statements governed by Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Lewis\u2019s and Brunner\u2019s statements were governed by Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g). Crim.R. 16 and not Evid.R. 612 controls the availability to defense counsel of witnesses\u2019 statements. Under the circumstances, appellant may not use Evid.R. 612 as an additional method of discovery. See Staff Notes, Evid.R. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-18\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>Evid.R. 612 did not except Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) statements from its scope, we would find no reversible error. We note appellant asked Barney to look at the statements solely to discover whether the statement forms contained <em>Miranda </em>warning language. The question of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>statements contained such language bears no relation .to the merits of the case <em>sub judice. </em>As appellant\u2019s counsel readily admitted at trial, he posed the questions solely to compel Barney to look at the statements. We find Barney\u2019s answers to the questions are irrelevant to the facts and arguments raised in this case; appellant\u2019s sole purpose was to require the witness to review the statement so appellant could assert that Evid.R. 612 applied and that he was entitled to view the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The drafters of Evid.R. 612 wisely decided the rule must not apply to admit matters unrelated to the testimony of a witness. The rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u201c * * * If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing <em>in camera, </em>excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Appellant may not use Barney\u2019s testimony about the <em>Miranda </em>warning language on the statements to admit the other portions of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Lastly, we note Barney accurately answered the questions posed by appellant\u2019s counsel. The statement forms used by Lewis and Brunner both contained the <em>Miranda </em>warning language. Thus, we find appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of his inability to use the statements to challenge .Barney\u2019s testimony about the <em>Miranda </em>warning language.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts the court erred by denying the motion for a mistrial he made on the grounds the prosecutor had failed to provide him with favorable evidence as required by Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant argues the state should have provided him with a favorable statement appellant\u2019s witness Kelly made to Barney. Appellant contends Kelly\u2019s statement indicates Lewis, and not appellant, was the aggressor in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">First, we note appellant did <em>not </em>move for a mistrial based upon the prosecutor\u2019s failure to provide him with <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>statement. We will assume, for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of this assignment of error, that appellant m\u00e9ant to assign as error the trial court\u2019s failure to grant the motion for mistrial he made on the grounds the prosecutor failed to provide him with a statement by his witness Hamilton.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Appellant moved for a mistrial at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Hamilton. During that cross-examination, Hamilton: (1) acknowledged he told police officers that Lewis threw the first punch; and (2) denied remembering he told the police officers that appellant \u201cwas bragging about cutting [Lewis] and said \u2018no one was going to mess with him.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel requested a mistrial as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cYour Honor, at this point I\u2019m going to move for a mistrial. The Prosecutor, Mr. Grimshaw, is under an affirmative obligation to give me anything favorable to the defendant, my client. He\u2019s been in possession of a statement in which Donnie Hamilton told Sgt. Barney that he thought that Eric threw the first punch. That clearly is evidence favorable to my client. I was not provided with that. I was not told about the fact of that statement. I think in view of that a mistrial is appropriate in this case, and I want to make that motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In <em>State v. Glover </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 517 N.E.2d 900, the court discussed how an appellate court should review an assignment of error concerning a motion for mistrial. The court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u201c * * * In evaluating whether the declaration of a mistrial was proper in a particular case, this court has declined to apply inflexible standards, due to the infinite variety of circumstances in which a mistrial may arise. * * * <em>This court has instead adopted an approach ivhich grants great deference to the trial court\u2019s discretion </em>in this area, in recognition of the fact that the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the situation in his courtroom warrants the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">In <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 413, 575 N.E.2d 167, 170, the court followed established law . on what constitutes an abuse of discretion:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 \u2018 * * * connotes more than error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. * * *\u2019 <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151 [16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144] * * See also, <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894, and <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 584 N.E.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">In the instant case, we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s decision denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial. The trial court\u2019s decision was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Appellant raised no objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>lack of discovery until after the prosecutor finished cross-examining Hamilton. If appellant had raised an objection when the prosecutor first mentioned the undiscovered statement, the court could have prohibited the prosecutor from using the statement during cross-examination. The court could have also granted appellant a continuance to examine the statement, speak to Hamilton, and perhaps conduct more direct examination before the prosecutor could cross-examine Hamilton about the statement. Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u201cFailure to Comply. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, <em>the court may </em>order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, <em>grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In view of the fact appellant failed to object until after the prosecutor completed the cross-examination, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion when denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial. See, generally, <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 117, 5 O.O.3d 98, 101, 364 N.E.2d 1364, 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this issue was properly before us, we conclude appellant\u2019s assertion is without merit. Appellant contends the prosecution failed to provide him with favorable evidence. In <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 33, 565 N.E.2d 549, 555, the Ohio Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u201cIn <em>State v. Johnston </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898, we recognized that suppressing material evidence favorable to an accused violates due process regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s good or bad faith. See <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>[ (1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215], <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\"><em>\u201cState v. Johnston </em>further held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether the prosecution improperly suppressed evidence favorable to an accused, such evidence shall be deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. * * * \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u201cThe <em>Brady </em>test, applied in <em>State v. Johnston, supra, </em>is stringent. \u2018The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u201cmateriality\u201d in the constitutional sense.\u2019 <em>United States v. Agurs </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 [353]; see <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Thus, evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>State v. Johnston, supra; United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant contends appellee failed to provide appellant with Hamilton\u2019s prior statement and that if this evidence had been disclosed, the result of the trial would have been different. We disagree. Hamilton\u2019s trial testimony did not differ from the statement he gave to the police prior to the trial. We are not persuaded that if the prosecution had provided Hamilton\u2019s statement to appellant, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-8\">Harsha, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b187-9\">Grey, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-13\">.
