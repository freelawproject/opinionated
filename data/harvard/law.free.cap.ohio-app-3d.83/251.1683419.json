These cases evolved after the Ohio Supreme Court abandoned a prior line of cases which permitted immediate review of temporary alimony awards, <em>McMahon v. McMahon </em>(1951), 156 Ohio St. 280, 46 O.O. 143, 102 N.E.2d 252, by holding that an abuse of discretion does not render an otherwise interlocutory order relating to an award of attorney fees immediately appealable.

Oatey appeals from a prejudgment order of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Division, awarding plaintiff-appellee Susan A. Oatey $100,000 in attorney fees funded by an immediate court-ordered sale of substantial marital property. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Plaintiff filed a complaint for divorce in domestic relations case No. D-200521 against defendant and five other defendants who are not parties to the appeal <em>sub judice, viz.: </em>(1) Oatey Company; (2) Oatey Company Profit Sharing Trust &amp; Savings Incentive Plan; (3) Cardinal Federal Savings Bank; (4) Society National Bank; and (5) Ameritrust Company, National Association. Plaintiff requested a divorce, custody of the couple\u2019s three minor children, alimony, child support, an equitable division of property, attorney fees, temporary restraining orders against the six defendants prohibiting the disposition of various property and other equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">Plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint naming seven additional defendants who are not parties to this appeal for the purpose of obtaining additional temporary restraining orders against the transfer of property in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>plaintiff claims an interest. It appears from the record the Oateys have accumulated substantial marital assets. Defendant Gary Oatey filed an answer and an amended answer and counterclaim requesting a divorce, custody of the three children, an equitable division of property, attorney fees and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">During the course of the proceedings in the domestic relations court plaintiff filed a motion for interim attorney fees and costs in addition to a separate motion for temporary alimony and child support. The domestic relations court granted the motion for attorney fees after conducting a hearing over a three-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The domestic relations court order journalized July 2, 1991 (the \u201cOrder\u201d) awarded plaintiff $100,000 as interim attorney fees, ordered defendant to pay plaintiffs counsel $50,000 within seven days of journalization of the \u201cOrder\u201d and to deposit the proceeds from the court-ordered sale of certain condominiums in escrow within sixty days pending further order of the domestic relations court. The \u201cOrder\u201d continued the prior temporary restraining orders on all the parties\u2019 remaining assets and did not contain the express language \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Defendant filed a notice of appeal from the \u201cOrder\u201d July 9, 1991 raising eleven assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff thereafter commenced proceedings to enforce the \u201cOrder\u201d in the domestic relations court and filed a motion in this court of appeals to dismiss the appeal contending the \u201cOrder\u201d from which defendant appealed was not a final appealable order. This court of appeals granted defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of execution of the \u201cOrder\u201d July 29, 1991 upon the posting of a $100,000 supersedeas bond after the domestic relations court denied a similar motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Defendant subsequently filed a \u201cMotion to Supplement the Record on Appeal\u201d pursuant to App.R. 9(E)' to include as part of the record in the appeal <em>sub judice </em>various original papers from proceedings conducted by the domestic relations court to enforce the \u201cOrder\u201d while defendant\u2019s appeal from the underlying \u201cOrder\u201d was pending in this court of appeals. Defendant\u2019s motion contends the enforcement proceedings demonstrate the \u201cOrder\u201d from which he appealed constitutes a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Plaintiffs motion to dismiss the appeal <em>sub judice </em>and defendant\u2019s motion for leave to supplement the record on appeal have been referred to the merit panel for disposition. For the sake of simplicity, this court shall address defendant\u2019s motion to supplement the record prior to considering plaintiffs motion to dismiss and the additional authority submitted by the parties concerning this jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\n<em>Motion for Leave to Supplement Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Defendant contends interlocutory orders are not enforceable by the domestic relations court prior to final judgment; however, since the domestic relations court attempted to enforce the \u201cOrder,\u201d defendant maintains this makes the \u201cOrder\u201d \u201cfinal.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">However, the enforceability of orders entered by domestic relations courts does not depend upon whether such orders are classified as \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201cinterlocutory\u201d for purposes of appeal. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, interlocutory orders entered during the course of the proceedings may be enforced by a domestic relations court against a noncomplying party prior to final judgment. <em>In re Kurtzhalz </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 432, 25 O.O. 574, 48 N.E.2d 657; see, also, <em>Ollick v. Rice </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 448, 16 OBR 529, 476 N.E.2d 1062 (probate court). The mere filing of a notice of appeal from the order by a noncomplying party does not divest the domestic relations court of jurisdiction to enforce an interlocutory or final order pending appeal unless the party is granted a stay of execution of the order. <em>In re Kurtzhalz, supra; Pugh v. Pugh </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 136, 15 OBR 285, 472 N.E.2d 1085; <em>Buckles v. Buckles </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 118, 546 N.E.2d 965; <em>Huelsman v. Huelsman </em>(Nov. 17, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 54684, unreported, at 22-23,1988 WL 122899; <em>White v. White </em>(1977), 50 Ohio App.2d 263, 272, 4 O.O.3d 225, 230, 362 N.E.2d 1013, 1019. Although this court\u2019s stay of execution renders any purported enforcement of the \u201cOrder\u201d by the domestic relations court pending appeal a nullity, the stay has no effect on the finality of the \u201cOrder.\u201d <em>Gieg v. Gieg </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 51, 16 OBR 55, 474 N.E.2d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We find defendant\u2019s proffered materials relating to subsequent proceedings conducted in the domestic relations court after defendant\u2019s notice of appeal to this court of appeals do not fall within the scope of App.R. 9(E) and are not relevant to the determination of the jurisdiction of this court or the merits of the appeal <em>sub judice. </em>Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for leave to supplement the record is not well taken and is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\n<em>Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Plaintiffs motion to dismiss the appeal <em>sub judice </em>contends the underlying \u201cOrder\u201d for the payment of attorney fees was entered pursuant to the temporary alimony and attorney fees provisions of Civ.R. 75(M)(1) and Dom.Rel.Loc.R. 21 and constitutes an interlocutory <em>order from </em>which <em>no </em>appeal may be taken prior to a final judgment disposing of the entire case based upon Loc.App.R. 20 and Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Loc.App.R. 20 governs jurisdiction in appeals from actions involving multiple claims or parties and provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cAppeals involving either multiple claims or multiple parties are not within the jurisdiction of this court unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u201c1) A judgment disposition in the trial court determined all issues and all claims involving all parties, or</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u201c2) A partial disposition in the trial court is accompanied by a determination by that court under Civ.R. 54(B) that there is no just reason to delay entering judgment on issues, claims or parties involved in the partial disposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Civ.R. 54(B) likewise provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u201cJudgment upon multiple claims or involving multiple parties. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may enter final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. In the absence of such determination, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Defendant\u2019s brief in opposition argues the \u201cOrder\u201d for interim attorney fees was entered pursuant to R.C. 3105.18(H) and constitutes a final appealable order affecting a \u201csubstantial right\u201d made in a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d within the scope of R.C. 2505.02 to which neither Loc.App.R. 20 nor Civ.R. 54(B) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">R.C. 3105.18(H), which was enacted and became effective after plaintiff filed her motion for attorney fees in the case <em>sub judice, </em>provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">\u201cIn divorce or legal separation proceedings, the court may award <em>reasonable </em>attorney\u2019s fees to either party <em>at any stage of the proceedings, </em>including, but not limited to, any appeal, any proceeding arising from a motion to modify a prior order or decree, and any proceeding to enforce a prior order or decree, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>determines that the other party has the ability to pay the attorney\u2019s fees that the court awards. When the court determines whether to award <em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fees </em>to any party pursuant to this division, it shall determine whether either party will be prevented from fully litigating his rights and adequately protecting his interests if it does not award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">R.C. 2505.02 defines \u201cfinal order\u201d in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, <em>an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding </em>or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Although the underlying motion for attorney fees in the case <em>sub judice </em>was filed prior to the effective date of R.C. 3105.18(H), the motion was heard and decided by the domestic relations court after the effective date. The \u201cOrder\u201d expressly states, \u201c[tjhis matter came on to be heard on June 18th, 25th and 26th upon Plaintiffs motion for interim fees and costs pursuant to Loc\u00e1l Rule 21 as amended by O.R.C. 3105.18(H).\u201d Consequently, we conclude the domestic relations court relied upon and decided its \u201cOrder\u201d in the case <em>sub judice </em>pursuant to the guidelines specified in R.C. 3105.18(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Defendant contends that since attorney fees incurred by a party in litigation are not ordinarily recoverable from an opposing party absent statutory or other authority, R.C. 3105.18(H), therefore, establishes a definitive statutorily authorized \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d within a domestic relations action to recover such attorney fees. Although an order mandating immediate payment of attorney fees to an opponent clearly affects a \u201csubstantial right\u201d of a party, we reject defendant\u2019s argument R.C. 3105.18(H) categorically establishes a \u201cspecial proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Defendant has offered nothing to support his contention that R.C. 3105.-18(H) departs from the prior longstanding well-developed practice governing the timing of appeals from orders in domestic relations cases granting attorney fees pending final disposition of the case. Authority existing prior to the enactment of R.C. 3105.18(H) sanctioned motions for attorney fees during the course of domestic relations proceedings prior to final judgment, <em>Stuart v. Stuart </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 289, 29 O.O. 432, 58 N.E.2d 656, during appeals, <em>Lee v. Lee </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 113, 10 OBR 137, 460 N.E.2d 710, or in proceedings to modify or enforce domestic relations orders, <em>Rand v. Rand </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 356, 18 OBR 415, 481 N.E.2d 609; <em>Blum v. Blum </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 92, 38 O.O.2d 224, 223 N.E.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Such attorney fee awards were generally characterized as a component of \u201calimony\u201d or as \u201cnecessaries\u201d supplied to the parties\u2019 spouse or children, <em>Hamilton v. Hamilton </em>(1988), 40 Ohio App.3d 190, 532 N.E.2d 213, although some awards were not in fact made as part of alimony or child support obligations. <em>E.g., Butler v. Butler </em>(Apr. 17, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50422, unreported, 1986 WL 249. The discretion of - the domestic relations court in awarding such attorney fees was likewise guided by, <em>inter alia, </em>the parties\u2019 respective needs and ability to pay. <em>Swanson v. Swanson </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 85, at 94-95, 2 O.O.3d 65, at 70-71, 355 N.E.2d 894, at 900-901.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">It was likewise well established prior to the enactment of R.C. 3105.-18(H) that prejudgment orders in domestic relations actions, including attorney fee awards, generally constitute ordinary proceedings in the domestic relations action from which an appeal may not be taken until final disposition of the case. <em>Galbreath v. Galbreath </em>(June 13, 1989), Franklin App. No. 89AP-103, unreported, 1989 WL 65389; <em>Daughtry v. Daughtry </em>(1973), 47 Ohio App.2d 195, 1 O.O.3d 275, 353 N.E.2d 641; <em>Venable v. Venable </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 421, 3 OBR 498, 445 N.E.2d 1125.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As in other cases, absent a finding of contempt or some other basis for immediate review, a party filing an appeal from an attorney fee award prior to final judgment in a domestic relations case must demonstrate the order awarding attorney fees \u201caffects a substantial right made in a special proceeding\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02. See <em>Galbreath v. Galbreath, supra. </em>The Ohio Supreme Court has established a balancing test based on the following factors to determine whether an order, such as the \u201cOrder\u201d in the case <em>sub judice, </em>was made in a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cThis test weighs the harm to the \u2018prompt and orderly disposition of the litigation,\u2019 and the consequent waste of judicial resources resulting from the allowance of an appeal, with the need for immediate review because appeal after final judgment is not practicable.\u201d <em>Id.; Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 253, 258, 21 O.O.3d 158, 161, 423 N.E.2d 452, 455; Voss <em>v. </em>Voss (1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 200, 203-204, 574 N.E.2d 1175, 1176-1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Based upon our balancing of the factors discussed in <em>Amato, supra, </em>this court concludes the \u201cOrder\u201d <em>sub judice </em>affects a \u201csubstantial right\u201d made in a \u201cspecial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>proceeding\u201d under R.C. 2505.02. We recognize that immediate appeals from attorney fee awards would under most circumstances constitute unwarranted interference with the timely resolution of domestic relations actions since the awards would be subject to reconsideration prior to final judgment in each case and could be adequately reviewed at that time. <em>Galbreath v. Galbreath, supra, </em>at 8. However, the \u201cOrder\u201d falls within the narrow range of cases warranting immediate review based upon a substantial likelihood of extreme and irreparable harm since the attorney fee award is funded by an immediate court-ordered sacrifice sale of substantial property and mandates payment of prospective fees to a non-party without any provision for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We agree with the Fifth District Court of Appeals which held prior to the enactment of R.C. 3105.18(H) that an order to liquidate business assets and real estate to facilitate the subsequent division of property and to pay, <em>inter alia, </em>attorney fees prior to the final disposition of a divorce proceeding constitutes a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 to which Civ.R. 54(B) does not apply. <em>Joseph v. Joseph </em>(Jan. 25, 1988), Stark App. No. CA-7126, unreported, 1988 WL 8490.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The <em>Joseph </em>court reasoned that such an order mandating the sale of marital assets prior to disposition of the entire case is similar to a foreclosure decree, where the order of sale is immediately appealable although the action is not yet concluded, since it is impossible as a practical matter to unwind the sale if the order is later found to be erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 7 (citing <em>Third Natl. Bank of Circleville v. Speakman </em>[1985], 18 Ohio St.3d 119, 18 OBR 150, 480 N.E.2d 411). The <em>Joseph </em>court stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u201cWe conclude that the order of the trial court, in effect liquidating the businesses of the parties by a procedure akin to receivership or partition, so impacts with finality the rights of the respective parties as to \u2018affect a substantial right\u2019 of these parties. The sale of the business assets would be an event from which the trial court and the parties could hardly retrench in the event it was determined the judgment was in error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The \u201cOrder\u201d in the case <em>sub judice </em>directed defendant to liquidate numerous condominiums within sixty days, distribute $50,000 of the proceeds to plaintiffs attorney and place an additional $50,000 in escrow to ensure payment of possible future attorney fees and expenses of litigation. Ordering such an immediate wholesale sacrifice sale of real property accumulated over the course of years is not commercially reasonable and may irrevocably deprive both parties from realizing the fair market value of the assets to their detriment and \u201cso impacts with finality the rights of the respective parties\u201d to constitute an order made in a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d warranting an immediate appeal prior to the final disposition of the entire case. See <em>Van Fossen v. Van Fossen </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>547 N.E.2d 1237 (court-ordered auction of marital property \u201cforthwith\u201d as part of divorce decree reversed as an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As noted by the <em>Van Fossen </em>court, the role of the domestic relations court is to resolve the parties\u2019 disputes in a fair and equitable manner at a difficult time in their lives rather than embroiling them in further litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 176, 547 N.E.2d at 1238. Ordering an immediate wholesale sacrifice sale of real property without regard to market conditions constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Any losses sustained by the parties as a result of the liquidation of the marital property would be irreparable as a practical matter and unnecessary since much of the proceeds are ordered to be stored in a bank account to hold for possible future expenses. R.C. 3105.18(H) governs the payment of reasonable interim attorney fees and it is an abuse of discretion for the domestic relations judge to order immediate payment of substantial <em>prospective </em>attorney fees since the effect is to mandate extending credit to counsel for an opposing party who renders services only at the discretion of the client and who may not continue to provide services until final disposition of the case. Accordingly, plaintiffs motion to dismiss is not well taken and is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Prior to considering the merits of the parties\u2019 respective arguments concerning the \u201cOrder,\u201d this court must address one other preliminary matter. Defendant\u2019s brief on appeal does not separately brief and argue his eleven assignments of error as mandated by App.R. 12(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the court shall disregard the assignments of error which are not properly briefed and argued and address only defendant\u2019s fifth, sixth and eighth assignments of error which are properly executed. <em>Jackson v. Jackson </em>(Dec. 26, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 59459, unreported, 1991 WL 280984. We shall address defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error first.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u201cThe lower court committed prejudicial error in finding plaintiffs motion for interim fees and costs well taken and granting same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Defendant argues plaintiff did not sufficiently demonstrate the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the direct payment to plaintiffs counsel of $50,000 within seven days or the total award of $100,000 in interim attorney fees, or that plaintiff would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>prevented from fully litigating her rights or adequately protecting her interests in the case without such an immediate payment or award.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Appellate review of attorney fee awards in domestic relations actions is not intended to deny awards of reasonable attorney fees and is limited to determining whether (1) the factual considerations upon which the award was based are supported by the manifest weight of the evidence, or (2) the domestic relations court abused its discretion. <em>Linehan v. Linehan </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 124, 517 N.E.2d 967 (citing <em>Swanson v. Swanson, supra, </em>48 Ohio App.2d at 90, 2 O.O.3d at 68, 355 N.E.2d at 898). An \u201c \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"> We note that R.C. 3105.18(H) authorizes domestic relations courts to order the payment of <em>reasonable </em>interim attorney fees for <em>completed </em>services upon proper application from time to time during the course of the proceedings and not <em>prospective </em>attorney fees at the inception of a case as in the \u201cOrder\u201d <em>sub judice. </em>Moreover, an award of reasonable attorney fees must be predicated upon evidence submitted by the movant demonstrating the reasonable value of actual services performed and itemized to the party pursuant to Dom.Rel.Loc.R. 21(B). See, also, <em>Swanson v. Swanson, supra </em>(mere multiplication of the hourly rate by the number of hours expended without evidentiary support is insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The record demonstrates that prior to the filing of plaintiffs motion for interim attorney fees and costs counsel for plaintiff had received a $1,500 retainer and billed plaintiff a total of $3,177.68 for services rendered. Counsel for plaintiff presented a bill at the hearing for additional services in the amount of $24,970 based upon 51.3 hours at $250 per hour and 59.8 hours performed by an associate at $150 per hour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, counsel for <em>plaintiff offered no testimony concerning the \u201creasonableness\u201d of any of the fees in the original or supplemental invoices. </em>In addition, the domestic relations court did not consider whether plaintiff would be prevented from fully litigating her rights without an award of reasonable interim attorney fees in light of her counsel\u2019s statement at the final hearing that counsel would continue to provide services without payment until the conclusion of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Based upon our review of the record, we find that the \u201cOrder\u201d mandating payment of $50,000 within seven days and the total award of $100,000 in attorney fees is unsupported by the evidence and constitutes an abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Under the circumstances, such an award improperly circumvents the requisite finding of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of such an award pursuant to R.C. 3105.18(H), Civ.R. 75(M) and Dom.Rel.Loc.R. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is well taken and the judgment of the trial court is reversed in its entirety and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The court shall address defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error pursuant to App.R. 12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Defendant\u2019s eighth assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u201cThe lower court committed prejudicial error in including an amount for appraisers\u2019 charges in its award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Defendant\u2019s eighth assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Defendant contends the \u201cOrder\u201d improperly awarded plaintiff appraiser fees due to the fact the trial court improperly excluded testimony at the hearing that plaintiffs appraisers would continue to provide services without such interim payments. However, our review of the terms of the \u201cOrder\u201d demonstrates the \u201cOrder\u201d makes absolutely no reference of any kind to the payment of appraiser fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Although the hearing transcript and exhibits indicate that such evidence was presented by plaintiff, the trial court is presumed to consider \u201conly the relevant, material and competent evidence in arriving at a judgment, unless the contrary affirmatively appears from the record.\u201d <em>State v. Crisp </em>(Dec. 13, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 57805, unreported, at 9, 1990 WL 204054. Defendant has failed to exemplify any error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">\u201cThe lower court committed prejudicial error in finding that defendant-appellant has the ability to pay what the court awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-16\">Defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-17\">Defendant contends plaintiff did not adequately demonstrate defendant has the \u201cability to pay\u201d the award for interim attorney fees of $50,000 within seven days or the total award of $100,000 within sixty days. Defendant argues the evidence demonstrated his annual income of approximately $287,000 not including profit sharing benefits, or $22,814 per month was consumed by monthly expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>$22,685, and the trial court did not authorize the use of any of the assets subject to restraining orders as collateral for the purpose of obtaining a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Although we reverse the trial court\u2019s attorney fee award based upon defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error under the facts of this case, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that a domestic relations court is prohibited from ordering the <em>commercially reasonable </em>sale of marital property to satisfy reasonable court-ordered interim attorney fee awards for completed services. As we have noted, funding such an award by ordering an immediate wholesale sacrifice sale of real property accumulated over years without regard to market conditions or considering less draconian alternatives constitutes an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, a party\u2019s \u201cability to pay\u201d reasonable court-ordered attorney fees encompasses more than the party\u2019s current income flow or credit limitations and may include court-ordered asset sales under appropriate circumstances after considering other alternatives to adequately protect the parties\u2019 respective interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Moreover, we note that in the case <em>sub judice </em>there was evidence at the hearing that defendant obtained a short-term loan in the amount of $7,500 from the Oatey Company for a down-payment to obtain a new residence valued at $315,000 despite the stated company policy against making loans. The domestic relations court could properly consider this evidence when making an award. Contrary to plaintiffs contention, defendant\u2019s ability to post the $100,000 supersedeas bond within two weeks of the journalization of the \u201cOrder\u201d to stay execution of the \u201cOrder\u201d does not demonstrate his claimed inability to pay is a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The judgment of the domestic relations court is reversed in its entirety and the domestic relations court is directed on remand to scrutinize any subsequent attorney fee motion under the <em>Swanson </em>criteria based upon evidence properly submitted to the domestic relations court demonstrating the reasonable value of actual services performed by counsel and itemized to the movant prior to filing the motion. Any orders pertaining to the issue <em>sub judice, </em>entered by the domestic relations court to enforce the \u201cOrder\u201d after the domestic relations court was divested of jurisdiction and the stay granted by this court of appeals, shall have no force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Judgment reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-11\">Francis E.
