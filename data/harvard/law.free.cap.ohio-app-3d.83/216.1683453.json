Bowman, a minor, sustained bodily injury in an automobile accident. The accident occurred when Ruth M. Davis struck the Bowmans\u2019 car with the car that she was driving. Angela was exiting the Bowmans\u2019 car at the moment of impact and became pinned underneath one of its wheels. Mrs. Bowman, the driver, and Mr. Bowman, a bystander, witnessed Angela become trapped beneath the car. Mr. Bowman assisted in lifting the car off his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">At the time of the accident, Davis was covered by an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Auto-Owners. The policy provided liability coverage of $50,000 \u201ceach person\u201d and $100,000 \u201ceach occurrence.\u201d Davis subsequently died of unrelated causes, so the Bowmans brought the present action against John F. Holcomb, the administrator of Davis\u2019 estate. The complaint seeks damages for Angela\u2019s physical injuries and for the negligent infliction of emotional distress suffered by the Bowmans in witnessing the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">After the Bowmans filed suit, the parties entered a contingent settlement agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, Auto-Owners paid the Bowmans $50,-000, taking the position that the $50,000 \u201ceach person\u201d policy limitation applies. In consideration of the $50,000 payment, the Bowmans agreed to release all claims they may have as a result of the accident if it is adjudicated that $50,000 is the coverage limit. If it is resolved that $100,000 is the policy limit, the Bowmans agreed to waive all claims against the Davis estate in excess of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Auto-Owners then intervened in the Bowmans\u2019 personal injury suit requesting a declaratory judgment that (1) all of the claims set forth in the Bowmans\u2019 complaint arise out of bodily injury to one person; (2) Auto-Owners\u2019 maximum liability under the policy issued to Davis for all claims is $50,000; and (3) such limitation of coverage is valid. The trial court ruled that the Bowmans\u2019 claims arose from bodily injuries sustained by one person, Angela Bowman; that the maximum liability coverage in Davis\u2019 policy is $50,000; and that the policy\u2019s limitation of coverage is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Davis\u2019 Auto-Owners policy states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u201cI. COVERAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u201cA. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201cB. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY. To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law for damages because of</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u201cA. bodily injury or</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u201cB. property damage</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cCONDITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u201c1. * * * [T]he Company\u2019s liability shall be limited as provided in Condition 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u201c2. Limits of Liability. The limit of liability expressed in the Declarations with respect to Coverages-A and D as applicable to \u2018each person\u2019 is the limit of the Company\u2019s liability for all damages, including damages for expenses, care and loss of services, <em>arising out of bodily injury to one person in any one occurrence; </em>the limit of such liability expressed in the Declarations as applicable to \u2018each occurrence\u2019 is, subject to the above provisions respecting such person, the total limit of the Company\u2019s liability for all damages, including damages for expenses, care and loss of services, arising out of bodily injury to one or more persons in any one occurrence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">As indicated above, the policy\u2019s declarations page provides limitations of $50,000 \u201ceach person\u201d and $100,000 \u201ceach occurrence.\u201d In addition, the policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">On appeal, the Bowmans argue that because of their emotional distress, they suffered bodily injury in the accident. As a result, the Bowmans claim that the $50,000 \u201ceach person\u201d provision allows an <em>additional </em>$50,000 of coverage, up to the $100,000 \u201ceach occurrence\u201d limit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">This court is of the opinion that, in the context of liability insurance, the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d contemplates only <em>physical </em>injury. Our view is consistent with the definitions of the terms comprising the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d For example, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cbodily,\u201d \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201csickness,\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">\u201cBodily. Pertaining to or concerning the body; of or belonging to the body or the physical constitution; not mental but corporeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">\u201cBodily Injury. Generally refers only to injury to the body, or to sickness or disease contracted by the injured as a result of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201cSickness. Illness; disease. An ailment of such a character as to affect the general soundness and health; not a mere temporary indisposition, which does not tend to undermine and weaken the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u201cDisease. Deviation from the healthy or normal condition of any of the functions or tissues of the body. An alteration in the state of the body or of some of its organs, interrupting or disturbing the performance of the vital functions, and causing or threatening pain and weakness. Illness; sickness, disorder, malady; bodily infirmity.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.Rev.1979) 159, 1238, 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Also, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d usually indicates an injury brought on by external violence. <em>Tomlinson v. Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 11, 540 N.E.2d 716. The Lake County Court of Appeals, in concluding that emotional distress is not a \u201cbodily injury\u201d for purposes of automobile liability insurance, took a similar approach. See <em>Vance v. Sang Chong, Inc. </em>(Nov. 9, 1990), Lake App. No. 88-L-13-188, unreported, 1990 WL 174121. In addition, Ohio courts have held that non-physical, consortium-type \u201cinjuries\u201d are not \u201cbodily injuries.\u201d See <em>Tomlinson </em>and <em>Muniz v. Erie Ins. Group </em>(Sept. 4, 1990), Stark App. No. CA-8075, unreported, 1990 WL 127947. Furthermore, other jurisdictions have limited the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d to physical injury when an insurance policy definition identical to that in the present case was at issue. See, <em>e.g., Mut. Serv. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Co-op Supply, Inc. </em>(D.Mont. 1988), 699 F.Supp. 1438; <em>Rolette City v. W. Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(D.N.D.1978), 452 F.Supp. 125; <em>W. Am. Ins. Co. v. Bank of Isle of Wight </em>(E.D.Va.1987), 673 F.Supp. 760; <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Campbell Cty. School Dist. No. 1 </em>(D.Wyo.1985), 612 F.Supp. 285; <em>Daley v. United Serv. Auto Assn. </em>(1988), 312 Md. 550, 541 A.2d 632; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Diamant </em>(1988), 401 Mass. 654, 518 N.E.2d 1154; <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Bisson </em>(1982), 122 N.H. 747, 449 A.2d 1226; <em>Northwest Farm Bur. Ins. Co. v. Roberts </em>(1988), 52 Wash.App. 888, 765 P.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Nevertheless, appellants rely on <em>Giancarli v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 68, 5 OBR 165, 449 N.E.2d 517, to support their argument that the word \u201csickness,\u201d as used in the policy\u2019s \u201cbodily injury\u201d definition, is ambiguous. In <em>Giancarli, </em>the court determined that the word \u201csickness\u201d was ambiguous as used in the family major-medical policy at issue in the case. The issue in <em>Giancarli </em>was whether the policy phrase \u201cany one sickness\u201d included the metastasis of the insured\u2019s first cancerous tumor to another part of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">We find that appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Giancarli </em>is misplaced. The <em>Giancarli </em>court focused on which physical conditions amount to \u201csickness,\u201d not on whether mental distress is a \u201csickness.\u201d In addition, <em>Giancarli </em>involved medical insurance, not automobile liability insurance where the insured and insurer contemplate coverage for the typical injuries, <em>i.e., </em>physical injuries, sustained in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>automobile accident. The <em>Giancarli </em>court also stated that it examined the word \u201csickness\u201d <em>as used in the policy at issue in the case. Giancarli, </em>5 Ohio App.3d at 69, 5 OBR at 166, 449 N.E.2d at 518. For these reasons, we conclude that the <em>Giancarli </em>holding is limited to its facts and is therefore unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Based on the commonly accepted definitions of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201csickness\u201d and \u201cdisease,\u201d the judicial trend to exclude non-physical harms such as emotional distress from the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d and the coverage anticipated by the parties in an automobile liability policy, we hold that the Bowmans\u2019 claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is not a separate \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the Auto-Owners policy. To find otherwise would subject insurance companies to a flood of separate claims for the mental suffering which commonly occurs when a family member, friend or relative is injured in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Because we find that the Bowmans\u2019 emotional distress claims are not \u201cbodily injuries,\u201d Angela Bowman is the only individual who sustained \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the accident for purposes of the Auto-Owners policy. Therefore, <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 84, 545 N.E.2d 83, is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In <em>Burris, </em>an automobile liability policy with an \u201ceach person\u201d coverage limit was also at issue. Like the Bowmans, the appellant in <em>Burris </em>argued that the higher \u201ceach occurrence\u201d coverage amount should apply to cover her emotional distress. Also, in <em>Burris, </em>as in this case, only one person suffered physical injuries in the accident. The <em>Burris </em>court held that \u201cthe number of persons sustaining bodily injury as a result of the accident controls the amount of coverage provided by the policy. Thus, the number of persons sustaining consequential damages is irrelevant for the purpose of determining the amount of coverage available.\u201d <em>Burris </em>at 91, 545 N.E.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">As we indicated above, only Angela Bowman sustained \u201cbodily injury\u201d as a result of the accident. Relying on <em>Burris, </em>this single \u201cbodily injury\u201d limits the required coverage to the \u201ceach person\u201d amount specified in the Auto-Owners policy. Accordingly, the trial court correctly limited Auto-Owners\u2019 obligation to $50,000. Appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-9\">Koehler and William W. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\">. Although the parties stipulated that the accident occurred on October 3, 1989, this must be a typographical error. The complaint stales the accident date was September 8, 1988. Also, the parties stipulated that the Auto-Owners policy provides coverage. The declarations page, however, indicates that the policy term was July 1, 1988 to January 1, 1989. Therefore, the September 1988 date must apply to coincide with the policy term.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
