When the goods were delivered to them appellants gave him a warehouse receipt in the usual form. In April, 1896, appellee borrowed the sum of $20 from appellants. At that time, and as a part of the same transaction, certain papers were executed between them, namely:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-7\" pgmap=\"658\">1. Upon the back of the warehouse receipt was written the following:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-8\" pgmap=\"658\">\u201c April 14, \u201996.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-9\" pgmap=\"658\">For value received I hereby sell and assign to W.

E. Brackett (except in case of fire) one lot of H.

C. Reebie &amp; Bro.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-20\" pgmap=\"658(10) 659(292)\">The sum of $78 mentioned in the last paper includes the $20 then loaned. It appears that appellee was a traveling man, and was absent from the city of Chicago the greater part of the time. In September, 1896, the wife of appellee, acting for him, called upon appellants and paid them $25. She asked for a receipt, but they refused to give it, stating that the transaction ivas a peculiar one. They did not tell her that appellee had sold the goods to them. She left her address, and they promised they would not sell the goods without personally notifying her. She called upon them several times after that, telling them that she was saving money and would soon have it all paid. In April, 1898, without previously notifying appellee or his wife, appellants placed the goods in an auction room and sold them for the net sum of $202.40. In August, 1898, the wife of appellee went to pay the storage upon and take the goods. She had the necessary money with her. When she made known her errand, one of appellants told her that the goods were sold. Subsequently appellee called upon appellants and was told by them that his goods had been sold. Upon the trial appellee introduced evidence tending to prove that these goods were worth from $1,400 to $1,800, and contended that he was entitled to recover the value of the goods in August, 1898, when the demand was made and conversion took place. The contention of appellants is that the recovery, if any, is limited to the amount of cash realized at the auction sale. The jury returned a verdict finding the issues for appellee and assessing his damages at $610. Judgment was rendered upon the verdict, from which this appeal was perfected.</p><attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-4\" pgmap=\"659\">Vocke &amp; Healy, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-5\" pgmap=\"659(62) 660(31)\">Assumpsit will not lie to recover property wrongfully withheld from the owner, unless it has been sold and converted into money or money\u2019s worth, in which event the owner may waive the tort for wrongfully taking or holding the property and sue in asstimpsit for the amount actually received at such sale. 1 Am. &amp; Eng.

This gave them a common law lien upon the goods for services performed in relation to them. They had the right to hold the goods until their charges upon them were paid, but they had no right to sell the goods for their charges. Without an enabling statute the warehouseman can not sell the property stored with him, unless he obtains an order to that effect from a court of competent jurisdiction. Jones on Liens, Sec. 976; Low v. Martin, 18 Ill. 286; Hanchett v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, 25 Ill. App. 284. In many of the states a remedy by sale for the purpose of enforcing this lien is provided by statute. Counsel have not referred us to such a statute in this state, and we have found none.</p> <p id=\"b661-6\" pgmap=\"661\">The loan of $20 to appellee, the assignment of the warehouse certificate to appellants, and the execution of the defeasance, being simultaneous and parts of the same transaction, constituted a mortgage as between the parties. Jones on Chatt. Mortgages, Sec. 19, 2d Ed. The law is that upon forfeiture of the condition in the mortgage, the .possession of the goods then being in appellants, the legal title vested in them absolutely, and they might lawfully sell such goods either at public or private sale. Rhines v. Phelps, 3 Gilm. 455; Constant v. Matteson, 22 Ill. 559; Durfee v. Grinnell, 69 Ill. 373; Larmon v. Carpenter, 70 Ill. 550; McConnell v. People, 84 Ill. 584.</p> <p id=\"b661-7\" pgmap=\"661(41) 662(103)\">But these authorities have no application to this case, for the reason that the property stored consisted of household goods, and appellee was then a married man and his wife did not join with him in the conveyance. Under the act of 1889, concerning the foreclosure of chattel mortgages upon household goods, etc., it is provided that no chattel mortgage, executed by a married man or married woman on household goods, shall be valid unless joined in by the husband or wife, as the case may be. In Gaines v. Williams, 146 Ill. 450, this act is held to be valid. It follows that what these parties did April 14, 1896, is void, and appellants acquired no rights thereunder. Being a nullity, it left the parties just where it found them. Appellants remained as warehousemen with no right of sale.</p> <p id=\"b662-4\" pgmap=\"662\">Afterward, and without having obtained a decree of a court of chancery empowering them to sell, appellants sold these goods, and thereby converted them. By so doing they rendered themselves liable to this action for damages.</p> <p id=\"b662-5\" pgmap=\"662\">There is abundant evidence in the record to sustain the verdict as to the amount of damages. The objection made that the witnesses were not experts, and therefore not qualified to testify as to the value of the goods, is not well taken.</p> <p id=\"b662-6\" pgmap=\"662\">\u201c Every one is presumed to have some idea of the value of property which is in almost universal use, and it is not necessary to show that a witness is a drover or a butcher before he is allowed to give an opinion of the value of a cow.\u201d Ohio &amp; M. R. R. Co. v. Irvin, 27 Ill. 180. See, also, Sewell v. Chicago Terminal R. R. Co., 177 Ill. 95.</p> <p id=\"b662-7\" pgmap=\"662\">The warehouse receipt fixed no time within which the goods were to be returned to appellee. Hence they \"were deliverable on demand. These goods were converted by appellants, and the measure of appellee\u2019s recovery is their value at the date of the demand. Cushman v. Hayes, 46 Ill. 145, 156; C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Dickinson, 74 Ill. 258.</p> <p id=\"b662-8\" pgmap=\"662\">We are satisfied that the law involved in the case was -fairly given to the jury, and that the verdict is just. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
