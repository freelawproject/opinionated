I give and bequeath unto my daughter, Charlotte L.

Barnes, as such trustee, and I do hereby revoke so much of paragraph twenty-two on page fourteen of my said last will of date April 18, 1891, as shall be inconsistent herewith.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">The estate of John D. Gillett was administered by Richard J. Oglesby, David T. Littler and John P. Gillett, the executors of his will; and by their inventory it appears that John D. Gillett died in possession of bank stock in the First National Banks of Lincoln, Farmer City and Mt. Pulaski; the Farmers\u2019 National Bank of Springfield and Pekin; the Illinois National Bank of Springfield and the National State Bank of Bloomington. Of these the Farmer City, and Bloomington banks voluntarily liquidated and the stock of the Mt. Pulaski and Pekin banks was sold; the proceeds from all such stock going to Lemira P. Gillett by the terms of the will of her husband. In each case there was an accretion of surplus and undivided profits to the par value of the stock. In 1889 the accumulation of undivided profits and surplus funds of the Lincoln bank equaled the amount of the capital stock and by the action of the stockholders this surplus fund was appropriated to the capital stock of the bank, which was thereby doubled, the increase being represented by certificates issued to the holders of original stock pro rata, of which Lemira P. Gillett received 100 shares; and it was this bank stock, issued on increasing the capital stock, which was mentioned and bequeathed in the will of Lemira P. Gillett as of her own property.</p> <p id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108(42) 109(41)\">The executors of the will of John D. Gillett were discharged in 1896; and later Jessie D. Gillett, as administratrix de bonis non, with the will annexed, exhibited this bill in chancery seeking a construction of the will of John D. Gillett, and an order of distribution of the proceeds of the bank stock converted on liquidation of the banks mentioned and by sale of the stock; and also as to the shares issued upon the increase of capital stock.</p> <p id=\"b109-4\" pgmap=\"109\">The decree of the trial court found that all the bank stock and the proceeds thereof remaining at the death of Lemira P. Gillett passed under the specific bequests of the will of John D. Gillett to the children who survive her; and that it did not pass under the residuary clause; and ordered distribution accordingly. This appeal is prosecuted to effect a reversal of the decree, with the contentions that the court erred by finding and ordering that the funds received by Lemira P. Gillett from the banks going into voluntary liquidation passed under such specific bequests to the children who survived her, and making a like order with reference to the shares of stock in the Lincoln bank issued upon increase of stock. It is insisted that the proceeds of stock upon the liquidation of the banks should pass under the residuary clause, and to the children who survived John D. Gillett; that the increase of stock in the Lincoln bank should pass the same way; and one appellant insists that such increase of capital stock was the absolute property of Lemira P. Gillett and that it should pass under her will.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109(152) 110(226)\">It is argued that the fact of the accumulation of surplus and undivided earnings on the capital stock of the Lincoln bank and the addition of such earnings to the stock is conclusive of the fact that it became thereby the absolute property of Lemira P. Gillett, and that she was entitled to take and use it as such. An examination of the terms of the will discloses that the testator created a division of his banking interests, making his bank stock the principal and inalienable portion, and its earnings appropriated and divided among the stockholders the secondary portion. The principal portion was bequeathed to her for life, the secondary portion absolutely. We are not disposed to take his use of the term \u201c bank stock \u201d in any special or restricted sense but rather to take it in the general and common acceptation of the term, equivalent to meaning his interest in the bank. In this sense it is apparent that the term stock includes not only the capital stock considered at par but also the surplus undivided, used by the bank and partaking of many of the attributes of capital stock. This surplus fund at no time left the control of the bank; it was not appropriated and paid out to stockholders but was retained for banking purposes and at length converted to all the uses and purposes of capital stock, and came to the possession and control of the stockholder as capital stock. The secondary portion of his interests in the bank, that part which would be severed from banking purposes and paid out to the stockholders while the other portion was still retained for banking purposes, was, we think, the only part which by the terms of the will could be rightly converted to her own uses by Lemira P. Gillett. It seems to have been the testator\u2019s clear intention to keep intact the principal portion of his banking interests during the life of his widow; and such intention will be given full effect. In that view of the matter, which we think admits of no other construction in considering all the terms of this instrument, Lemira P. Gillett was without authority to alienate the shares of stock in the Lincoln bank.</p> <p id=\"b110-5\" pgmap=\"110(170) 111(76)\">While the will does not in terms specify that the proceeds derived from banks upon winding up affairs and closing business should pass to the specific legatees at the death of Lemira P. Gillett, yet it seems plain from every intendment that such was its purpose. Ho other disposition is specifically made of such a fund. But the will does provide that unsold stock and the proceeds arising from the sale of stock shall be disposed of in that manner. How it is clear that stock which passes out of existence upon the winding up and liquidation of a bank can not in any sense be said to have been sold. . It was surrendered up to be canceled; its functions destroyed; and was deprived of the capacity of being bought and sold. So that while the stock may have been sold, converted by liquidation or remained in force, we are of the opinion the testator meant to include it all under the terms sold and unsold. Gathered from the whole will, as we have above noted, it was the testator\u2019s intention to preserve unimpaired his banking interests in a fund comprising cash and shares of stock, either or both, to be distributed according to the specific bequests of the will. He expressed this in a manner leaving no reasonable doubt of his intention, and to elicit which it is not necessary either to expunge words from or add language to the will.</p> <p id=\"b111-4\" pgmap=\"111\">The vesting of any interests in the remainder of the bank stock after the life estate, was specifically postponed until the death of Lemira P. Gfillett. Grace Adeline Littler and John P. Gillett having died without issue surviving before that contingency, were never seized of a vested interest in the bank stock and were not alive to receive it when she died. Therefore the bequests to each of them lapsed by virtue of the unqualified and clear expression of the will itself. The decree of the Circuit Court is right and it is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
