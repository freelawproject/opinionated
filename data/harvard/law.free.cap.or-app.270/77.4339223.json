As an insured under an auto policy, she sought uninsured motorist (UM) benefits in a contract action against defendant, Farmers Insurance Company (Farmers). After cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed her claim on the basis that her injury did not \u201carise out of the * * * use of [an] uninsured vehicle,\u201d as provided in ORS 742.504(l)(a) and Farmers\u2019 policy. On appeal, the issue is whether this case is governed by our decision 22 years ago interpreting policy language in a claim for UM benefits or is governed by a more recent decision of the Supreme Court interpreting similar statutory language in a claim for personal injury protection (PIP) benefits. Because statutory language prevails over policy language and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of similar terms is dispositive, we conclude that the trial court erred in part and that Farmers\u2019 policy may cover plaintiffs injuries, although other issues remain for decision. Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Two cars traveled the same direction on a street in northeast Portland. Plaintiff was a passenger in a car insured by Farmers with UM coverage required by ORS 742.504.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the next lane, Jesse Guerrero drove a vehicle alongside plaintiffs car. Gunshots were fired from Guerrero\u2019s vehicle into plaintiffs car, causing her serious injuries. Because Guerrero\u2019s insurer denied coverage for his liability, his vehicle was deemed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d under the terms of plaintiffs policy and statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff made a claim for UM benefits with Farmers. The insurer denied her claim, and she commenced an action against Farmers for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on coverage. Farmers contended that our decision in <em>Worldwide Underwriters, Ins. Co. v. Jackson, </em>121 Or App 292, 855 P2d 166, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 26 (1993) <em>(Jackson), </em>should control because the decision construed the same phrase in a UM policy (\u201carising out of\u2019); determined a gunshot, not a vehicle, to be the \u201cdirect cause\u201d of injury; and upheld the denial of coverage. Plaintiff contended that a more recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Carrigan v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>326 Or 97, 949 P2d 705 (1997), should control, because the court construed similar language in the PIP statute and rejected a \u201cdirect cause\u201d interpretation. Plaintiff reasoned that <em>Carrigan </em>portends that ORS 742.504(l)(a) should require UM coverage for plaintiffs injuries. Farmers responded that Carrigan\u2019s interpretation should be limited to PIP coverage as a different form of coverage that provides no-fault coverage for medical bills and wage loss. The trial court deemed <em>Carrigan </em>distinguishable, found <em>Jackson </em>to be on point, denied plaintiffs motion, granted Farmers\u2019 motion, and entered judgment dismissing plaintiffs action.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to the order granting defendant summary judgment and denying plaintiff summary judgment. Plaintiff argues that our earlier decision in <em>Jackson </em>did not consider the controlling terms of ORS 742.504(l)(a) on mandated UM coverage and that the Supreme Court construed the parallel terms of ORS 742.520 on PIP coverage. Farmers responds that <em>Jackson </em>is still good law and, if nothing else, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>counsels adherence to <em>Jackson </em>as to UM coverage for a drive-by shooting. Resolution of the dispute turns upon whether our prior conclusion remains true in light of the mandatory terms of the UM statute, ORS 742.504(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Our decision in <em>Jackson </em>and the cases on which it relied were indeed cases that construed policies without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>considering a statutory mandate for coverage, if any pertained. Based in policy language, those cases developed a standard for the causal connection between an injury and use of a vehicle. We first recap <em>Jackson </em>in order to then assess the implication of <em>Corrigan </em>as to the statutory mandate for UM coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><em>Jackson </em>also involved a drive-by shooting. As a car approached the victim, a man leaned out the car window and fired a gun, blinding the victim in his right eye. The man escaped in the car unidentified. The victim\u2019s UM insurer sought a declaratory ruling that, under the terms of the policy, the injury did not \u201carise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of the uninsured vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim asserted that there was a necessary relationship between the use of the vehicle and the injury, because the vehicle was used to launch the assault, approach him without detection, fire the shot, and escape. We responded, \u201cIt is immaterial that the vehicle may have facilitated the shooting and the escape. It was not the \u2018direct cause\u2019 of the shooting.\u201d 121 Or App at 295. We had \u201cno doubt that the use of the assailant\u2019s vehicle was \u2018within the line of causation\u2019 of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296. But the policy language raised a question of \u201ccausation and remoteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Summarizing prior cases, we declared, \u201cCoverage depends on whether the injury \u2018was <em>directly </em>caused by some act wholly disassociated from and independent of the vehicle\u2019s use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We concluded that the \u201ccritical fact\u201d was that the injury was \u201cdirectly caused by the use of a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297. Therefore, the injury did not \u201carise out of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of an uninsured vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 294. In reaching that conclusion, we relied on two cases that had construed liability policies to determine the requisite causal connection between a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and an injury: <em>Oakridge Comm. Ambulance v. U.S. Fidelity, </em>278 Or 21, 24, 563 P2d 164 (1977) <em>(Oakridge </em>Ambulance) (death allegedly linked to delayed ambulance), and <em>Jordan v. Lee, </em>76 Or App 472, 475, 709 P2d 752, <em>rev den, </em>300 Or 545 (1986) (gunshot injury in a travel trailer).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirmed the judgment denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">A member of the court, then-Judge Durham, dissented, drawing from the same precedents. <em>Jackson, </em>121 Or App at 297 (Durham, J., dissenting). He quoted a Supreme Court decision for its use of an insurance treatise, which, in part, observed, \u201cThe words \u2018arising out of when used in such a [policy] provision are of broader significance than the words \u2018caused by[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297-98 (quoting <em>Oakridge Ambulance, </em>278 Or at 24 (citing Appleman 7, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 4317, 144)). Concluding that a \u201cvehicle\u2019s use need not be the direct and efficient cause,\u201d then-Judge Durham urged, \u201cThe majority is not free to impose a direct causation requirement * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299. Although his observations proved unpersuasive in <em>Jackson, </em>they presaged the Supreme Court decision in <em>Carrigan </em>and its statutory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In <em>Carrigan, </em>the Supreme Court faced the question whether, in light of a statutory mandate, State Farm\u2019s policy should provide PIP coverage for a gunshot injury suffered in a carjacking. 326 Or at 99. Early one morning, the plaintiff had agreed to give a stranger a ride. Along the way, the stranger Henderson pulled a gun, pointed it at the plaintiff, and gave him directions. Later, Henderson ordered the plaintiff out of the car and into the trunk. The plaintiff could not fit in the trunk. When he backed about 30 feet away from the vehicle, Henderson shot him in the chest. The plaintiff survived to file a claim for PIP benefits for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>expenses. State Farm denied the claim, and the plaintiff initiated a declaratory proceeding to challenge the denial. The trial court gave summary judgment for the insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Under ORS 742.520(2)(a), policies are mandated to provide PIP coverage for injuries \u201cresulting *** from the use, occupancy or maintenance of any motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff based his complaint on the terms of the statute. When the case was before this court, we observed that the PIP statute\u2019s phrase, \u201cresulting from,\u201d was not the broader phrase, \u201carising out of,\u201d and that <em>Oakridge Ambulance, Jordan, </em>and <em>Jackson </em>all required more than the simple fact that the vehicle\u2019s use is within the \u201cline of causation.\u201d We held that the trial court correctly determined that the injuries did not \u201cresult from\u201d the use of a vehicle. <em>Carrigan v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>140 Or App 359, 366, 914 P2d 1088 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>326 Or 97, 949 P2d 795 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The Supreme Court reversed. <em>Carrigan, </em>326 Or at 105. The court recognized that the phrase, \u201cresulting from,\u201d had two plausible interpretations. One would \u201climit coverage only to injuries that <em>are inflicted directly by the use of a motor vehicle </em>and <em>during </em>the operation of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102 (emphasis in original). Another would \u201ccover injuries that result <em>indirectly </em>from the use of a motor vehicle, as well as those that result directly from such use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102-03 (emphases in original). The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cThe legislature used the term \u2018resulting\u2019 by itself and did not modify that term with the adjective \u2018direct\u2019 or any similar limiting term. If the legislature desires to restrict the scope of coverage that the statute contemplates, it does not lack the linguistic tools necessary to achieve that outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 103. Finding no legislative history on the phrase \u201cresulting from the use * * * of any motor vehicle,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>turned for guidance to the introduction to the Insurance Code. The court noted that ORS 731.008 provides that \u201cthe Insurance Code is for the protection of the insurance-buying public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. And, ORS 731.016 advises that \u201c[t]he Insurance Code shall be liberally construed\u201d to further that purpose. <em>Id. </em>Speaking to the general possibility of coverage, the court announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">\u201cThus, our consideration of statutory text, context, legislative history, and pertinent maxims of statutory construction cumulatively leads us to hold that PIP coverage extends to gunshot injuries that result from the use of a motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 105. That general conclusion, however, did not address the particular circumstance of the case. If a car\u2019s occupant were \u201cshot by a sniper,\u201d the court posited, then the victim would be \u201cinjured as a result of the use of a motor vehicle\u201d so as to be covered. <em>Id. </em>But what about this plaintiff standing 30 feet outside a vehicle? The court concluded that, because the assailant had taken over use of the car and shot the plaintiff in close proximity soon thereafter, the carjacking and injury were the result of a \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle so as to require coverage. <em>Id. </em>PIP coverage was mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, <em>Corrigan </em>cannot be ignored as an aberration involving a distinguishable form of auto coverage. In this case, unlike in <em>Jackson, </em>the plaintiff asserts the statutory terms of UM coverage. Under ORS 742.504, every subject motor vehicle policy must provide terms of coverage that are no less favorable than the statutory terms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Erickson v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>331 Or 681, 685, 21 P3d 90 (2001) (invalidating a policy\u2019s less favorable provisions); <em>Vega v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>323 Or 291, 300-01, 918 P2d 95 (1996) (same). The mandated UM coverage requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cthe insurer will pay all sums that the insured, the heirs or the legal representative of the insured is legally entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to recover as general and special damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by accident and <em>arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured vehicle.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">ORS 742.504(l)(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This mandate is addressed in terms of injuries that \u201carise out of\u2019 the use of an uninsured vehicle, and, as such, it happens to be the phrase that has been repeatedly described as \u201cbroader\u201d than the phrase, \u201ccaused by\u201d the use of a vehicle. <em>See Oakridge Ambulance, </em>278 Or at 25; <em>see also Jordan, </em>76 Or App at 475 (acknowledging that \u201carising out of\u2019 has a broader meaning than \u201ccaused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We cannot draw a meaningful distinction between the operative phrase in the UM statute\u2014\u201carising out of\u2019\u2014 and the operative phrase in the PIP statute\u2014\u201cresulting from\u201d\u2014which <em>Carrigan </em>construed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 742.504(l)(a); ORS 742.520(2)(a). The benefits may be different. That is, PIP may provide no-fault recovery for medical costs and wages loss, ORS 742.524, while UM may provide fault-based recovery for economic and noneconomic damages, ORS 742.504(l)(a)(B). But the causal link in the two statutes between an injury and a vehicle use is the same.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Plaintiff is correct that <em>Carrigan </em>portends a different result when ORS 742.504(l)(a) is invoked to demand mandated coverage that may be broader than what a policy might provide. <em>See, e.g, Erickson, </em>331 Or at 687 (invalidating \u201cother insurances\u201d provisions in a policy); <em>Vega, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>323 Or at 303 (invalidating exhaustion clause not permitted by statute at that time). Much like the PIP statute at ORS 742.520(2)(a), the UM statute at ORS 742.504(l)(a) provides that UM coverage \u201cwill pay all sums\u201d that would be recoverable \u201cas general or special damages\u201d because of bodily injury \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured vehicle.\u201d Like the Supreme Court in <em>Corrigan, </em>we observe that the legislature did not insert a requirement that the injury be \u201cdirectly caused\u201d by vehicle use. If the legislature had desired to restrict the scope of coverage in that way, \u201cit does not lack the linguistic tools necessary to achieve that outcome.\u201d <em>Corrigan, </em>326 Or at 103. To the contrary, the legislature chose for UM coverage the broad phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 vehicle use. The parties have pointed to no legislative history, and we are aware of none indicating a narrower meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">As was the court in <em>Corrigan, </em>we are mindful of the admonition of ORS 731.008 and ORS 731.016 that the Insurance Code should be liberally construed for the protection of the insurance-buying public. Because a policy must provide coverage no less favorable than the statute, we conclude that ORS 742.504(l)(a) requires UM coverage when the injury arises out of the use of an uninsured vehicle and that coverage cannot be denied based on an interpretation that the gunshots were the \u201cdirect cause\u201d of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Understandably, Farmers invokes the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>to dissuade this court from reaching a result contrary to <em>Jackson, </em>a similar UM claim based on a drive-by shooting. <em>Stare decisis </em>is a prudential doctrine that embodies the tension between stability and correction of error. <em>See Farmers Ins. Co. v. Mowry, </em>350 Or 686, 698, 261 P3d 1 (2011). The doctrine requires that a court begin with the assumption that issues were correctly resolved in cases previously decided. <em>Id. </em>Departure from precedent may be considered when the previous court was \u201cnot presented with an important argument or failed to apply [its] usual framework for decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201ccourt is [also] willing to reconsider cases when the legal or factual context has changed in such a way as to seriously undermine the reasoning or result of earlier cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For both reasons, we do not adhere to <em>Jackson. </em>This court was not asked in <em>Jackson </em>to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the implication of the statutory mandate for coverage as required by ORS 742.504(1)(a). In addition, the subsequent decision in <em>Carrigan, </em>involving statutory text that cannot be distinguished, represents a changed legal context. Indeed, because <em>Carrigan </em>is a decision of the Supreme Court, it is an interpretation of a similar provision that we are not free to ignore.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Our conclusion on coverage means that the trial court erred in granting Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff may show that the offender\u2019s vehicle was used to approach with surprise and maximize the likelihood of injury. Those facts would establish that \u201cthe temporal and spatial distance\u201d between that vehicle use and the injury are sufficient to permit the conclusion that that the injury arose out of use of the vehicle. <em>See Carrigan, </em>326 Or at 105; <em>see also Davis, </em>264 Or 547 (vehicle used to inflict intentional injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Farmers argues that this conclusion should not mean that the trial court erred in denying plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment, by which plaintiff had sought a declaration that there <em>is </em>coverage for this injury. Farmers argues that plaintiff has not yet proved, in the language of the insuring clause, that plaintiff is legally entitled to recover from the \u201cowner or operator of the uninsured * * * motor vehicle.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 742.504(l)(a) (statutory analogue). Farmers disputes whether plaintiff succeeded in showing all that was necessary for coverage, at least at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Farmers is correct. Failure of Farmers\u2019 motion to defeat coverage does not require granting plaintiffs cross-motion to declare coverage. The complaint does not allege specifically that Guerrero fired the shots or is otherwise liable as a tort conspirator or joint tortfeasor. No declarations or affidavits appear in the record to establish that specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>fact. The allegation of the complaint certainly <em>does permit </em>such proof to be offered, and plaintiff may yet prove facts to establish coverage. But, construing facts on plaintiffs cross-motion in favor of the non-moving party, ORCP 47 C, the ambiguity of the complaint and the absence of specific evidence by affidavit or declaration mean that the trial court did not err in denying plaintiffs cross-motion. Further proceedings, to which plaintiff alludes in reply, may establish such facts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The liability of the uninsured motorist and the extent of recoverable damages remain to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and did not err in denying plaintiffs cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\"> The insuring clause of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201cWe will pay all sums which an insured person is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured person.
