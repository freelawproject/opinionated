At defendant\u2019s trial, over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the state to discuss and introduce evidence of text messages that the victim sent to defendant at the police\u2019s request, as well as defendant\u2019s nonresponse to those messages. In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress that evidence, arguing that the state\u2019s use of his silence as substantive evidence at trial violated his right to remain silent under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the text messages and defendant\u2019s nonresponse to the messages as adoptive admissions under OEC 801(4)(b)(B). We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, in which he argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find him guilty by a nonunanimous verdict. <em>State v. Cobb, </em>224 Or App 594, 198 P3d 978 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009). For the reasons below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress for legal error and are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). When reviewing a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling that a statement fits within an exception to the hearsay rule, we apply a two-part standard of review. <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 537, 135 P3d 260 (2006). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s preliminary factual findings for any evidence, but we review the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion about whether the hearsay statement is admissible for legal error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Defendant was charged with first-degree rape of the victim. The victim was a friend of defendant\u2019s who, to avoid driving while intoxicated after a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, spent the night on defendant\u2019s couch. Other people were staying at the house that night, including defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Wanke. After everyone had gone to bed, defendant went downstairs and sexually assaulted the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Later that morning, the victim exchanged text messages with Wanke and spoke with her on the phone. Eventually, the victim told Wanke that she had woken up to defendant raping her. In a text message to the victim, Wanke wrote, in part, that defendant \u201csaid he bla[c]ked out[.] *** [H]e wanted to know if you are going to the cops[.]\u201d The victim did contact the police, and later that evening, she spoke with Detective Myers on the phone. Myers asked if the victim would send defendant text messages. The victim agreed, and Myers instructed her on what the messages should say. The victim sent defendant two text messages that evening. The first said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this happened!.] [W]e\u2019ve been friends for along [sic] time. [W]hy did [you] do that to me?\u201d The second said, \u201cI really want to know why? [I don\u2019t know] what to do but I was passed out[.] [W]hat made what [you] did ok?\u201d Defendant did not respond to either message. Defendant was later arrested and charged with first-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Before trial, the state had given defense counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> copies of the text messages that the victim had sent defendant. However, it was not until the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, in which the prosecutor told the jury that Myers had asked the victim to send the text messages, that defense counsel became aware of the police involvement in the messages. Upon learning that fact, defense counsel moved to suppress that evidence and for a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued that, in telling the jury about defendant\u2019s non-response to the text messages, the state was impermissibly using defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent against him. The state responded that there was no constitutional violation because the text messages, from the perspective of defendant, had come from a woman whom he had known for years; it was not a situation in which defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>had told the detective that he was not talking to the police. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions, ruling that it was not significant that the text messages were sent at the request of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Defendant maintained his objections during the state\u2019s direct examination of the victim. The victim testified that Myers had asked her if she would send text messages to defendant\u2019s phone and that she had agreed to do so. She further testified that Myers had told her what to say in the messages. The prosecutor then had her describe the content of the first text message, and she testified that she received no response. The prosecutor followed the same line of questioning for the second text message. The victim then said several more times that defendant had not responded after relating that, at the time of the assault, she and her husband had been friends with defendant for six years and that she had spent time with defendant as a friend. The prosecutor returned to the text messages a final time after the court admitted two photographs of the messages, and the victim repeated that defendant had not responded to them. Defendant objected at each juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">At that point, after the jury left the courtroom, the court addressed defense counsel\u2019s objections to the victim\u2019s testimony about the text messages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Alright, I\u2019ve been assuming that the objection to the text messages and the non response has been on the same basis as what was discussed earlier outside the presence of the jury, but I, I, it occurs to me that I should probably ask and make sure that there\u2019s no additional grounds for any objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, we\u2019d just like to expand on that a bit, and Mr. Graham will do that if that\u2019s alright with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, one, there was subterfuge by, by the State to get that information, and I anticipate that the State will, will then use that silence as an admission. And it\u2019s one thing for the State to come in and say, \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t respond.\u2019 There\u2019s no explanation of why he didn\u2019t respond, it\u2019s just he didn\u2019t respond. It could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>have gone into * * * a device and be * * * locked in the car, it could be in a number of places. * * * And, and they\u2019re, they\u2019re in a position now to try to argue, and I anticipate they will try to argue that that\u2019s an admission. *** [I]f the Court\u2019s going to allow it in, then the Court should say, \u2018You may not use it as a re, as an admission by silence.\u2019 In the classic situation an admission by silence is where two people are face to face and one says, \u2018You ran the red light\u2019 and the other person stands mute, mute. This is, this can\u2019t be analogous to that same situation Your Honor, and I want the Court, I would like to ask the Court to give an instruction and * * * admonish the State that it may not argue an admission by silence in this circumstance. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The prosecutor responded that both parties could argue the inferences that the jury should make regarding the evidence that defendant had not responded to the victim\u2019s text messages and that the photographs of the messages were offered \u201cjust to show that the messages were sent, period [.]\u201d The prosecutor then stated the inference that he would argue to the jury and acknowledged that the state would ask the jury to infer that defendant\u2019s failure to respond was an admission of guilt. The court allowed the parties an opportunity to submit written briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In its ruling from the bench the next day, the court explained that it thought that there were two issues presented by the text messages: (1) whether defendant\u2019s nonresponse was an admission by silence and therefore admissible as nonhearsay and (2) whether defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination was implicated by the evidence. As to the first issue, the court ruled that, because it was unclear that, in not responding to the text messages, defendant was adopting them, there was no adoptive admission. As to the constitutional issue, the court concluded that there was no problem with the state using defendant\u2019s silence and arguing an inference of guilt from it because defendant was not in custody and had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the time. The court further explained that there were a number of nonprejudicial inferences that could be drawn from defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Defense counsel then argued that, because the court had ruled that defendant\u2019s failure to respond was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>adoptive admission of the statements in the text messages, the text messages were inadmissible. The court explained that defendant\u2019s failure to respond was not a statement and that the text messages were not inadmissible hearsay. Although defense counsel protested that the text messages were hearsay, the court did not alter its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Defendant later testified at trial. Defendant admitted receiving the text messages but explained that he had not responded to them because \u201cthey were weird\u201d and that \u201cthey didn\u2019t make sense and I just ignored them.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the text messages and his nonresponse to those messages. Defendant argues that, because the police told the victim to send the text messages, the questions and accusations contained in the messages constituted police questioning. From that proposition, defendant reasons that, when he did not respond to those text messages, he was exercising his constitutional right to remain silent under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. Accordingly, defendant contends, the state\u2019s subsequent use of that silence as substantive evidence at trial was an impermissible comment on his right to remain silent, and that evidence should have been suppressed. <em>See State v. Larson, </em>325 Or 15, 22, 933 P2d 958 (1997) (stating that \u201cthe Oregon Constitution does not permit a prosecutor to draw the jury\u2019s attention to a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent\u201d); <em>State v. Smallwood, </em>277 Or 503, 505-06, 561 P2d 600, <em>cert den, </em>434 US 849 (1977) (\u201cThere is no doubt that it is usually reversible error to admit evidence of the exercise by a defendant of the rights which the constitution gives him if it is done in a context whereupon inferences prejudicial to the defendant are likely to be drawn by the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The state responds that, under the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Davis, </em>350 Or 440, 256 P3d 1075 (2011), defendant did not have a constitutionally protected right to remain silent when the victim sent him the text messages, because he was not in custody or in compelling circumstances; therefore, the trial court did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>allowing the state to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s non-response to the messages. We agree with the state that the major premise of defendant\u2019s argument\u2014that his right to remain silent under Article I, section 12, was implicated\u2014is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Article I, section 12, provides that a defendant shall not \u201cbe compelled * * * to testify against himself.\u201d In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether, under Article I, section 12, a suspect\u2019s invocation of a right to remain silent without the assistance of counsel <em>at a time that he or she is not in custody or in compelling circumstances </em>precludes the police from nevertheless attempting to obtain incriminating information from that suspect.\u201d 350 Or at 446-47 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court concluded that the right is not implicated in noncompelling circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The facts in <em>Davis </em>bear some similarity to those at issue here because, in that case, the police also instructed the victim concerning certain communications she had with the defendant. In <em>Davis, </em>the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter reported to the police that the defendant had been sexually abusing her. 350 Or at 442. A detective contacted the defendant by phone to discuss the allegations, and the defendant asked if there was a warrant for his arrest and if he needed an attorney. <em>Id. </em>The detective told him that he was not \u201cwanted\u201d and that it was up to the defendant to decide if he wanted an attorney. <em>Id. </em>A few weeks later, the detective received a letter from the defendant\u2019s attorney, stating that the attorney was aware of the allegations against the defendant, that he was invoking the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, and that the detective should not directly contact the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 443. Eight months later, the victim told the detective that the defendant had contacted her via her instant-messaging service. The detective arranged for the victim to come to his office to engage in monitored instant-message conversations with the defendant. The detective instructed the victim about the persona that she should portray during the conversations and, to some extent, told her what to say. <em>Id. </em>During those conversations, the defendant made several incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>At trial, the defendant sought to suppress the evidence derived from his monitored conversations with the victim. He argued that, because he had invoked his right to counsel and right to remain silent eight months before, the police could not thereafter communicate with him except through counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 443-44. The trial court agreed and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground that the police had violated the defendant\u2019s Article I, section 11, right to counsel and his Article I, section 12, right to remain silent when they questioned the defendant, through the victim, without his attorney present. <em>Id. </em>at 444. We affirmed, because the police knew that the defendant had asserted his right to remain silent. <em>State v. Davis, </em>234 Or App 106, 113, 227 P3d 204 (2010), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>350 Or 440, 256 P3d 1075 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">On review, the Supreme Court noted that, although several of its cases had alluded to the history of Article I, section 12, none had engaged in the analysis that <em>Priest v. Pearce, </em>314 Or 411, 840 P2d 65 (1992), requires to address the constitutional issue presented in that case. <em>Davis, </em>350 Or at 446. Accordingly, the court analyzed the provision\u2019s text, its historical context, and the case law that had construed it to determine whether, \u201cas defendant contends and the Court of Appeals held, Article I, section 12, prohibits police from obtaining incriminating statements from a defendant in the absence of compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Beginning with the text of Article I, section 12, the court noted that, \u201c[t]aken at face value, the provision does not state a broad \u2018right to remain silent.\u2019 Rather, it states a much more specific right not to be \u2018compelled\u2019 to testify against himself or herself.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>350 Or at 447. The court\u2019s examination of the historical underpinnings of Article I, section 12, revealed a similar emphasis on freedom from compulsion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201c[T]he evidence of the historical circumstances of the adoption of Article I, section 12, in the mid-nineteenth century reveals that the constitutional right against self-incrimination generally was understood to limit the means by which the state may obtain evidence from criminal defendants by prohibiting compelled testimony. In our examination of the historical record, we have found a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>absence of evidence of the recognition of a constitutionally protected \u2018right to remain silent\u2019 that exists independent of compelling circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 453-54 (footnote omitted). Turning then to Oregon case law construing that provision, the court noted that, from very early on, its cases held that \u201cthe focus of Article I, section 12, is whether a defendant\u2019s testimony was compelled, or, conversely, whether it was voluntarily given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454. In that regard, the court further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201c[t]his court has never recognized an obligation under Article I, section 12, of police to inform a person of a right to remain silent in the absence of custody or other compelling circumstances. Likewise, the court has never held that an individual\u2019s invocation of a right to remain silent in the absence of custody or other compelling circumstances precludes police from attempting to obtain incriminating information from that individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">With those principles in mind, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s invitation to hold that \u201chis invocation of a right to remain silent some months before he was placed in custody or in circumstances that could be regarded as compelling precluded police from obtaining incriminating information from him during that time.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>350 Or at 459. The court noted that there was no suggestion that the defendant was in custody or otherwise compelling circumstances when the police informed him of the allegations, when he attempted to invoke his right against self-incrimination, or when the pretextual communications were made. <em>Id. </em>at 460-61. Nor was there any suggestion that the defendant\u2019s statements were \u201cinduced by threats or promises or that in any other way defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statements were not voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Accordingly, there was no basis for concluding that the defendant\u2019s statements were obtained in violation of Article I, section 12. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Davis </em>does not apply to this case. He contends that the court in <em>Davis </em>considered only whether a person\u2019s pre-arrest invocation of the right to remain silent prevented the police from further questioning the person and the admissibility of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>resulting statement at trial, but that this case is different because it concerns whether the state can comment on a defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right to remain silent. Although it is true that the Supreme Court emphasized that the scope of the issue before it in <em>Davis </em>was narrow and involved circumstances distinct from those in this case, we cannot ignore the import of the court\u2019s analysis of Article I, section 12. As noted above, the right to remain silent in Article I, section 12, is focused on preventing <em>compelled </em>testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201c[I]f there is a right to remain silent that is guaranteed by Article I, section 12, it is a right to insist that the police refrain from interrogation after a person who is in custody or otherwise in compelling circumstances has invoked the right to remain silent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>Davis, </em>350 Or at 459. Implicit in that holding is the idea that, absent custody or compelling circumstances, the right to remain silent under Article I, section 12, is not implicated. Thus, <em>Davis </em>governs on the question whether defendant could rely on Article I, section 12, to prevent the state from introducing evidence of his nonresponse to the text messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In addition to arguing that <em>Davis </em>does not control, defendant relies on two of our decisions from the 1980s: <em>State v. Marple, </em>98 Or App 662, 780 P2d 772 (1989), and <em>State v. Pigg, </em>87 Or App 625, 743 P2d 770 (1987). Defendant cites <em>Marple </em>for the proposition that we have held that \"a criminal defendant may invoke his right to silence before his arrest and <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and the state may not introduce that evidence against him.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument, however, rests on an expansive reading of our holding in <em>Marple </em>that conflicts with the holding in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In that case, a police officer saw two men sitting in a pickup truck near a tavern. <em>Marple, </em>98 Or App at 664. The officer watched the men from a distance and saw the passenger, the defendant, holding a mirror with powder on it. The officer approached the pickup, identified himself as a police officer, and shined his light into the pickup. <em>Id. </em>The officer told the men to keep still and keep their hands in plain sight and called for backup. When another officer arrived, the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>officer asked the defendant to step out of the pickup and searched him for contraband. The officer found two bindles, one of which contained a controlled substance. The officer asked the defendant, \u201cIs this yours? What is it?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019d rather not say.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At his trial, the defendant argued that his answer to the officer\u2019s questions was an invocation of his constitutional right to remain silent and, accordingly, the state could not bring it to the jury\u2019s attention. <em>Id. </em>The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the officer to testify about the defendant\u2019s statement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">On appeal, the state argued that the defendant\u2019s answer to the officer\u2019s question was not an invocation of his right to remain silent, but merely was a response to the question asked. <em>Marple, </em>98 Or App at 666. We rejected that argument, and held that, by his statement, the defendant was indicating that he wanted to remain silent in response to the officer\u2019s question; therefore, the state could not use that refusal against him. <em>Id. </em>We noted in a footnote that the state had argued at trial that the defendant could not assert his constitutional rights because he was not in custody but that, on appeal, the state had conceded that a person not in custody can invoke the right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 666 n 2. We agreed with the state\u2019s concession and stated that \u201c [a] person <em>not in custody </em>can * * * assert the right to remain silent under Article I, section 12.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Relying on <em>Marple, </em>defendant argues that, \u201c[i]f a suspect can validly invoke his right to silence during the investigation stages of a criminal prosecution, it follows that the state cannot permissibly comment on that invocation.\u201d In <em>Marple, </em>however, we did not hold that a suspect can invoke his or her right to remain silent during the investigation stages of a criminal investigation. At most, we recognized that a suspect need not be in custody to invoke that right, which is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Davis </em>that the right under Article I, section 12, only applies if the suspect is in custody <em>or </em>compelling circumstances. In <em>Marple, </em>though the defendant was not in custody during the police questioning, he was in circumstances that could be considered compelling. Moreover, were <em>Marple </em>understood to stand for the proposition defendant urges, the Supreme Court limited that holding through its decision in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>We also conclude that <em>Pigg </em>is inapt. In that case, a child reported that the defendant had sexually abused her, and, although the defendant told the investigating officer that he was busy with final exams and would call back to discuss the matter further, on the advice of counsel, he never called the officer. 87 Or App at 627. The trial court admitted that evidence over the defendant\u2019s objections under Article I, section 12, <em>and </em>OEC 403 (\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice ***.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we resolved the issue on OEC 403 grounds and did not address whether the state was allowed, under Article I, section 12, to discuss the defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence. <em>Id. </em>at 629. Our holding in <em>Pigg </em>does not imply that there was a constitutional problem in allowing the evidence of the defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence; instead, we concluded that the evidence \u201cwas of little probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In sum, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Davis, </em>a person \u201calways may invoke a \u2018right to remain silent\u2019 and refuse to speak with police without the presence of counsel.\u201d 350 Or at 446. However, unless the person is in custody or compelling circumstances when he or she refuses to speak to police, the protections of Article I, section 12, do not apply. In this case, there was no suggestion that defendant was in custody or compelling circumstances when he received the text messages. Thus, the trial court did not err by allowing the prosecutor, over defendant\u2019s objection based on Article I, section 12, to elicit testimony and to make an argument concerning defendant\u2019s failure to respond to the text messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the text messages and defendant\u2019s nonresponse to the messages as adoptive admissions. He contends that, \u201c[a]lthough the state initially offered the messages for an alleged non-hearsay purpose, it did not use them in that manner. Instead, the state used the messages to prove the truth of the contents <em>via </em>defendant\u2019s purported adoption of those contents.\u201d Defendant reasons that the messages should have been excluded because defendant\u2019s silence does not qualify as an adoptive admission under OEC 801(4)(b)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We note, however, that the trial court did not admit the text messages on the basis that defendant had adopted the messages through his silence. Indeed, defendant recognizes that fact in his brief, noting that \u201c[t]he trial court found that the evidence was at best ambiguous and did not meet the requirements of an adoptive admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Nevertheless, the state understands defendant\u2019s argument to more broadly be that the text messages and his nonresponse to them were inadmissible hearsay, an objection that defendant asserted in the trial court. The state responds to that argument by contending that none of the evidence that defendant challenges was hearsay: First, the victim\u2019s text messages were not \u201cstatements\u201d under the hearsay rule because they were questions and because the victim adopted the questions in her testimony. Second, defendant\u2019s nonresponse to the messages was also not a \u201cstatement\u201d under the hearsay rule, and, even if it were, it would be an admission by a party opponent under OEC 801(4)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We first conclude that, even assuming that the text messages are \u201cstatements\u201d under the hearsay rule, they were not being offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein and, therefore, are not hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is generally inadmissible unless the statement is excluded from the definition of hearsay or falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. OEC 801; OEC 802. Here, the text messages that the victim sent to defendant said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this happened [.] [W]e\u2019ve been friends for along <em>[sic] </em>time[.] [W]hy did [you] do that to me?\u201d and \u201cI really want to know why? [I don\u2019t know] what to do but I was passed out[.] [W]hat made what [you] did ok?\u201d The prosecutor told the court that he was not offering the messages for their truth and that he intended to use defendant\u2019s nonresponse to the messages to argue inferences to the jury regarding defendant\u2019s choice in not responding to the messages. Because the state was not offering the text messages to prove the truth of their contents, they were not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As to defendant\u2019s nonresponse, the state first argues that defendant took the position that his nonresponse was not intended as an assertion, and so it was not a \u201cstatement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>for purposes of the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>OEC 801(l)(b) (a \u201cstatement\u201d includes \u201c[n]onverbal conduct of a person, if intended as an assertion\u201d). Relatedly, the state argues that his non-response was not a statement because it constituted \u201ccontext\u201d for the text messages. Finally, the state argues that, assuming that defendant\u2019s nonresponse was a statement under the hearsay rule, a party\u2019s statement offered against that party is excluded from the definition of hearsay as an admission. <em>See </em>OEC 801(4)(b)(A) (a statement is not hearsay if it is \u201coffered against a party\u201d and is that party\u2019s \u201cown statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity\u201d). We agree with the state that, even if the nonresponse is viewed as some type of statement by defendant, such a statement is not hearsay. The trial court did not err by rejecting defendant\u2019s hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-5\"> Defendant was represented by two attorneys at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\"> In addressing the court, defense counsel stated that, had she known that the police were involved in sending the text messages, she would have prepared a motion to suppress. She then stated that she was \u201cnot prepared to do an oral motion to suppress at this time [.] \u201d The trial court nonetheless understood defense counsel to be moving to suppress the evidence, as well as moving for a mistrial. Defense counsel also argued that the state\u2019s withholding of that information was a <em>Brady </em>violation. On appeal, defendant does not assign error to the court\u2019s denial of the mistrial motion or the court\u2019s ruling regarding the alleged <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
