Defendant appeals the judgment, challenging his conviction for third-degree robbery but not theft of services. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his demurrer and the court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA), arguing that, although he may have stolen services from the driver, he did not steal property, as required by ORS 164.395.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state argues that defendant did steal property, because the \u201cbenefit of a service\u201d is a chose-in-action and a chose-in-action is property. We agree with defendant that the trial court erred in denying his MJOA. Accordingly, we reverse that conviction; otherwise we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We begin with defendant\u2019s second assignment of error\u2014that the trial court erred when it denied his MJOA. Our resolution of that issue obviates the need to consider defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his demurrer. We review a trial court\u2019s denial of an MJOA to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found that the state proved all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Kaylor, </em>252 Or App 688, 691, 289 P3d 290 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The facts are undisputed. After taking a ride in a taxi cab, defendant refused to tender money\u2014offering instead to trade food for the ride\u2014then scuffled with the driver before fleeing without paying. The state charged defendant by indictment. Count 1 of the indictment, alleging robbery in the third degree, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cThe defendant, on or about December 4, 2011, in Marion County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>while in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft of services, and with the intent of preventing or overcoming resistance to defendant\u2019s theft of services or retention of the benefit of that theft of services immediately after the taking, use or threaten the immediate use of physical force upon [the driver]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that a taxi ride is not property and therefore the indictment did not state any offense, including the crime of third-degree robbery. As relevant here, the state argued in response that the definition of property as it applies to the robbery statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is \u201cexpansive\u201d and, moreover, a \u201cfee for a service owed\u201d is \u201cevidence of a debt,\u201d and therefore property. The court denied defendant\u2019s demurrer stating, \u201cas set forth in the state\u2019s response to the demurrer, I find that the definition of \u2018property\u2019 is sufficiently expansive to encompass the services of a taxi (vehicle and driver) which are customarily provided in exchange for a fee.\u201d At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing, first, that defendant used physical force only after the taking, not in the course of taking, and, second, that services are not property that can be taken in the course of a robbery. The state argued in response that the benefit of a taxi ride is \u201cbeing transported from A to B without having to pay\u201d and that that benefit was property that defendant used force to take or retain. The court agreed with the state\u2019s reasoning and denied defendant\u2019s MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On appeal, defendant renews his argument that a taxi ride is a service, not property, and therefore the state presented legally insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict for the crime of third-degree robbery, which requires the taking of property. For the purpose of this case, the state agrees, on appeal, that a service is not property. However, the state argues that the \u201cbenefit of theft of services\u201d is \u201cproperty.\u201d The state explains that such a distinction is meaningful because the benefit of a service is the right to payment, and \u201c[t]he right to payment *** is a \u2018chose-in-action,\u2019\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>a chose-in-action is a type of property. <em>See </em>ORS 164.005(5) (definingproperty, in part, as \u201cchoses-in-action\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cchose in action\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201c1. A property right in personam, such as a debt owed by another person, a share in a joint-stock company, or a claim for damage in tort. 2. The right to bring an action to recover a debt, money, a thing. 3. Personal property that one person owns but another person possesses, the owner being able to regain possession through a lawsuit.\u2014Also termed a <em>thing in </em>action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>275 (9th ed 2009) (boldface and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Thus, a chose in action is a claim to a thing\u2014such as relevant here, payment for services rendered\u2014that can be enforced only by court action. <em>See, e.g., State v. Tausher, </em>227 Or 1, 360 P2d 764 (1961) (discussing the difference between tangible choses in action and intangible choses in action and concluding that, under the statute at issue, defendant could not be convicted of embezzling an intangible chose in action because it was not capable of being possessed); <em>Gregoire v. Rourke, </em>28 Or 275, 42 P 996 (1895) (assignee of a chose in action may bring the action in court under his own name as the party in interest). When he fled without paying for his taxi ride, defendant did not take from anyone the right to bring a claim in court to enforce payment for the taxi ride, nor do we see how defendant could have accomplished that despite the state\u2019s artful attempts to persuade us otherwise. Consequently, defendant did not take the driver\u2019s chose in action, and the court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s MJOA on the charge of third-degree robbery, because that offense requires the taking of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Judgment of conviction for robbery in the third degree reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> ORS 164.395(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of robbery in the third degree if in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle as defined in ORS 164.135 the person uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person with the intent of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">\u201c(a) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to retention thereof immediately after the taking!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\"> ORS 164.005(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201c\u2018Property\u2019 means any article, substance or thing of value, including, but not limited to, money, tangible and intangible personal property, real property, choses-in-action, evidence of debt or of contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
