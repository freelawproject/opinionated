He argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal based on an improper construction of that statute, contending that the state failed to prove precisely when the crime was committed because it failed to prove when he moved out of his grandfather\u2019s house, where he was registered. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u201cBecause the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state.\u201d <em>State v. Massei, </em>247 Or App 30, 32, 268 P3d 774 (2011). \u201cOur standard for reviewing the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Paragon, </em>195 Or App 265, 267, 97 P3d 691 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In 1999, defendant was convicted of a sex offense in Florida and sentenced to five years in prison. As a result of that conviction, defendant was required to register as a sex offender in Oregon. Defendant completed his initial registration in Oregon on October 22, 2008, and also reported in July 2009, April 2010, April 2011, and April 2012. Each time that he reported, defendant provided the same residential address in Portland\u2014the address of his grandfather\u2019s house. Each time that he reported, defendant was also informed that he must report, in person, within 10 days of any change of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In August, 2012, Officer Sickon conducted an investigation and found that defendant was not present at his registered address. At the time, <em>former </em>ORS 181.595 to 181.597 (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 181.806 to 181.808 (2013), required a sex offender to report to law enforcement within 10 days of a change of residence. On September 5, 2012, defendant was arrested for the crime of failure to report,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>he spent one night in jail; he was released on September 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On October 3,2012, defendant went to Sickon\u2019s office to report a change of residence. Sickon asked defendant, \u201c \u2018What are you coming in to tell me? \u2019 \u201d Defendant replied, \u201c \u2018I live with my grandfather ***.\u2019\u201d Defendant informed Sickon that \u201che was going to start staying with his dad\u201d at a different address. Sickon confirmed that that address was \u201ca good address that [she] could use for a current registration to bring [defendant] back into compliance at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Sickon then asked defendant where he had \u201creally [been] staying\u201d from September 6, 2012 to October 3, 2012. Defendant replied that \u201che had many girlfriends [and] that he stayed at their locations\u201d during that time\u2014that is, he told Sickon that \u201che had been in different girlfriends\u2019 homes all in Portland, Oregon.\u201d Sickon asked defendant for the names and addresses of his girlfriends, but he would not give them to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Sickon then inquired whether defendant had lived at his grandfather\u2019s house since September 6, 2012; specifically, she asked him if he had been to his grandfather\u2019s house \u201cat any point since being released from custody\u201d; if he had \u201cgone there to visit\u201d; if he had \u201cgone there to spend the night, to live and sleep in any way\u201d; and if he had \u201cany belongings there [.]\u201d Defendant replied \u201cno\u201d to each of those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Based on defendant\u2019s statements to Sickon, the state subsequently charged defendant with failure to report as a sex offender under <em>former </em>ORS 181.599(1), which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\u201cA person who is required to report as a sex offender in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS 181.595, 181.596, 181.597 or 181.609 and who has knowledge of the reporting requirement commits the crime of failure to report as a sex offender if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\u00abHj ^ Hi # \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201c(d) Moves to a new residence and fails to report the move and the person\u2019s new address [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">In its information, the state alleged that defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201con or about October 03, 2012, * * *, being a person who was required by law to report in person, as a sex offender, to the Oregon State Police, a chief of police or a county sheriff within 10 days of a change of residence, having changed residence, and having knowledge of the reporting requirement, did unlawfully and knowingly fail to report in person, as required, to an appropriate agency or official * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">At trial, the state submitted defendant\u2019s sex offender registration forms, including the form showing that, on April 24, 2012, defendant reported that he was residing at his grandfather\u2019s house. The state also submitted Sickon\u2019s testimony, as noted above, relating defendant\u2019s admission that he was not \u201creally *** staying\u201d at his grandfather\u2019s house from September 6, 2012 to October 3, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. He relied upon <em>State v. Depeche A139293, </em>242 Or App 155, 164, 255 P3d 502 (2011), in which we construed a previous version of <em>former </em>ORS 181.599 to require reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the state had failed to prove where the defendant was located at \u201cthe end of the tenth day following [his] change of residence [,]\u201d and, thus, had failed to prove venue. Based on <em>Depeche, </em>defendant argued to the trial court that there is a \u201cspecific day when you commit [the] crime\u201d of failure to report\u2014\u201c\u2018literally at midnight on the tenth day after defendant changed his residence.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Depeche, </em>242 Or App at 163.) Defendant then argued that the state failed to prove precisely when the crime was committed because it failed to prove when he moved out of his grandfather\u2019s house,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, thus, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The state responded that the relevant reporting statutes had been amended in response to <em>Depeche </em>and argued that the reasoning in <em>Depeche </em>had related only to the issue of venue. Thus, in the state\u2019s view, the temporal element of the statute was satisfied by the state\u2019s evidence that defendant moved out of his grandfather\u2019s house on September 6, 2012, and failed to report until October 3, 2012\u201427 days after defendant had moved.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The trial court noted that, in the 10 days prior to October 3, 2012, defendant was not living at his grandfather\u2019s house. The court then stated that, by defendant\u2019s own admission, he had not been at his grandfather\u2019s house for \u201c27 days, which would put him in violation, because he\u2019s supposed to tell [Sickon] within ten days of moving [.]\u201d The court then denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, and defendant, who was convicted as noted above, now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The parties essentially reprise their arguments on appeal; based on <em>Depeche, </em>defendant argues that the state was required to prove precisely when the crime was committed, and, thus, was required to prove when he moved out of his grandfather\u2019s house, and the state responds that it was not required to do so. We agree with the state. In <em>Depeche, </em>we construed a previous version of <em>former </em>ORS 181.599 to resolve a question of venue. However, there is no longer any need to analyze the venue issue as we did in <em>Depeche </em>because, in response to <em>Depeche, </em>the legislature amended the relevant statutes to specify where reporting must occur. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 675; <em>see also Massei, </em>247 Or App at 32 n 1 (noting that the 2011 legislature amended the statutes in response to <em>Depeche). </em>Furthermore, under the principles set forth in <em>State v. Mills, </em>354 Or 350, 312 P3d 515 (2013), venue is no longer a material allegation that the state must prove as part of its case-in-chief, but is an issue that a defendant must raise before trial to avoid waiver. Accordingly, we conclude that the reasoning in <em>Depeche </em>related to venue no longer applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In light of that conclusion, we conclude that a rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, could have found that, \u201con or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>October 3, 2012,\u201d as alleged in the information, defendant had failed to report within 10 days of moving out of his grandfather\u2019s house, where he was registered. Although it is unclear exactly when defendant moved out of his grandfather\u2019s house, a rational trier of fact could conclude that the state had met its burden by presenting evidence that defendant had not been at his grandfather\u2019s house for 27 days without reporting that he had moved out. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal based on a purported insufficiency of proof of the timing of his move from his grandfather\u2019s house.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\"> Defendant was later acquitted of that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\"> Defendant\u2019s argument was predicated on the reasoning set forth in <em>State v. Cox, </em>219 Or App 319, 323, 182 P3d 259 (2008), in which we construed the phrase \u201cchange of residence\u201d to mean \u201cthe date of moving out of the current residence.\u201d The statute at issue in <em>Cox </em>was <em>former </em>ORS 181.599(l)(e), which criminalized the failure to report set forth in <em>former </em>ORS 181.596(4)(b)(A). That version <em>o\u00ed former </em>ORS 181.599 provided, in part, that a person \u201ccommits the crime of failure to report as a sex offender if the person fails * * * to * * * [r] eport following a change of residence].]\u201d However, that language was amended in 2009, <em>see </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 713, to provide that a person \u201ccommits the crime of failure to report as a sex offender if the person * * * [m] oves to a new residence and fails to report the move and the person\u2019s new address].]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> When making those arguments, defendant expressly stated that he was \u201cnot arguing the venue issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\"> Defendant did not argue to the trial court, and does not argue on appeal, that the legal effect of the version of <em>former </em>ORS 181.599 that applies to him, <em>former </em>ORS 181.599(l)(d) (2011), is to require that he must report only when he had acquired a new residence. <em>See State v. Hiner, </em>269 Or App 447, 345 P3d 478 (2015) (construing <em>former </em>ORS 181.599(l)(d) (2011) to that effect). Accordingly, any argument about the state\u2019s failure to prove when defendant acquired a new residence is not preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
