J.</author>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">In this consolidated appeal, parents separately appeal judgments terminating their parental rights to their children, I and K, both four years old at the time of trial (though 10 months apart in age). The juvenile court determined that parents were unfit under ORS 419B.504 because they were unable to provide minimally adequate parenting at the time of trial and would not be able to do so within a time that was reasonable for I and K due to conduct or conditions that were not likely to change. On appeal, both parents contend that the court erred in concluding that the Department of Human Services (DHS) proved that (1) they were unfit at the time of trial, (2) the children could not be returned to their care within a reasonable amount of time, and (3) it was in the children\u2019s best interests to terminate parental rights. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.504 (establishing grounds for terminating parental rights for unfitness).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">On appeal, father admits that he has a \u201cmixed history as a parent\u201d because of his recurring problems with drug addiction, but he asserts that he is a minimally adequate parent when sober. Further, he contends that the evidence at trial showed that he had been sober for many months, had completed drug and alcohol treatment, had engaged in parenting and domestic violence classes, and had established that, with the help of his extended family, he could be ready to have the children returned to him within a reasonable time. Mother\u2019s general argument on appeal is that DHS failed to prove that her risk of relapse rendered her unfit or presented a serious detriment to the children at the time of trial, and that it is not in the best interests of the children to terminate her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">DHS counters that it proved unfitness through evidence of parents\u2019 personality disorders and drug addiction that have resulted in a consistent and long-standing pattern of drug use, domestic violence, and neglect of the children. Further, DHS asserts that reintegration of the children within a reasonable time is unlikely because, despite the provision of extensive services over a period of several years, mother and father have been unable to sustain sobriety and complete the required treatments and services and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>failed to establish a safe home for the children. We agree with DHS, and affirm the juvenile court\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We find the following facts on <em>de novo </em>review. ORS 19.415(3)(a) (appeals in termination of parental rights cases are reviewed <em>de novo). </em>We begin with a chronological review of DHS\u2019s involvement with the family and the services provided up to the time of trial. Separately, we examine the facts related to parents\u2019 mental health. Finally, we discuss the circumstances of mother, father, K, and I at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">A. <em>Mother\u2019s Involvement with DHS from 2003 to 2006</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Mother had a child, C, with Bennett in 2002. DHS placed C in substitute care in 2004 because of Bennett\u2019s abuse of mother and concerns that Bennett and mother were abusing drugs. Mother quickly engaged in services. Initially, she completed substance abuse treatment and participated in domestic violence counseling, parent training, and individual and group mental health counseling. Nevertheless, she continued to have contact with Bennett and continued to use drugs. In late 2004, mother served time in jail for violating her probation related to earlier convictions for unlawful possession of a controlled substance. DHS filed a petition to terminate her parental rights to C. When she was released from jail, mother completed substance abuse treatment and other services. DHS eventually dismissed the termination petition and returned C to mother\u2019s care after mother ended her relationship with Bennett. Mother and C moved to Florida to be closer to mother\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Mother and C returned to Oregon a few months later and it appears that mother remained sober for a period of three years. However, she relapsed when C was about five years old. At that point, mother arranged for Bennett\u2019s parents to take custody of C without DHS\u2019s involvement. Eventually, Bennett\u2019s parents became C\u2019s legal guardians, and they later adopted C with mother\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">B. <em>DHS Involvement May 2009 to March 2011</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">Mother and father began a relationship in 2007. Mother gave birth to I in May 2009, and DHS soon received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>a community referral based on mother\u2019s substance abuse and her history with C. DHS investigated and determined that there were no safety threats to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">In September 2009, DHS received a referral from an anonymous source alleging that mother and father were using drugs and that mother had assaulted father\u2019s mother. I was then four months old. DHS investigated and determined that the family\u2019s housing situation was unsafe for I because the family was living with a person who had an open DHS case, as well as with people who were known drug users. At that time, father submitted a urinalysis (UA) that tested positive for marijuana, but mother\u2019s UA was clean. Initially, parents refused to cooperate with DHS, and, in October 2009, DHS petitioned for juvenile court jurisdiction over I. DHS removed I from the home and placed her in shelter care. Thereafter, DHS referred parents to two housing programs and eventually paid for them to move to appropriate housing. Parents began cooperating with DHS on a voluntary basis and I was returned to their care. At DHS\u2019s request, the court dismissed the jurisdictional petition in December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In March 2010, mother gave birth to K, who tested positive for methamphetamine in the hospital. Although K did not exhibit withdrawal symptoms immediately after birth, her pediatrician observed some symptoms that were consistent with methamphetamine withdrawal a few weeks later. Mother admitted that she had used methamphetamine shortly before K was born. DHS sought, and was granted, temporary custody over I and K. In May 2010, the juvenile court took jurisdiction over the two children, and DHS placed them in nonrelative foster care. DHS and parents entered into action agreements that required parents to complete drug and alcohol treatment, demonstrate a drug-free lifestyle, submit to UAs, participate in individual and family counseling, and comply with a visitation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">DHS referred parents to enhanced visitation through Catholic Charities and a baby bonding group. DHS also referred father to a parenting program and mother to Emergence for intensive drug and alcohol outpatient and aftercare. By September 2010, father had made significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>progress after completing the referred services and substance abuse treatment and aftercare. DHS, with court approval, returned the children to father\u2019s care, but first required mother to move out of the family home and into a recovery house because of ongoing concerns about her drug use. In November 2010, DHS allowed mother to return to the home, and eventually DHS asked the juvenile court to close the case. In March 2011, the juvenile court dismissed jurisdiction and terminated the wardship over K and I. The children were then one and two years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">C. <em>DHS Involvement July 2012 to April 2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">DHS received an anonymous referral a year later, on July 31, 2012, and made contact with parents at their home two days later. That contact confirmed that parents were using methamphetamine again, that the household conditions had fallen below minimum community standards, and that parents were being evicted from their home and had no place to live other than their car. DHS took physical custody of the girls on that day, and placed them in shelter care with the foster parents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DHS filed a petition for jurisdiction alleging that parents\u2019 \u201cuse of alcohol and/or controlled substances\u201d and \u201cliving instability, employment instability and chaotic lifestyle\u201d interfered with their ability to safely parent the children. A few weeks later, mother petitioned for and obtained a Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) restraining order that prohibited father from contacting mother. The FAPA order was based on allegations of three instances of physical abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mother later admitted that one of the incidents occurred well before the children were born. As for the other incidents, father had slapped her in the face during an argument in the summer of 2011, which resulted in a black eye. In July 2012, father had shot mother with a BB gun in the neck, although mother and father each later testified at trial that that incident was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>DHS held a child safety meeting in August 2012. At that meeting, DHS informed father of the safety threats that he needed to alleviate for the children to return home. The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the children in September 2012. At that time, they were two and three years old. The following month, DHS arrived at action agreements with each parent that listed the services and outcomes they needed to achieve to mitigate the safety threats to the children. Father agreed to submit to alcohol and drug screening and to follow any treatment recommendations that resulted from the screening, to submit to UAs, to complete a batterers\u2019 intervention program, and to complete a parent-training program. Mother agreed to the same, except that she was expected to participate in domestic violence counseling instead of batterers\u2019 intervention. DHS held a series of family decision meetings in late 2012, but father could not attend those meetings because of mother\u2019s FAPA order.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Mother engaged in numerous services offered by DHS, including residential drug and alcohol treatment, the UA hotline, Womenspace (domestic violence support), the Relief Nursery (family support), Willamette Family Treatment (parenting classes and mental health treatment), working with an individual parent trainer, and she moved into an addiction recovery house in February 2013. Mother also had plans to begin family counseling with the children. Mother\u2019s service provider reports from those services were excellent, and by most accounts mother was doing very well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In early 2013, with DHS\u2019s support, the juvenile court authorized DHS to begin work on a \u201ctransition home plan\u201d to return the children to mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">As we explain below, because father was not actively participating in services during late 2012 and the first half of 2013, DHS focused mostly on mother. DHS\u2019s plan to transition the children home to mother in early 2013 was slowed because of concerns raised by the foster parents and the children\u2019s therapists, but eventually the parties settled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>July 3, 2013, as the \u201creturn home date.\u201d In the days leading up to that date, however, mother relapsed on methamphetamine. At a hearing also scheduled for July 3, the juvenile court approved return of the children to mother, but required mother to submit to a UA first. After she did so, mother informed the DHS caseworker that she had relapsed and that the UA would come back \u201cdirty.\u201d Mother continued using methamphetamine throughout the month of July, and the children remained in foster care. About a week after the hearing, a police officer discovered mother and father together, and arrested father for violating the FAPA order that was still in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">After her relapse, mother moved into a recovery house. She began attending group and individual alcohol and drug treatment at Willamette Family Treatment in late July 2013, and attended consistently until September. In October and November 2013, her attendance was sporadic due to scheduling conflicts and transportation issues, and she missed a UA in mid-October. Her counselor at Willamette Family closed her file in December 2013 for nonattendance. However, when she attended she had a positive attitude and engaged in therapy. Her counselor noted in her file that mother still had not addressed the codependence issues that marked her relationship with father.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">In addition, sometime in the fall of 2013, mother struck C in the face because C was being rude to her adoptive mother <em>(i.e., </em>her paternal grandmother). The blow bruised C\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Mother returned to Willamette Family in early February 2014 for an assessment and to re-engage in outpatient treatment. Mother reported to her counselor that she had used marijuana in mid-January 2014 due to depression. Mother\u2019s drug and alcohol counselor reported at trial that mother was much more motivated and introspective than she had been. She explained that mother\u2019s behavior demonstrated that she was committed to being clean and sober and that she was open to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Mother also re-engaged in mental health counseling at the Center for Family Development in February 2014. Her counselor, who had previously counseled mother in late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>2009, 2010, and January 2011, testified that, in six sessions before trial, mother was \u201cquite reflective\u201d and regretted how her drug use had harmed the children. Mother demonstrated insight into very difficult situations and took responsibility for her children\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Meanwhile, after signing his action agreement in October 2012, father had been slow to engage in services. Late that year, father, who was using methamphetamine, missed a number of scheduled visits with the children. DHS stopped visits to arrange a \u201cconfirmation system\u201d so that the children were not transported to the visit center unless father had confirmed an hour before the visit that he would attend. In January 2013, DHS sent father a letter of expectation clearly outlining DHS\u2019s expectation that he engage in alcohol and drug treatment and domestic violence intervention and that he confirm and attend visits with the children. DHS referred father for a psychological evaluation, which he completed in January 2013 with Dr. Sorenson. DHS also referred father for a drug and alcohol assessment, the UA hotline, parenting classes, and batterers\u2019 intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Father balked at engaging in the DHS-approved substance abuse treatment programs at Willamette Family Treatment or Emergence because he did not feel that either would be effective for him because of the \u201creligious tones\u201d of the programs. Instead, he elected to participate in a treatment program at Chrysalis. Because that program is not \u201cDHS approved,\u201d DHS did not pay for treatment at Chrysalis. Nevertheless, father\u2019s caseworker negotiated with Chrysalis to obtain the required releases and to try to secure an indigent waiver for father. Father\u2019s caseworker indicated that she \u201cwas in support of that, versus nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Almost 10 months after DHS removed the children, father began the group drug and alcohol treatment program at Chrysalis. He engaged in that program from June 2013 through November 2013. His initial UA tested positive for marijuana, but otherwise he provided clean UAs for the rest of his time in treatment. Although his attendance was \u201cat times not very consistent,\u201d father was active and engaged in the group sessions when he was there. Father\u2019s drug and alcohol counselor at Chrysalis closed father\u2019s file in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>December 2013 at father\u2019s request; father reasoned that he was clean and they should graduate him from treatment. Because he met the requirements for completing treatment, his counselor did so but believed that father \u201ccould use some continued contact in the form of groups and one-on-ones\u201d so that he could have a little more time to understand how to use the tools that he had learned in the real world. The counselor\u2019s \u201cservice conclusion summary\u201d indicated that father had a \u201cvery high relapse potential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">As for father\u2019s required batterers\u2019 intervention and parenting classes, DHS had referred father to Christians as Family Advocates (CAFA) in August 2012, but father waited until February 2013 to attend intake, at which he stated that he did not believe that he needed domestic violence classes, and then did not attend his first sessions for another six months. He attended regularly between August and November, but then stopped attending classes. At that point, he had attended 9 out of the 36 required domestic violence sessions and 2 out of the 15 required parenting classes. Father re-engaged in services in March 2014, for a \u201crein-take\u201d and one domestic violence session and two parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In October 2013, the juvenile court changed the permanency plan to adoption, noting that even though parents were clean and engaged in services at that point, \u201cthey each have a history of achieving sobriety and stability, only to relapse back into old patterns.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also determined that the children needed permanency because, given the multiple alternative placements in their short lives,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> each was demonstrating anxiety and difficulty with any type of transition. After the plan was changed, DHS filed petitions to terminate parents\u2019 rights to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">After DHS filed the termination petitions, mother and father visited with the children at DHS facilities each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>week and, consistently with prior observations, the visits generally went well for both parents. Father was engaged and interested at the visits and provided appropriate activities and snacks and was receptive to feedback. In general, he attended regularly and the visits involved high-quality, positive interactions between father and the children. As for mother, an incident occurred at a visit in September 2013, at which I complained that mother \u201cbit her bottom,\u201d and DHS responded by increasing supervision at mother\u2019s visits. Otherwise, mother\u2019s visits have gone well. She has been engaged, affectionate, and appropriate with the children, and the visits have demonstrated a bond between mother and the children. Mother also accepts direction from the visit supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">D. <em>Mother\u2019s Mental Health</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Because of mother\u2019s lengthy and repeated involvement with DHS, she underwent psychological evaluations in 2004, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2014. In addition to diagnoses on Axis I of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) related to her drug abuse, mother has consistently been diagnosed on Axis II with Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified with antisocial and dependent features. Dr. Basham, who evaluated mother in 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2014, stated in his 2014 evaluation that, throughout his contact with mother, her personality disorder has presented the greatest impediment to her prospects for parenting because she has a longstanding condition that is resistant to change. Basham supported his diagnosis and conclusions with citations to mother\u2019s pattern throughout her adult life, where \u201cshe has had some period of improved functioning\u201d that has been repeatedly disrupted by relapse. Basham opined that the \u201cstress, demands, and responsibilities of caring for the children on a full-time basis would be a significant stressor to [mother] and leave her at an increased risk of relapse to drugs, resumed bouts of depression, or being involved with an abusive partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">At trial, he explained that mother\u2019s personality disorder presented a significant risk to her ability to parent because the disorder makes it likely that her substance abuse problem would keep returning and disrupting her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>life. Basham also testified that, based on mother\u2019s mental health therapy records, he did not believe that the type of therapy that mother was participating in at the time of trial was sufficient to treat her personality disorder. In fact, he opined that, given mother\u2019s history, the prospects for change through mental health treatment were poor because, first, mother \u201chas a psychological condition that is persistent, highly resistant to change,\u201d and \u201chas been in place for at least a decade,\u201d and, second, she \u201chas engaged in a significant amount of treatment over that time,\u201d yet the \u201cpattern of problems has persisted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Basham testified that mother\u2019s personality disorder has a detrimental effect on the children. He explained that people suffering from her disorder demonstrate irresponsibility and inconsistency when responding to a child\u2019s needs. He also believed that the children were at increased risk of witnessing mother\u2019s drug use, domestic violence, and her role-modeling of antisocial behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Sorenson, who evaluated mother in 2013, testified consistently with Basham. Sorenson described mother\u2019s personality disorder as an \u201cenduring set of beliefs about oneself, about one\u2019s world and behavior patterns, that go together in some notable way and are in conflict with what is true about the world as most of the rest of us believe and understand, that present a real and significant problem for them in their functioning.\u201d Sorenson expressed optimism that mother was reportedly engaging in mental health therapy \u201cmore fully\u201d at the time of trial, but cautioned that what matters is whether she is exhibiting an understanding of how her thinking is leading to the problem behaviors. In his view, however, mother\u2019s prognosis for sustaining positive change for any significant time period was poor because of her diagnosis and the pattern reflected in the past 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">E. <em>Father\u2019s Mental Health</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Like mother, father has consistently received a diagnosis related to his drug use on Axis I of the DSM-IV; on Axis II, father was diagnosed in 2010 by Basham and 2013 by Sorenson with Antisocial Personality Disorder. Sorenson explained that, for purposes of father\u2019s parenting abilities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>his personality disorder is the most serious diagnosis. He explained that father\u2019s disorder is marked by a persistent belief pattern that remains stable despite efforts to change, or experiences that \u201cargue against\u201d those perceptions. Father\u2019s disorder presents a potential risk to the community because father cannot appreciate when his behavior is a problem; instead, despite evidence to the contrary, he perceives others or external factors as the problem. Accordingly, father lacks motivation to change. Sorenson stated that the ability of a parent with an antisocial personality disorder to effectively care for a child is compromised because the parent has a very strong belief in his own abilities, so he may ignore or overlook the child\u2019s problems, dismiss the concerns of others, or believe that he can overcome any problems on his own without help. Sorenson expressed particular concern regarding father\u2019s overwhelming and unrealistic belief in his own ability to overcome any problems that may arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">In his evaluation, Sorenson suggested that a style of therapy called \u201cmotivational interviewing\u201d might be most effective for father, but concluded that, given father\u2019s personality characteristics, he demonstrates \u201ca willingness to return to old behavior patterns, including poor planning, drug use, and a lack of consideration for others when determining his own behavior.\u201d Sorenson opined that he did not expect that \u201cforced\u201d services and treatment would alter father\u2019s basic belief system or change his behavior much. That is so because father demonstrated through his behavior that \u201chis goal is to assert his beliefs\u201d even when doing so causes him (and the children) significant problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">F. <em>Mother\u2019s Circumstances at the Time of Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">At the time of trial, mother had been living at the Oxford Dalton House since February 2014. Before that she had been living with father at Bennett\u2019s mother\u2019s house. She was engaged in services with Willamette Family, CAFA, and the Center for Family Development and in drug and alcohol counseling. She admitted that she had smoked marijuana as recently as January 2014 because she was depressed, but had otherwise been sober since her relapse in July 2013. She explained that she and father were a \u201ccouple\u201d but that they were not ready to live together or parent together. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>expressed a desire to do whatever was needed for the children to return to her care and explained that her plan for the return of the children would be to stay in current services and to leave Oregon \u201cwhen allowed to.\u201d She acknowledged a desire to get away because of \u201ca lot of damage here\u201d and a \u201clot of people that she has used with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">G. <em>Father\u2019s Circumstances at the Time of Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">At the time of trial, father was living in his car and unemployed. A little over a month before the termination trial, father had been involved in an altercation with his mother. Father claimed that he pushed his mother when attempting to ward off her attack; as a result, she fell, hit her head on a piece of furniture, and sustained a laceration. Police arrested father and the state charged him with fourth-degree assault. He pleaded guilty the week before the termination trial, and was sentenced to probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">H. <em>Circumstances of the Children at the Time of Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Stancil acted as I\u2019s therapist from September 2012 to September 2013, and again from February 2014 to the time of trial. Stancil testified that in September 2012, I, then age 3, showed symptoms of indiscriminate attachment associated with attachment disorder. She explained that I wanted immediate physical contact and attention from new people. Stancil also diagnosed I with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on her history of numerous foster placements and family experiences. Because of all the disruption in her life, I is not secure in attaching to one person to meet her needs. At first, I demonstrated several developmental delays in speech and in gross and fine motor coordination. She made significant improvement in her first year of therapy, although Stancil testified that I had \u201cregressed recently.\u201d Stancil opined that, although she did not formally diagnose I, she believes that the child suffers from reactive attachment disorder, which includes indiscriminate attachment and has features of PTSD. Stancil testified that I needs permanency \u201cnow\u201d and, without it, she is at \u201crisk of continued delay and regression in her emotional development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Reilly treated K from February 2013 to the summer of 2013, and then saw her three times in the four weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>leading up to the trial. Reilly diagnosed K with adjustment disorder with mixed disturbances of emotions and conduct. She explained that K exhibited difficulty adjusting to different caregiving patterns and homes and to loss of relationships. Reilly used play therapy to assist K with her problems in controlling her impulses and maintaining focused attention. Reilly testified that K\u2019s emotional development is delayed and that she needs permanency as soon as possible because the lack of a permanent caregiver has a significant effect on brain development in children her age. She explained that constant stress can permanently harm a child\u2019s view of life and relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">A therapist who evaluated I and K immediately before trial testified that she was concerned that the girls were going to suffer long-term problems. She explained that children who experience a lack of permanency between birth and age three have interrupted brain structure development that makes it hard for them to form adaptive skills. She also stated that the children showed evidence of chronic stress, and explained that she did not find it surprising that the children showed attachment to father and mother at visits because they were suffering from indiscriminate attachment disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The juvenile court terminated parents\u2019 rights due to unfitness, ORS 419B.504, which is permissible if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is \u201cunfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child or ward and integration of the child or ward into the home of the parent or parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Evidence is clear and convincing if it makes the existence of a fact \u201chighly probable\u201d or if it is of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. A. M. R., </em>212 Or App 94, 104, 157 P3d 283 (2007). A parent\u2019s fitness is measured at the time of the termination trial, <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Simmons, </em>342 Or 76, 96, 149 P3d 1124 (2006), and the focus of the test is \u201con the detrimental effect of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition on the child, not just the seriousness of the parent\u2019s conduct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>condition in the abstract.\u201d <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 146, 36 P3d 490 (2001). In addition, termination of parental rights must be in the child\u2019s best interests. ORS 419B.500.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">To determine if a parent is unfit, courts engage in a two-step analysis. <em>Stillman </em>Or at 145. First, the court determines whether \u201c(1) the parent has engaged in some conduct or is characterized by some condition; and (2) the conduct or condition is \u2018seriously detrimental\u2019 to the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond\u2014 and only if the parent has met the foregoing criteria\u2014the court also must find that the \u2018integration of the child into the home of the parent * * * is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>In evaluating the second step, the court must \u201cevaluate the relative probability that, given particular parental conduct or conditions, the child will become integrated into the parental home \u2018within a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145-46. The \u201creasonable time\u201d standard is child-specific\u2014the period of time that \u201cis reasonable given a child or ward\u2019s emotional and developmental needs and ability to form and maintain lasting attachments.\u201d ORS 419A.004(20).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">A. <em>Father</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Father contends that DHS failed to prove that he was unfit at the time of trial or, alternatively, that he could not become fit within a short time period. In support, he points to treatment that he has completed and to evidence that \u201cwhen he is not using drugs\u201d he \u201chas been a consistently appropriate parent.\u201d Father argues that he completed treatment at Chrysalis and that there was no evidence that it was \u201cother than an excellent treatment program.\u201d He posits that the method of treatment at Chrysalis was consistent with Sorenson\u2019s recommendation that father would do best with a program that uses \u201cmotivational interviewing.\u201d Father further contends that the evidence shows that his treatment was effective and has enabled changes in his life to such a degree that his drug dependence has been properly addressed and, if the children were returned to him, he would not resume using drugs. In particular, he explains that he was in treatment for six months and, with one exception early on, his UAs were negative; his counselor spoke well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of his participation in the program; and he had remained clean and sober for nearly a year before trial. Given that evidence, father contends that DHS failed to prove that father was likely to relapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Father also argues that, to the extent that his personality disorder, homelessness, and domestic violence constitute problems, there is reason to believe that those problems are being adequately dealt with. Father asserts that he is fully engaged in a domestic violence program that has a high rate of success, he is engaged in parenting classes, and, \u201cdue to recent changes in his health insurance,\u201d he has signed up for counseling that uses \u201cmotivational therapy mode.\u201d In sum, father contends that he has \u201ctaken care of his biggest problem (drug use)\u201d and that his remaining concerns are \u201ccompletely manageable, and they are well on their way to being managed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Although we agree that father has demonstrated that he can at times be an appropriate and loving parent, based on the evidence adduced at trial, we conclude that DHS proved by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of trial, father\u2019s past drug abuse, domestic violence, personality disorder, and general instability continued to present conduct or a condition that is seriously detrimental to the children. We consider all proven conduct or conditions in combination when evaluating a parent\u2019s unfitness. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. F. W., </em>218 Or App 436, 456, 180 P3d 69, <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 670 (2008). DHS also proved by clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s conduct or condition was not likely to change to allow the children to be integrated into his home in a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We address the most recent past first. Although father graduated from Chrysalis treatment in December 2013, his counselor indicated that he could use additional group support to learn how to use the coping skills he had gained in the real world. His counselor also believed that father had a high risk of relapse. Nevertheless, father concluded that his treatment was sufficient as of November 2013 and asked his counselor to close his file. That behavior is consistent with Sorenson\u2019s explanation of the characteristics of father\u2019s personality disorder: He has an unrealistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>view of his own abilities to overcome problems despite past experiences that indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Moreover, father\u2019s inconsistent participation in domestic violence and parenting classes also demonstrates father\u2019s lack of motivation or ability to change. Although it is true that his service providers indicated that he was engaged and making progress <em>when he was attending the programs, </em>father did not engage in those programs until a year after he was referred; he attended for a four-month period before stopping, and, when he stopped, he had completed only a fraction of the requirements for completing the programs. Father returned to those programs a little over a month before the termination trial, but even then attended only one domestic violence session and two parenting classes. Further, contrary to father\u2019s assertion that his \u201cremaining problems\u201d are well on their way to being managed, father was arrested for fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence in March 2014 and pleaded guilty to that crime shortly before trial. Again, father\u2019s inconsistent engagement in services is in line with Sorenson\u2019s observation that father is motivated to engage in services because of external requirements, not because he believes that he needs to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">There is ample evidence that father\u2019s conduct or condition is seriously detrimental to the children, who have spent the majority of their lives being shuttled between placements and who have demonstrably suffered and continue to suffer from the lack of permanency. Given the evidence, father\u2019s conduct or condition, particularly when considered in light of Sorenson\u2019s testimony, is unlikely to change in a time that would allow integration of the children into father\u2019s home within a time that is reasonable for I and K.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In sum, the record supports the conclusion that father has not sufficiently addressed the conduct or conditions that are seriously detrimental to the children, and may not be capable of doing so. He had almost four years to address the problems that brought DHS into his life but he still does not appear to recognize that his problems are a significant barrier to his ability to parent. Given the uncertainty that father can effect a lasting change, and given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>father has only sporadically engaged in services up to the time of trial, we conclude that it is unreasonable to require the children to wait longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">B. <em>Mother</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Mother contends that DHS failed to prove any detriment to the children at the time of trial. She argues that she had then been clean and sober for four months and had not used methamphetamine for 10 months. Further, she points out that her therapist and drug treatment counselor thought that she was approaching her treatment with more motivation and insight than before. In support, mother relies on three cases in which we concluded that a \u201crisk of relapse\u201d failed to qualify as unfitness under ORS 419B.504. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. D. F. W., </em>225 Or App 220, 201 P3d 226 (2009) (the parents\u2019 sustained work to resolve their problems led to conditions at the time of trial that did not justify termination of either parent\u2019s parental rights); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. A. M. P., </em>212 Or App 94, 157 P3d 283 (2007) (it was improper to terminate parental rights where the only evidence regarding the father\u2019s condition at the time of trial showed that the father had been making improvements during his incarceration); and <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. L. S., </em>211 Or App 221, 154 P3d 148 (2007) (despite evidence of a \u201cvery troubling\u201d risk of relapse, evidence did not support conclusion that the mother had used drugs in the fifteen months before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We conclude that this case is unlike any of the three cited by mother. Those cases may stand for the general proposition that prior substance abuse does not prove <em>present </em>unfitness, particularly where there has been a sustained period of abstinence from use and engagement in services. Nevertheless, the evidence in this case consists of much more than prior substance abuse. First, mother has a years-long pattern of drug abuse, sobriety, and relapse. That is so despite engaging in and completing an array of services intended to support her sobriety. Second, the psychological testimony presented by DHS demonstrated that, given mother\u2019s personality disorder, her demonstrated pattern is likely to repeat itself, especially because the mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>therapy that she was participating in at the time of trial was unlikely to effectively treat her disorder. Finally, despite the consequences, mother had resorted to using marijuana in response to depression just four months before the termination trial; thus, there is direct recent evidence of the pattern that mother has demonstrated for at least 10 years before trial. For all of those reasons, we have no difficulty concluding that mother\u2019s conduct or condition is seriously detrimental to the children. We also conclude that, given the history of this case, mother\u2019s prognosis, and the children\u2019s circumstances, her conduct or condition is unlikely to change to allow the children to be integrated into her home within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">C. <em>Best Interests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Finally, we conclude that it is in the best interests of the children that we terminate the parental rights of mother and father. Both children have spent the majority of their lives in a series of foster placements and are exhibiting developmental delays and attachment issues. Continued delays in permanency will only further compromise their best interests, particularly under circumstances where both parents have an extended history of recovery and relapse that is likely to repeat itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\"> The foster parents provided foster care for the girls from August 2, 2012 to September 26, 2013, and then again were providing care from March 12, 2014, through the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-7\"> Mother admitted at the termination trial that two of the incidents happened outside of the 180-day period that is required for a restraining order under FAPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\"> For example, mother\u2019s therapeutic parent trainer, Rich, testified that the first half of 2013 was a \u201cgood time\u201d for mother.
