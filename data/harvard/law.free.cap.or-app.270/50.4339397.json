He also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA), arguing that his actions were passive resistance, and, therefore, do not constitute the crime of interfering with a peace officer. The state responds that police did not violate defendant\u2019s right under Article I, section 9, because the risk of losing evidence of defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level created exigent circumstances that excused the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9. The state also contends that a rational factfinder could find that defendant\u2019s actions were not passive resistance. We hold that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress because the officers violated defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, and that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant was not engaged in passive resistance. Accordingly, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s conviction for DUII, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Two off-duty deputy sheriffs observed a station wagon driving 25 miles per hour on a road with a posted speed of 35 miles per hour. They saw the station wagon cross the center line multiple times and noticed that it increased its speed to 55 miles per hour on a bridge and then slow back down to 25 miles per hour after crossing. One deputy noted that the driver was an older tired-looking man with droopy eyes and mouth. The deputies called the authorities to report the driver as a possible drunk driver, gave a description of the station wagon and the driver, and relayed the station wagon\u2019s license plate number. The station wagon then ran a red light, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>deputy sheriffs lost track of it. Later, when he was traveling alone, one of the off-duty sheriffs spotted the same driver and station wagon, only now traveling with a woman in the passenger seat. He noticed the station wagon weave <em>\u201ca </em>little bit\u201d and again called to report the driver. That call took place around 11:01 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Between 11:15 a.m. and 11:20 a.m., Deputy Sheriff Sites, responding to the off-duty deputies\u2019 calls, arrived at the home of the registered owner of the station wagon. Sites knocked on the door, peered into the window, and saw defendant and a woman in the house. Defendant, who matched the description of the driver, opened the interior door, but left a storm door locked and closed. Sites noticed that defendant\u2019s eyes were watery and glassy, he smelled of alcohol, his facial muscles were slack, he appeared lethargic, and, when he spoke, his speech was slurred. Defendant admitted that he had been driving the station wagon. Sites asked defendant to step outside to perform field sobriety tests, and defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t see why I would do that.\u201d Sites then told defendant that he was being detained on suspicion of DUII and instructed him to open the storm door. Defendant replied, \u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d and closed the interior door.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Sites began to knock on the door again and yelled for defendant to open the door. Defendant opened the interior door, again leaving the storm door locked and closed, and said, \u201cNow you\u2019re getting annoying.\u201d Sites told defendant that he was under arrest and ordered him to open the storm door. Defendant told Sites to \u201cfuck off.\u201d Sites put his hand through an open window in the locked and closed storm door\u2014placing his hand against the interior door\u2014 and told defendant not to close the door. Defendant replied, \u201cYou\u2019d better get more cops here,\u201d before closing the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Sites then immediately attempted to forcibly open the locked storm door, damaging the handle. Failing to open the door, Sites called for assistance, and continued to peer into defendant\u2019s home where he saw defendant sit down at his dining room table. Sites continued to order defendant to open the door, telling him that, if he didn\u2019t open the door, \u201cI\u2019d be forcing entry into his residence.\u201d Defendant closed his blinds. Concerned that defendant would attempt to leave, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Sites walked to the back of the house and saw the station wagon in the home\u2019s detached garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Sergeant Shanks and Trooper Tucker arrived at 11:34 a.m., and Sites briefed them on the situation. The officers believed that they had probable cause and exigent circumstances, permitting them to enter the residence without a warrant. At about 11:41 a.m., with one officer stationed at the rear of the house, Sites reached through the open window of the storm door and unlatched it, then he kicked in defendant\u2019s interior door, breaking the door frame. Defendant continued to sit at his dining room table.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Those events transpired on a Sunday. Sites testified that he had not considered attempting to obtain a telephonic warrant to enter the home and that the officers did not discuss getting a warrant because they believed that they had probable cause and exigent circumstances. Sites also testified that the last time he had forced entry into a residence, it had involved detectives and had taken several hours to obtain a warrant. Given that the entry had occurred on a Sunday, Sites believed\u2014in retrospect\u2014that it may have been difficult to reach a judge to issue a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Following a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained after the forcible entry, the trial court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u201c[the ajvailability of a judge to review a search warrant on a Sunday at 11 a.m. is speculative; it is far easier to contact a judge at 2 a.m. because they are routinely home at that time. It can take a matter of mere minutes to get a judge on the line for a telephonic warrant if things go right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The court also found that, on a past occasion when Sites obtained a warrant to search a person\u2019s residence, the process had taken several hours, and that Sites was \u201caware of [the] process for a telephonic warrant\u201d and was \u201caware that a telephonic warrant [of the required type] takes several hours.\u201d The court, citing <em>State v. Machuca, </em>347 Or 644, 227 P3d 729 (2010), denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">\u201c [i] t doesn\u2019t matter how quickly Sites might have been able to get a telephonic warrant; he did not have to waste the time doing that. That\u2019s the whole point behind the doctrine of exigent circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>At trial, defendant testified that, immediately after reaching home, he drank nearly two coffee mugs full of vodka because he was out of his pain medication. After defendant\u2019s first trial, a jury returned a guilty verdict on the charge of interfering with a peace officer, but could not reach a verdict on the DUII and other charges, and the court declared a mistrial on those remaining charges. After his second trial, defendant was convicted of DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for legal error. <em>State v. Woodall, </em>181 Or App 213, 217, 45 P3d 484 (2002). Defendant argues that the officers violated his right against unreasonable search and seizure under Article I, section 9, and under the Fourth Amendment. The state contends that defendant\u2019s argument under the Fourth Amendment is unpreserved; however, because defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim is dispositive, we do not reach defendant\u2019s argument under the federal constitution. <em>See State v. Cookman, </em>324 Or 19, 25, 920 P2d 1086 (1996) (\u201cThis court considers state constitutional claims before considering federal constitutional claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Article I, section 9, provides that \u201c[n]o law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure [.]\u201d \u201cWarrantless entries and searches of premises are <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless they fall within one of the few specifically established and carefully delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Bridewell, </em>306 Or 231, 235, 759 P2d 1054 (1988). One such exception applies when police have probable cause to arrest a suspect and there are \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Kruse, </em>220 Or App 38, 42, 184 P3d 1182 (2008). \u201cAn exigent circumstance is a situation that requires the police to act swiftly to prevent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall a suspect\u2019s escape or the destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 126, 806 P2d 92 (1991). \u201cArticle I, section 9, typically requires a degree of justification for a seizure of a person that correlates with the extent to which police conduct intrudes on that citizen\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>State v. Fair, </em>353 Or 588, 603, 302 P3d 417 (2013). \u201cAn ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>objective of the [Oregon state] constitutional protections * * * against unreasonable searches and seizures is to protect the individual in the sanctity of his or her home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cThe state has the burden of proving that circumstances existing at the time were sufficient to satisfy any exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Baker, </em>350 Or 641, 647, 260 P3d 476 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Regarding his motion to suppress, defendant argues that the trial court erroneously relied on <em>Machuca, </em>347 Or 644, for the proposition that the state did not have to show that it could not have obtained a warrant without sacrificing evidence in order to prove that exigent circumstances existed here, relieving the officers of the warrant requirement. Defendant argues, among other things, that <em>Machuca </em>does not apply to this case because, unlike Machuca\u2014where a DUII suspect was in custody in an emergency room when police ordered a warrantless blood draw to assess the suspect\u2019s blood alcohol level\u2014here, the officers forcibly entered defendant\u2019s home. The state responds that the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Machuca </em>applies equally to the context of an officer\u2019s forcible entry into a suspect\u2019s home as to a blood draw taken from a suspect in an emergency room and, therefore, the state was not required to show that it could not have obtained a warrant without sacrificing evidence. Moreover, the state argues that any delay long enough to obtain a warrant might allow a defendant to either consume alcohol in his home\u2014hidden from police view\u2014or to claim that he had done so, and thus \u201ctamper\u201d with the evidence\u2014namely, the condition of his own body.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We reject the state\u2019s argument for reasons set forth in <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>265 Or App 62, 333 P3d 1201 (2014). The facts here are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Sullivan. </em>Accordingly, the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court found that the \u201c[a] variability of a judge to review a search warrant on a Sunday at 11 a.m. is speculative; it is far easier to contact a judge at 2 a.m. because they are routinely home at that time. It can take a matter of mere minutes to get a judge on the line for a telephonic warrant if things go right.\u201d Yet, to justify a warrantless entry into a residence under the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>of exigent circumstances, the state has the burden to prove that the time it would have taken to obtain a warrant would have sacrificed the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 80-81; <em>see also State v. Ritz, </em>270 Or App 88, 98-99, 347 P3d 1052 (2015) (concluding that, after showing how long it would have taken to obtain a warrant, the state may prove that an exigency exists by showing that the circumstances at the time gave rise to a reasonable concern that, if police waited for a search warrant, the suspect\u2019s blood would lose all evidentiary value). Based on the trial court\u2019s findings, the state did not meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Turning to defendant\u2019s conviction for interfering with a peace officer, defendant argues that he did not violate ORS 162.247<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because (1) the officer\u2019s order that he not close the door was unlawful; (2) defendant was already seized at the point at which the officer issued the order and, therefore, may have committed the crime of resisting arrest, ORS 162.315, but not interfering with a peace officer; and (3) defendant\u2019s actions were passive resistance. We agree with the state that, at trial, defendant only argued that the court should grant an MJOA because closing the door was passive resistance, and consequently, only that argument is preserved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(2000) (explaining that, to preserve an issue, a party must provide the trial court with sufficient explanation to identify the alleged error).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">We review the denial of an MJOA to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Defendant argues that closing the door on the officer is passive resistance because it is a noncooperative and nonviolent reaction to government overreach. However, after the court ruled on defendant\u2019s MJOA, we held that passive resistance under ORS 162.247(3)(b) requires that a \u201cdefendant *** engag[e] in specific acts or techniques that are commonly associated with governmental protest or civil disobedience.\u201d <em>State v. Patnesky, </em>265 Or App 356, 366, 335 P3d 331 (2014). A rational trier of fact could have found that defendant\u2019s action\u2014 closing his door on an officer investigating a crime\u2014was not a specific act or technique of noncooperation \u201ccommonly associated with governmental protestor civil disobedience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In sum, to demonstrate that exigent circumstances exist when police seek to forcibly enter a defendant\u2019s residence, the state has the burden to prove that the time it would take to obtain a warrant would have sacrificed the evidence sought. <em>Sullivan, </em>265 Or App at 80-81. Here, the state did not meet that burden and the court erred in denying his motion to suppress. However, the court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s MJOA on the charge of interfering with a peace officer because there was evidence sufficient to support a finding that closing the door on an officer was not passive resistance under ORS 162.247(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Conviction on Count 1 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> Defendant was also charged with escape in the third degree, ORS 162.145, and reckless driving, ORS 811.140. However, he was not convicted of those crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-5\"> ORS 162.247 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of interfering with a peace officer or parole and probation officer if the person, knowing that another person is a peace officer or a parole and probation officer as defined in ORS 181.610:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u00absj; \u00edfc ?\u00a1\u00ed s\u00a1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201c(b) Refuses to obey a lawful order by the peace officer or parole and probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\"><em>tty </em>sj; sjs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">\u201c(3) This section does not apply in situations in which the person is engaging in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">\u201c(a) Activity that would constitute resisting arrest under ORS 162.315; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">\u201c(b) Passive resistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\"> Defendant did not argue at trial that the officer\u2019s order was unlawful. To be sure, during his motion to suppress, he argued that the officer\u2019s entry was unlawful; however, the issue of the officer\u2019s subsequent entry is distinct from whether the prior order was lawful. <em>See, e.g., State v. Neill, </em>216 Or App 499, 508, 173 P3d 1262 (2007) (concluding that a defendant may be convicted of interfering with a peace officer for disobeying an order issued after police entered the defendant\u2019s home regardless of whether the entry was lawful).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
