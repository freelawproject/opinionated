We write to address petitioner\u2019s contention that OAR 859-050-0010, a rule that specifies certain information that PSRB must include in its prehearing written notice, is inconsistent with ORS 161.346 and ORS 183.413 and, therefore, exceeds PSRB\u2019s statutory authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject petitioner\u2019s remaining assertions without discussion.

If the rules comply, then any further challenge to them must be made on an \u2018as applied\u2019 basis.\u201d). Here, petitioner contends that OAR 859-050-0010 exceeds PSRB\u2019s statutory authority because it does not list all the advisements set forth in ORS 183.413(2). Specifically, petitioner points to ORS 161.346(6) and the provisions of ORS 183.413(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Under ORS 161.346(5), when PSRB conducts a hearing under ORS 161.315 to 161.351,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201c[t]he agency exercising jurisdiction over the person shall furnish to the person about whom the hearing is being conducted, the attorney representing the person, the Attorney General, the district attorney and the court or department of the county from which the person was committed written notice of any hearing pending under this section within a reasonable time prior to the hearing. The notice shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201c(a) The time, place and location of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201c(b) The nature of the hearing and the specific action for which a hearing has been requested, the issues to be considered at the hearing and a reference to the particular sections of the statutes and rules involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u201c(c) A statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201c(d) A statement of all rights under subsection (7) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">ORS 161.346(7), in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201cAt the hearing, the person about whom the hearing is being held shall have the right:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201c(a) To appear at all proceedings held pursuant to this section, except for deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c(b) To cross-examine all witnesses appearing to testify at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">\u201c(c) To subpoena witnesses and documents as provided in ORS 161.395.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u201c(d) To be represented by suitable legal counsel possessing skills and experience commensurate with the nature and complexity of the case, to consult with counsel prior to the hearing and, if financially eligible, to have suitable counsel appointed at state expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">\u201c(e) To examine all information, documents and reports that the agency considers. If then available to the agency, the information, documents and reports shall be disclosed to the person so as to allow examination prior to the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">In addition, ORS 161.346(6) references the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), providing that, \u201c[p]rior to the commencement of the hearing, the agency shall serve personally or by mail a written notice to each party as provided in ORS 183.413(2).\u201d Under ORS 183.413(2), an agency must advise parties to a hearing of a large number of items, including some that are not included in OAR 859-010-0050.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>In view of those statutory provisions, petitioner contends that, \u201c[a]\u00a1though OAR 859-050-0010 complies with the provisions of ORS 161.346 subsections (5) and (7), it does not comply with the requirements of ORS 161.346(6) and ORS 183.413(2)\u201d because \u201cORS 183.413(2) adds multiple requirements to the advisements which must be contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>in respondent\u2019s prehearing notice of rights which [OAR 859-050-0010] ignores.\u201d We reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the rule is invalid because it does not list all of the advisements set forth in ORS 183.413(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">First, we observe that OAR 859-050-0010 implements ORS 161.346 and restates the requirements of ORS 161.346(5). Both the rule and that statutory section provide that PSRB\u2019s prehearing notice shall include (1) the time, place, and location of the hearing; (2) the issues to be considered at the hearing and reference to the statutes and rules involved; (3) the legal authority and jurisdiction for the hearing; (4) a statement of the patient\u2019s right to appear at all proceedings, except PSRB deliberations; (5) a statement of the patient\u2019s right to cross-examine all witnesses who appear to testify at the hearing; (6) a statement of the patient\u2019s right to subpoena witnesses and documents; (7) a statement of the patient\u2019s right to be represented by legal counsel and, if indigent, to have counsel provided without cost; and (8) a statement of the patient\u2019s right to examine all information, documents, and reports under consideration. Thus, on its face, the rule is specifically directed toward the advisements that must be included in PSRB\u2019s prehearing notices. Although the rule mandates that the notice \u201cshall contain\u201d the items set forth above, it does not limit the content of the notice to exclude anything not listed therein. In other words, the rule does not preclude the notice from including the broader list of advisements from the APA; it merely lists the particular items that are required to be included pursuant to a different statutory section. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>491 (unabridged ed 2002) (to contain is to have within, to include); <em>see also id. </em>at 1143 (The term \u201cinclude\u201d indicates \u201cenclosure or containment by a larger class or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>whole of a smaller class or specific item or part.\u201d Include \u201cmay call more attention to the single item or smaller class by stressing the fact of its existence or the fact of its not having been overlooked\u201d). Thus, under the rule, the notice must have the listed items within it, but need not have <em>only </em>those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">We further note that, because it implements a different statutory section, the rule does not merely contain an incomplete list of the prehearing notice requirements of ORS 183.413(2). Rather, OAR 859-050-0010 mandates advisements that are not required under the APA generally. Thus, for example, where ORS 183.413(2)(j) requires an advisement regarding \u201cwhether the parties ordinarily and customarily are represented by an attorney,\u201d ORS 161.346 and OAR 859-050-0010 require an advisement specific to the type of proceedings at issue\u2014that a patient at the hearing has a right to counsel, and, if financially eligible, a right to counsel appointed at no cost. Similarly, advisements of a right to cross-examine and subpoena witnesses are required under ORS 161.346 and OAR 859-050-0010, but not under ORS 183.413(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In sum, we conclude that, in listing a more limited and specific set of advisements that must be included in PSRB\u2019s prehearing notices, OAR 859-050-0010 does not conflict with the statutes listed by petitioner. The rule does not limit the advisements that the notice may contain to the items set forth in the rule; it merely provides that those items must be included. Accordingly, OAR 859-050-0010 does not conflict with the statutes identified by petitioner and, therefore, does not exceed the agency\u2019s authority. Given that, on its face, the rule does not conflict with the requirements of the statutes, any further challenge to it, or to a particular notice from the agency, must be made on an \u201cas applied\u201d basis. <em>See Oregon Newspaper Publishers, </em>329 Or at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">OAR 859-050-0010 held valid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> ORS 183.400 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u201c(1) The validity of any rule may be determined upon a petition by any person to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided for review of orders in contested cases.

We note, however, that the version of OAR 859-050-0010 at issue in this case became effective in January 1995 and, at that time, ORS 183.413(2) provided that, prior \u201cto the commencement of a contested case hearing before any agency including those agencies identified in ORS 183.315, the agency shall inform each party to the hearing of\u2019 certain matters. That information could be conveyed orally before commencement of the hearing. Thus, unlike the current statute, the 1995 version of ORS 183.413(2) did not set forth requirements for a mandated prehearing written notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
