J.</author>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In this action for trespass and nuisance, plaintiffs alleged that, when defendants, owners of neighboring upslope property, replaced their septic system, they caused water to intrude onto plaintiffs\u2019 property in a greater quantity, and at a different location, than water had historically drained. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that defendants\u2019 \u201cgroundwater interceptor\u201d\u2014a long, narrow, and deep trench that collected water and sent it through a pipe that exited down-slope from the septic system\u2014collected surface and groundwater on defendants\u2019 property and diverted it directly onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. After a bench trial, the court found that the groundwater interceptor had, in fact, improperly collected and diverted water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the trial court held that plaintiffs\u2019 trespass and nuisance claims failed because plaintiffs had not shown that defendants\u2019 actions were either intentional or negligent. That is, the trial court found that defendants did not know, and acted reasonably in not discovering, that the groundwater interceptor caused water to improperly intrude onto plaintiffs\u2019 property\u2014either when the system was first installed or when plaintiffs complained to defendants about water coming onto their property. On appeal, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in making that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>finding because the only factual determination supported by the evidence is that defendants knew or should have known that their groundwater interceptor would divert or was diverting water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. For the reasons below, we reject that argument and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">We state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s findings and in the light most favorable to defendants, who prevailed at trial. <em>Sutherlin School Dist. #130 v. Herrera, </em>120 Or App 86, 91, 851 P2d 1171 (1993). Defendants have lived in a home on their property for several decades. Their property is to the north of plaintiffs\u2019 property, and water in their backyard naturally travels on a southeastern path along a slope toward plaintiffs\u2019 property. In 2007, the septic system in defendants\u2019 backyard failed, and they contracted with an installer to replace it. As part of the permitting process for the replacement, a soil scientist from Clackamas County evaluated the backyard soil and issued a report specifying the general type of septic system to be installed and where it should be placed based on \u201ctest pits\u201d dug in the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The county also required the installation of a \u201cgroundwater interceptor\u201d to protect the drainage field where water exited the septic system. The groundwater interceptor\u2014a narrow, deep, and long trench built upslope from that drainage field\u2014diverted surface water and groundwater around the drainage field, ensuring that the soil in the field could absorb water from the septic system. As built, the interceptor trench on defendants\u2019 property was three feet deep, one foot wide, and filled with gravel; it extended 70 feet upslope of the drainage field. A perforated four-inch pipe running along the bottom of the trench collected water and took it to a solid four-inch pipe that ran underground down the slope, for about 100 feet, until it met daylight. The above-ground point where the pipe released water was about 36 feet from plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Sometime after defendants installed the groundwater interceptor, plaintiffs noticed that the edge of their property bordering defendants\u2019 property was quite muddy and soggy. They had noticed that the property was muddy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>before, and, in 2001, built a six-inch-deep trench along the property line that would fill with about four inches of water from time to time. As of 2007, however, plaintiffs observed <em>\u201ca </em>significant increase in the amount of water that was coming off of [defendants\u2019 property].\u201d After deepening the ditch to address the water, in 2010, plaintiffs built a French drain that drained to a creek on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In November 2010, plaintiffs sent defendants a letter, stating that they had \u201cnoticed an extremely large amount of water flowing from\u201d defendants\u2019 property to plaintiffs\u2019 property. The letter identified the groundwater interceptor as the cause, though it also asserted that defendants had \u201cconnected a [12-inch] concrete drain pipe to the culvert running under [the road in front of defendants\u2019 house], extending [100 feet] to an open ditch on the west side of [defendants\u2019] property where it flows south onto [plaintiffs\u2019] property.\u201d Plaintiffs \u201cdemand [ed] that within 30 days of the date of this letter, you install dry wells to which you pipe the water you are diverting and collecting and prevent it from running onto our property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">After receiving the letter, defendants contacted the septic system installer, who suggested that defendants talk to someone from the county. Two county officials, Garity and Patterson, came out to inspect the property for one or two hours on a day following a heavy rain storm. Garity, a licensed water-rights examiner and inspection supervisor of the county engineering division, observed that water flowing out of the interceptor exit pipe dissipated and went back into the ground within five to 10 feet of the exit point. In Garity\u2019s view, the groundwater interceptor had not changed the flow of water from defendants\u2019 property onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. Garity\u2019s assistant, Patterson, concurred with that assessment, stating that he thought that defendants \u201chad left sufficient space for the water [flowing out of the exit pipe] to be able to sheet-flow and do what it * * * would do naturally anyways.\u201d Garity also told defendants that the ground wells that plaintiffs had demanded would not be effective because the soil in the area had an extremely hard and impermeable layer about two feet below the surface. Garity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>sent defendants a written summary of his views, a \u201cSketch of Drainage Complaint Investigation,\u201d and an \u201cInspection Summary\u201d that Patterson prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Relying on those materials and advice from county officials, defendants did not believe that the groundwater interceptor was sending water improperly onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. They responded to plaintiffs\u2019 letter stating as much, explaining that they had spoken to the county officials. Defendants also explained that the culvert under the road in front of their house and the ditch connected to it were \u201ctoday just as they were when [defendants] purchased the home in 1967.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Plaintiffs filed suit for trespass and nuisance soon thereafter, seeking $7,500 in damages, an injunction to stop \u201cdefendants from diverting the water from their [groundwater interceptor] to [plaintiffs\u2019 property],\u201d and attorney fees. The legal principles supporting plaintiffs\u2019 claims were undisputed at trial (and are not disputed on appeal). Plaintiffs\u2019 trespass and nuisance claims each \u201cinvolve [] a different kind of interference with plaintiffs\u2019 interest in their land: \u2018[A]n actionable invasion of a possessor\u2019s interest in the exclusive possession of land is a trespass; an actionable invasion of a possessor\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of his land is a nuisance.\u2019\u201d <em>Carvalho v. Wolfe, </em>207 Or App 175, 178, 140 P3d 1161 (2006) (quoting <em>Martin et ux v. Reynolds Metals Co., </em>221 Or 86, 90, 342 P2d 790 (1959), <em>cert den, </em>362 US 918 (1960)). Both claims require plaintiffs to show that the intrusion was intentional or, if unintentional, the result of defendants\u2019 negligence or ultrahazardous activity. <em>Carvalho, </em>207 Or App at 180-81. \u201c\u2018Intentional\u2019 is used in this context to mean that the acts setting in motion the invasion were done with knowledge that a trespass would result and not that the acts were done for the specific purpose of causing a trespass or injury.\u201d <em>Lunda v. Matthews, </em>46 Or App 701, 705, 613 P2d 63 (1980). Conduct may also be intentional when \u201cthere is a <em>continuing </em>intrusion known to the intruder that he allows to persist,\u201d even if the intruder did not know that an invasion would result at the time the acts \u201csetting in motion the invasion\u201d were done. <em>McGregor v. Barton Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., </em>62 Or App 24, 31 n 5, 660 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>175 (1983) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs may also prevail on a claim for negligent trespass or nuisance by showing that, when defendants acted, they should have known the intrusion would result. <em>Hudson v. Peavey Oil Company, </em>279 Or 3, 7, 566 P2d 175 (1977). Consistent with those principles, plaintiffs argued that defendants knew or should have known that \u201cthey were piping groundwater and surface water onto Plaintiffs\u2019 land\u201d as of 2007, or at least knew or should have known of an ongoing intrusion when plaintiffs complained about the water in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The trial court, in oral remarks made at the end of trial, first addressed whether defendants\u2019 groundwater system had, in fact, caused an improper intrusion of water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. On that question, the court had heard conflicting evidence (including opposing opinions from two expert witnesses), and it resolved that evidence in plaintiffs\u2019 favor: \u201c[T]he greater weight of the evidence * * * seems to be that it was that system that caused the water to be diverted, and then it resulted, essentially, in an accumulation or a concentration of water at the south end of [defendants\u2019] property. And that moved onto [plaintiffs\u2019] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In assessing plaintiffs\u2019 theory that, in 2007, defendants knew or should have known that the groundwater interceptor would cause water to intrude on plaintiffs\u2019 property beyond what would occur with ordinary drainage, the court determined that defendants did not have \u201cany idea that the water was going to drain down into the neighbors\u2019 property.\u201d When considering what defendants knew or should have known in 2010, after they received plaintiffs\u2019 letter, the court identified the \u201ccore issue\u201d as whether plaintiffs could \u201cprevail in light of the information that [defendants] had received from the county\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201c[Defendants] received the notice from the [plaintiffs], and * * * then [defendants] * * * did something about it. They contacted the county; the county came out. And Mr. Morris\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>testimony was that Mr. Garity had arrived and looked at the entire system and concluded that [defendants] were not causing the problem. So that appears to create a problem in proving the intentional trespass where you\u2019ve got competing notices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The court expressed \u201creal concerns\u201d as to whether plaintiffs could recover for intentional or negligent trespass or nuisance on those facts and took the matter under advisement. The court later ruled, in a letter opinion, \u201cas it stated it was inclined to rule\u201d when it made its oral rulings. The court explained that, \u201c[although [it] * * * ruled in plaintiffs\u2019 favor on causation, more than proof of causation is required in order to prevail on the trespass and nuisance claims. As stated in court, a water intrusion case of this nature is not a strict liability offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in finding that defendants did not know of an intrusion beyond what would occur with ordinary drainage and were reasonable in believing that their actions would not result, and were not resulting, in that kind of intrusion onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 property. Plaintiffs contend that, once defendants installed the groundwater interceptor in 2007, they \u201cshould have known at all times that they would be causing Plaintiffs\u2019 property to be flooded.\u201d They claim that \u201cwhat the [groundwater interceptor] did was act as a giant funnel\u201d and that \u201c[a]nyone who created such a structure should know that it is going to have a material impact on the property below the exit pipe.\u201d Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that, regardless of what defendants knew when the groundwater interceptor was installed in 2007, they knew or should have known that the interceptor was sending water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property when they received plaintiffs\u2019 letter in 2010 asserting that defendants had engaged in \u201cwater trespass.\u201d In plaintiffs\u2019 view, defendants\u2019 consultation with officials from the county did \u201cnot rise to the level of adequate due diligence\u201d because those officials\u2019 views were \u201cerroneous,\u201d \u201ccasual,\u201d and \u201cinformal.\u201d In support of that characterization, plaintiffs fault defendants for failing to consult a \u201cgeotechnical expert\u201d and point out what they perceive as limitations in the opinions from the county officials\u2014that the officials\u2019 \u201cprimary purpose\u201d was to make sure that the culvert under the county road was not causing a problem, and that they told defendants that they were not \u201cattorneys or hydrologists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The fundamental problem with those arguments\u2014 arguments that mirror the arguments plaintiffs made to the trial court\u2014is that they are incompatible with our standard of review. The question as to what defendants knew or should have known, under the circumstances as they existed in 2007 or 2010, was a question of fact for the finder of fact\u2014here, the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Senn v. Bunick, </em>40 Or App 33, 38, 594 P2d 837, <em>rev den, </em>287 Or 149 (1979) (rejecting argument on appeal that trial court erred in refusing to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for trespass based on construction of a dam, where there was \u201csufficient evidence <em>from which the jury could find </em>that [the] defendants knew or should have known what they were doing, and they knew or should have known of potential effects on [the] plaintiffs\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Kaseberg v. Davis Wright Tremaine, LLP, </em>351 Or 270, 278, 265 P3d 777 (2011) (explaining that, in determining the point when a plaintiff should know of legally cognizable injury, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201capplies an objective standard\u2014how a reasonable person of ordinary prudence would have acted in the same or a similar situation,\u201d and that generally \u201cpresents a factual question for determination by a jury\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When a party challenges the findings of a trial court sitting as a factfinder, our review is limited to the narrow issue of whether there is any evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. <em>Hassan v. Guyer, </em>271 Or 349, 352, 532 P2d 227 (1975); <em>Herrera, </em>120 Or App at 91 (stating that standard for claim of intentional trespass). We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s determination as to what a party knew or should have known unless we can say, as a matter of law, that there is <em>only </em>one factual determination supported by the evidence, and the trial court reached a contrary conclusion. <em>See Hudson, </em>279 Or at 7 (explaining that what a plaintiff knew or should have known in trespass action could not be decided as a matter of law where there was conflicting evidence on that issue); <em>Kaseberg, </em>351 Or at 278 (explaining that determination as to whether a plaintiff should have known of cognizable injury presents a \u201cfactual question for determination by a jury unless the only conclusion that a jury could reach is that the plaintiff knew or should have known the critical facts at a specified time and did not file suit within the requisite time thereafter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>To endorse plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on review, then, we must conclude, as a matter of law, that the only factual determination supported by the evidence is that defendants knew or should have known that their groundwater interceptor would divert or was diverting water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. At best, plaintiffs\u2019 arguments demonstrate that the evidence in this case might have permitted that determination, not that that was the <em>only determination </em>that could have been drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hudson </em>illustrates that principle. In that case, the plaintiffs noticed an overwhelming odor of gasoline on one end of their property, which was near multiple service stations. 279 Or at 5, 7. When the plaintiffs inquired at the station next door to see if one of the station\u2019s gasoline storage tanks might be leaking, the station\u2019s employees told the couple, after checking their tanks and sales records, that the station was not losing any gasoline from its tanks. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Several months later, the plaintiffs dug a trench and discovered that the station\u2019s tanks were leaking, and they sued the station for trespass. The question on review was whether the evidence permitted the determination, as a matter of law, that the station knew or should have known of the gasoline seepage before the plaintiffs dug the trench.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the court determined that \u201c[t]here was evidence which would have <em>permitted </em>the jury to find that [the station] was negligent in failing to discover the leak in the tank sooner than it did,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9 n 4 (emphasis added), the court concluded that \u201cthe evidence would not have justified a ruling that defendant knew or should have known of the gasoline seepage <em>as a matter of law,\u201d id. </em>at 7 (emphasis added). The court noted that, until the couple dug the trench, \u201cso far as the parties knew, the gasoline on plaintiffs\u2019 property might have been coming from other sources, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>including other service stations which were located nearby. There was also evidence that during this period [the station\u2019s] normal record-keeping did not disclose any gasoline shortages from its tanks.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Here, as in <em>Hudson, </em>the evidence presented to the trial court did not compel a finding that defendants knew or should have known about the improper water intrusion when the groundwater interceptor was installed in 2007 or when plaintiffs complained about water entering their property in 2010. As to what defendants should have known when the interceptor was installed, plaintiffs point to the physical attributes of the system\u2014that it was a long, deep trench (a \u201cgiant funnel\u201d) that sent water to an exit point 36 feet from plaintiffs\u2019 property\u2014and draw the inference, from those attributes alone, that defendants should have known that the interceptor would cause a water intrusion. But there was evidence from which the trial court could draw a contrary inference. At the time the septic system was installed, defendants understood that the county had required the groundwater interceptor and imposed minimum requirements on its design, and they understood that, to prevent saturation of the drain field, the interceptor captured and sent water out an exit pipe. Beyond that, there was no evidence that anything told to them by the installers or the county officials, or anything defendants knew about the system itself, suggested that the interceptor would do more than keep water out of the septic system drain field\u2014 that it would increase the quantity of, and change direction of, water draining from their property. Defendants testified that they never noticed large amounts of water coming out of the pipe and that the southern, downslope end of their property had been marshy long before the groundwater interceptor was installed. In light of that evidence, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that defendants acted negligently in failing to forecast that the groundwater interceptor would concentrate and divert water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Plaintiffs likewise question defendants\u2019 reliance on the opinions they received from county officials in 2010 (that the interceptor was not sending water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property beyond what would occur with ordinary drainage), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>there was evidence establishing that defendants reasonably relied on advice from county officials and discounted plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was the county that required the groundwater interceptor, and so defendants contacted the county when they were alerted to a possible problem with its operation. Regardless of whether the county had any legal responsibility for the interceptor\u2019s function, county officials conducted an on-site inspection as part of what they identified as an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d and they assessed whether the system was causing the problem that plaintiffs had identified in their letter. The officials also explained to defendants that, even if there was a problem, the dry wells demanded by plaintiffs would be ineffective, suggesting that plaintiffs might have been mistaken about the flow of water onto their property. That evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that defendants reasonably credited the county officials\u2019 assessment over the accusations in plaintiffs\u2019 letter, even if it might have permitted the court \u201cto find that [defendants were] negligent in failing to discover\u201d that the interceptor was causing an improper intrusion. <em>Hudson, </em>279 Or at 9 n 4. We cannot say that the only determination that the evidence allowed was that plaintiffs were unreasonable in concluding that the groundwater interceptor was not sending water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property beyond what would occur with ordinary drainage. Thus, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-5\"> The parties agree that defendants had the right to have their property naturally drain surface and ground water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property, but they did not have the right to artificially collect and redirect the water in a way that changed the quantity of water that naturally flowed, and the place where the water naturally flowed, onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. In this opinion, then, references to an \u201cimproper\u201d intrusion of water are to the collection and redirection of water in a way that changed the flow\u2019s quantity and location when compared to the natural flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We also note that the parties rely on cases involving surface water in support of the above proposition. <em>See Rehfuss v. Weeks, </em>93 Or 25, 32, 182 P 137 (1919) (\u201cThe defendant as a landowner had the right to turn or expel upon the land of an adjacent owner, surface water that would naturally flow there, and in such quantities as would naturally drain in such direction, without liability for damages.\u201d); <em>Garbarino v. Van Cleave et al, </em>214 Or 554, 557-58, 330 P2d 28 (1958) (reasoning that the \u201cdefendants had the right to install and use a system to drain the surface water from their lands into natural channels even though they thereby accelerated the flow of water onto the lower lands of plaintiff,\u201d but noting that the plaintiff did \u201cnot allege that defendants changed the place where the surface water from their property naturally flowed onto plaintiffs lands\u201d). We assume that those rules apply in this case, which involves allegations of the collection and diversion of both surface and ground water.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\"> <em>McGregor </em>imposed liability for intentional trespass in a case where the intruder knew of a persistent intrusion and allowed it to persist. Here, plaintiffs extend that theory to negligent conduct, arguing that defendants are liable for negligent trespass and nuisance because they <em>should have known </em>of the intrusion and allowed it to persist. For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the rule in <em>McGregor </em>extends to negligent conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\"> Plaintiffs also argued that defendants were negligent in constructing the groundwater interceptor and that negligence caused the intrusion of water on plaintiffs\u2019 property. As plaintiffs described it in a pretrial memorandum, defendants\u2019 negligence related to \u201cthe manner and location in which the [groundwater interceptor] and the drainfield were constructed and the failure to mitigate the water being diverted.\u201d In argument at trial, plaintiffs elaborated that \u201cthe groundwater intercept or * * *\u2014you know, where it\u2019s located is negligence. And because it\u2019s capturing water from that metal pipe, because [the interceptor trench] was rocked to the top and because where [defendants] have it located, they don\u2019t mitigate the water that they\u2019re causing to be concentrated in one course at the south end of their property.\u201d The trial court rejected that theory of liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_L\">\u201cAnd I also am not inclined to believe that [defendants] were negligent in how they constructed this system. They\u2019re working with other professionals, and the system was placed in a location which appeared to be appropriate. And they certainly didn\u2019t want to have a disaster on their hands by having water get into that drain field or the septic system, so it was diverted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Plaintiffs do not appear to challenge that determination on review. Rather, they argue that defendants\u2019 knowledge of the structure itself in 2007, or their knowledge of the structure itself and plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that it was causing water to enter their property, compelled the trial court to find that defendants knew or should have known that the groundwater interceptor was diverting and concentrating water on plaintiffs\u2019 property. To the extent that plaintiffs on appeal challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendants were not negligent in how they constructed the system, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination is supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b637-4\"> Plaintiffs suggest that our \u201creview is for an error of law,\u201d relying on cases discussing what is required to meet the fact-pleading requirement in alleging the foreseeability element of a negligence claim. In <em>Moore v. Willis, 307 </em>Or 254, 259, <em>767 </em>P2d 62 (1988), for example, the court explained that \u201c[w]hether a defendant should have known something is a judgment about a particular set of circumstances rather than a fact from which conclusions are drawn. An allegation that a defendant knew something may be an allegation of fact, but an allegation that he should have known something is merely a <em>conclusion drawn from other facts? </em>(Emphasis added.) From that, plaintiffs argue that what a defendant \u201cshould have known\u201d is a legal conclusion that we should review for errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">But <em>Moore </em>further explains that, \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff claims that a risk was foreseeable, though not necessarily foreseen, the plaintiff must allege facts that would allow <em>the factfinder </em>to conclude that the defendant should have known of the risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, although it is true that what a person should have known is a \u201cconclusion drawn from other facts,\u201d it remains an innately <em>factual </em>conclusion that is ordinarily left for the factfinder\u2014here, the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 17-18, 734 P2d 1326 (1987) (\u201c \u2018The jury is given a wide leeway in deciding whether the conduct in question falls above or below the standard of reasonable conduct deemed to have been set by the community. The court intervenes only when it can say that the actor\u2019s conduct clearly meets the standard or clearly falls below it.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Stewart v. Jefferson Plywood Co., </em>255 Or 603, 607, 469 P2d 783 (1970))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b638-5\"> The trial court, over the station\u2019s objection, \u201cinstructed the jury, in effect, that [the station] was strictly liable for any damages caused by the seepage of its gasoline\u201d onto the plaintiffs\u2019 property. <em>Hudson, </em>279 Or at 6. In assessing that instruction, the Supreme Court explained that, because \u201cliability for trespass will not be imposed for an unintentional trespass unless it arises out of defendant\u2019s negligence or the carrying on of an extrahazardous activity,\u201d the instruction was \u201cproper only if [the station\u2019s] trespass was either intentional or negligent as a matter of law or if [the station\u2019s] storage of gasoline constituted an extra-hazardous activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-5\"> Plaintiffs also argue\u2014in direct contradiction to their suggestion that defendants acted unreasonably in not consulting an expert\u2014that the outside opinions that defendants received were \u201clegally and factually irrelevant\u201d because \u201c[w]hether one should know that the [groundwater interceptor] would cause flooding to [plaintiffs\u2019] property is based solely on the physical attributes of the system.\u201d Plaintiffs cite no authority for that categorical proposition, and we are aware of none. As the trial court observed, adopting that rule would mean that defendants\u2014neither of whom had any expertise in the groundwater system that was installed\u2014would be liable for trespass and nuisance, even if the world\u2019s foremost expert in hydrology, drainage, and groundwater systems had counseled them that their system was not causing a problem. We agree with the trial court that the opinions of county officials were relevant in assessing whether defendants acted reasonably.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
