Petitioner assigns error to LUBA\u2019s determination that the county failed to establish, under the process outlined in OAR 660-004-0018, that the proposed amendment and zone change did not require new exceptions to Statewide Planning Goals 3 and 4, as well as to LUBA\u2019s determination that the county was required to demonstrate that all sections of OAR 660-004-0018(2) are satisfied in order to establish that the proposed plan amendment and zone change do not require new exceptions to Goals 3 and 4. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The subject property for which petitioner seeks the zone change and plan amendment is located in Oregon City and includes two \u201clegal lots of record\u201d on Tax Lots 1000,1001, 1002,1100, and 1101, totaling approximately 8.15 acres. The entire property is bordered on the west by Highway 213, on the south by Quail Crest Lane, and on the north and east by rural residential properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Originally, the subject property was zoned Suburban Low Density Single Family Residential. In 1979, it was rezoned to Rural Residential Farm Forest 5-Acre District (RRFF-5). In 1980, the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) acknowledged the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. As acknowledged in 1980, the comprehensive plan (the Plan) designates the subject property as \u201cRural,\u201d meaning \u201cexception lands, as defined in Oregon Administrative Rules 660-004-0005(1).\u201d That rule includes in the definition of \u201cexception\u201d those Plan provisions that do not comply with some or all of the statewide planning goals, but that meet the requirements of a statutorily-recognized exception. <em>See </em>OAR 660-004-0005(l)(b) - (c). The county determined below that the 1980 acknowledgement of the plan provision designating the subject property as Rural resulted in an exception to the requirements of Goals 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Petitioner purchased Tax Lot 1000 in 1991 and Tax Lot 1100 in 1996 and operates a paving business on the property. In 2013, petitioner applied to the county to amend the Plan designation from \u201cRural\u201d to \u201cRural Industrial\u201d (RI) and to rezone the subject property from RRFF-5 to RI. In response to petitioner\u2019s application, respondent Brian Ooten argued that the county could not approve the proposed plan amendment and zone change because petitioner failed to demonstrate that the amendment complied with Goals 3 and 4 (the goals that regulate development on agricultural and forest lands), or qualified for exceptions to those goals under ORS 197.732<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and OAR 660-004-0018<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Petitioner, in turn, asserted that, as a result of the county\u2019s 1980 exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>stemming from the acknowledged plan\u2019s designation of the subject property as \u201crural\u201d, Goals 3 and 4 no longer applied to the property at all, relieving petitioner of the obligation to demonstrate compliance with them or to obtain an exception from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The county agreed with petitioner, determining that no new exception to either Goal 3 or 4 was required, because the property at issue was already subject to the 1980 exception to Goals 3 and 4. Specifically, the county reasoned that \u201c[a]n Exception to the Statewide Planning Goals was completed by the County and acknowledged by LCDC to designate the property Rural when the County adopted the Comprehensive Plan in 1980.\u201d Further, the county determined that the proposed plan amendment otherwise complied with the requirements of OAR 660-004-0018.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Respondent appealed the county\u2019s decision to LUBA. Before LUBA, respondent assigned error to, among other things, the county\u2019s determination that no new exception to Goal 3 or 4 was required, and to the county\u2019s factual findings concerning OAR 660-004-0018. Concerning the need for new exceptions to Goals 3 and 4, respondent argued that a representative from the county had stated that the initial Rural designation qualified as both a \u201cphysically developed\u201d and an \u201cirrevocably committed\u201d exception to Goals 3 and 4. Respondent further asserted that, under ORS 197.732 and OAR 660-004-0018, those types of exceptions \u201care limited to \u2018specific properties or situations\u2019\u201d and \u201cauthorize only uses that existed at the time the exception was granted.\u201d In respondent\u2019s view, because the proposed amendment appeared to permit \u201cuses that are decidedly not the same as the uses permitted under the existing Rural designation,\u201d OAR 660-004-0018 required petitioner to meet the requirements for a new \u201creasons\u201d exception to Goals 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In response, petitioner argued that respondent\u2019s contention that new exceptions to Goals 3 and 4 were required amounted to an impermissible collateral attack on the 1980 exception taken when the subject property was designated and rezoned Rural. Petitioner did not attempt to frame his argument that no new exceptions were required under the terms of OAR 660-004-0018, which governs the determination of whether new exceptions are required in connection with plan amendments and zone changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">LUBA concluded that the county\u2019s factual findings were inadequate to determine whether or not new exceptions to Goals 3 and 4 were required under OAR 660-004-0018 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>connection with the proposed amendment and zone change, and remanded to the county to conduct the analysis required by the rule. In so doing, LUBA rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that the 1980 exception to Goals 3 and 4 meant that those goals no longer applied to the property, noting that, under the plain terms of OAR 660-004-0018, exceptions to goals operate to authorize only uses, services, activities, densities and facilities that are \u201crecognized or justified by the applicable exception,\u201d and do not categorically exempt the property covered by the exception from the application of the statewide planning goals. LUBA reasoned that, under the terms of the rule, whether new exceptions were required turned on the scope of the 1980 exception and the relationship between the land uses \u201crecognized or justified by\u201d that exception, and the uses that would be permitted under the proposed plan amendment and zone change.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Petitioner timely petitioned for judicial review of LUBA\u2019s decision. On judicial review, petitioner raises two assignments of error. First, petitioner assigns error to LUBA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe County was required to take Goals 3 and 4 [into] consideration with respect to Petitioner\u2019s application.\u201d Petitioner argues that, \u201conce an exception has been taken to a goal no new exception to the same goal is necessary.\u201d Therefore, petitioner argues, because the 1980 designation of the property as Rural constituted an acknowledged exception to Goals 3 and 4, no new exception to those goals is required. Second, petitioner assigns error to LUBA\u2019s conclusion that he must demonstrate that all requirements of OAR 660-004-0018(2) are satisfied in order to avoid the need to take a reasons exception to Goals 3 and 4, arguing that we should interpret the word \u201cand\u201d in OAR 660-004-0018(2)(c) as a disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d The county joins in petitioner\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We review LUBA\u2019s order to determine whether it is \u201cunlawful in substance or procedure[.]\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">As noted, in the first assignment of error, petitioner contends that LUBA erred in concluding that the county failed to demonstrate that no new exceptions to Goals 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>and 4 were required in connection with the proposed plan amendment and zone change, rendering LUBA\u2019s order \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d Petitioner asserts that, by virtue of the 1980 exception, Goals 3 and 4 no longer apply to the subject property at all and that, as a result, the county was not required to assess whether new exceptions were required in processing petitioner\u2019s application for a plan amendment and zone change. In petitioner\u2019s view, LUBA therefore erred by remanding to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">That argument fails to demonstrate any legal error in LUBA\u2019s decision. LUBA remanded the case to the county based on its determinations that (1) OAR 660-004-0018 establishes the process for determining whether or not the proposed plan amendment and zone change require new exceptions to Goals 3 and 4; (2) the county failed to conduct the analysis required by the rule in approving petitioner\u2019s application, and, relatedly; (3) the county had failed to develop an adequate factual basis for conducting that analysis. It is undisputed that the subject property is subject to the existing 1980 exception to Goals 3 and 4. Moreover, OAR 660-004-0018 states unequivocally that it \u201cexplains the requirements for adoption of plan and zone designations for exceptions,\u201d and then spells out the process for determining whether or not a new exception is required. OAR 660-004-0018. We recognized as much in our decision in <em>Doty v. Coos County, </em>185 Or App 233, 241-44, 59 P3d 50 (2002) (explaining that \u201cORS 660-004-0018 governs whether a change in use is allowed under an existing exception\u201d and provides the process for determining whether a new exception is required by a proposed zone change or plan amendment). In the briefing before us,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petitioner has not identified any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>error in LUBA\u2019s conclusion that the county must conduct the OAR 660-004-0018 analysis to determine whether new exceptions to Goals 3 and 4 are required or provided any reasoned argument as to why that rule does not apply to the county\u2019s evaluation of petitioner\u2019s application. Accordingly, petitioner has not demonstrated that LUBA\u2019s conclusion to remand to the county to conduct the analysis required by OAR 660-004-0018 renders the order on review \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In the second assignment of error, petitioner argues that LUBA erred in concluding that on remand the county is required to find that all requirements of OAR 660-004-0018(2) are satisfied to avoid the requirement in OAR 660-004-0018(3) and (4) that the county take a new \u201creasons\u201d exception to Goals 3 and 4. OAR 660-004-0018(2) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cFor \u2018physically developed\u2019 and \u2018irrevocably committed\u2019 exceptions to goals, *** all plan and zone designations shall limit uses, density, and public facilities and services to those:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201c(a) That are the same as the existing land uses on the exception site;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201c(b) That meet the following requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201c(A) The rural uses, density, and public facilities and services will maintain the land as \u2018Rural Land\u2019 as defined by the goals, and are consistent with all other applicable goal requirements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201c(B) The rural uses, density, and public facilities and services will not commit adjacent or nearby resource land to uses not allowed by the applicable goal as described in OAR 660-004-0028; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\u201c(C) The rural uses, density, and public facilities and services are compatible with adjacent or nearby resource uses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">\u201c(c) For uses in unincorporated communities, the uses are consistent with OAR 660-022-0030, \u2018Planning and Zoning of Unincorporated Communities\u2019, if the county chooses to designate the community under the applicable provisions of OAR chapter 660, division 22; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201c(d) For industrial development uses and accessory uses subordinate to the industrial development, the industrial uses may occur in buildings of any size and type provided the exception area was planned and zoned for industrial use on January 1, 2004, subject to the territorial limits and other requirements of ORS 197.713 and 197.714.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">(Emphasis added.) In turn, OAR 660-004-0018(3) states that \u201c[u]ses, density, and public facilities and services not meeting section (2) of this rule may be approved on rural land only under provisions for a reasons exception as outlined in section (4) of this rule\u201d and other applicable rules. Although petitioner acknowledges that the word \u201cand\u201d at the end of OAR 660-004-0018(2)(c) ordinarily would be construed to mean that all four requirements under section (2) must be met in order to avoid the need to take a reasons exception, petitioner argues that we should construe that \u201cand\u201d to mean \u201cor,\u201d and hold that the county need not take a reasons exception to Goals 3 and 4 if it finds that any one of the four requirements in OAR 660-004-0018(2) is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We decline petitioner\u2019s request to read the \u201cand\u201d at the end of OAR 660-004-0018(2)(c) to mean \u201cor.\u201d LCDC, which promulgated the rule, amended the rule in 2011 to change what had been the word \u201cor\u201d at the end of OAR 660-004-0018(2)(c) to \u201cand.\u201d Oregon Bulletin, Volume 50, No 3, p 126 (March 2011). Notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s suggestion to the contrary, it is not impossible to implement the rule if the requirements of OAR 660-004-0018(2) are construed to operate conjunctively, as the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cand\u201d would suggest LCDC intended. Under those circumstances, we presume that LCDC\u2019s explicit and recent decision to change the word \u201cor\u201d to \u201cand\u201d was intentional, and, in particular, that LCDC intended that the provisions of OAR 660-004-0018(2) would apply conjunctively rather than disjunctively as a result of the amendment. It is not our role to repeal that amendment by interpreting the word \u201cand\u201d to mean \u201cor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-4\"> ORS 197.732 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201c(2) A local government may adopt an exception to a goal if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201c(a) The land subject to the exception is <em>physically developed </em>to the extent that it is no longer available for uses allowed by the applicable goal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201c(b) The land subject to the exception is <em>irrevocably committed </em>as described by Land Conservation and Development Commission rule to uses not allowed by the applicable goal because existing adjacent uses and other relevant factors make uses allowed by the applicable goal impracticable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201c(c) The following standards are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">\u201c(A) <em>Reasons </em>justify why the state policy embodied in the applicable goals should not apply;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201c(B) Areas that do not require a new exception cannot reasonably accommodate the use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u201c(C) The long term environmental, economic, social and energy consequences resulting from the use at the proposed site with measures designed to reduce adverse impacts are not significantly more adverse than would typically result from the same proposal being located in areas requiring a goal exception other than the proposed site; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">\u201c(D) The proposed uses are compatible with other adjacent uses or will be so rendered through measures designed to reduce adverse impacts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-14\"> OAR 660-004-0018 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">\u201c(1) Purpose.

However, those arguments were not presented to LUBA, and, thus, do not provide a basis for us to conclude that LUBA erred. In addition, petitioner\u2019s belated suggestion at oral argument that the 1980 exception is irrelevant to the analysis conflicts with the county\u2019s finding that it was the 1980 exception that relieved the county of any further obligation to assess whether the changes proposed by petitioner\u2019s application required a new exception to Goals 3 and 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
