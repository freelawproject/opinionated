J.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Plaintiff, who is a former employee of the State of Oregon\u2014specifically, Oregon Youth Authority\u2014filed a complaint seeking damages from the state and Sid Thompson, the superintendent of MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility where plaintiff had worked (collectively, OYA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After OYA moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to ORCP 21 B, the trial court concluded that plaintiff had resolved \u201call civil areas of dispute\u201d by way of a settlement agreement. Accordingly, the court entered a judgment dismissing all of plaintiffs claims with prejudice. Plaintiff appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment and, as explained below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">We state the facts as alleged in the complaint and supplemented by the terms of the settlement agreement, which was attached to OYA\u2019s answer. <em>See Boyer v. Salomon Smith Barney, </em>344 Or 583, 589 n 3, 188 P3d 233 (2008) (where the defendants incorporated a contract into their answer and plaintiff did not object to the trial court considering the terms of that agreement in evaluating a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the appellate court treated the terms of the agreement \u201cas having been admitted by plaintiff, the same as if plaintiff had alleged those terms in his complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Plaintiff worked for OYA as a group life coordinator at MacLaren. In that position, plaintiffs main job duty was to supervise youth offenders in the facility. Over the course of several months in 2010, plaintiff made a number of complaints to management about staff being attacked by youth offenders, knowledge of offenders planning attacks on staff, differential treatment of offenders, staff being put physically at risk, lack of policies and rules governing the unit, and failure to provide treatment to offenders. On May 19, 2010, OYA terminated plaintiff from his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">After plaintiff was dismissed, he pursued a grievance through his union. As part of the settlement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>grievance, OYA agreed that plaintiffs dismissal would be characterized as a resignation and that plaintiff would not have any further legal issues regarding the events leading to his termination. In return, plaintiff agreed to drop his claims and release OYA from liability. Accordingly, the parties signed a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The agreement, entered into in August 2010, recites that the parties \u201cwish to resolve this grievance on mutually satisfactory terms without further hearing or litigation of any kind.\u201d Accordingly, OYA \u201cagrees to revoke the Letter of Dismissal and accepts a Letter of Resignation *** from [plaintiff], effective upon final signature of this document.\u201d Plaintiff, for his part, \u201cagrees not to appeal, grieve, or otherwise challenge the * * * Letter of Dismissal,\u201d and the union \u201cvoluntarily withdraws the * * * grievance with prejudice.\u201d The agreement contains a provision stating that it \u201cis the sole and entire agreement between the parties. This Agreement fully supersedes any and all written or oral contracts, agreements or understandings between the parties pertaining to the subjects discussed herein.\u201d Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201c[t]his Agreement constitutes the good faith resolution of all claims or potential claims [plaintiff] might have against the State or OYA and is not and shall not in any way be construed as an admission of any wrongful or discriminatory act or omission against [plaintiff], or that [plaintiff]\u2019s discipline was in any way wrongful, unlawful, or contrary to the terms of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Soon after the parties entered into the settlement agreement, plaintiff was charged with official misconduct, tampering with a witness, and fourth-degree assault based on events related to his termination. Around the same time, he obtained employment at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW). Once ODFW conducted a further background check, however, it terminated plaintiffs employment as a result of the pending criminal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Although OYA was aware that those criminal charges would likely be brought against plaintiff, it did not disclose that information to plaintiff during settlement negotiations. Plaintiff would not have entered into the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>if that information had been provided. OYA encouraged the prosecution, provided prosecutors and investigators access to OYA employees, and provided paid time off to employees who testified against plaintiff. After a jury trial, plaintiff was acquitted of all the criminal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In August 2011, plaintiff filed his complaint against OYA in which he sought damages for malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship, and violations of 42 USC section 1983, along with a declaration, \u201cpursuant to ORS 28.010-28.020,\u201d that \u201cthe release is invalid, and of no legal effect [.] \u201d OYA filed an answer to the complaint and set forth a number of affirmative defenses; among other things, OYA asserted that plaintiffs claims were barred as a result of the settlement agreement. In his reply, plaintiff denied OYA\u2019s affirmative defenses. Thereafter, OYA filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to ORCP 21B on the ground that plaintiffs claims were barred \u201cbecause he released all claims upon entering into a binding settlement agreement with [OYA] .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff responded that the settlement agreement had been breached by OYA or, alternatively, that execution of the agreement was based on a misrepresentation and, therefore, could not be enforced. He also contended that, by its terms, the agreement only settled his union grievance and did not apply to the claims at issue, and pointed out to the trial court that issues of fact cannot be tried on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The trial court held a hearing on the motion and later issued a letter opinion concluding that \u201cthe Settlement Agreement resolves all civil areas of dispute between OYA and the Plaintiff.\u201d Furthermore, the court observed that \u201cthe District Attorney was not a party to the Settlement Agreement\u201d and \u201cPlaintiff could not reasonably anticipate the Settlement Agreement prohibited the District Attorney from filing criminal charges against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Plaintiff objected, asserting that his claims for malicious prosecution and intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship related to \u201cconduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>facts that occurred after the execution of the settlement agreement\u201d and that the agreement did not \u201crelease future claims when the facts that g[a]ve rise to the claims had not yet occurred.\u201d Furthermore, plaintiff contended that the court could not dismiss his claim for declaratory relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201cPlaintiff objects to having his sixth claim for declaratory judgment against OYA dismissed because the court has not ruled on the declaratory judgment nor has Plaintiff been able to provide evidence at hearing. Pursuant to statute and case law, if jurisdiction to render declaratory judgment is properly invoked, the court has a duty to render judgment declaring right of the respective parties litigant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The court held an additional hearing, but thereafter entered an order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordering that all of plaintiffs claims be dismissed with prejudice. Thus, the court concluded (1) that the settlement agreement was enforceable as a matter of law despite plaintiffs assertions that it had been induced by misrepresentation and (2) as a matter of law, the release contained in the settlement agreement precluded all of plaintiffs claims. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of OYA and against plaintiff, dismissing with prejudice every claim set forth in plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings. He asserts, in part, that the motion on the pleadings should not have been granted because (1) his pleadings alleged that the settlement agreement is unenforceable as he was induced to execute the agreement by OYA\u2019s misrepresentations, (2) the settlement agreement did not release liability for future torts, and (3) the trial court could not dismiss his declaratory judgment claim. We agree with plaintiff on all of those points.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201cMotions for judgment on the pleadings are not generally well-regarded by the courts, because hasty or imprudent use of the procedure can conflict with the policy of ensuring litigants a full and fair opportunity to try their claim or defense.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Telephone &amp; Data Systems, Inc., </em>130 Or App 302, 309, 881 P2d 819, <em>adh\u2019d, to as modified on recons, </em>132 Or App 103, 888 P2d 16 (1994). Thus, \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>showing that the nonmoving party cannot prevail as a matter of law is the basis for a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d <em>Rowlett v. Fagan, </em>262 Or App 667, 679, 327 P3d 1, <em>rev allowed, </em>356 Or 516 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cJudgment on the pleadings, which is authorized by ORCP 21B, \u2018is only allowable when the pleadings [,] taken together!,] affirmatively show that plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Boyer, </em>344 Or at 586 (quoting <em>Salem Sand v. City of Salem, </em>260 Or 630, 636, 492 P2d 271 (1971)) (footnote omitted; brackets in <em>Boyer). </em>\u201cOn review of a judgment on the pleadings, an appellate court accepts as true all well-pleaded allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To \u201cobtain judgment on the pleadings, defendants ha[ve] the burden to establish that, assuming the truth of the allegations in the complaint, they were[,]\u201d nonetheless, entitled to prevail. <em>Rowlett, </em>262 Or App at 680 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">We begin by addressing plaintiffs contention that the court erred in dismissing his claims on the pleadings based on the settlement agreement because the agreement was procured by misrepresentation and was, therefore, unenforceable. \u201cReleases are a species of settlement agreement and, as such, are favored by the law.\u201d <em>Pioneer Resources, LLC v. D. R. Johnson Lumber Co., </em>187 Or App 341, 356, 68 P3d 233, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 16 (2003). \u201cNevertheless, under limited circumstances, enforcement of a release may be barred if the release was the product of misrepresentation or unconscionable conduct.\u201d <em>Id. \\ see also Whitehead v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., </em>194 Or 106, 131, 239 P2d 226 (1952) (if a plaintiff was induced to enter into a release \u201cby means of [the] defendant\u2019s fraud or material misrepresentation, the transaction is voidable\u201d). However, \u201cfraud or inequitable conduct with respect to a transaction that is the subject of a release does not bar enforcement of a release, so long as the release was not itself the product of fraud in the inducement.\u201d <em>Pioneer Resources, LLC, </em>187 Or App at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Here, in his complaint, plaintiff alleged that, as part of settlement discussions, OYA represented to him that he \u201cwould not have any further legal issues regarding the events leading to his termination.\u201d However, \u201c[w]ithin days of signing the release\u201d agreement, he was charged with crimes relating to the events leading to his termination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Furthermore, at the time of the settlement discussions, \u201cOYA was aware of the likelihood that Plaintiff would be charged with crimes relating to the events related to his termination, but failed to disclose that material fact to Plaintiff when Plaintiff was considering whether to settle his grievance.\u201d OYA also \u201cactively participated in the criminal prosecution of Plaintiff.\u201d That participation included \u201cencouraging the prosecution.\u201d According to plaintiff, if OYA had disclosed those facts during settlement discussions, he \u201cwould not have signed the release and dropped his grievance.\u201d Thus, plaintiff claims that the release itself was procured by fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">OYA asserts that, assuming it failed to inform plaintiff of the likelihood that criminal charges would be filed against him, that is not a basis on which the agreement would be unenforceable. In particular, assuming the truth of the allegations in the complaint, OYA nonetheless contends that the misrepresentation alleged could not render the agreement unenforceable. OYA points to a clause in the agreement that states \u201cneither the State of Oregon, OYA, nor any of their agents or attorneys has made any representations or promises concerning the terms or effects of this agreement other than those expressly set forth herein.\u201d In light of that provision, according to OYA, \u201cplaintiff cannot argue that defendants affirmatively made any promises to him relating to the conduct of the criminal investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We are unpersuaded by OYA\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, the disclaimer clause in the settlement agreement precludes plaintiff from going forward on his contention that the release should not be enforced because OYA\u2019s misrepresentations induced him to enter into the agreement. A contract may be avoided on the basis of fraudulent representations in the inducement despite a disclaimer clause where the fraud complained of vitiates the entire transaction, including the disclaimer clause. <em>Wilkinson v. Carpenter, </em>276 Or 311, 318-19, 554 P2d 512 (1976) (citing <em>Sharkey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Burlingame Co., </em>131 Or 185, 282 P 546 (1929)); <em>id. </em>at 319 (where a party waived reliance on any previous representations by contractual disclaimer, absent a showing of actual fraud, the party could not avoid the effect of the disclaimer); <em>see also Bodenhamer v. Patterson, </em>278 Or 367, 370-73, 563 P2d 1212 (1977) (a party who was induced to enter into a contract by a material misrepresentation on which the party relied may rescind the contract even though the contract contains a disclaimer clause expressly disclaiming reliance on \u201cany representations, warranties, guarantees or covenants\u201d by the other party). Again, plaintiff alleged that, although OYA knew that plaintiff would likely be criminally charged as a result of events leading to his termination and OYA, indeed, encouraged the prosecution, it both failed to disclose that information to plaintiff and affirmatively represented to him during settlement discussions that he would have no further legal issues with respect to those events. Thus, plaintiffs pleadings alleged that OYA fraudulently induced plaintiff to enter into the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">OYA, nonetheless, asserts that, even accepting plaintiffs allegations as true, any misrepresentation \u201cabout whether criminal charges would be filed was not a fact material to the resolution of the civil claims between these parties.\u201d In other words, OYA asserts that, even if there was a misrepresentation, that misrepresentation was not material and, therefore, as a matter of law, could not be a basis to rescind the settlement agreement. \u201cA misrepresentation is material where it would be likely to affect the conduct of a reasonable [person] with reference to a transaction with another person.\u201d <em>Millikin v. Green, </em>283 Or 283, 285, 583 P2d 548 (1978). Determinations of materiality are \u201cgenerally committed to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>OPERB v. Simat, Helliesen &amp; Eichner, </em>191 Or App 408, 436, 83 P3d 350 (2004), <em>rev withdrawn, </em>340 Or 411 (2006); <em>see Everts v. Holtmann, </em>64 Or App 145, 151-52, 667 P2d 1028, <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 120 (1983) (materiality may be resolved as a matter of law only if reasonable minds could not differ).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Here, plaintiff asserted that the misrepresentation was material. He alleged that he was assured that, after entering into the settlement with OYA, he would not have any further legal issues and, had he known that there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>likely be criminal charges as a result of events leading to his termination\u2014charges that he alleged were encouraged by OYA\u2014he would not have entered into the agreement. We cannot say that no reasonable person would consider the alleged misrepresentation to be material. Accordingly, we reject OYA\u2019s contention that, as a matter of law, the misrepresentation was not material and could not be a basis to conclude that the release is unenforceable. In light of those conclusions, the trial court erred in concluding on the pleadings that the release was enforceable, despite plaintiffs assertions that his execution of the settlement agreement was induced by material misrepresentations on the part of OYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Furthermore, the trial court was incorrect in concluding that, as a matter of law, the release contained in the settlement agreement precluded all of plaintiffs claims. Specifically, the court could not dismiss plaintiffs claims for malicious prosecution and intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship on the basis of the agreement. As noted, plaintiff asserts that his claims for malicious prosecution and intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship should not have been dismissed based on the settlement agreement \u201cbecause the conduct and facts alleged in Plaintiffs complaint occurred after the execution of the settlement agreement and were based on unrelated operative facts.\u201d According to plaintiff, although he \u201cagreed to drop his grievance and release OYA from liability related to his employment,\u201d he did not \u201crelease future tort liability for harm when the facts that give rise to the claims had not yet occurred.\u201d Furthermore, he asserts that a contractual provision in which one party \u201cagrees that another party will be exempted from future tort liability for harm caused intentionally or recklessly is void as against public policy.\u201d OYA responds that, as to the malicious prosecution and intentional interference claims, \u201cthe facts underlying the [criminal] charges were known to the parties prior to execution of the settlement agreement, and plaintiff released all \u2018potential claims\u2019 relating to them. Thus, the settlement agreement is a defense to those claims.\u201d Accordingly, the parties agree that the release of \u201cpotential claims\u201d in the agreement relates to liability for facts that existed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>time of the agreement and does not relate to future torts where the facts that give rise to the claims had not yet occurred. OYA asserts that the circumstances out of which these claims arise were known to the parties at the time of the agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Again, the settlement agreement states that plaintiff was dismissed and filed a grievance of that action and that the parties wish \u201cto resolve [plaintiffs] grievance on mutually satisfactory terms without further hearing or litigation of any kind.\u201d It further provides that the \u201cAgreement constitutes the good faith resolution of all claims or potential claims grievant <em>may have </em>against the State and OYA[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the agreement does not purport to (and the parties do not contend that it does) release OYA from liability for future intentional torts for which the underlying facts have not yet occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">As noted, to obtain judgment on the pleadings on those claims, OYA had the burden to establish that, assuming the truth of the allegations in the complaint, it was, nonetheless, entitled to prevail. However, the complaint alleges that, after the parties entered into the settlement agreement, criminal charges were brought against plaintiff and those charges were resolved in his favor, and also that, as a result of the charges, he was terminated from employment with ODFW.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The elements of a malicious prosecution claim are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c\u2018(1) the institution or continuation of the original criminal proceedings; (2) by or at the insistence of the defendant; (3) termination of such proceedings in the plaintiffs favor; (4) malice in instituting the proceedings; (5) lack of probable cause for the proceeding; and (6) injury or damage because of the prosecution.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\"><em>Blandino v. Fischel, </em>179 Or App 185, 190-91, 39 P3d 258, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 492 (2002) (quoting <em>Rose (Betty) v. Whitbeck, </em>277 Or 791, 795, 562 P2d 188, <em>modified on other grounds, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>278 Or 463, 564 P2d 671 (1977)). Thus, plaintiffs claim for malicious prosecution was necessarily predicated on the institution and resolution of criminal proceedings against him and, at the very least, there are factual issues regarding when that occurred. Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding, based on the pleadings, that, as a matter of law, the release contained in the settlement agreement precluded plaintiffs malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Similarly, an intentional interference claim consists of the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201c(1) the existence of a professional or business relationship (which could include, <em>e.g., </em>a contract or prospective economic advantage), (2) intentional interference with that relationship, (3) by a third party, (4) accomplished through improper means or for an improper purpose, (5) a causal effect between the interference and damage to the economic relationship, and (6) damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or 532, 535, 901 P2d 841 (1995). Plaintiff alleged here that OYA intentionally interfered with his employment (and prospective employment) by encouraging and participating in the criminal charges and their prosecution. As discussed above, according to the complaint, plaintiff was not criminally charged until after execution of the settlement agreement. Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that the release contained in the settlement agreement precluded plaintiffs intentional interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">For those reasons, we agree with plaintiff that the trial court incorrectly granted judgment on the pleadings based on the settlement agreement. Accepting the truth of the allegations in the complaint, OYA was not entitled to prevail as a matter of law on the issues of (1) the enforceability of the release or (2) whether the release precluded plaintiffs malicious prosecution and intentional interference claims. For those reasons, OYA was not entitled to judgment on the pleadings on any of plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Finally, we note, in any event, that the trial court erred when it dismissed the claim for declaratory relief. \u201cA claim for declaratory relief may be dismissed only if there is no justiciable controversy. If there is such a justiciable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>controversy, the court must dispose of the matter by a judgment containing a declaration as to the matter in dispute.\u201d <em>Advance Resorts of America, Inc. v. City of Wheeler, </em>141 Or App 166, 180, 917 P2d 61, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 322 (1996) (internal citations omitted) (addressing dismissal of claim for declaratory relief in summary judgment context). That may be done, where appropriate, in the context of granting a judgment on the pleadings, but the end result still must be a judgment declaring the rights of the parties, not a judgment of dismissal. Here, OYA did not (and does not) contend that the claim for declaratory relief did not involve a justiciable controversy. Instead, as noted, it asserts that the settlement agreement was valid and enforceable. However, that is not a basis on which the trial court could dismiss the claim for declaratory relief. Instead, because there was a justiciable controversy, the court could dispose of the claim for declaratory relief only by entering a judgment containing a declaration regarding the validity and enforceability of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Because Thompson was sued as \u201cthe superintendent of OYA MacLaren during all relevant times * * * [who was] acting within the course and scope of his employment and under color of law,\u201d we refer to him throughout this opinion, along with the Oregon Youth Authority, as OYA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Under ORCP 21 B, \u201c[a]fter the pleadings are closed, but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\"> Defendant does not claim that the release explicitly and unambiguously released fraud in the inducement claims. <em>See Lindgren v.
