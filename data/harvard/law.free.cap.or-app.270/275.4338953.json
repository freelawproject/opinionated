Defendant contends that the trial court erred because the state had to prove that he had compelled the victim to \u201cengage in conduct from which [the victim had] a legal right to abstain,\u201d ORS 163.275, and the evidence showed that the victim lacked the right to retain the keys that defendant had demanded the victim to give to him. We conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant and the victim had an equal right to possess and use the car to which the keys related and, in turn, an equal right to possess and use the keys. Hence, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA. Defendant raises additional assignments of error that we reject without written discussion. We accordingly affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Because we are reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of an MJOA, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>See, e.g., State v. Evans, </em>161 Or App 86, 89, 983 P2d 1055 (1999). Defendant and the victim had been romantically involved for 16 years. They lived with their two daughters, ages six and 12, and defendant\u2019s father. Defendant\u2019s father required extensive care, and the victim was his caretaker. Defendant and the victim shared a bedroom. The children had a separate room. Defendant, the victim, and defendant\u2019s father each owned cars, but only defendant\u2019s father\u2019s car was operable and insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Around 3:00 a.m. one morning, the couple\u2019s youngest child burst into defendant and the victim\u2019s bedroom crying loudly because she had had a nightmare. The child tried to enter her parents\u2019 bed. Defendant became very agitated and told the child to \u201cshut up\u201d or \u201cpay.\u201d While the victim was picking up the child to take her out of the room, defendant began punching the child in the head. As the victim carried the child to the children\u2019s room, defendant followed, yelling \u201cfight, fight, fight\u201d and hitting them both. Once in the children\u2019s room, the victim asked the oldest child to call 9-1-1. As the child did that, defendant told her that, if she called the police that there would be a \u201cgun battle\u201d and tried to grab the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Defendant left the room when the daughter completed the 9-1-1 call. The victim then took defendant\u2019s car keys to drive the children to safety in defendant\u2019s father\u2019s car. As the victim was on her way to the car, defendant told her to give him the keys or he \u201cwas going to go get them.\u201d The victim interpreted that to mean that defendant would hurt the children unless she gave him the keys, so she gave him the keys. Shortly thereafter, the victim found her keys and drove to safety in the father\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Defendant was charged with, among other things, coercion relating to his demand that the victim give him the car keys. Defendant\u2019s father testified at trial that the victim had his permission to use his car. Throughout their testimony, both defendant and the victim referred to one set of keys as defendant\u2019s keys and another set as the victim\u2019s keys. However, the victim also testified that it was her \u201cusual practice\u201d to use defendant\u2019s keys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>When the state rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the coercion charge that alleged that defendant had compelled the victim to give him the keys by threatening to harm their children. Defendant argued that the state had failed to show that the victim had the right to withhold the keys from defendant and, hence, had failed to prove that defendant had compelled the victim to engage in conduct from which the victim had a legal right to abstain, an essential element of coercion. The state responded that there was testimony that the parties in the house all used varying sets of keys and that the victim had defendant\u2019s father\u2019s permission to use the car at any time. The state reasoned that a jury could find from that evidence that defendant and the victim had an equal right to possess and use the keys to the father\u2019s car, and, hence, the victim had the right to refuse to give defendant the keys. The trial court agreed with the state and denied defendant\u2019s motion. After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s MJOA, defendant testified that the victim did not have to get his permission to use the father\u2019s car. The jury found defendant guilty of both counts of coercion, and defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The parties renew their arguments on the MJOA on appeal. As recited above, defendant\u2019s father had given defendant and the victim the right to use his car and the keys by which to do that. Further, the victim testified that it was her customary practice to use defendant\u2019s keys whenever she desired, which is consistent with her having an equal interest with defendant in the keys to the father\u2019s car. Defendant, in turn, testified that the victim did not need his permission to use the car. Based on that evidence, a reasonable factfinder could find that the victim and defendant had an equal right to use the car and the keys to the car. Hence, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant had compelled the victim to engage in conduct from which she had a legal right to abstain when he made her give him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the keys. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\"> ORS 163.275 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of coercion when the person compels or induces another person to engage in conduct from which the other person has a legal right to abstain, or to abstain from engaging in conduct in which the other person has a legal right to engage, by means of instilling in the other person a fear that, if the other person refrains from the conduct compelled * ** * the actor or another will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">\u201c(a) Unlawfully cause physical injury to some person [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> The victim testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cA.
