The court entered a judgment of conviction for the charges to which defendant pleaded and dismissed the final charge. For the felony conviction of unlawful use of a weapon, the court imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months\u2019 post-prison supervision (PPS). The court imposed PPS on the misdemeanor convictions and a no-contact order during the term of PPS on each of the three convictions. Defendant appealed that judgment of conviction, and we affirmed without opinion. <em>State v. Larrance, </em>249 Or App 334, 278 P3d 141 (2012). Defendant then filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in the trial court to modify the judgment under ORS 138.083 (l)(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that the terms in the judgment were erroneous because (1) the felony sentence exceeded the statutory maximum and was unlawfully indeterminate; (2) the court lacked authority to impose PPS on misdemeanor convictions; and (3) the court lacked authority to impose conditions of PPS on all convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the court modified the judgment to remove the PPS terms from the misdemeanor convictions, but left the other terms intact. Defendant now appeals the amended judgment, arguing that the court abused its discretion when it declined to correct all of the purportedly erroneous terms contained in the original judgment. The state argues that, regardless of whether the terms of the judgment are unlawful, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to correct the purported errors. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, vacate the amended judgment, and remand to the trial court for further consideration of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>We review a trial court\u2019s determination whether to correct a judgment of conviction under ORS 138.083 for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Engerseth, </em>255 Or App 765, 768 n 4, 299 P3d 567, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013). With that standard in mind, we turn to the facts, which are procedural and undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">As noted, defendant pleaded no contest to certain charges following plea negotiations. Defendant and the state did not memorialize the terms of the plea agreement before the sentencing hearing. Instead, the parties agreed to state the terms of the agreement on the record. While doing so, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cWe understand that [the charge of unlawful use of a weapon] is subjected to [ORS] 161.610; the 60 months. We\u2019re in agreement that [defendant] would be sentenced in accordance with that statute, which allows for good time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">After the parties stated the terms of the agreement, which included no discussion of PPS, the court accepted defendant\u2019s plea and imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months\u2019 PPS for the conviction of unlawful use of a weapon, which is a Class C felony with a maximum indeterminate sentence of 60 months. ORS 161.605(3). The court provided that defendant was eligible for \u201cearned good time credit\u201d on that sentence. The court also inserted a qualification into the judgment stating that \u201cpost [-] prison supervision plus time served, shall not exceed 60 months.\u201d When the court inserted that qualification into the judgment, the following exchanged occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So\u2014and what about post-prison supervision? Because I can\u2019t give a sentence that\u2019s longer\u2014 let me just ask: If it\u2019s 60 months, and I know that he\u2019s going to get some time off, he\u2019s going to get 20 percent off, I can say\u2014I can say 36 months, but post-prison supervision will be reduced by\u2014will be no longer than the time actually served, plus whatever it is not to exceed 60 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: That\u2019s fine with the State, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you agree with that, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Sir, I\u2019m just trying to make sure that I give you a lawful sentence.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: So that\u2019s my job, to make sure I don\u2019t exceed my authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">At that sentencing hearing, the court also imposed PPS on the misdemeanor convictions and an order to have no contact with the victim during the PPS term of each of the three convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">As noted, defendant appealed the judgment of conviction, and we affirmed without opinion. Next, defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in the trial court to modify the judgment under ORS 138.083. Defendant filed a concise memorandum in support of his motion clearly articulating his arguments. In support of his argument that the sentence for his conviction of unlawful use of a weapon\u201460 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months\u2019 PPS with a qualification varying the length of the sentence depending on any good time credit\u2014 was unlawfully excessive and indeterminate, defendant cited <em>State v. Stalder, </em>205 Or App 126, 133 P3d 920 (2006) (holding that a sentence is both unlawfully excessive and unlawfully indeterminate if the term of incarceration and term of PPS taken together are greater than the statutory maximum, regardless of whether the court inserts a qualification), and <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>236 Or App 248, 235 P3d 725 (2010) (same; reviewing for plain error). In support of his argument that the court lacked authority to impose PPS on misdemeanor convictions, defendant cited ORS 137.010(10) (authorizing a trial court to impose PPS on felony, not misdemeanor, convictions). And last, in support of his argument that the court lacked authority to impose conditions of PPS, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>defendant argued that the court has authority only to recommend a condition of PPS, not to order that condition, but he cited no authority for that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">During the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to modify the judgment, the state was present and defendant represented himself over the telephone. The court began the hearing by acknowledging that it lacked authority to impose PPS on misdemeanor convictions, and then asked defendant if there were other problems with the judgment. Defendant replied that there was a problem with the sentence for his conviction for unlawful use of a weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I\u2014my release date is June 30th of 2014, which is 48 months. I have 12 months\u2019 good time. And they\u2019re telling me that I have to do 36 months\u2019 post-prison supervision in one correspondence, and 12 months in another, which actually they can\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s an indeterminate sentence of 96 months, and the maximum is 60 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In response, the court read the sentence as it was recorded in the judgment of conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: It says, \u2018The defendant is sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections of the State of Oregon for the crime of unlawful use of a dangerous weapon with a firearm for a period of 60 months under ORS 161.610, with credit for time served. He\u2019s eligible for all programs, consistent with the Department of Corrections.\u2019 And he may release the defendant on post-prison supervision under, as long as it does not conflict with ORS 161.610. Okay. \u2018Defendant is eligible for good time credit as authorized by the Department of Corrections.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201cAnd then I say, \u2018The length of post-prison supervision shall be 36 months, but post-prison supervision plus time served shall not exceed 60 months.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if it could be any clearer than that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Defendant asked the court to further explain its position\u2014inquiring whether he would still be required to serve any term of PPS once he has completed 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, less 12 months\u2019 earned good time. The court indicated that he would, and defendant replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">\u201cDEFENDANT: So are they saying that my good time is just so I can get out and do more time, do my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>post-prison supervision, when it clearly states \u2018will not exceed 60 months?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, sir, your\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Or my good time doesn\u2019t count for anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Your good time does not count against your obligation for post-prison supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Well, there\u2019s\u2014oh, gosh. I got Layton and Hall\u2014Layton versus Hall and Stalder,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] several case laws that state the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you want to state those cases, sir, fine; I\u2019ll be happy to look at them. But in any event, what I\u2019m prepared to say and what I understood to say was you wanted [the imposition of PPS on defendant\u2019s two misdemeanor convictions] deleted. That\u2019s clear on the face of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201cIf you\u2014I think what I said [in the judgment] was pretty darn clear. And you can talk to the Parole Board or the corrections officials, but I think the sentence that I gave you was consistent with the plea negotiations, sir. And how it\u2019s calculated is between you and the Corrections Division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Before concluding, the court went over what had taken place during the hearing, and defendant again articulated his argument and attempted to bring the dispositive case law to the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, I\u2019ve done what you wanted on the majority of this. I\u2019m just trying to help you out, <em>make sure that it\u2019s complied with, </em>okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Yes. I guess I\u2019ll have to contact [defense counsel]. In my amended sentence that I sent you, <em>I listed the cases on </em>the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Right. I only had one circled at the top [referring to defendant\u2019s circuit case file numbers, not the case law cited by defendant in his memorandum], and that\u2019s the one they sent up, but I\u2019ll correct the other two misdemeanors as well, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Yeah. I understand that. I\u2019m still concerned about the gun charge sentencing and the determination of good time, where\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, even if you get good time, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to take that off the total 60 months that you\u2014between incarceration and post-prison supervision. But you can talk to the Corrections Division, you can talk to your attorney * * *. I\u2019m not precluding you from bringing that back to the Court, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Okay. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m just trying to help you out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: And we\u2019ll make sure that those are corrected. The State will do the felony, and we\u2019ll make sure the two misdemeanors are taken care of, and we\u2019ll send you that in Deer Ridge, sir, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Okay. Thank you, Judge * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. [Prosecutor], would you do that promptly, so that we can take care of this gentleman? And again, if you have any problems with the length or misunderstanding, please contact your attorney, * * *, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Okay. I\u2019ll do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sir, it\u2019s nice talking to you and I wish you well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">On appeal of the amended judgment, defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to correct defendant\u2019s felony sentence and the no-contact order for defendant\u2019s misdemeanor and felony convictions because the court explicitly stated that it intended to impose a lawful sentence, but declined to correct the unlawful sentence contained in the judgment when given the opportunity to do so. The state responds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion because a trial court has broad discretion whether to modify a judgment under ORS 138.083. Moreover, the state argues that allowing defendant to modify the sentence contained in the judgment\u2014 regardless of whether the judgment contains an unlawful sentence\u2014would allow defendant to abuse the negotiation process because, \u201cafter securing a favorable agreement from the state, the defendant could then change the terms of the agreement to something that the state may never have agreed with in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">ORS 138.083(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cThe sentencing court retains authority irrespective of any notice of appeal after entry of judgment of conviction to modify its judgment and sentence to correct any arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment. The court may correct the judgment either on the motion of one of the parties or on the court\u2019s own motion after written notice to all the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Under ORS 138.083, a trial court has broad discretion to modify or to not modify an erroneous term in a judgment. <em>State v. Harding, </em>225 Or App 386, 389, 202 P3d 181, <em>vacd on other grounds, </em>347 Or 368, 223 P3d 1029 (2009) (\u201c[E]ven assuming that [a sentencing term] constitutes an erroneous term, ORS 138.083 would not require the court to correct such an error, given the discretionary nature of the trial court\u2019s error-modification authority under that statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion under ORS 138.083, \u201cwe will reverse only if a trial court\u2019s discretionary determination is not a legally permissible one.\u201d <em>State v. Lewallen, </em>262 Or App 51, 56, 324 P3d 530, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 880 (2014); <em>see also State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (abuse of discretion means that the court\u2019s action or decision was not \u201cwithin the range of legally correct discretionary choices\u201d and did not result in a \u201cpermissible, legally correct outcome\u201d); <em>State v. G. N., </em>230 Or App 249, 255, 215 P3d 902 (2009) (one test for evaluating whether a court has abused its discretion is whether the decision was clearly against reason and evidence). Although a court\u2019s decision not to modify a judgment is not appealable, a judgment amended under ORS 138.083 that imposes a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>is appealable. <em>Harding, </em>225 Or App at 391. The issue on appeal of such a judgment is whether the court erred in the manner in which it amended the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 388; <em>accord Engerseth, </em>255 Or App at 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Consequently, the issue presented by defendant\u2019s appeal of his amended judgment is whether the court abused its discretion when it corrected some, but not all, of the purported errors identified by defendant in his motion to modify the judgment. Three facts are of particular significance to our answer to that question in this case. First, the court stated that it intended to comply with the sentencing rules and statutes, both when it initially crafted defendant\u2019s sentence and when it declined to modify defendant\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the court misstated the law at sentencing and in the course of the hearing to modify the judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Third, when defendant corrected the court\u2019s misstatement of the law and directed the court to the dispositive cases, the court acknowledged defendant\u2019s reference, and even stated that it would examine those authorities, but then decided the matter without doing so because it concluded that the judgment was not erroneous under its incorrect view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cAlthough a trial court\u2019s decision whether to modify a judgment under ORS 138.083 is discretionary, <em>Lewallen, </em>262 Or App at 56-57, the exercise of discretion based on a mistaken premise of law can be a failure to properly exercise discretion. <em>State v. Pemberton, </em>226 Or App 285, 289, 203 P3d 326 (2009); <em>see also State v. Romero (A138124), </em>236 Or App 640, 643-44, 237 P3d 894 (2010) (\u201cWhere * * * a trial court\u2019s purported exercise of discretion flows from a mistaken legal premise, its decision does not fall within the range of legally correct choices and does not produce a permissible, legally correct outcome.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Moreover, the state\u2019s policy concern\u2014that a defendant might try to game the system by soliciting an unlawful sentence from the state and then later compelling the court to modify the judgment, thereby securing a more favorable agreement than the state would have offered\u2014is not present here. As noted, defendant and the state did not memorialize the plea agreement before the sentencing hearing, but rather agreed to read the terms into the record. While stating the terms of the agreement for the record, defendant emphasized that the parties had agreed that defendant\u2019s sentence for unlawful use of a weapon would be consistent with the statutory sentencing scheme in terms of both eligibility for good time and the 60-month maximum sentence. That emphasis makes clear that the state\u2019s policy concern is not implicated by these facts. And in a case in which such a concern is implicated by the facts, those facts could be used by the trial court to inform its decision whether to exercise its discretion to modify the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In sum, a court\u2019s decision to modify or not to modify a term contained in a judgment is \u201chighly discretionary.\u201d <em>Harding, </em>225 Or App at 391; <em>accord Lewallen, </em>262 Or App at 57. Moreover, a court\u2019s decision to not modify a judgment under ORS 138.083 is not appealable. <em>Harding, </em>225 Or App at 392. However, when a court amends a judgment, it must not do so in a manner that abuses its discretion. <em>Engerseth, </em>255 Or App at 768 n 4. Here, because the trial court intended to give a lawful sentence, but misapprehended the law and ultimately decided the matter in reliance on that erroneous view of the law, the court abused its discretion. Accordingly, we vacate the amended judgment and remand to the trial court for further consideration of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\"> We set out the text of ORS 138.083 (l)(a) below. 270 Or App at 438.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> In defendant\u2019s appeal of his judgment of conviction, defendant did not raise the issue that his felony sentence was unlawfully excessive or indeterminate.
