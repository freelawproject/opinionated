The dispute turns on the intersection between ORS 278.215(2), which obligates Clackamas County as a self-insured public body to provide the UM/UIM coverage \u201crequired under ORS 742.500 to 742.504,\u201d and ORS 742.502(2), which requires every \u201cmotor vehicle bodily injury liability policy\u201d to provide UM/UIM coverage to the \u201csame limits\u201d as the liability coverage absent a signed, written election of lower limits that contains specific statutory formalities. The county, which admittedly set its limits for motor vehicle liability coverage at $500,000, contends that some of the election formalities are inapplicable to a self-insured public body and that it validly elected to limit its UM/UIM coverage to only $25,000 through an unsigned electronic document created by the county\u2019s risk manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which the trial court resolved by granting the county\u2019s motion and denying plaintiffs motion. On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to both rulings. We hold that the county\u2019s admitted failure to comply with elements that the legislature has unambiguously required for all valid elections of lower UM/UIM coverage limits entitles plaintiff to the declaration he seeks. Accordingly, we reverse both the grant of summary judgment to the county and the denial of summary judgment to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine disputes of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C. When reviewing rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, \u201c[w]e review the record for each motion in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>light most favorable to the party opposing it to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See Dial Temporary Help Service v. DLF Int'l Seeds, </em>252 Or App 376, 377 n 1, 287 P3d 1202 (2012), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>255 Or App 609, 298 P3d 1234 (2013). Because we ultimately conclude that plaintiff was entitled to prevail on his motion for summary judgment, we describe the evidence in the light most favorable to the county, which opposed plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In June 2010, while on duty as a Clackamas County deputy sheriff, plaintiff was injured in a collision between the county vehicle he was driving and a car driven by Evan Buell. Buell had purchased a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance providing coverage up to only $25,000. The county was self-insured for $500,000 in motor vehicle liability insurance and self-insured for UM/UIM coverage, the limit of which is in dispute. Plaintiff sued Buell for negligence and ultimately collected through settlement the $25,000 limits of Buell\u2019s liability insurance. Plaintiffs amended complaint also included a claim against Clackamas County, seeking a declaration that the county had $500,000 in UM/UIM coverage available to compensate plaintiff for damages in excess of those covered by Buell\u2019s liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In opposing plaintiffs claim, the county relied on a document created by its Risk Manager, Dwayne Kroening, and maintained on his computer. The electronic document contains the heading \u201cUNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE,\u201d below which appears a list of terms of that coverage, including the disputed term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201cOur current UM limit is $25,000 per claimant for bodily-injury and $50,000 per accident for all claimants combined. Our UM benefits increase automatically to any larger amounts required by state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Kroening testified that he created the document to be an \u201cuninsured motorist policy,\u201d and that it became effective in October 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The document is not signed, and the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>contains no evidence that a printed version existed prior to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The parties\u2019 dispute turns on whether the Kroening document serves as a valid election to limit the county\u2019s self-insured UM/UIM coverage to $25,000. Plaintiff argues that he was entitled to summary judgment because the legislature intended self-insured public bodies to fully satisfy the formal election requirements of ORS 742.502(2). As with all matters of statutory construction, we apply the methodology articulated in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Under that methodology, our first step is examination of the text and context of the pertinent statutes, followed by consideration of the legislative history to the extent it \u201cappears useful to the court\u2019s analysis.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">ORS 278.215(2) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\u201cAny local public body, as defined in ORS 30.260, which establishes a self-insurance program under ORS 30.282 for or on account of the operation of motor vehicles within the local public body\u2019s control, <em>shall provide the uninsured motorist coverage required under ORS 742.500 to 742.504 </em>\u2021 H; * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">(Emphasis added.) ORS 742.500 to 742.504, in turn, describe the UM/UIM coverage that Oregon requires in \u201c [e] very motor vehicle liability policy.\u201d ORS 742.502(1). The Supreme Court has held that a self-insured entity is an \u201cinsurer\u201d for purposes of the statutory obligations regarding UM/UIM coverage and that the public body\u2019s self-insured UM/UIM coverage is a \u201cpolicy of insurance.\u201d <em>Haynes v. Tri-County Metro., </em>337 Or 659, 667, 103 P3d 101 (2004). UM/UIM coverage, in general terms, fills the gap when an insured suffers \u201cdamages for bodily injury or death\u201d in a motor vehicle accident caused by a negligent driver who is either uninsured or underinsured (meaning covered by a liability policy \u201cthat provides recovery in an amount that is less than\u201d the insured\u2019s UM/UIM coverage). ORS 742.500(1); ORS 742.502(2)(a); <em>Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Perkins, </em>344 Or 196, 218, 179 P3d 633, <em>modified on recons, </em>345 Or 373, 195 P3d 59 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">In particular, ORS 742.502 specifies that UM/UIM coverage \u201cshall have the same limits for uninsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>coverage as for bodily injury liability coverage unless a named insured in writing elects lower limits.\u201d ORS 742.502(2)(a). It also specifies that, \u201c [i] f a named insured elects lower limits, the named insured shall sign a statement electing lower limits within 60 days of the time the named insured makes the election.\u201d ORS 742.502(2)(b). Moreover, ORS 742.502(2)(b) identifies several elements that \u201cshall\u201d be part of the written election, including that \u201c[t]he statement shall acknowledge that a named insured was offered uninsured motorist coverage with the limits equal to those for bodily injury liability\u201d and \u201cshall state the price for coverage with limits equal to the named insured\u2019s bodily injury liability limits and the price for coverage with the lower limits requested by the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">There is no dispute that Clackamas County is a local public body that has established a \u201cself-insurance program\u201d subject to ORS 278.215(2). There is also no dispute that the document created by Kroening lacks a signature of the \u201cinsured\u201d and other elements that ORS 742.502(2)(b) specifies \u201cshall\u201d be included in an election of UIM limits lower than liability limits. According to plaintiff, those omissions mean that the county has not validly elected to provide self-insured UM/UIM coverage in an amount lower than its liability coverage and that plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to a declaration that $500,000 of UM/UIM coverage is available to plaintiff. The county contends, however, that most of the formalities of ORS 742.502(2)(b) do not apply in the context of self-insured UM/UIM coverage and that the Kroening document complies with ORS 742.502(2) \u201cby complying with all of the elements applicable to a self-insurer\u2014 it elected the lower limits in writing and included an explanation of UM/UIM coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Nothing in the statutory framework discussed above permits us to read into the statutes the county\u2019s proposed exception. First, the election requirement of ORS 742.502(2) is described in mandatory terms: The policy <em>\u201cshall have </em>the same limits for uninsured motorist coverage *** <em>unless </em>a named insured in writing elects lower limits\u201d; \u201c[i]f a named insured elects lower limits, [then] the named insured <em>shall </em>sign a statement\u201d that <em>\u201cshall </em>acknowledge\u201d an offer of UM/UIM coverage with limits equal to liability coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>and <em>\u201cshall </em>state the price\u201d differences between electing or not electing lower limits of UM/UIM coverage. ORS 742.502(2)(b) (emphases added); <em>see Dika v. Dept. of Ins. &amp; Finance, </em>312 Or 106, 109, 817 P2d 287 (1991) (\u201cTo construe the word \u2018shall\u2019 as anything other than mandatory would thwart the intention of the legislature!.]\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2085 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cshall,\u201d in part, as \u201cused in laws, regulations, or directives to express what is mandatory\u201d); Legislative Administration Committee, <em>Form and Style Manual for Legislative Measures </em>10 (2014) (\u201cTo impose an obligation to act, use \u2018shall.\u2019\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the statutory language demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent that the formalities are a condition of a valid election: \u201cUnless\u201d the named insured signs a written election containing the required formalities, then the \u201cpolicy shall have the same limits for uninsured motorist coverage as for bodily injury liability coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The text of ORS 278.215(2) describes the obligation of a self-insured local public body in the same mandatory language: The public body <em>\u201cshall </em>provide the uninsured motorist coverage required under ORS 742.500 to 742.504 * * Thus, as written, ORS 278.215 leaves no room for a distinction between how the requirements of ORS 742.502(2) apply to employers whose vehicles are covered by a private policy of motor vehicle insurance and how those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>requirements apply to public employers that have elected to create a policy of self-insurance for their vehicles. Indeed, the legislative history of ORS 278.215 indicates that the provision \u201cwas enacted to place employees of public bodies in a similar posture\u201d to employees of private sector employers, who are required to maintain policies of UM/UIM coverage that included coverage for their employees when using their vehicles. <em>City of Salem v. Salisbury, </em>168 Or App 14, 27, 5 P3d 1131 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 633 (2001). As is true for private sector insurance policies, UM/UIM coverage in an amount lower than liability limits\u2014unless there is a valid election\u2014is not the coverage \u201crequired under ORS 742.500 to ORS 742.504.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The county, nevertheless, argues that a \u201cstrict application\u201d of the statutory language creates an \u201cabsurd result,\u201d and it invites this court to \u201cavoid an interpretation of the statute which leads to an absurd result.\u201d Even if we agreed with the claim of absurd result, we cannot accept the invitation to ignore the clear statutory language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cWhen the legislative intent is clear from an inquiry into text and context, or from resort to legislative history, * * * it would be inappropriate to apply the absurd-result maxim. If we were to do so, we would be rewriting a clear statute based solely on our conjecture that the legislature could not have intended a particular result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>State v. Vasquez-Rubio, </em>323 Or 275, 283, 917 P2d 494 (1996); <em>see also Young v. State of Oregon, </em>161 Or App 32, 38, 983 P2d 1044, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 447 (1999) (The \u201cabsurd result\u201d doctrine is a maxim of construction that is limited to cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>in which the statute remains ambiguous after examination of text, context, and legislative history.) The legislature\u2019s intent here is clear: Regardless of whether a local public body purchases a motor vehicle insurance policy or creates a policy of self-insurance, the public body\u2019s UM/UIM coverage \u201cshall have the same limits\u201d as the limits of the bodily injury liability coverage \u201cunless\u201d the public body signs a written statement of election containing the formalities required by ORS 742.502(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Applying the clear legislative intent to the undisputed facts, as a matter of law the county failed to make a valid election of UM/UIM coverage in an amount less than $500,000, so\u2014as the Kroening document recognizes\u2014 the county\u2019s UM/UIM coverage \u201cincrease [s] automatically to [the] larger amounts required by state law.\u201d <em>See also American Economy Ins. Co. v. Canamore, </em>114 Or App 348, 352, 834 P2d 542, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 727 (1992) (policy that did not include the UIM <em>coverage </em>required by ORS 742.502 would be reformed to include the required coverage). Accordingly, we reverse both the grant of the county\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the denial of plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> We refer to the county\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage as UM/UIM because all uninsured motorist coverage includes \u201cunderinsurance coverage for bodily injury or death caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle with motor vehicle liability insurance that provides recovery in an amount that is less than the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d ORS 742.502(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\"> We resolve the dispute in a way that makes immaterial any factual dispute about when and why Kroening created the document, or the extent to which he had authority to set UM/UIM coverage limits for the county.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\"> Although we recognize that the Supreme Court has kept open the possibility that \u201cshall\u201d could be interpreted to mean \u201cmay,\u201d nothing in the context of ORS 742.502 permits an interpretation that the legislature was merely suggesting how UM/UIM coverage limits <em>could </em>be set. <em>See Doyle v. City of Medford, </em>347 Or 564, 570-71, 227 P3d 683 (2010) (qualifying that there can be \u201csituations in which the context demonstrates that, although the legislature used the word \u2018shall,\u2019 it intended to create a permissive statute\u201d but concluding that for the statute under consideration \u201ccontext demonstrates that the legislature intended \u2018shall\u2019 to retain its ordinary meaning\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\"> The county urges us to follow <em>Thompson v. Estate of Adrian L. Pannell, </em>176 Or App 90, 29 P3d 1184 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 655 (2002), in which we held that <em>former </em>ORS 806.130, <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 287, \u00a7 1\u2014a different statute addressing the obligation of self-insured entities to provide uninsured motorist coverage\u2014did not require UM/UIM coverage greater than $25,000. But the language of <em>former </em>ORS 806,130 differed significantly from the language of ORS 278.215(2), and <em>Thompson </em>specifically emphasizes that ORS 278.215(2) was inapplicable under the facts of that case. 176 Or App at 98 n 6. Here, it is undisputed that plaintiff was driving a \u201cmotor vehicle [] within the local public body\u2019s control\u201d and that the coverage requirements of ORS 278.215(2) apply to that vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> It is not clear that it is \u201cabsurd\u201d to apply the election criteria to a public body. Although the county\u2019s argument presumes that terms like \u201csign,\u201d \u201coffer,\u201d and \u201cprice\u201d cannot be applied to a self-insured public body, none of those terms has precise definitions within the Insurance Code. <em>See </em>ORS 731.052 - 731.146. The election requirements serve to demonstrate a deliberate and informed choice to reject UM/UIM limits equal to liability limits, and there is no reason to assume that the legislature framed those requirements in terms that preclude application to a self-insured public body.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">Moreover, it is possible the county assigns the wrong significance to the \u201cabsurdity\u201d it proposes. If the legislature has created an election process that cannot be applied to public bodies, that might suggest that the legislature did not intend to allow public bodies to elect lower limits.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
