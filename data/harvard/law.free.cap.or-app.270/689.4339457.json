In its 2012 order, the board construed petitioner\u2019s request for periodic review as a request to reopen and reconsider a previous decision of the board, and it denied that request. In the alternative, the board construed petitioner\u2019s request as a new request for an early parole consideration hearing and denied that request also. In his request for judicial review, petitioner challenges the board\u2019s denial of his request for periodic review. He does not challenge the board\u2019s denial of his request for an early parole consideration hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The board contends that petitioner\u2019s request for judicial review is improper because the board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request to reopen and reconsider a previous board action was not a \u201cfinal order\u201d that is subject to judicial review under ORS 144.335(1). Petitioner disagrees with the board\u2019s characterization of his request; he contends that he did not ask the board to reopen and reconsider any previous decision, but, rather, sought a different form of relief. As explained below, we agree with the board\u2019s view of the record in this case and conclude that petitioner\u2019s request to the board was properly understood as a request for reconsideration, even if petitioner did not label it as such. For that reason, we conclude that the board\u2019s 2012 order was not a final order subject to judicial review, that we therefore lack jurisdiction, and that the request for judicial review must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Petitioner is serving sentences totaling 105 years for violent crimes that he committed in 1983. At his sentencing in 1985, petitioner was designated a dangerous offender under ORS 161.725 (1983). At a 1986 prison-term hearing, the board denied parole and set petitioner\u2019s parole date for February 24, 2090.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In 2008, petitioner sent a letter to the board that stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">\u201cI am writing to request that your office schedule me for a parole consideration hearing in relation to the dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>offender sentences that I am currently serving. Please schedule me for a Parole consideration hearing concerning the dangerous offender sentences I received in Multnomah County Circuit Court Case NO. C85-03-31060 as soon as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">A week later, the board replied to petitioner\u2019s request in Board Action Form (BAF) 3, which stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cBoard notes letter from inmate indicating that he feels that he is no longer a danger to the community and requesting an Early Parole Consideration hearing. [Petitioner\u2019s] 1 page letter dated January 9, 2008, was insufficient to establish reasonable cause for the Board to believe that he is no longer dangerous or that necessary supervision and treatment are available. Early Parole Consideration hearing request denied. Parole Consideration hearing should remain 2/24/2090.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Petitioner requested administrative review of BAF 3. Petitioner\u2019s request is not in the record. In Administrative Review Response (ARR) 1, the board responded, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cIn your administrative review request, you assert that the Board misunderstood the request that was the subject of BAF #3, and that you were asking for a parole consideration hearing that you allege the Board is required to hold under ORS 144.228 [(l)](b),[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and OAR 255-40-005(4) (1982). The Board does not find your claim that the Board misconstrued your letter persuasive. The Board finds that it properly construed the request as a request for an early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>parole consideration hearing because 2008 is well short of 2090.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">\u201cNext, you appear to allege that the Board must review your case every two years from the inception of your incarceration. As an initial matter, the Board notes that section 4 of OAR 255-40-005, which you cite, was effective February 1,1979, and was repealed effective May 19, 1982, and therefore that rule is not applicable to your case and will not be discussed here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201cNext, the Board directs your attention to the statute you cite, ORS 144.228 [(l)](b) (1981), which contrary to your apparent allegation, requires only that the Board set a date for a parole consideration hearing, at \u2018the earliest time the prisoner is eligible for parole under the Board\u2019s rules.\u2019 You have failed to establish that the two-year review period provided for under ORS 144.228 (1981) begins now, or began in the past, considering that you received no votes to override your minimum term of 105 years. At the very least, your minimum sentences were upheld and 2090 is the earliest you are eligible for a parole consideration hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cRELIEF DENIED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Petitioner sought review of the board\u2019s order in ARR 1 but later dismissed that request for judicial review (case A141840).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">On June 15, 2011, petitioner sent the following request to the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u201cI wish to make a request to the Parole Board for a reconsider hearing on my sentencing structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">\u201cIt has been more than 25 years since my last psychological evaluation, and I believe that if one were given to me now, the Parole Board would find that I have no desire to be a destructive person in any manner; whether criminally, or mentally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">\u00abHi Hi Hi H&lt; Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">\u201cSince 1986, the Parole Board has failed to give, or even offer, a psychological evaluation to see if I still have a propensity towards criminal activity; to see if the antipersonality disorder is in remission. And so the Parole Board has failed to schedule reviews as stipulated under Chapter 255,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Division 38\u2014BOARD OF PAROLE: under OAR 255-38-005(1); which says in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u2018\u201cIf the condition (e.g., psychiatric or psychological diagnosis of a present severe emotional disturbance, such as a severe personality disorder indicating a propensity towards criminal activity) is still present, reviews will be scheduled at least every two (2) years thereafter.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cAnd under Division 40 \u2018Reviews; Scheduling Personal Reviews (August 1982)\u2019, OAR 255-40-005 (1) says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201c\u2018Periodic reviews\u2019 shall, be conducted after the prisoner has served five (5) years of his prison term and every three (3) years thereafter, starting with the date the prisoner\u2019s sentence begins to run except Dangerous Offenders, which have periodic reviews every two (2) years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201c*** The Parole Board in 1986 *** recognized these OARs and did set a reschedule hearing date at five \u00cd5) years. The review hearing was set for April 1990. and this information is on the \u2018Oregon Board of Parole- board action form\u2019 dated April 9th 1986.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">(Underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The board responded to petitioner\u2019s 2011 request in ARR 2, which stated, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">\u201cRESPONSE TO REQUEST TO REOPEN: In your letter you ask that the Board reopen and reconsider a decision made in a past Board order. Generously read, you appear to allege that the Board has failed to take into account your institutional programming, and has failed to obtain a psychological evaluation to determine if you continue to remain a danger. The Board has reviewed and fully evaluated your request. The arguments you have provided, however, do not warrant reopening and reconsidering your case. Interests of administrative efficiency and finality of Board orders militate against reopening and reconsidering a final Board order based on issues that could have been raised through established procedures for administrative review. You could have raised your arguments in your timely request for administrative review of BAF #3, to which you received a response in Administrative Review Response #1, dated February 5, 2009. Therefore, based on the information that you have provided the Board in your request, the Board denies your request to reopen and reconsider its previous orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201cRESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR EARLY PAROLE CONSIDERATION: To the extent that your letter intends to ask for an early parole consideration hearing, the Board concludes that the information you provided was insufficient to establish reasonable cause to believe that you are no longer dangerous, or that necessary supervision and treatment are available in the community. As a result of this finding, the Board declines to hold an early parole consideration hearing. The Board notes that you have previously raised the claim that the Board must review your case every two years from the inception of your incarceration, and that you received a response in ARR #1, for which you received review in the Court of Appeals, case number A141840. Therefore, the Board declines to consider this issue further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">\u201cREQUEST TO REOPEN AND RECONSIDER DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201cREQUEST FOR EARLY PAROLE CONSIDERATION HEARING DENIED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Petitioner seeks review of the board\u2019s decision in ARR 2, arguing that the board erred when it declined to grant petitioner a periodic review hearing. Petitioner contends that he is entitled to periodic review hearings every three years pursuant to OAR 255-40-005(1), which provides, in part, that \u201c [p] eriodic reviews shall be conducted after the prisoner has served five years of his prison term and every three years thereafter, starting with the date the prisoner\u2019s sentence begins to run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The board moved to dismiss the petition for judicial review on the ground that petitioner is not contesting a \u201cfinal order\u201d of the board. <em>See </em>ORS 144.335 (\u201cA person over whom the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision exercises its jurisdiction may seek judicial review of a final order of the board[.]\u201d). The board argued that petitioner\u2019s 2011 request to the board is properly understood as a request to reopen and reconsider a previous decision, and that the board\u2019s denial of that request in ARR 2 was not a final order in light of <em>Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 690, 159 P3d 1151 (2007) (holding that a denial of review or reconsideration that did not \u201creexamine the prior order * * * was not a final order subject to judicial review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The Appellate Commissioner denied the board\u2019s motion to dismiss. The commissioner reasoned that petitioner \u201cis not seeking to challenge any decision made in a previous [b]oard order; rather, [petitioner] seeks to challenge the [b]oard\u2019s recent decision that petitioner is not entitled to periodic review hearings.\u201d The commissioner concluded that the board \u201chas not shown that the issue of whether petitioner is entitled to periodic review hearings and, if so, how often, was decided by the [b]oard in its prior order or that petitioner could have raised those issues for decision by the [b]oard at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">In its briefing and at oral argument, the board reiterated its argument that petitioner\u2019s claim is not subject to judicial review because \u201cpetitioner\u2019s argument * * * is encompassed within the issues that the board chose not to address by declining to reopen and reconsider a previous decision.\u201d The board reasons that, in 2008, petitioner requested periodic review and made that same request in 2011, albeit under a different subsection of the applicable rule; thus, the board in ARR 2 correctly understood petitioner\u2019s 2011 request to be seeking reconsideration of the board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s 2008 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Petitioner contends that his request for review in 2011 was \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from the one he made in 2008 for the following reasons: (1) In 2008, petitioner relied on \u201csubsection (4) of OAR 255-40-005\u201d and ORS 144.228, whereas he \u201cdoes not rely\u201d on those provisions now; (2) and in 2011, he argued that he is entitled to \u201cperiodic review every <em>three </em>years, as opposed to every <em>two </em>years.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Petitioner contends that the board has \u201cmisconstrued his argument\u201d because the board has never considered whether petitioner is entitled to periodic reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Petitioner does not dispute that <em>Mastriano </em>bars review if the board\u2019s decision in ARR 2 is properly characterized as a denial of a request to reopen and reconsider a previous decision. Thus, resolution of this case turns on that question. If, in fact, the board in ARR 2 correctly understood petitioner to be raising an issue that was before the board in ARR 1, then the board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request in ARR 2 was not a final order and is not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>As we understand it, petitioner\u2019s theory is that his 2008 request was for something other than periodic review\u2014 specifically, a \u201cparole consideration hearing\u201d\u2014and, therefore, the board\u2019s denial of that request was not a decision regarding periodic review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is true that petitioner\u2019s initial 2008 request asked for a \u201cparole consideration hearing,\u201d and the board\u2019s response in BAF 3 construed petitioner\u2019s request as one for an \u201cearly parole consideration hearing.\u201d The board denied that request. In his request for administrative review of that denial, however (which is not contained in the record), petitioner <em>also </em>apparently cited OAR 255-40-005(4) (1982). In response, the board in ARR 1 wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">\u201cNext, you appear to allege that the Board must review your case every two years from the inception of your incarceration. As an initial matter, the Board notes that section 4 of OAR 255-40-005, which you cite, was effective February 1,1979, and was repealed effective May 19,1982, and therefore that rule is not applicable to your case and will not be discussed here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">As we now explain, in light of that paragraph, we conclude that petitioner did present the issue of periodic review to the board in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>As it happens, contrary to the board\u2019s citation in ARR 1, OAR 255-40-005 <em>did not contain </em>a subsection (4) at any time in 1982. In order to make sense of the arguments in this case, therefore, some further examination of the regulatory scheme is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">OAR 255-40-005 was amended effective May 19, 1982. Before that date, the rule provided, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201c(1) Periodic reviews shall be conducted after the prisoner has served five years of his prison term and every three years thereafter, starting with the date the prisoner\u2019s sentence begins to run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201c(a) Dangerous offenders sentenced under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 shall be seen every two years as required by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201c(b) Prisoners convicted of murder shall be seen as required by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201c(2) Reviews that have been scheduled prior to January 26, 1977 shall be conducted as scheduled. Reviews scheduled subsequent to January 26, 1977 shall be rescheduled to comply with this rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Again, the rule did not contain a subsection (4), contrary to the board\u2019s citation in ARR 1 (and, apparently, petitioner\u2019s citation in his request for review that precipitated ARR 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Effective May 19, 1982, the rule was amended to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">\u201c(1) Periodic reviews shall be conducted after the prisoner has served five years of his prison term and every three years thereafter, starting with the date the prisoner\u2019s sentence begins to run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201c(2) Prisoners convicted of murder shall be seen as required by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">Thus, before May 19,1982, the general rule in OAR 255-40-005 provided for periodic reviews every three years, but subsection (l)(a) set forth a different rule for dangerous offenders (every two years). Effective May 19, 1982, the rule was amended to eliminate the two-year review provision for dangerous offenders. Like the earlier version of the rule, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>post-May 19, 1982, version of the rule contained no subsection (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">A subsection (4) <em>did </em>exist in a closely related rule, however: OAR 255-38-005. As explained below, that provision turns out to be directly applicable to the issues in this case. Accordingly, we presume that petitioner\u2019s 2008 request and the board\u2019s response in ARR 1 inadvertently cited a nonexistent rule, OAR 255-40-005(4), when they intended to cite OAR 255-38-005(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">OAR 255-38-005(4) was also amended on May 19, 1982. Before that date, the rule provided, in relevant part, that \u201c[p]eriodic reviews shall be given [to] dangerous offenders pursuant to rule 255-40-005.\u201d Effective May 19, 1982, subsection (4) was amended to eliminate any reference to periodic review for dangerous offenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201c[A] prisoner sentenced as a dangerous offender under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 may, if the prisoner believes that he is no longer dangerous, request a parole consideration hearing. Should the Board find based upon the request that there is a reasonable cause to believe the dangerous condition is in remission, the Board shall order a parole consideration hearing pursuant to the above procedures. Applications received more often than every two years will carry a greater burden in establishing that the request is reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Read together, before May 19, 1982, the two rules established a mechanism whereby dangerous offenders received periodic reviews every two years. OAR 255-38-005(4), a rule generally applicable to dangerous offenders, provided that dangerous offenders were to receive periodic reviews in accordance with OAR 255-40-005, a rule generally applicable to periodic reviews. Effective May 19, 1982, periodic reviews for dangerous offenders were abolished. Instead, with the amendment to OAR 255-38-005(4), dangerous offenders were provided an opportunity to request parole consideration hearings, which the board was required to grant only under certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">With this historical context in mind, we return to petitioner\u2019s 2008 request and the board\u2019s response in ARR 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The board\u2019s response reflects that the board had understood petitioner to allege an entitlement to administrative review every two years under \u201csection 4\u201d of OAR 255-40-005. No such \u201csection 4\u201d existed. But, as noted above, petitioner could plausibly have located an entitlement to two-year review in two other rules: subsection (l)(a) of the pre-May 19, 1982, version of OAR 255-40-005, and subsection (4) of the pre-May 19, 1982, version of OAR 255-38-005. A reasonable inference from the record is that either petitioner, or the board, or both, made a typographical error in citing OAR 255-40-005(4), rather than those other two provisions. That inference is further supported by the board\u2019s reasoning in denying petitioner\u2019s request. The board noted that \u201csection 4 of OAR 255-40-005, which you cite, was effective February 1, 1979, and was repealed effective May 19, 1982, and therefore that rule is not applicable to your case.\u201d Again, the board\u2019s reference to \u201csection 4 of OAR 255-40-005\u201d was incorrect, but the board correctly identified the May 19, 1982, changes that affected both of the rules (OAR 255-40-005(1) and OAR 255-38-005(4)) that would have been the only conceivable basis for petitioner\u2019s contention that he was entitled to administrative review every two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Having so clarified our understanding of the record, we return to the board\u2019s motion to dismiss this request for judicial review. The board\u2019s reference in ARR 1 to the May 19, 1982, amendments to the periodic-review rules indicates that the board construed petitioner\u2019s 2008 request as a request for periodic two-year review, in the alternative to what petitioner labeled a request for a \u201cparole consideration hearing.\u201d The board\u2019s interpretation was reasonable, because the rule cited by petitioner, OAR 255-40-005, relates to periodic review hearings, not parole consideration hearings. Thus, petitioner\u2019s contention on judicial review that he requested periodic review for the first time in 2011 is incorrect. When petitioner requested periodic review hearings in 2011 and the board denied that request in its 2012 ARR 2, the board correctly concluded that petitioner had already sought periodic review hearings in 2008, and that his 2011 request was, in effect, a request to reopen and reconsider the board\u2019s ruling on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Given our conclusion that the board rejected petitioner\u2019s 2008 request for periodic review hearings and then declined to reopen and reconsider that order in 2011 in ARR <em>2, </em>we conclude that the 2011 order was not a \u201cfinal order\u201d and thus is not subject to judicial review at this time. <em>See </em>ORS 144.335(l)(a); <em>Mastriano, </em>342 Or at 690 (holding that a denial of review or reconsideration that does not \u201creexamine the prior order * * * was not a final order subject to judicial review\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\"> ORS 144.228 (1981), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">\u201c(l)(a) Within six months after commitment to the custody of the Corrections Division of any person sentenced under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 as a dangerous offender, the State Board of Parole shall set a date for a parole consideration hearing instead of an initial release date as otherwise required under ORS 144.125 and 144.210.

Instead, the board, within six months of an offender\u2019s incarceration, shall \u201cset a parole consideration hearing\u201d date (rather than a parole release date). <em>Id. </em>At a parole consideration hearing, the board would determine whether the condition that rendered an offender \u201cdangerous\u201d was absent or in remission. <em>Id. </em>If the board concluded that the dangerous condition was present or was not in remission, the board would schedule another parole consideration hearing to occur \u201cat least every two years thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the board concluded that the dangerous condition was absent or in remission, then the board \u201cshall set a release date or order parole if the prisoner is otherwise eligible under the rules.\u201d If an offender believed that he or she was no longer dangerous prior to his or her initial parole consideration hearing date, he or she could request an early parole consideration hearing.

Because petitioner was sentenced as a dangerous offender, he was ineligible for periodic review in 1983. <em>See </em>OAR 255-40-005 (1982); OAR 255-38-005 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b720-5\"> Petitioner argues that, because the Appellate Commissioner denied the board\u2019s motion to dismiss, the \u201cquestion of whether the order is a final order is law of the case\u201d and \u201cno longer subject to dispute in this court.\u201d Petitioner is incorrect. <em>See City of Eugene v.
