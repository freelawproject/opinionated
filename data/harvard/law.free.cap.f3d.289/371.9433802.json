Moreno received a sentence of life imprisonment under the latter statute following a judicial determination that 122,081 kilograms of marijuana were attributable to him. Moreno argues that his indictment failed to sufficiently allege drug quantity under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Because Moreno did not challenge the indictment or his sentence on these grounds in the district court, this court reviews his assertion for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Randle, </em>259 F.3d 319, 321 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">\u201c[A] fact used in sentencing that does not increase a penalty beyond the statutory maximum need not be alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Keith, </em>230 F.3d 784, 787 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1182, 121 S.Ct. 1163, 148 L.Ed.2d 1023 (2001). The CCE statute authorizes imprisonment for life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a). As the district court\u2019s findings regarding drug quantity did not increase Moreno\u2019s sentence of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Moreno\u2019s Apprendi-based attack is unavailing. <em>See Keith, </em>230 F.3d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The remaining elements of Moreno\u2019s sentence, <em>ie., </em>his term of supervised release and his fine, were in no way affected by judicial findings as to drug quantity, and thus they are not implicated by Moreno\u2019s argument. Moreover, they do not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(1), 3583(b)(1); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a). Moreno has not shown plain error; indeed, he has not shown any error at all. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
