Robinson appeals from the district court\u2019s orders granting the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, issuing a permanent injunction, dismissing as frivolous a number of Robinson\u2019s motions, and denying Robinson\u2019s motion for reconsideration in this trademark infringement case. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Christian Science Bd. v. Robinson, </em>No. CA-99-148-1 (W.D.N.C. July 11 &amp; July 24, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"> Although the district court\u2019s orders are marked as \"filed\u201d on July 6, 2000, and July 21, 2000, respectively, the district court\u2019s records show that they were entered on the docket sheet on July 11, 2000, and July 24, 2000, respectively. Pursuant to Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the date that the order was entered on the docket sheet that we take as the effective date of the district court's decision. <em>Wilson v.
