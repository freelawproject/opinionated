We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error in the court\u2019s denial of Buckner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Buckner, </em>Nos. CR-97-413-JFM; CA-99-3578-JFM (D.Md. July 27, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">With regard to Buckner\u2019s claim that he should receive credit for time served in state custody on charges unrelated to his federal offense, we find that the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the claim because such claims, which challenge the execution of a sentence, must be filed in a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994), in the district court where Buckner is confined. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>871 F.2d 488, 489-90 (4th Cir.1989). We therefore dismiss this portion of the appeal. We deny Buckner\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal as moot and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
