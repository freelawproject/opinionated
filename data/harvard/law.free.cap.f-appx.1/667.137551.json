We reject Tritz\u2019s contention that these incidents constitute part of a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d because they are neither reasonably related nor similar to the allegations contained in her EEOC complaint, and thus do not represent an ongoing unlawful employment practice. <em>See Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., </em>147 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1998). Because the continuing violation theory has no application here, those incidents are not actionable. <em>See Green v. Los Angeles Superintendent of Schools, </em>883 F.2d 1472, 1475-76 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In an opinion published after the district court\u2019s decision, we indicated that evidence relating to untimely claims may serve as relevant background to put timely claims in context. <em>See Anderson v. Reno, </em>190 F.3d 930, 936 (9th Cir.1999). Having considered the additional evidence presented, we still conclude that no triable issues are raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">.
