We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Brannon\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">Parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal when the United States is a party, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 14, 2000. Bran-non\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on July 12, 2000. Because Brannon failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
