The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of appellees and LaBlanche appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Specifically, we agree with the district court that LaBlanche failed to offer any evidence the College\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for LaBlanche\u2019s dismissal, failing grades, was a pretext for discrimination. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Fuller v. Rayburn, </em>161 F.3d 516, 518 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Montgomery v. John Deere &amp; Co., </em>169 F.3d 556, 558 n. 3 (8th Cir.1999) (discrimination claims under Iowa Civil Rights Act analyzed in same manner as federal law counterparts).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">LaBlanche also argues the court violated her right to court-appointed counsel, but she was not entitled to appointment of counsel; and in any event, the court repeatedly tried to appoint counsel but La-Blanche failed to cooperate with any of them. <em>See Stevens v. Redwing, </em>146 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir.1998) (pro se litigant has no statutory or constitutional right to have counsel appointed in civil case). Finally, we do not review LaBlanche\u2019s argument that the College denied her due process, as she raises this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Tarsney v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>225 F.3d 929, 939 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. The Honorable Charles R. Wolle, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
