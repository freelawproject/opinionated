Ortiz was sentenced to 360 months, out of a possible range of 360 months to life, on the racketeering charge. Ortiz argues that the court erred in refusing to grant a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which would have reduced the applicable range to 324 to 405 months. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to reduce a sentence for acceptance of responsibility for clear error, and will not disturb the decision unless it is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irabor, </em>894 F.2d 554, 557 (2d Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>870 F.2d 174, 176 (5th Cir.1989)); see <em>also United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52,123 (2d Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>13 F.3d 638, 640 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">Although Ortiz pled guilty, he continued to maintain: that he was not a member of the Latin Kings; that he never sold narcotics on the Latin King territory in question; that he did not receive substantial profits from the conspiracy; and that the government informants were lying. The district court, based on \u201cthe entire record, the trial record, statements made in connection with the presentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>report, the wiretaps, the overwhelming evidence in this case,\u201d concluded that these denials were \u201cabsolute untruths,\u201d and therefore refused Ortiz\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. Based on our review of the evidence, we conclude that this decision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">2. We further conclude that Judge Nevas provided adequate reasons for his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">3. Ortiz also challenges the calculation of his sentence for acting as an accessory after the fact to murder. Section 2X3.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that the base offense level for that offense shall be six levels lower than the level for the underlying crime. If the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cis limited to harboring a fugitive,\u201d then the offense level cannot rise above twenty; had Judge Nevas found that Ortiz\u2019s conduct was so limited, his sentence range would have been 70 to 87 months, rather than the 180 months he received. Ortiz did not object to the presentence report on this basis, nor did he raise any objection at the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, this claim was waived. <em>See Diaz, </em>176 F.3d at 117-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Nonetheless, we still examine the record for \u201cplain error,\u201d an error that \u201cwould result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118 (quoting <em>United States v. Keppler, </em>2 F.3d 21, 24 (2d Cir.1993)). Since we find that the district court had sufficient facts before it to determine that Ortiz\u2019s conduct exceeded mere \u201charboring,\u201d we conclude that the district court committed no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
