Brown (\u201cBrown\u201d) appeals to this court from the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) final determination to deny him disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. Upon review of the record, we find that there is substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s decision and we therefore AFFIRM the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">Brown was born on April 6, 1973. He completed eleventh grade and obtained his high school diploma through a General Equivalency Degree program. His employment history includes work as a bag-ger at a grocery store and a food preparer at a fast food restaurant. He most recently worked in a factory from January 1994 to February 1996 as a high pressure spray washer cleaning automotive and industrial machinery. In July 1994, Brown suffered a workplace injury to his right foot when his foot got caught in a piece of machinery and remained in a twisted position for thirty minutes. Several months after the injury, Brown resumed work at the factory in a sedentary position cleaning excess plastic off steering wheels. He was unable to work for more than four hours a day due to the pain in his foot and he was subsequently terminated. Brown saw several doctors, beginning in September 1994, who diagnosed his condition as reflex sympathetic dystrophy of his right foot, a neurological syndrome characterized by acute pain and motion loss due to inflamed nerves and nerve endings. Admin. R. at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">According to Brown, the onset date of his disability was February 28, 1996. Brown first filed an application for Social Security Disability Income benefits in March 1996; his application was denied initially by the Social Security Administration and again on reconsideration. In September 1997, Brown sought review of the agency\u2019s decision before an administrative law judge (\u201cAL J\u201d). The ALJ to whom the matter was assigned conducted a hearing and concluded that Brown was not disabled. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision on December 4, 1998 when the Appeals Council denied Brown\u2019s request for review. <em>See Casey v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>987 F.2d 1230, 1233 <em>(6th </em>Cir.1993). Brown then sought judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision in federal district court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The matter was referred to a Magistrate Judge, who concluded that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision. The district court agreed with and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The district court judge had jurisdiction to review the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). This court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 after Brown filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">This court reviews the ALJ\u2019s final decision to determine whether the ALJ applied the correct legal standard and supported his decision with substantial evidence based on the record as a whole. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see also Walters v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. </em>., 127 F.3d 525, 528 (6th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence means more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance. It means \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>127 F.3d at 528 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). This court \u201cmay not try the case de novo, nor resolve conflicts in evidence, nor decide questions of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). An ALJ\u2019s decision is not subject to reversal simply because there is substantial evidence that would support the opposite conclusion than that reached by the ALJ. <em>See Key v. Callahan, 109 </em>F.3d 270, 273 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a), a person is entitled to disability insurance benefit payments if he (1) is insured for disability insurance benefits; (2) has not attained retirement age; (3) has filed an application for disability insurance benefits; and (4) is under a disability. This case presents the question whether Brown is under a \u201cdisability\u201d as required by the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d). The Act defines \u201cdisability\u201d as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S .C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a) (2000). To meet this definition, a claimant must have an impairment so severe \u201cthat he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a). The ALJ must engage in a five-step decisionmaking process as set out in agency regulations to determine whether the claimant has a disability. The five steps are as follows: (1) If claimant is doing substantial gainful activity, he is not disabled; (2) If claimant is not doing substantial gainful activity, his impairment must be severe before he can be found to be disabled; (3) If claimant is not doing substantial gainful activity and is suffering from a severe impairment that has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least twelve months, and his impairment meets or equals a listed impairment, claimant is presumed disabled without further inquiry; (4) If claimant\u2019s impairment does not prevent him from doing his past relevant work, he is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>disabled; (5) Even if claimant\u2019s impairment does prevent him from doing his past relevant work, if other work exists in the national economy that accommodates his residual functional capacity and vocational factors, such as age, education, and past work experience, he is not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>see also Walters, </em>129 F.3d at 529. The instant case involves the ALJ\u2019s decision at the fifth step of this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">C. Whether the Commissioner\u2019s Decision Was Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In his analysis, the ALJ first determined that Brown had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since February 28, 1996. The ALJ then determined that Brown has a \u201csevere\u201d impairment due to the pain and swelling in his right foot but that it did not meet any of the disabling criteria in 20 C.F.R., pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1. In his assessment of Brown\u2019s functional limitations, the ALJ found that Brown\u2019s testimony regarding his level of pain was not fully credible based on the objective medical evidence. The ALJ then found that while Brown was unable to perform his past relevant work, his residual functional capacity allowed him to execute unskilled sedentary work. Based on Brown\u2019s capacity for sedentary work and his age, education, and skill set, the ALJ then applied the medical-vocational grid at 20 C.F.R., pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2 (\u201cthe grid\u201d), which directed a finding of \u201cnot disabled.\u201d However, the ALJ noted that Brown\u2019s ability to perform the full range of sedentary work was \u201creduced by the need to elevate his right leg to footstool level and the need to limit work activity to the least amount of physical exertion in the upper extremities.\u201d Admin. R. at 16 (ALJ\u2019s Op.). While emphasizing that Brown suffers from additional nonexertional limitations which the grid does not accommodate, the ALJ reiterated that Brown is not disabled because there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that he can perform, including bench-type work such as visual inspection, sorting, simple assembly, machine operation, as well as working as a lobby or information clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Brown contests the ALJ\u2019s determination that his testimony regarding his pain, limitations, and restrictions was not credible. Brown also contests the ALJ\u2019s finding that his foot only needed to be elevated to footstool height as opposed to chair height. Because the ALJ did not find Brown\u2019s testimony credible, the ALJ rejected the Vocational Expert\u2019s (\u201cVE\u201d) opinion that a person who experienced Brown\u2019s stated levels of pain and swelling could not perform substantial gainful activity. Instead, the ALJ relied on the VE\u2019s opinion that there were 14,000 jobs that would accommodate a person with all of Brown\u2019s physical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">A claimant has the ultimate burden to prove the existence of a disability. However, when the claimant has established that he can no longer perform his past relevant work, as in this case, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to establish that the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform other substantial gainful activity existing in the national economy. <em>See Key, </em>109 F.3d at 274; <em>Walters, </em>127 F.3d at 529. The Commissioner can often meet his burden at the fifth step of the analysis by referring to the medical-vocational grid at 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, which measures whether a person is disabled based on his or her age, education, and work experience. <em>See Born v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>923 F.2d 1168, 1173 (6th Cir. 1990). However, if a claimant has both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>exertional and nonexertional limitations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the ALJ found in the instant case, the ALJ is not permitted to rely on the grid alone to determine whether the claimant has a disability. <em>See Born, </em>923 F.2d at 1174; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1569a(d); pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 200.00(e)(2) (the grid only \u201cprovide[s] a framework for consideration of how much the individual\u2019s work capability is further diminished\u201d by nonexertional limitations). If a claimant\u2019s nonexertional limitations prevent the claimant from doing the full range of work at the designated level, then the Commissioner must come forward with some reliable evidence showing that there remains a significant number of jobs that the claimant can perform, taking into account all of the claimant\u2019s limitations. <em>See Shelman v. Heckler, </em>821 F.2d 316, 321-22 (6th Cir. 1987). The Commissioner may meet his burden in this respect by relying on the testimony of a vocational expert. <em>See Born, </em>923 F.2d at 1173-74; <em>Damron v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>778 F.2d 279, 282 (6th Cir.1985); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Bearing in mind our deferential standard of review, this court must first determine whether the ALJ properly assessed Brown\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) in light of Brown\u2019s exertional and nonexertional limitations and the record evidence. A claimant\u2019s RFC is a measure of what the claimant can still do despite his limitations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a). It is an assessment \u201cbased upon all of the relevant evidence\u201d including the claimant\u2019s own descriptions of limitations that go beyond the symptoms of the impairment, such as pain; observations by the claimant\u2019s treating or examining physicians, including medical records; and observations by other relevant witnesses. <em>See id. </em>In this case, after taking into consideration Brown\u2019s age, education, and work experience, the ALJ limited Brown to unskilled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sedentary work, which involves:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a). The ALJ then considered two additional restrictions on Brown\u2019s ability to perform sedentary work, namely the requirement that he be allowed to elevate his foot and refrain from activity involving upper body exertion. In making this decision, the ALJ relied on only a portion of the VE\u2019s testimony. At the hearing, the ALJ asked the VE whether there were any sedentary, unskilled jobs in the metropolitan Detroit area where an individual could work if he had the option of elevating his foot on a footstool; could sit up to eight hours a day; had little or no physical exertion of the upper extremities: and could lift up to ten pounds. Admin. R. at 155-56 (Tr. of Hr\u2019g). The YE responded that there were approximately 14,000 suitable jobs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Southeast Michigan area in which a person could perform a limited range of unskilled sedentary work. The ALJ then asked the VE whether an individual with Brown\u2019s amount of pain and swelling of the right foot, who elevated his foot to chair height, could function in a gainful activity. The VE responded in the negative. Admin. R. at 157. In his findings, the ALJ did not rely on the VE\u2019s response to the second hypothetical because the ALJ concluded that Brown\u2019s assessment of his pain was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In evaluating complaints of pain, an ALJ may properly consider the credibility of the claimant. <em>See Walters, </em>127 F.3d at 531. Moreover, \u201can ALJ\u2019s findings based on the credibility of the claimant are to be accorded great weight and deference, particularly since the ALJ is charged with the duty of observing a witness\u2019s demeanor and credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the ALJ\u2019s assessment must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>An individual\u2019s statements as to \u201cpain or other symptoms will not alone establish that [he is] disabled.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(a). This court has developed a two-prong test to evaluate a claimant\u2019s assertions of disabling pain. \u201cFirst, we examine whether there is objective medical evidence of an underlying medical condition. If there is, we then examine: (1) whether objective medical evidence confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from the condition; or (2) whether the objectively established medical condition is of such a severity that it can reasonably be expected to produce the alleged disabling pain.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>127 F.3d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The record evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Brown\u2019s testimony regarding his pain was not credible. While all of the physicians who evaluated Brown concluded that he suffered from reflex sympathetic dystrophy (\u201cRSD\u201d), they were not in agreement concerning the degree to which Brown was limited by the pain he experienced. Only one physician, Dr. Phipps, who evaluated Brown in September 1997, suggested that Brown could not perform any kind of work. His opinion was contradicted by the other examining physicians. For example, Dr. Patel, who evaluated Brown on May 20, 1996 for the Social Security Administration, reported that while Brown suffered from RSD with \u201cswelling, pain and severe limitation of the range of motion of the right foot,\u201d Admin. R. at 86, Brown was able to sit and stand, bend and stoop, as well as push and pull the normal weight for his age and sex. Dr. Patel recommended that Brown walk with a cane temporarily until treated for RSD. In October, 1996, Dr. Roth evaluated Brown at the request of Brown\u2019s attorney. Dr. Roth determined that most of Brown\u2019s symptoms appeared to be mostly related to disuse and inactivity, although he stated that he could not rule out RSD. He could not fully evaluate Brown because he was not provided with Brown\u2019s medical records, but he did state that Brown should continue to modify his work activities to a sitting job of four hours a day, with his right foot elevated most of the time. Admin. R. at 110. Based on a thorough review of Brown\u2019s medical records, we conclude that there is contradictory evidence regarding the severity of Brown\u2019s pain arising from his injury. Moreover, the medical evidence was not conclusive regarding whether the medical condition is of such severity that it can reasonably be expected to produce disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The regulations indicate that if a disabling severity cannot be shown by objective medical evidence alone, the Commissioner may also consider other factors, such as how the claimant\u2019s symptoms affect his daily activities; precipitating and aggravating factors; the type and dosage of medication taken; and any measures used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the claimant to relieve pain. <em>See Walters, </em>127 F.3d at 531; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3). The ALJ did not dispute the physicians\u2019 conclusion that Brown has a \u201csevere\u201d impairment but, when weighing Brown\u2019s testimony regarding his pain and physical limitations against his testimony about his lifestyle and his level of medication, the ALJ concluded that Brown\u2019s \u201ctestimony as to his level of pain in [sic] not credible based upon the objective medical report.\u201d Admin. R. at 14 (ALJ Op.). At the hearing before the ALJ, Brown stated that he had held a sedentary job at the same factory at which he was injured but that he could not work for more than four hours a day because his foot would swell and become more painful, even when it was elevated on a chair. Admin. R. at 136-58 (Brown\u2019s Test.) He also testified that he cannot stand on his foot for long periods of time and that his foot usually swells four days of the week. However, Brown testified that he spends his days sleeping or watching television, presumably in a seated position, often with his foot elevated on a chair. This portrait of Brown\u2019s daily activities is not inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Brown can perform a limited set of sedentary activities, where he is seated for much of the day and may elevate his foot should he so choose. Brown also testified that he goes to the mall with his cousin and best friend to walk around on the weekends, where he can usually walk for ten minutes and then has to sit down. He also drives two or three blocks about twice a week, with his left foot. The record also reflects that twice a month he goes to the movies and is able to sit through the movie. This evidence further supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that Brown\u2019s pain does not completely inhibit him from performing sedentary activities. As to his pain levels, Brown testified that his foot gave him constant pain, which increased when his foot was swollen, and that the pain sometimes kept him up at night. However, the record indicates that Brown takes only two medications: Darvocet, which he takes every day for the pain and Elavil, to help him sleep at night. The ALJ found that this amount and kind of medication is inconsistent with the incapacitating and chronic pain from which Brown allegedly suffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">When viewed as a whole, the record clearly provides substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination. Because we conclude that the ALJ properly assessed Brown\u2019s credibility, we see no error in the ALJ\u2019s decision to rely on the portion of the YE\u2019s testimony that is consistent with the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding. \u201cSubstantial evidence may be produced through reliance on the testimony of a vocational expert in response to a \u2018hypothetical\u2019 question, but only if the question accurately portrays [plaintiffs] individual physical and mental impairments.\u201d <em>Varley v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>820 F.2d 777, 779 (6th Cir.1987) (internal citation omitted). In this case, the ALJ\u2019s second hypothetical did not accurately portray Brown\u2019s physical limitations. Thus, the ALJ properly relied on only the first hypothetical when making his residual functional capacity determination. Our review of the record, including Brown\u2019s testimony, the VE\u2019s testimony, and the medical records, also leads to our conclusion conclude that the ALJ has provided reliable evidence, in the form of the VE\u2019s testimony, that supports the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Moreover, we also conclude that the ALJ\u2019s determination that Brown needed to elevate his foot to footstool height, as opposed to chair height, is supported by substantial evidence in the record. There is no evidence in the medical records to support Brown\u2019s contention that his foot must be elevated to a certain height. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Brown stated that he continued to experience pain when his foot was elevated to chair height, the ALJ was not required to credit Brown\u2019s own assessment of his limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">D. \u201cSecondary Gain\u201d Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Brown also argues that the Appeals Council\u2019s use of the term \u201csecondary gain\u201d in its December 4, 1998 order denying review of the ALJ\u2019s decision necessitates a remand to the Commissioner for a determination of the psychiatric implications of that finding. In its order, the Appeals Council addressed a contention from Brown\u2019s lawyer that the ALJ impermissi-bly considered Brown\u2019s $27,000 worker\u2019s compensation settlement as a factor in its determination that Brown was not disabled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appeals Council explicitly noted that it was reviewing Brown\u2019s contentions raised in his request for review from October 29, 1997, when it stated: The Appeals Council considered the contention that the Administrative Law Judge was unfair to consider your workers\u2019 compensation when considering your credibility and willingness to return to the work force. The Administrative Law Judge, as the trier of fact, is required to consider all facets of a case in determining a claimant\u2019s credibility, including any non-medical factors which can be seen to affect an individual\u2019s motivation in returning to work. Therefore, it is within the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s jurisdiction to consider other income sources and secondary gain in determining credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Admin. R. at 4. Based on the language of the Appeals Council\u2019s decision, there is no evidence to support the claim that the Appeals Council independently raised or improperly considered the issue of Brown\u2019s receipt of worker\u2019s compensation, nor is there evidence that the Appeals Council implied that Brown suffered from the psychiatric condition \u201csecondary gain.\u201d Thus, this claim is totally without merit and must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Because we find that both of Brown\u2019s claims are without merit, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to deny Brown disability benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\">.
