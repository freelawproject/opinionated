ARNOLD, FAGG, and BOWMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b630-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Camila Chavez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. Chavez faced a U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) range of 120 to 135 months, and a statutory minimum sentence of ten years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Before sentencing, Chavez filed a motion for a downward departure arguing she tried to cooperate with the Government and had given the names of two drug contacts, but the Government did not file a substantial assistance motion. At sentencing, the district court granted the departure because of Chavez\u2019s \u201clanguage barrier\u201d and her willingness to cooperate. The district court sentenced Chavez to time served, about ten months. The Government appeals, arguing the district court abused its discretion in departing downward from the mandatory minimum sentence without a Government motion for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">\u201cUpon motion of the Government,\u201d a district court has authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), and to depart from the sentence prescribed by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, to reflect a defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d Without a Government motion, a district court cannot depart based on substantial assistance below the statutory minimum sentence or the Guidelines range, unless the Government\u2019s refusal to file the motion was irrational, in bad faith, or based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, </em>958 F.2d 1441, 1443-44 (8th Cir.1992). Chavez did not argue and the district court did not find the Government acted improperly in refusing to file a departure motion, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) and its Guidelines equivalent, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, a district court may impose a sentence below the Guidelines range if the court finds a \u201cmitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the Guidelines.\u201d In this case, Chavez did not show and the district court did not find her circumstances warranted a departure under \u00a7 5K2.0. Indeed, we have expressly held a district court may not depart downward under \u00a7 5K2.0 on the basis of a defendant\u2019s cooperation, in a veiled attempt to circumvent the need for a Government departure motion. <em>See United States v. Aslakson, </em>982 F.2d 283, 284 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">The district court also declared it was departing downward because Chavez may have been confused since she speaks only Spanish and because her confusion may have prevented her from cooperating with authorities. The facts indicate otherwise. A fluent Spanish speaking agent spoke with Chavez and made her rights known to her at the bus station where she was arrested. Further, Chavez was given an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>opportunity to cooperate with law enforcement after her indictment about a month later, and she refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We conclude the district court lacked authority to depart under \u00a7 3553(e), \u00a7 5K1.1, or \u00a7 5K2.0. We thus reverse and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. On remand, the district court may consider whether Chavez is eligible for relief from the statutory minimum sentence under the \u201csafety valve,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
