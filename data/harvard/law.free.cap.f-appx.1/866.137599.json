In the district court proceedings, Mr. Read challenged a divorce decree entered by default by the Tulsa County District Court (hereafter \u201cthe Tulsa County Court\u201d). He maintained that the decree was entered after service by publication and thereby violated his due process rights. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Mr. Read\u2019s claims against the defendant state court judges are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). We further conclude that the district court properly dismissed Mr. Read\u2019s claim against his ex-wife and her lawyer on the ground that they are not state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In February 1990, the defendant Shawna Dunn filed a petition for divorce from Mr. Read in the Tulsa County Court. Ms. Dunn served Mr. Read by publication, and the court entered a divorce decree on April 30,1990. The decree determined that service by publication was proper, that Mr. Read was the father of the parties\u2019 child, and that he was responsible for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Mr. Read failed to comply with the child support obligations set forth in the decree. In December 1996, Ms. Dunn filed an application for contempt in the Tulsa County Court, alleging that Mr. Read was $32,055.40 in arrears. Mr. Read moved to dismiss the contempt application, asserting that he had not been properly served in the divorce proceedings. The Tulsa County Court denied Mr. Read\u2019s motion, and he then filed a Petition to Vacate Void Judgment, which the court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In April 1997, the Tulsa County Court held a non-jury trial on this first contempt charge. It granted judgment to Ms. Dunn for $32,659.20. However, the court withheld a finding on the issue of whether Mr. Read should be held in contempt for having failed to pay child support. Aple\u2019s Supp.App. at 34,\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Mr. Read then mounted two challenges to the contempt ruling: (1) he appealed the $32,659.20 judgment to the Oklahoma Supreme Court; and (2) he filed a petition for a writ of prohibition with the same court. The Oklahoma Supreme Court entered a writ staying contempt proceedings pending the resolution of the appeal, and it assigned the appeal of the contempt ruling to the Oklahoma Court of Appeals. That court affirmed the Tulsa County Court\u2019s contempt ruling and denied Mr. Read\u2019s petition for rehearing. The Oklahoma Supreme Court then denied Mr. Read\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Next, Mr. Read filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition and initiated an adversary proceeding requesting the bankruptcy court to vacate the divorce decree. The bankruptcy court dismissed the adversary proceeding in October 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Subsequently, the Tulsa County Court resumed proceedings on Ms. Dunn\u2019s application to hold Mr. Read in contempt. In December 1998, it found Mr. Read in indirect contempt for failing to pay child support through April 28, 1997, and it sentenced him to six months in the Tulsa County jail. The court set a purge fee of $3,000, which Mr. Read paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Mr. Read then filed the instant \u00a7 1983 action against the two state court judges, the Tulsa County prosecutor, Ms. Dunn, and Shannon Davis (Ms. Dunn\u2019s lawyer in the divorce proceedings). He sought a temporary restraining order barring enforcement of the divorce decree as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>damages against Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis. The federal district court denied application for the restraining order and dismissed the case, reasoning that the defendant judges and the defendant prosecutor were entitled to absolute immunity and that Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis were not state actors and thus not subject to \u00a7 1983 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Mr. Read proceeded to file another petition for a writ of prohibition in the Oklahoma Supreme Court. He again requested the court to enter an order barring the collection of child support pursuant to the 1990 decree. The Oklahoma Supreme Court again denied Mr. Read\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Ms. Dunn then filed a second application for contempt in the Tulsa County Court, asserting that Mr. Read had failed to pay child support from May 1997 through February 1999. In March 1999, the court conducted a jury trial on this second contempt charge. It again found Mr. Read guilty of indirect contempt of court and sentenced him to six months\u2019 incarceration in the Tulsa County jail. Mr. Read refused to pay the $9,200 purge fee and served his sentence. He challenged his confinement in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied. Mr. Read also filed an appeal of the March 1999 contempt ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In a July 2000 ruling on the appeal of the second contempt proceeding, the Oklahoma Court of Appeals agreed with Mr. Read that the issuance of the 1990 divorce decree had been improper. <em>See Read v. Read, </em>No. 92,930 (Okla.Ct.App. July 18, 2000). The court observed that the record in the divorce proceeding \u201cdoes not reflect any entry concerning the issuance of summons or any return reporting an unsuccessful attempt to serve summons.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 4. The record also did not reflect \u201cany entry concerning an attempt to serve [Mr. Read] by mail at the \u2018last known address\u2019 set out in the petition or any other attempted and unsuccessful service by mail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court invoked an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision holding that \u201c \u2018[w]here names and addresses of adverse parties are known ... notice of pending proceedings by publication service alone, is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process under federal or Oklahoma constitutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson v. McDaniel, </em>569 P.2d 977, 981 (Okla.1977)). Thus, the court concluded, <em>\u201cwe agree with [Mr. Read] that the decree of divorce by default herein must be set aside </em>because the trial court had no jurisdiction over [Mr. Read] by reason of [Ms. Dunn\u2019s] failure to comply with the mandates of due process for service by publication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5 (emphasis added). It remanded the case to the trial court, \u201cwith directions to reopen the divorce proceeding to allow [Mr.] Read to be heard on the merits of any issue bearing on his liability for child support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Mr. Read first challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant state court judges are entitled to immunity from his claim seeking an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the 1990 divorce decree. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s Br. at 2. He argues that, because the judges acted without jurisdiction in enforcing the decree, they are not entitled to immunity. Mr. Read also argues that, because Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis are state actors, the district court also erred in dismissing his due process claim against them. We review de novo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>the legal conclusions on which the district court based its dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf &amp; Blind, </em>173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">\n<em>A. Claim for Injunctive Relief Against the State Court Judges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Mr. Read\u2019s claim for injunctive relief against the state court judges constitutes a challenge to the validity of the Tulsa County Court\u2019s April 1990 divorce decree. His complaint in this case seeks a judgment \u201cadjudicating that said default judgment is void and that [the defendants] are barred from taking any action to enforce said judgment.\u201d Aple\u2019s Supp App. at 5 (Plaintiffs Complaint, filed Dec. 10, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, federal district courts lack jurisdiction to review state court judgments. <em>Fado v. Jones, </em>929 F.2d 541, 544 (10th Cir.1991) (noting that \u201c[w]here a constitutional issue could have been reviewed on direct appeal by the state appellate courts, a litigant may not seek to reverse or modify the state court judgment by bringing a constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Anderson v. State of Colorado, </em>793 F.2d 262, 264 (10th Cir.1986) (noting that federal district courts do no have jurisdiction to review final state court judgments in judicial proceedings). The losing party in a state court proceeding is generally barred \u201cfrom seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing pai'ty\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s federal rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994). Review of the state court judgment must proceed to the state\u2019s highest court and then to the United States Supreme Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257. <em>See Fado, </em>929 F.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars not only direct review of state court judgments in federal court but also consideration of claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 483-84 n. 16). However, as this circuit has explained, \u201cif the purpose of a federal action is separable from and collateral to a state court judgment, then the claim is not inextricably intertwined merely because the action necessitates some consideration of the merits of the state court judgment.\u201d <em>Kiowa Indian Tribe ofOkla. v. Hoover, </em>150 F.3d 1163, 1170 (10th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Determining whether a federal claim is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment may be difficult. <em>See Young v. Murphy, </em>90 F.3d 1225, 1231 (7th Cir.1996). \u201cThe fundamental and appropriate question to ask is whether the injury alleged by the federal plaintiff resulted from the state court judgment itself or is distinct from that judgment.\u201d <em>Garry v. Geils, </em>82 F.3d 1362, 1365 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Here, Mr. Read\u2019s claim against the state court judges directly challenges the state court divorce decree. Notably, the claim repeats arguments that he raised in his various state court challenges to the Tulsa County Court\u2019s divorce decree. Furthermore, the Oklahoma Court of Appeals\u2019s July 2000 ruling demonstrates the availability of a state court remedy for the alleged deficiencies in the entry of that decree. Any further review of the state court decision must come from the Oklahoma Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court rather than the federal district court. <em>See Fado, </em>929 F.2d at 543. Applying the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, we therefore conclude that we lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>jurisdiction over Mr. Read\u2019s claim against the state court judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">\n<em>B. Claim Against Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Mr. Read\u2019s claim for damages against Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis involves somewhat different considerations. As to that claim, he alleges that Ms. Dunn \u201cknew the last known address of [Mr. Read] and ... knew the address of his parents and a brother, but did not mail notice to [Mr. Read] at his last known address, nor to his parents\u2019 known address, nor to his broth-erf\u2019s] known address, thereby depriving [Mr. Read] of his right to due process.\u201d Aple\u2019s Supp App. at 2 (Plaintiffs Complaint, filed Dec. 10, 1998). As Judge Pos-ner has observed, there are limitations on the scope of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine when a plaintiff alleges that state procedures have been corrupted:</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Were [the plaintiff] merely claiming that the decision of the state court was incorrect, even that it denied him some constitutional right, the [Rooker-Feldman] doctrine would indeed bar his claim. But if he claims, as he does, that people involved in the decision violated some independent right of his, such as the right (if it is a right) to be judged by a tribunal that is uncontaminated by politics, then he can, without being blocked by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, sue to vindicate that right and show as part of his claim for damages that the violation caused the decision to be adverse to him and thus did him harm.... Otherwise there would be no federal remedy for a violation of federal rights whenever the violator so far succeeded in corrupting the state judicial process as to obtain a favorable judgment, as alleged in cases such as <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>[449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980)], and <em>Casa Mane, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>[988 F.2d 252, 259 (1st Cir.1993)]. This result would be inconsistent with cases in which, for example, police officers are sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for having fabricated evidence that resulted in the plaintiffs being convicted in a state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\"><em>Nesses v. Shepard, </em>68 F.3d 1003, 1005 (7th Cir.1995). However, we need not resolve the \u201cdifficult question,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1004, of whether the Rooker-Feldman doctrine applies to these claims because the defendants Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis are entitled to judgment in their favor for a different reason \u2014 because they are not state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">In order to prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging a deprivation of constitutional rights, a plaintiff must show that he was injured as a result of state action. <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., </em>457 U.S. 922, 935, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); <em>Gallagher v. Neil Young Freedom Concert, </em>49 F.3d 1442, 1447 (10th Cir.1995). Thus, private conduct, \u201cno matter how discriminatory or wrongful,\u201d may not be redressed by a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The Supreme Court \u201chas taken a flexible approach to the state action doctrine, applying a variety of tests to the facts of each case.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>49 F.3d at 1447. Thus, a party may be considered a state actor if: (1) \u201c \u2018there is a sufficiently close nexus\u2019 between the government and the challenged conduct such that the conduct \u2018may be fairly treated as that of the State itself[,]\u2019 \u201d see <em>id. </em>at 1448 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477(1974)); (2) the state \u201c \u2018has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence\u2019 with a private party that \u2018it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>activity[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1451 (quoting <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 725, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961)); (3) a private party is a \u201c \u2018willful participant in joint action with the State or its agents[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1453 (quoting <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27,101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980)); and (4) the state delegates to the private party a function \u201c\u2018traditionally exclusively reserved to the State[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1456 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>419 U.S. at 352).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In this case, Mr. Read\u2019s argument that Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis are state actors is based primarily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Company, </em>457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). There, the Court considered a due process claim brought by a debtor against a private company that had initiated prejudgment attachment proceedings. Under the Virginia procedure at issue, the private company filed an ex parte petition alleging that the debtor might be disposing of property to defeat his creditors. Acting on that petition, the clerk of the state court issued a writ of attachment, and the county sheriff executed the writ. The Court rejected the conclusion of a lower court that \u201c \u2018joint participation\u2019 required something more than invoking the aid of state officials to take advantage of state-created attachment procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942. It explained that \u201c[w]hatever may be true in other contexts, this is sufficient [i.e. invoking the aid of state officials to take advantage of state-created attachment procedures] when the State has created a system whereby state officials will attach property on the ex parte application of one party to a private dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Read attempts an analogy to the facts of that case, maintaining that, like the private corporation in <em>Lugar, </em>Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis obtained the aid of state officials (the defendant judges) in order to obtain the divorce decree and the various subsequent orders enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Although <em>Lugar </em>adopts an expansive test for state action, the decision \u201cis carefully limited to prejudgment seizures of property.\u201d 1 Martin A. Schwartz \u00a7 John E. Kirklin, <em>Section 1983 Litigation: Claims, Defenses, and Fees, </em>\u00a7 5.14, at 291 (2d ed. 1998). In other contexts, a private party\u2019s \u201cmere invocation of state legal procedures\u201d does not constitute joint participation and thus is not state action. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, this circuit and several others have held that private parties to litigation and their lawyers are not state actors. <em>See Barnard v. Young, </em>720 F.2d 1188,1189 (10th Cir.1983) (concluding that application of <em>Lugar </em>\u201cdoes not change the vast weight of authority that private attorneys, by virtue of being officers of the court, do not act under color of state law within the meaning of section 1983\u201d); <em>Lindley v. Amoco Prod. Co., </em>639 F.2d 671 (10th Cir. 1981) (concluding that an attorney and a corporation were not state actors when they obtained an order from a court allowing the attorney to enter the plaintiffs home to seal files); <em>Torres v. First State Bank of Sierra County, </em>588 F.2d 1322, 1326-27 (10th Cir.1978) (\u201cWe do not think that the \u2018color of lav/ reference in \u00a7 1983 was intended to encompass a case such as this one, where the only infirmities are the excesses of the court itself, subject to immediate modification by a court having jurisdiction over the parties, and subject to the normal processes of appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Catz v. Chalker, </em>142 F.3d 279, 289 (6th Cir.1998) (concluding that an attorney was not a state actor); <em>Hoai v. Vo, </em>935 F.2d 308, 313 (D.C.Cir.1991) (affirming dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 claim against a private party and a lawyer and noting that \u201c[i]t is well established that mere recourse to state or local court procedures does not by itself constitute \u2018joint activity\u2019 with the state suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ficient to subject a private party to liability under section 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Significantly, Mr. Read has not cited any authority other than <em>Lugar </em>for the proposition that parties to .litigation and their lawyers may become state actors merely by obtaining orders from a state court judge. Such a rule would greatly expand the universe of state actors, and we decline to adopt such a new approach here. We therefore conclude that the district court properly dismissed Mr. Read\u2019s claims against Ms. Dunn and Ms. Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">As to Mr. Read\u2019s claims against state court Judges Klein and Hass, we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment as to that claim and remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction As to Mr. Read\u2019s claims against Ms. Dunn and Shannon Davis, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b892-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">. The court also explained that a decision about the $3,000 purge fee should be held in abeyance until the trial court revisited the issues bearing on child support. <em>See Read v. Read, </em>No. 92,930, slip op. at 9 n. 2 (Okla Ct.App. July 18, 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b898-7\">BRISCOE, Circuit Judge, concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">I concur in the majority\u2019s ruling that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes further litigation against Judge Klein and Judge Hass in federal court. I write separately because I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision not to decide whether to apply the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to the claims against Shawna Dunn and Shannon Davis. In my view, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine clearly applies to these claims and, as jurisdiction is a threshold issue, I would decide the case on <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars consideration by federal courts of claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with state court judgments. <em>Faci\u00f3 v. Jones, </em>929 F.2d 541., 543 (10th Cir.1991). Evaluating Read\u2019s claim for damages against Dunn and Davis would require the federal district court to determine whether the state court had entered a default judgment against Read without adequate notice. The federal court would thus be evaluating whether the state court\u2019s decision that notice was proper was correct. This is the sort of collateral review of state court decisions that is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine. <em>See Anderson v. Colorado, </em>793 F.2d 262, 264 (10th Cir.1986). I would, therefore, also dismiss the claims against Dunn and Davis for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
