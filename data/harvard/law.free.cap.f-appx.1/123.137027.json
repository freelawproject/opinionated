We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and Hawkins\u2019 informal appellate brief. Because Hawkins failed to challenge on appeal the bases for the district court\u2019s denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, he has not preserved any issue for our review. 4th Cir.R. 34(b). With regard to the issues Hawkins raises for the first time on appeal, we generally do not consider such issues, except under narrow circumstances not present here.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that issues raised for first time on appeal generally will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-23\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v.. Hawkins, </em>Nos. CR-98-16-BO; CA-99-704-5-BO (E.D.N.C. July 6, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-17\"> Even if Hawkins\u2019 claim under <em>Apprendi v.
