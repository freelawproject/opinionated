Jackson pleaded guilty to bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>2 </em>and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and to carrying and using a firearm during and in relation to the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 248 months (20 years and 8 months) imprisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal, Jackson\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Jackson has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, but he has moved to strike counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and for appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Upon a thorough review of the record, we conclude Jackson knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement. See <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>171 F.3d 567, 568 (8th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Michelsen, </em>141 F.3d 867, 871-72 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 942, 119 S.Ct. 363, 142 L.Ed.2d 299 (1998). Accordingly, we enforce the appeal waiver, dismiss the appeal, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We deny Jackson\u2019s motions to strike and for new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\">. The Honorable D.
