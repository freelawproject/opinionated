Courts contends that the district court erred by not reducing his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Dabbs contends that the district court erred by increasing his offense level based upon his role in the conspiracy. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">A district court\u2019s factual determinations at sentencing are reviewed for clear error and legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996). We find that the district court did not err by considering Courts\u2019 criminal conduct not related to the offense of conviction in denying a reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ceccarani, </em>98 F.3d 126, 129-30 (3d Cir.1996). We further find that the district court did not err by finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Courts did not voluntarily terminate or withdraw from criminal conduct or association. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1(b), 3) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">We also find that the district court did not err by finding that Dabbs was a manager or supervisor within the conspiracy and the conspiracy had five or more persons or was otherwise extensive. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (1998). There was substantial evidence that Dabbs instructed other members of the conspiracy and that the conspiracy contained five or more persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">We affirm the convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
