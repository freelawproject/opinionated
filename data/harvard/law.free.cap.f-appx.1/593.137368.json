For the reasons discussed below, we reject each of the arguments he raises on appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>First, Eddy argues that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in setting his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4. We disagree: the proper Guideline was applied because Eddy received through the mail a videotape involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Next, Eddy argues that his offense level should not have been increased by two under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) because there was insufficient evidence that the videotape depicted a prepubescent minor or a minor under the age of twelve years. We conclude that the district court \u2014 having personally viewed the videotape, and having considered the affidavit of a pediatrician who opined that the girl was prepubescent and younger than eleven \u2014 did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Marquardt, </em>949 F.2d 283, 286-87 (9th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (district court did not clearly err in determining that subject was prepubescent where postal inspector so opined, films were furnished to court, and defendant did not present any evidence to contrary).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Finally, Eddy argues that the district court erroneously denied his entrapment-based downward-departure motion. The matter is unreviewable, however, because the court was aware of its authority to depart and discretionarity declined to do so. <em>See United States v. Turechek, </em>138 F.3d 1226, 1228 (8th Cir.1998) (district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward from Guidelines is unreviewable so long as court was aware of its authority to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-20\">.
