The Appellants sought Cameron\u2019s placement in a private school at public expense. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s memorandum and order and find no reversible error. <em>See Florence County School Dist. Four v. Carter, </em>510 U.S. 7, 15, 114 S.Ct. 361, 126 L.Ed.2d 284 (1993); <em>Hall v. Vance County Bd. of Educ., </em>774 F.2d 629, 635 (4th Cir. 1985). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Gorby v. Grasmick, </em>No. CA-00-71-MJG (D. Md. June 20, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
