JOEL M. FLAUM, Chief Judge, Hon. FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, and Hon. MICHAEL S. KANNE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">Midway through his criminal trial, David Larson pleaded guilty to a federal crime. Delay in entering the plea until it became clear that conviction was inevitable, coupled with efforts to withdraw that plea, led the district court to deny Larson any reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">In this proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Larson contends that his lawyer rendered ineffective assistance by not informing him that his position was hopeless, so that he could enter a guilty plea well in advance of trial in order to obtain the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. After an evidentiary hearing, the district judge denied the petition. Larson\u2019s lawyer testified that such advice had indeed been provided, but that Larson had refused to listen. The district judge believed counsel\u2019s testimony, concluded that Larson\u2019s contrary testimony was untrue, and added that Larson would not have received a reduction no matter when he had pleaded guilty, because his entire course of conduct evinces refusal to accept responsibility for his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Larson\u2019s appeal is frivolous, because it is predicated on his version of events, which the district judge did not accept. The judge\u2019s credibility findings cannot be deemed clearly erroneous. See <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Indeed, the district judge should not have issued a certificate of appealability, because the issue <em>for appeal </em>is not substantial. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The district judge stated that she was obliged to issue a certificate because she had deemed the claim sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing. But the reason for the hearing was a conflict in the evidence, not a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d, and the only issue on appeal \u2014 which cannot be thought \u201csubstantial\u201d by any measure \u2014 is whether the district judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. Such a question rarely meets the statutory standards for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Larson contends that the district judge should have recused herself. This argument was not covered by the certificate of appealability and does not entail a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d. Larson contends that the district judge must be prejudiced because she harshly criticized him when denying his petition. The criticism arises from Larson\u2019s conduct revealed in the record and therefore does not require recusal. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). District judges are not required to pull their punches when describing the conduct of persons who not only have been convicted of federal crimes but have committed new ones (in this case, perjury) in an effort to escape punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
