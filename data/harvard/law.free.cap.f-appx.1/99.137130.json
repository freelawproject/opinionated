Radio Corporation of America, </em>434 F.2d 315, 317 (2d Cir .1970). We see no abuse of discretion in the determination here \u2014 given the public availability of the information in question years prior to the entry of judgment \u2014 that plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate, filed more than a year after entry of judgment, was not made within a reasonable time as required by Rule 60(b). Plaintiffs contention that his time to move under that Rule was governed by a six-year statute of limitations is without merit. His additional contention that the district judge\u2019s signature may have been invalid is unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-20\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
