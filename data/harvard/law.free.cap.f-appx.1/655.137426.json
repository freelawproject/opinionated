He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of the above judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>and the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Because Roberson\u2019s appeal of the amended judgment is dispositive, we need not address the other claims at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Weiner v. San Diego County, </em>210 F.3d 1025,1028 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Judgment as a matter of law is proper if the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party permits only one reasonable conclusion, and that conclusion is contrary to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 864 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The jury in this case gave two contradictory answers to special interrogatories: in one answer they found no proximate causation for Appellees\u2019 deliberate indifference, and in another they found proximate causation for Appellees\u2019 violation of Roberson\u2019s civil rights. The district court focused on the first answer, suggesting that without a finding of proximate causation for deliberate indifference, there could be no award in the failure to protect claim. The district court did not suggest that it would have been unreasonable for the jury to find proximate causation for deliberate indifference, simply that they did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">At the same time, the jury also found that sufficient proximate causation existed. This is inherent in its conclusion that compensatory damages should be awarded for the deprivation of civil rights proximately caused by Chelan County and Chelan County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Because the jury answers cannot be reconciled, the district court erred in awarding nominal damages. We reverse and remand for a new trial on Roberson\u2019s federal failure to protect claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-17\">.
