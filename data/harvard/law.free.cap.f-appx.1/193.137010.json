He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 63 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Both statutes carry a maximum term of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(b), 2423(b). On appeal, Perry contends that his intention to produce a visual depiction of the proposed sexual activity was an element of the offenses that needed to be in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He further contends that the district court clearly erred by finding that he had the intention to produce a visual depiction of the proposed sexual activity. Perry also contends that the district court erred by not departing downward for diminished capacity pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guide</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>lines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.13 (1998). We affirm the convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The district court\u2019s finding at sentencing that Perry intended to produce a visual depiction of the proposed sexual activity did not increase Perry\u2019s maximum statutory sentence for either conviction. Thus, the court did not err by making this finding by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, other than the fact of prior conviction, must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>31 F.3d 1304, 1315 (4th Cir.1994). This Court is reluctant to overturn the district court\u2019s factual findings. <em>United States v. D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 614 (4th Cir.1994). We find that the court\u2019s finding that Perry intended to produce a visual depiction of the sexual activity was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Because the district court knew that it had the authority to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines for diminished capacity and found that a departure was not warranted, we cannot review the claim. <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
