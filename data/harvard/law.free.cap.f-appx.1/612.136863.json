In the first appeal, we reversed the district court\u2019s decision that Commercial Optical Company, Inc. did not violate the WARN Act when Commercial failed to give employees notice of a plant closing. <em>See Burnsides v. MJ Optical, Inc., </em>128 F.3d 700 (8th Cir. 1997). We decided that under the Act, the \u201cunforeseeable business circumstances\u201d defense excused Commercial from giving 60-days\u2019 written notice, but instead required Commercial to give as much notice as practicable. <em>See id. </em>at 703-04. We stated that under the circumstances, \u201cCommercial had an obligation to notify the employees that they would lose their jobs in two days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704. We remanded the case for the district court to calculate damages. <em>See id. </em>On remand, the district court awarded damages in the amount of two days\u2019 pay and benefits. The employees appeal arguing the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>court committed error in finding Commercial could rely on the \u201cunforeseeable business circumstances\u201d defense without giving any written notice to employees, and the district court should have awarded damages for a sixty rather than two-day WARN violation. These arguments ignore our holdings in the first appeal. Having carefully considered the employees\u2019 appeal, we affirm the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
