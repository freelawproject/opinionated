The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On October 25, 1994, petitioner John J. Pappert was convicted by a jury of three counts of mail fraud, four counts of wire fraud, and two counts of submitting false documents to a federally insured financial institution. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343, 1014. He was sentenced by the Honorable Kathryn H. Vratil on February 21,1995, to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment on one of those counts and ninety-seven months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the remaining eight counts. No fine was imposed, but petitioner was ordered to pay his numerous victims a total of several million dollars in restitution. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Pappert, </em>112 F.3d 1073 (10th Cir.1997). After his appeal was decided, petitioner filed a motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">While the case was on direct appeal, Judge Vratil learned that her staff member who was responsible for screening her cases for conflicts from investments in an IRA had not been doing so. Judge Vratil surveyed her pending and closed cases for previously unknown conflicts. Judge Vra-til immediately divested herself of the stock in her IRA and transferred the money to mutual funds, eliminating any conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Petitioner moved to amend his motion for new trial to include the argument that Judge Vratil should have recused in this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 because of her financial interest in a company related to one of the corporate victims that would be paid restitution under his sentence. Judge Vratil denied petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial, rejecting his argument that she should recuse. Petitioner did not appeal this ruling. <em>See </em>R. Doc. 125. Petitioner then filed this motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing again that Judge Vratil should re-cuse and raising several other issues. Judge Vratil denied habeas relief, but granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on petitioner\u2019s argument that she should disqualify herself under \u00a7 455. <em>See </em>R. Doc. 151. We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">The denial of a motion to recuse under \u00a7 455(a) or (b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cA judge has a continuing duty to recuse under \u00a7 455(a) if sufficient factual grounds exist to cause a reasonable, objective person, knowing all the relevant facts, to question the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Pearson, </em>203 F.3d 1243, 1277 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1264, 120 S. Ct. 2734, 147 L.Ed.2d 995 (2000). \u201c[Section] 455(a) expands the protection of \u00a7 455(b), but duplicates some of its protection as well.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 552, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). However, where the language of \u00a7 455 specifically limits the requirements of recusal, the specific language limits the scope of \u00a7 455(a). <em>See id. </em>at 552-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">There are two questions before us. First, whether petitioner is entitled to a new trial because Judge Vratil should have recused herself. Second, whether Judge Vratil should have recused herself from the proceeding that followed the discovery of her conflict. We conclude that a new trial is not required and that Judge Vratil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>did not need to recuse herself after her discovery of her conflict. Judge Vratil acknowledged that at the time of petitioner\u2019s sentencing, she owned shares in General Electric Company, a corporate relative of General Electric Capital Leasing, one of petitioner\u2019s victims. <em>See </em>R. Doc. 151, at 3. Thus, she concluded that she arguably had a financial interest in the subject matter of petitioner\u2019s criminal proceeding within the meaning of \u00a7 455(b)(4). <em>See id. </em>She said that she did not know that she owned those shares at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial and sentencing, however, and that she had divested herself of them by the time petitioner raised the issue in a motion for new trial filed after his direct appeal was decided against him. <em>See id. </em>at 2, 3 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Judge Vratil was not obligated to recuse herself when she was unaware of her conflict. Section 455(b)(4) mandates that the judge have knowledge of the financial interest before she is obliged to recuse herself. <em>See Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 859, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988) (section 455(b)(4) requires scienter). Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial when the judge was unaware of the conflict at the time. <em>See Union Carbide Corp. v. U.S. Cutting Serv., Inc., </em>782 F.2d 710, 714 (7th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">By the time the motion for new trial and the section 2255 motion came before Judge Vratil, she had divested herself of the stock that created the conflict. Therefore, \u00a7 455(b)(4) no longer applied. Judge Vratil\u2019s prompt divestment prevented her from having to recuse. This is supported by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(f), which provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">if a judge, after substantial judicial time had been devoted to a matter, discovers or is apprised that she has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the judge divests herself of that financial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\"><em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>169 F.3d 281, 284 n. 3 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also Baldwin Hardware Corp. v. Franksu Enterorise Corp., </em>78 F.3d 550, 556 (Fed.Cir.1996). Thus, even if Judge Vratil\u2019s shares had been in a party, recusal was not necessary because she divested herself of her shares. Petitioner has not shown that Judge Vra-til\u2019s interest in General Electric Company could have been substantially affected by the restitution order in favor of General Electric Capital Leasing. Judge Vratil therefore did not abuse her discretion in declining to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Petitioner has moved for leave to raise issues outside the scope of the grant of COA. We agree with the district court that none of his issues rise to the level of constitutional error, <em>see </em>28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of COA on these issues. Petitioner\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Petitioner has also moved to supplement his brief to add an argument that his sentence violates the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We construe a pro se petitioner\u2019s pleadings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). We understand petitioner\u2019s argument to be that the district court\u2019s calculation of loss resulting from the fraud improperly increased his sentence of imprisonment. The rule of <em>Apprendi </em>is that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See </em>120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Because petitioner\u2019s sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>imprisonment is within the statutory maximum for each conviction, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See United States v. Hishaw, </em>235 F.3d 565 574-75 (10th Cir.2000). Petitioner\u2019s motion to supplement is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
