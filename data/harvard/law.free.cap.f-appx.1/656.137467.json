Wright and his tenant, Leimo-ku, Ltd., brought this action against their neighbor, Lance Dunbar, and various state officials, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1387. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state officials on the \u00a7 1983 claims asserted against them, and directed the entry of final judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). Appeal No. 99-15792 followed. Subsequently, the district court entered summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 and CWA claims asserted against Dunbar. Appellants filed Appeal No. 99-16207. We have jurisdiction over these consolidated appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the rulings of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">1. The district court properly granted summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claims against the state officials, who challenge ownership of the property in dispute. They have presented evidence that the State of Hawaii \u2014 not appellants \u2014 owns the property, thus raising an issue that \u201cimplicates special sovereignty interests.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>521 U.S. 261, 281, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997). To even reach the constitutional question, we would be required to decide who owns the property, a decision which potentially could \u201cdiminish, even extinguish, the State\u2019s control over ... lands and waters long deemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. As in <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, </em>the present action is the \u201cfunctional equivalent of a quiet title action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 281, and we con-elude that \u201c[t]he dignity and status of its statehood allow [Hawaii] to rely on its Eleventh Amendment immunity and to insist upon responding to these claims in its own courts, which are open to hear and determine the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287-88 (Eleventh Amendment barred suit against State and various state agencies and officials where the Tribe sought to establish ownership in land). Thus, the Eleventh Amendment bars the \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">2. The district court also properly granted summary judgment in favor of Dunbar on the \u00a7 1983 claims. Private persons generally do not act \u201cunder color of state law\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983 liability absent \u201c \u2018significant state involvement in the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Knowles, </em>113 F.3d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir.) (quoting <em>Howerton v. Gabica, </em>708 F.2d 380, 382 (9th Cir. 1983)), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 996 (1997). Dunbar participated in a private organization\u2019s project to clean out a nearby stream. The limited use of State equipment and State personnel in the stream cleaning project does not mean that the State has \u201c \u2018so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence -with [Dunbar] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gorenc v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist., </em>869 F.2d 503, 507 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 725, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961)), <em>cert, denied, </em>493 U.S. 899 (1989). Nor can it be said that the State\u2019s limited involvement established a \u201c \u2018sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of [Dunbar] so the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974)). The stream cleaning project was initiated solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>by the private organization and was not proposed, suggested, encouraged, or directed by any State official. Moreover, the mere fact that the State had the power to regulate the activities under its environmental laws does not convert Dunbar\u2019s actions into that of the State. <em>See id. </em>at 507 (\u201c[Regulation alone [does not] confer state action on a private actor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">3. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on appellants\u2019 CWA citizen suit was also proper. We reject appellants\u2019 suggestion that the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 subsequent decision to revoke Dunbar\u2019s nationwide permit somehow rendered invalid all his previous work on the fishpond wall. Appellants\u2019 argument that Dunbar was required to obtain a section 401 water quality certif\u00edcate, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, is equally without merit, given the State Department of Health\u2019s position that it waived the section 401 certification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Moreover, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the presence of the fishpond wall does not constitute an ongoing violation of the CWA. Appellants\u2019 expert on this issue concluded in his 1995 report that the wall was the most likely source of turbidity in the water. In his 1998 deposition, however, the expert retreated from his initial position, conceding at one point that he could not state to a reasonable scientific or engineering probability whether the sediment in the water was coming from the delta, the wall, or from the shoreline. In contrast, Dunbar\u2019s expert testified that the fishpond wall was not presently the cause of any turbidity in the water. We find that, in light of this and other evidence, no reasonable finder of fact could find for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
