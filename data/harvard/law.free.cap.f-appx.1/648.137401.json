Balough, </em>820 F.2d 1485, 1487 (9th Cir.1987). Glessner does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was competent to waive counsel but argues that the court failed to make the requisite record to establish that the waiver was knowing and intelligent. Our review is <em>de novo. See United States v. Springer, </em>51 F.3d 861, 864 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The district court discussed with Glessner the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. It advised him of the possible penalties he faced if convicted. However, the court did not inform Glessner of the nature of the charges against him. While the magistrate judge read the indictment to Glessner, and the district court gave a copy of the indictment to Glessner and told him to read it, neither the magistrate judge nor the district judge explained the charges or ensured that Glessner understood them. Indeed, at the competency hearing less than two months before trial, Glessner said that for some time he had been trying to figure out what he had been charged with and asked for more information, which the court declined to provide. Absent any specific inquiry by the district court on the record, or other facts demonstrating that Glessner was aware of and understood the charges, we lack assurance that Glessner\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. <em>See Balough, </em>820 F.2d at 1487,1489.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Glessner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel having been violated, the judgment must be reversed and the conviction vacated. Ordinarily we would remand for a new trial. However, because Glessner has served most of his sentence, a new trial would be inappropriate and government counsel advised the court at argument that no new trial would be sought. Accordingly, we remand with directions to promptly release Glessner and dismiss the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-17\">. Our disposition makes it unnecessary to address Glessner\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
