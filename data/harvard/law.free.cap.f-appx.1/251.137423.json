We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Fayemi, </em>Nos. CR-94-168; CA-99-343-3-2V (W.D.N.C. July 14, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> Although the district court\u2019s order is marked as \u201cfiled\u201d on July 6, 2000, the district court\u2019s records show that it was entered on the docket sheet on July 14, 2000. Pursuant to Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the date that the order was entered on the docket sheet that we take as the effective date of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Wilson v. Murray, </em>806 F.2d 1232, 1234-35 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
