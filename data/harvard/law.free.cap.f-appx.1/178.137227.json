Warthen and his father, Harry J. Warthen, III, appeal from the adverse decision of the district court for the Western District of Virginia. The War-thens contend that the court erred when, on March 14, 2000, it awarded summary judgment to Larry Dane Smith, II, by virtue of which the Warthens\u2019 judicial liens against Smith, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy debtor, were voided. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. The judicial liens at issue arose as a result of a civil lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. In that action, a jury, on June 30, 1998, awarded judgments to the Warthens, and against Smith, in the sum of $336,722.41. That lawsuit emanated from an automobile accident in which Smith was at fault. The jury award included damages for permanent physical injury suffered by William, a minor at the time of the accident, as well as incidental medical costs expended by his father. The Warthens docketed then-judgments in the land records of Fluvanna County, Virginia, on July 8,1998, and thus obtained judicial liens against Smith\u2019s real property and improvements located near Palmyra, in Fluvanna County (the \u201cReal Property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">Smith has an undivided one-half interest in the Real Property as a tenant-in-eom-mon. The Real Property\u2019s assessed value is $64,600, of which half may be said to have accrued to Smith; it is encumbered, however, by a first mortgage in the sum of $70,768.38. Consequently, Smith has no equity in the Real Property. The mortgage, for which Smith is jointly and severally hable, predates the judicial liens at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-20\">On September 30,1998, Smith petitioned for Chapter 7 liquidation in the bankruptcy court for the Western District of Virginia. Thereafter, Smith filed a \u201cComplaint to Set Aside Preferences,\u201d contending that the \u201cpreferential\u201d transfer of estate assets to the Warthens in satisfaction of then-hens was precluded by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(h). That subsection enables debtors to avoid the transfer of \u201cproperty of the debtor\u201d insofar as the debtor \u201ccould have exempted such property\u201d under certain other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-21\">In response, the Warthens moved to dismiss the Complaint as failing to state a claim upon which rehef could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), <em>incorporated by </em>Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7012(b). The Warthens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>asserted that, because Smith\u2019s complaint did not allege that he actually exempted the Real Property, Smith lacked standing under \u00a7 522(h) to avoid the liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Before the motion to dismiss could be heard, Smith filed an amended complaint, along with a \u201cMotion to Avoid Judicial Liens.\u201d The latter was submitted pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1), which provides that \u201cthe debtor may avoid the fixing of[eertain judicial or other] lien[s] on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under [federal or state law].\u201d The motion and the amended complaint each sought alternative relief under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d) in the event that Smith would not prevail with respect to either \u00a7 522(f) or \u00a7 522(h). Section 506 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">(a) An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest ... is a <em>secured </em>claim to the extent of the value of such creditor\u2019s interest in the estate\u2019s interest in such property ... and is an <em>unsecured </em>claim to the extent that the value of such creditor\u2019s interest ... is less than the amount of such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">(d) to the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an <em>allowed secured </em>claim, such lien is void....</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506 (emphasis added). With no factual issues to be resolved, the dispute centered exclusively on the proper application of the law. Each side moved for summary judgment, asserting that their interpretation was the correct one. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Bank.P. 7056; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">By its Order and Memorandum Opinion of May 21, 1999 (\u201cBR Op.\u201d), the bankruptcy court rejected Smith\u2019s arguments as to \u00a7 522(f) and \u00a7 522(h). The court, in agreement with the Warthens, determined that Smith could not avoid the liens under either subsection because he had failed to take the proper measures to perfect (or even claim) an exemption in the Real Property. Notwithstanding that the two subsections speak of exemptions to which Smith \u201cwould have\u201d been entitled or that he \u201ccould have\u201d otherwise taken, the court concluded that Smith was required to have actually exercised his exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The bankruptcy court nonetheless awarded summary judgment to Smith on the ground that the Warthens\u2019 liens were void under \u00a7 506(d). In so ruling, the court acknowledged the decision in <em>Dewsn-up v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), in which the Supreme Court held that both the secured and unsecured portions of the type of claim referenced in \u00a7 506(a) are, in their totality, a \u201csecured\u201d claim within the meaning of \u00a7 506(d). <em>Id. </em>at 417. The Court concluded that, under the terms of the statute, the $120,000 lien on the debt- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>or\u2019s property could not be partially voided \u2014 \u201cstripped down\u201d \u2014 to reflect its $39,000 value. In other words, a claim that is merely undersecured is still \u201csecured\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 506(d); the attendant lien may only be voided if the claim is not \u201callowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The bankruptcy court distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dewsnwp, </em>concluding that \u00a7 506(d) indeed voided the Warthens\u2019 liens in their entirety because they were not merely undersecured, but \u201cwholly unsecured.\u201d BR Op. at 12. Put another way, inasmuch as the amount of the senior lien created by the mortgage exceeds the value of the Real Property, there is nothing left to secure the War-thens\u2019 claims. Although the stripping down of a lien to some lesser amount is clearly prohibited by <em>Dewsnup, </em>the bankruptcy court discerned nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion that would preclude a worthless lien from being \u201cstripped off\u2019 to effectuate the broad policy goals of the bankruptcy laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> D.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Warthens appealed to the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). By its Memorandum Opinion of March 14, 2000, the district court affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court, concluding that it \u201cproperly avoided appellants\u2019 judicial hen under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d).\u201d Following the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment, the Warthens filed this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">We find ourselves in substantial agreement with the analysis and conclusions of the bankruptcy court, as seconded by the district court. Hence, except where explicitly noted herein, we are content to affirm the judgment below on the reasoning expressed by the lower courts in their memorandum opinions. <em>Smith v. Warthen (In re Smith), </em>No. 98-00093A (Bankr. W.D.Va., May 21, 1999); <em>Smith v. War-then (In re Smith), </em>247 B.R. 191 (W.D.Va. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\">. According to the bankruptcy court, \"The debtor, by not claiming an exemption on this property, has demonstrated his lack of interest in such an exemption. As he has shown no interest in obtaining an exemption, he should not have an interest in protecting one.\u201d BR Op. at 6. The court distinguished <em>Owen v. Owen, </em>500 U.S. 305, 310-11, 111 S.Ct. 1833, 114 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991) (holding that applicability of \u00a7 522(f) depends on whether lien impairs exemption to which debtor would have been entitled, rather than one to which the debtor is entitled in fact), on the ground that the debtor in <em>Owen </em>was precluded by state law from claiming the exemption. Smith\u2019s choice not to pursue an exemption in the Real Property was, by contrast, voluntary. On appeal, Smith has not argued that \u00a7 522 presents us with an alternative ground for affirmance; we therefore express no opinion as to the correctness of the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">. A claim is deemed \"allowed\" if proof thereof is timely filed pursuant to Code section 501, and: (1) no objection is made thereto; or (2) the bankruptcy court, after notice and a hearing, determines the validity of the claim notwithstanding the objection of a party in interest. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502. The lien-voiding mechanism of \u00a7 506(d), however, does not apply to claims disallowed merely because no proof has been filed. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d)(2) (excepting from operation of statute liens evidencing any claim that \"is not an allowed secured claim due <em>only </em>to the failure of any entity to file a proof of such claim under section 501 of this title\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">No proof of the claims at issue were filed by any party. The Warthens maintain that, by the terms of the aforementioned exception, such failure precludes the application of \u00a7 506(d) in this case. The lower courts rejected the Warthens\u2019 position on the ground that Smith\u2019s amended complaint challenging the liens was a suitable proxy for a proof of claim. We agree that the argument advanced by the Warthens does not carry the day, but we think the better rationale is that their claims cannot be classified as \u201callowed secured claims\u201d not <em>only </em>because they were not \"allowed,\u201d but <em>also </em>because they were not \"secured,\u201d as detailed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-17\">. In <em>Dewsnup, </em>the Supreme Court implicitly endorsed the view of the respondents therein that \"the 'fresh start\u2019 policy cannot justify an impairment of [the lienholders\u2019] property rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. In this case, however, the Warthens\u2019 rights are not significantly impaired; if the Real Property were sold at market value, all of the proceeds would be used to satisfy the mortgage debt. Nothing would be distributed to the Warthens.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
