Security, Inc. and Mohammed Islam (\u201cappellants\u201d) appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Carter, J.) entered on February 22, 2000, awarding plaintiff-appellee Debrah Sowemimo (\u201cap-pellee\u201d) judgment in the sum of $6,240.00, and from its order dated May 4, 2000 denying appellants\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law, or for a new trial. <em>See Sowemimo v.
