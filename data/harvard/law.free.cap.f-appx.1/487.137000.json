Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). In <em>Artuz, </em>the Court determined that, where a state application for postconviction or other collateral review meets applicable rules and laws governing such filings, the application is \u201cproperly filed\u201d and thus tolls the statute of repose applicable to habeas corpus petitions regardless of whether the claims contained therein are precluded by procedural bar. <em>Artuz, </em>121 S.Ct. at 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">Upon consideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s determination, we must vacate the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Moreland\u2019s habeas petition as barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>by the statute of repose because More-land\u2019s second state postconviction action tolled the limitations period. Therefore, consideration of the merits of Moreland\u2019s federal habeas petition is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit, and the case is remanded to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
