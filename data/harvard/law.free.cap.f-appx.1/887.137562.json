Haskell\u2019s individual right of action request for corrective action under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989) (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C). Because the Board\u2019s decision to deny the request for corrective action was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unlawful, or unsupported by substantial evidence, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">In November 1995, Mr. Haskell became the Assistant District Director for Investigations, a Supervisory Criminal Investigator position, GS-13, for the Anchorage, Alaska, office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Because he had not served before in a supervisory position, Mr. Haskell was required to serve a probationary period. During the relevant time frame, Jean Hemphill served as the Deputy District Director, and Robert Eddy served as the District Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">In the summer of 1996, Mr. Haskell allegedly made two disclosures. First, Mr. Haskell reported to District Counsel Dorothy Stefan that an arrested illegal alien was found to be carrying an INS business card of Mr. Eddy, which stated in handwritten notation on the back of the card: \u201cAbraham \u2014 Thanks for the T-shirts. Bob.\u201d <em>Haskell v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>SE-1221-98-0023-W-2, slip op. at 8, 24-25 (MSPB June 18,1999) <em>(Haskell).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Second, according to Mr. Haskell and his wife, Mr. Haskell had a conversation with Ms. Hemphill in the driveway of his home, where he asserted that he believed Mr. Eddy had improperly rented a vehicle for a personal family trip. In particular, Mr. Haskell\u2019s wife testified that she overheard Ms. Hemphill responding to Mr. Haskell\u2019s assertion by stating that Mr. Eddy\u2019s use of a rental vehicle might be improper. <em>Haskell, </em>slip op. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Later that same year, Mr. Haskell attended counseling meetings with Mr. Eddy and Ms. Hemphill, who cautioned Mr. Has-kell about his displays of anger. Soon after, via a letter sent by Mr. Eddy, the Department of Justice (DOJ) placed Mr. Haskell on administrative leave. One month later, Mr. Eddy sent another letter to Mr. Haskell, asking him to report for a psychiatric fitness for duty examination in a letter stating: \u201cAlthough the Service is sympathetic to your problems, your violent temper displays and outburst and your inability to focus on performance issues is of great concern.\u201d One day after the psychiatric examination, DOJ terminated Mr. Haskell\u2019s supervisory probation, and subsequently reassigned him as a Criminal Investigator, GS-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">Mr. Haskell appealed his reassignment to the Board, claiming that he was subjected to the psychiatric fitness for duty examination and demoted to a non-supervisory position in retaliation for his two alleged protected disclosures. The administrative judge found that Mr. Haskell made one protected disclosure <em>(i.e., </em>giving Mr. Eddy\u2019s business card to Ms. Stefan) and that it was a contributory factor in the termination of his supervisory probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>and his referral for a psychiatric fitness for duty examination. <em>Haskell, </em>slip op. at 1-2,19.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The administrative' judge also found, however, that DOJ established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action with regard to Mr. Haskell in the absence of his disclosure. <em>Haskell, </em>slip op. at 2. Consequently, Mr. Haskell\u2019s request for corrective action was denied. The full Board denied petitions by both Mr. Haskell and DOJ for review, and issued a final order. <em>Haskell v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>SE-1221-98-0023-W-2 (MSPB October 29, 1999). Mr. Haskell timely appeals to this court under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">This court must affirm any Board decision not found to be: (1) arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; (2) obtained without procedure required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1994); <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). On appeal to this court, Mr. Haskell asserts that the Board erred by: (a) discounting the testimony of Mr. Haskell\u2019s wife on the basis of a familial-pecuniary interest; and (b) failing to address the testimony of a previous INS Deputy District Director, Norbert Lague, regarding an alleged pattern of whistle-blowing retaliation by Mr. Eddy.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">As stated in <em>Wright v. United States Postal Serv., </em>183 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed.Cir.1999), a familial interest, while relevant, is not sufficient to disregard a witness\u2019 testimony. Mr. Haskell contends that the administrative judge discredited Mrs. Haskell\u2019s testimony regarding an alleged conversation between Mr. Haskell and Ms. Hemphill based on a familial-pecuniary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The administrative judge did not, however, discredit Mrs. Haskell\u2019s testimony simply because she was Mr. Haskell\u2019s husband. In his Initial Decision, the administrative judge pointed to five different reasons for finding Ms. Hemphill\u2019s testimony (where she denied having a conversation regarding Mr. Eddy in the Haskell\u2019s driveway) more credible. <em>Haskell, </em>slip op. at 6-7. Only one of the five reasons cited by the administrative judge addressed Mrs. Haskell\u2019s familial interesi&gt;-the second reason stated, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe appellant and, by association, his wife, would enjoy greater career possibilities if the termination of supervisory probation were removed from his record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Because familial interest was not the only factor considered in discrediting her testimony, the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion by considering Mrs. Haskell\u2019s familial interest as a relevant factor in ascertaining credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Mr. Haskell also asserts that the administrative judge erred by failing to address in his decision Mr. Lague\u2019s testimony regarding an alleged pattern by Mr. Eddy of retaliation against whistleblowing. Mr. Haskell also suggests that the administrative judge may have failed to evaluate Mr. Lague\u2019s testimony altogether, in violation of Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">As noted by Mr. Haskel in his brief, the administrative judge admitted the testimony of Mr. Lague at the hearing. Thus, Mr. Lague\u2019s testimony was before the administrative judge and, as stated in the Initial Decision, the administrative judge \u201cconsidered the evidence of record, including the testimony adduced at hearing\u201d in making his decision. <em>Haskell, </em>slip op. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Mr. Haskell contends that the failure by the administrative judge to address the testimony of Mr. Lague was error because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>that testimony was significant in what was an \u201cenormously difficult\u201d credibility call. Moreover, according to Mr. Haskell, the administrative judge concluded that Mr. Eddy had some motivation to retaliate, but not a particularly strong one, <em>id. </em>at 30, and the administrative judge relied significantly on Mr. Eddy\u2019s testimony in concluding that DOJ proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action with Mr. Haskell regardless of his disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The administrative judge, however, did not rely exclusively on Mr. Eddy\u2019s testimony in concluding that DOJ would have taken the same action regarding Mr. Haskell. For example, the administrative judge relied on testimony from other witnesses, such as Ms. Hemphill, who \u201chas been retired from the agency for some time, and can neither reap a benefit by protecting Mr. Eddy, nor suffer a harm for participating in reprisal against the appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 33. In addition, the administrative judge relied on Mr. Haskell\u2019s own statements, a psychiatrist\u2019s report based on Mr. Haskell\u2019s fitness for duty examination, memoranda written by Ms. Hemphill and other DOJ employees who interacted with Mr. Haskell, as well as other information in the record regarding an alleged failure by Mr. Haskell to provide supervisory oversight. Thus, this court finds that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that DOJ submitted clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated Mr. Haskell\u2019s probation in the absence of his disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Mr. Haskell has not shown that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious, or that it involved an abuse of discretion or was otherwise not in accordance with relevant laws, rules, and regulations. Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision to deny the request for corrective action, this court affirms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
