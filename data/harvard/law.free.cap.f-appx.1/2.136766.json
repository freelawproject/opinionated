In any event, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s second motion to reopen, which made no arguments undermining the district court\u2019s dismissal, without prejudice, of appellant\u2019s complaint. <em>See Illinois Dept. of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.
