We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">Mr. Roberto Ulloa-Porras, a citizen of Mexico, first entered the United States in 1975. In 1995, he was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance in violation of Wyo.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 35-7-1031, an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). After serving his state sentence, Mr. Ulloa-Por-ras was released into the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) and deported to Mexico on January 16, 1998. He reentered the United States some ten or eleven months later and was arrested by the INS in 1999. Mr. Ulloa-Porras pled guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with illegal entry of a deported alien into the United States, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and was sentenced to a forty-six month term of imprisonment. He raises four issues on appeal: (1) that the indictment to which he pled was defective under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); (2) that his sentence was imposed in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (3) that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward on the basis of cultural assimilation; and (4) that the United States Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">When Mr. Ulloa-Porras voluntarily entered a guilty plea to the indictment, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>waived all non-jurisdictional defenses, including his defective indictment claim. <em>United, States v. Browning, </em>61 F.3d 752, 753 (10th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>900 F.2d 1524, 1525-26 (10th Cir. 1990)); <em>see also Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (\u201cWhen a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d). Therefore, we need not address Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 argument that the indictment was defective for failure to allege his prior aggravated felony conviction. <em>Cf United States v. Martinez Villalva, </em>232 F.3d 1329, 1331-32 (10th Cir.2000) (rejecting identical defective indictment claim on the merits). Second, we reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that his sentence violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 \u201coverall sentence is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the ... goals [listed in \u00a7 3553(a)], the statute is satisfied.\u201d <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 108, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Mr. Ulloa-Porras also contends that he was entitled to a downward departure under <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726 (9th Cir.1998), in which the Ninth Circuit analogized \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d to \u201cfamily and community ties,\u201d a discouraged factor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6. <em>Id. </em>at 730. \u201cThus, to the extent that cultural assimilation denotes family and community ties, <em>[.Lipman </em>held] that the district court has the authority to depart on this basis in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our analysis of the sentencing court\u2019s denial of Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 motion for a downward departure must begin with the familiar rule that \u201c[a]bsent the trial court\u2019s <em>dear </em>misunderstanding of its discretion to depart, ... we have no jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Coddington, </em>118 F.3d 1439, 1441 (10th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted, emphasis added). Mr. Ulloa-Porras asserts that the sentencing court did not understand its authority to grant his motion for a downward departure on the basis of cultural assimilation. Aplt.Br. at 11. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The record in this case indicates that the sentencing judge agreed with the basic holding in <em>Lipman, </em>but that he did not believe he could depart downward <em>in Mr. Ulloar-Porras\u2019 case. E.g., </em>Tr. of Hr\u2019g at 32 (Mar. 8, 2000) (oral ruling by court) (\u201cI can discern no basis ... to depart in this instance.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 35 (\u201c... I don\u2019t have the authority to depart based on what I know about this case.\u201d). Despite a few critical remarks with respect to <em>Lipman, </em>the sentencing court expressly concurred with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s fundamental premise: that \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d was comparable to \u201cfamily and community ties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31-32 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6). While recognizing that such factors are \u201cnot ordinarily relevant\u201d under the Guidelines, the court noted that they might \u201cbe relevant if they\u2019re present to an unusual degree such that the case is distinguishable from the heartland of cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. In light of the court\u2019s statement that Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 \u201ccase [was] very similar to many other individuals who have appeared in front of me,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33, we are convinced that the court\u2019s refusal to grant Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 motion for a downward departure was discretionary, and that it is therefore unreviewable on appeal. Neither the court\u2019s passing criticisms of <em>Lip-man </em>nor its obvious frustrations with the Guidelines are sufficient bases to conclude that the court believed it could <em>never </em>consider evidence of \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d in support of a motion for a downward depar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ture. <em>Cf. United States v.. Fagan, </em>162 F.3d 1280,1282 (10th Cir.1998) (concluding that a refusal to depart downward was reviewable where the sentencing court \u201cspecifically rul[ed] that it did not have the discretion to consider remorse as a factor to support the downward departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 final argument, that the United States Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi, </em>is also unavailing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (emphasis added). The application of the Guidelines within the permissible statutory range was not before the Court, and the majority in <em>Apprendi </em>\u201ctherefore expressed] no view on the subject beyond what th[e] Court ha[d] already held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2366 n. 21 (citing <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 511, 515, 118 S.Ct. 1475, 140 L.Ed.2d 703 (1998) (noting difference between challenges to sentence in excess of the statutory maximum and sentence within statutory range); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1 (providing that Guidelines sentence may not exceed statutory maximum)). We see no <em>Apprendi </em>problem with the application of the Guidelines in this case. Given Mr. Ulloa-Porras\u2019 prior aggravated felony conviction, the applicable statutory maximum was twenty years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). His actual sentence of forty-six months was well within the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
