We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">1. The district judge\u2019s statements in Acosta\u2019s sentencing hearing regarding whether the departure was available reveal that the judge recognized he had discretion to grant the departure and considered doing so, but chose not to because of his view of Acosta\u2019s involvement in drug trafficking over many years. This decision is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Belden, </em>957 F.2d 671, 676 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">2. Acosta also argues that the district court erred in applying a 2-level gun enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b). The base offense level directed by the career offender guideline for the offense to which Acosta pled guilty is higher than the total offense level that would otherwise have applied. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. The gun enhancement therefore had no effect on Acosta\u2019s sentence, and we need not decide whether the district court erred in applying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">.
