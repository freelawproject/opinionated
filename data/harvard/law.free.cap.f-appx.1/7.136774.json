Finally, the district court denied Kashelkar\u2019s motion to amend his pleadings by adding more exhibits on the ground that the amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-21\">Kashelkar\u2019s complaint alleged substantially the same claims as those he had raised in a previous lawsuit against different defendants, <em>see Kashelkar v. MacCart-ney, </em>79 F.Supp.2d 370 (S.D.N.Y.1999), which was dismissed by Judge McMahon for failure to state a claim. That dismissal was affirmed by this Court, <em>see Kashelkar v. MacCartney, </em>No. 00-7090, 2000 WL 1678774 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">On appeal, Kashelkar maintains that his complaint, with appendices, demonstrated that the defendants violated \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985 and RICO, and that the district court decision was \u201cfactually wrong,\u201d as well as \u201cprejudicial, hostile, and discriminatory towards [him],\u201d and should be reversed. Defendants maintain on appeal that, as the district court held, Kashelkar\u2019s claims were barred by the statutes of limitations and, in any event, were properly dismissed for Kashelkar\u2019s failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The defendants point out that Kashelkar offered no facts to support his civil rights, RICO or negligence claims. Kashelkar filed a reply, which, to the extent it can be understood, restates his arguments on appeal and alleges that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint was itself discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">This Court \u201creviews the dismissal of a complaint under Fed.R.Civ .P. 12(b)(6) de novo,\u201d <em>Stuto v. Fleishman, </em>164 F.3d 820, 824 (2d Cir.1999), and the denial of a motion for leave to amend for abuse of discretion, <em>see Jones v. New York State Div. of Military &amp; Naval Affairs, </em>166 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir.1999). Our review of the record confirms that the findings of the district court were correct with respect to all of Kashelkar\u2019s claims, as well as Kashelkar\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. We therefore affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
