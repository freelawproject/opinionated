CITY OF CHEYENNE; City of Cannon City, Colorado; City of Dale City, Virginia; City of Omaha, Nebraska; State of Virginia; State of Colorado; State of Wyoming; State of Nebraska, Defendants-Appellees.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b889-18\">No. 00-8018.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b889-19\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b889-20\">Jan. 9, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b890-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Before SEYMOUR, EBEL and BRISCOE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b890-13\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"A71\">BRISCOE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">Michael Spencer, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">Spencer filed his original \u00a7 1983 complaint on July 13, 1999, alleging Wyoming officials deprived him of \u201cdue process when they failed to protect and afford him his rights pursuant to the IADA\u201d; the Wyoming officials deprived him of personal property \u201cin violation of the U.S. Constitution\u201d; and that Virginia officials \u201cfraudulently submitted federal documents to Colorado courts\u201d to gain custody of Spencer. Record, Doc. 2 at 3-4. On July 23, 1999, Spencer filed an amended complaint, alleging \u201cunlawful taking of [Spencer] by force and by means of fraud, against his will, by the State of Virginia\u201d; that he was denied and deprived of \u201cdue process to the United States Constitution by Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska\u201d; and \u201cmalicious prosecution by Virginia,\u201d aided and abetted by Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 5 at 3-4. As an amended complaint supersedes the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>nal complaint, only the allegations in the July 23 complaint mil be considered. <em>See Miller v. Glanz, </em>948 F.2d 1562, 1565 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The crux of Spencer\u2019s complaint is his challenge to his parole by Colorado to the state of Virginia pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), a compact among forty-eight states, the United States, and the District of Columbia, \u201cto encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of [outstanding] charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints.\u201d <em>United States v. Coffman, </em>905 F.2d 330, 331 (10th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In dismissing Spencer\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, the district court found he failed \u201cto present the facts that form[ed] the basis of his claims and his conclusory allegations rendered] his complaints largely incomprehensible.\u201d Record, Doc. 31 at 2. The court further found he failed to allege \u201cany personal participation or conduct by any individual defendant,\u201d and \u201chis claims against the states of Virginia, Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, or against state officials in their official capacities [were] barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. With respect to the cities named as defendants, the court found Spencer failed to allege any actions which violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Spencer argues he \u201cfully apprised the court of his severe mental and physical disabilities\u201d and the court failed to provide him \u201cmeaningful access to the courts\u201d by not appointing counsel. \u201cWe review the denial of appointment of counsel in a civil case for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Rucks v. Boergermann, </em>57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir.1995). Factors to be considered in deciding whether to appoint counsel include the merits of the claims, the nature of the factual issues raised in the claims, the litigant\u2019s ability to present the claims, and the complexity of the legal issues raised by the claims. <em>Rucks, </em>57 F.3d at 979. We have reviewed the record and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not appointing counsel for Spencer. Even with appointed counsel, there is little likelihood that Spencer could have prevailed on his claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Spencer also contends the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. \u201cWe review a [Rule] 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo.\u201d <em>Davis-Warren Auctioneers, J.V. v. F.D.I.C., </em>215 F.3d 1159, 1161 (10th Cir. 2000). Our review of the record convinces us that Spencer has failed to state any claim upon which relief could be granted. It appears that Spencer has recognized he cannot recover under \u00a7 1983. In his objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations, he admitted he had four pending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 actions in four separate federal district courts that would determine almost all of the claims he raised in his \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See </em>Record, Doc. 26 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Spencer references in his appellate brief a claim for deprivation of property without due process against the \u201cfour city defendants.\u201d Br. at 17. This issue was not raised in Spencer\u2019s amended complaint and we decline to review the merits of the claim. <em>See Scott v. Hern, </em>216 F.3d 897, 908 n. 5 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">AFFIRMED. Spencer\u2019s emergency motion for \u201cappropriate relief, ex parte\u201d is DENIED. Spencer is reminded of his obligation to continue making partial payments of appellate costs and fees until paid in full. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
