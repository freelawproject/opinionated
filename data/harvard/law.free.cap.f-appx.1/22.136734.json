On appeal, Baez challenges Judge Nevas\u2019s denial of that motion. We review the denial of such a motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Nichols, </em>56 F.3d 403, 414 (2d Cir.1995) (denial of motion under \u00a7 4241 reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Scarpa, </em>913 F.2d 993, 1023-24 (2d Cir.1990) (denial of motion made under related \u00a7 4244 reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Vamos, </em>797 F.2d 1146, 1150-51 (2d Cir.1986) (denial of motion under \u00a7 4247, relating to competence to stand trial, reviewed for abuse of discretion). Such an evaluation is required only if the district court has \u201creasonable cause to believe that the defendant has a mental defect rendering him incompetent.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>56 F.3d at 414. A judge is free to base his decision on his own observations of the defendant. <em>See United States v. Oliver, </em>626 F.2d 254, 258-59 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">On appeal, Baez principally points to four indications of psychiatric difficulties: his 1975 honorable discharge from the Navy citing \u201ccharacter and behavior disorders\u201d; an affidavit from his lawyer stating that Baez suffered \u201cemotional breakdowns\u201d; the disconnect between his life as a successful and respected psychologist and his life as the leader of a violent street gang; and his decision to flee while he was out on bail and awaiting sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">Baez made no mention of any psychiatric difficulties when he accepted the government\u2019s plea agreement. Judge Nevas found that the preparation that went into Baez\u2019s attempt to flee was indicative of rational planning rather than a disturbed mind. As for the remaining indications of incompetence that Baez points to, the district court weighs this evidence in combination with its own observations of Baez and the surrounding circumstances. We have previously upheld decisions under similar circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Scarpa, </em>913 F.2d at 1023-24 (upholding decision to deny request where defendant presented evidence of a suicide attempt, low IQ test scores, minimal education, and a ten year old diagnosis of psychiatric problems); <em>Oliver, </em>626 F.2d at 258 (finding no abuse of discretion where judge denied request for evaluation prior to finding defendant competent to stand trial even though presented with evidence that defendant had lapses of memory, was unresponsive to questions, had difficulty in discussions with counsel, and had a history of heavy drug use). There was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
