Robinson contends the district court committed error in failing to give her advance notice of its intent to depart upward from the 5-to-l 1-month revocation imprisonment range recommended under Chapter 7 of the Guidelines, to a revocation sentence of 12 months imprisonment and 2 years supervised release. This argument is foreclosed by the holdings of this court. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (Chapter 7 Guidelines serve non-binding, advisory role; thus, revocation sentence which exceeds suggested range \u201cis not an \u2018upward departure\u2019 because there is no binding guideline from which to depart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-19\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
