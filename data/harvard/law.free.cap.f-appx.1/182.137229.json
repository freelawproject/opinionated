Booker-Hicks appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s order granting Prince Edward County School Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing her claims of racial discrimination and retaliation filed pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000). We have reviewed the record and the magistrate judge\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the magistrate judge. <em>See Booker-Hicks v. Prince Edward Co. Sch. Bd., </em>No. CA-99-653-3 (E.D.Va. Apr. 24, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We deny Booker-Hicks\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel and her motion requesting that we order the School Board to permit her to conduct further discovery. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-16\"> We note that the magistrate judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (rejecting the \u201cpretext plus\u201d standard). Because we find that Booker-Hicks failed to provide any evidence of pretext whatsoever, the <em>Reeves </em>decision does not undercut the outcome reached by the magistrate judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
