The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b647-24\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-25\">Defendant Segundo Regalado-Frias pleaded guilty to two criminal charges for trafficking in methamphetamine. He appeals the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-26\">Mr. Regalado-Frias received a sentence of 235 months of incarceration. The district judge arrived at this sentence in the following manner: Regalado-Frias had eighteen criminal history points, yielding a criminal history category of six, which indicated a sentencing range of 188 to 235 months, given the drug amounts involved. The district court assigned a sentence at the \u201cupper end\u201d of that range based largely on its assessment of Regalado-Frias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>criminal history; in its view, the defendant\u2019s willingness to violate the law repeatedly indicated that \u201cleniency was not appropriate at all.\u201d Regalado-Frias appeals the decision to impose a sentence at the upper end of the range because he believes that it impermissibly \u201cdouble counted\u201d his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The cases cited by petitioner in support of this argument examine multiple considerations of the same criminal conduct during the calculation of the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines. In contrast, the district court in this case properly calculated an appropriate sentencing range for Regalado-Frias based on his criminal history, and then selected a sentence from that range based on its evaluation of the petitioner\u2019s propensity for recidivism. Even if this involved consideration of certain facts more than once, it does not constitute \u201cdouble counting\u201d as we have defined that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Because the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines is not in question, we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8742(a) allows this court to hear appeals of criminal sentences in four circumstances. Because \u201cnone of [these circumstances] characterizes a district court\u2019s discretionary decision to sentence at a particular place within the applicable Guidelines range,\u201d we are unable to review the district court\u2019s determination of Mr. Regalado-Frias\u2019 sentence within the sentencing range. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>914 F.2d 1288, 1290 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Young, </em>988 F.2d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cThis court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary selection of a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-28\">.
