Carmon raises two issues on appeal: (1) he should be allowed a new hearing because his probation officer allegedly sent him to the wrong court building, causing Carmon to arrive late for the supervised release revocation hearing and allegedly preventing Carmon from informing counsel prior to the hearing that he desired a continuance to obtain certain impeachment material against one of the government\u2019s witnesses; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that Carmon violated the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">As Carmon concedes in his informal brief, the law is well established that this court will not consider on appeal issues not first presented in the district court, absent plain error or where the refusal to consider the issue would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Carmon alleges that he seeks to raise the issue of a new hearing in the first instance before this court because he was not afforded an opportunity to raise the issue at his supervised release violation hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-19\">We have reviewed the record and find that, even assuming Carmon was instructed to go to the wrong courthouse by his probation officer, he did arrive at the proper venue before his hearing substantively began, and there was ample opportunity for him to confer with counsel and address the district court regarding his wish to present impeachment evidence. Moreover, given the testimony of an independent and unchallenged witness regarding Carmon\u2019s role in the assault and battery, which alone would support a finding that Carmon violated the terms of his supervised release, the impeachment evidence Carmon sought to obtain against another witness would not have changed the ultimate disposition of the case. Because Carmon\u2019s reasons for supporting his request for a new hearing do not give rise to an exceptional circumstance, and the denial of the request for the new hearing would not result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice, we deny the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id.; </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp.2000). We find that the district court\u2019s findings that Cannon violated the terms of his supervised release are supported fully by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">While Carmon\u2019s version of the altercation was corroborated by the testimony of his companion at the time, it was directly contradicted by the testimony of the victim of the assault and battery and the independent witness. The district court apparently weighed the contradictory testimony and decided to credit the victim\u2019s version, explicitly finding that Carmon was not truthful. It is not the province of this court to second-guess the credibility determinations of the factfinder. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Accordingly, we find that the district court\u2019s determination that Carmon violated the terms of his supervised release is supported sufficiently by a preponderance of the evidence, and we therefore affirm that determination. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
