Mammano appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2000) action. To state a First Amendment retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) that his speech was constitutionally protected; (2) that he was deprived of some valuable benefit as a result of the speech; and (3) that \u201cbut for\u201d the speech, the Defendants would not have taken the retaliatory actions they did. <em>DiMeglio v. Haines, </em>45 F.3d 790, 804 (4th Cir.1995). Because Mammano failed to proffer facts sufficient to support a finding that he has been deprived of a valuable employment benefit, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
