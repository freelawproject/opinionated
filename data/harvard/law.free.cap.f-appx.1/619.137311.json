Losee, Jr. of two counts of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison. After his unsuccessful pursuit of state-court remedies, <em>see State v. Losee, </em>354 N.W.2d 239 (Iowa 1984), Losee filed this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, and the district court denied relief. Losee raises one issue on appeal. He asserts his trial attorney ineffectively assisted him in deciding to call a psychologist as a witness. In response to a hypothetical question on cross-examination, the psychologist testified Losee\u2019s personality profile conducted four years earlier was associated \u201cwith poorly-executed crimes that exhibit a great deal of savagery and homicidal intents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">To prevail on his ineffective assistance claim, Losee must show both that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficient performance actually prejudiced him. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Applying <em>Strickland, </em>the Iowa Supreme Court rejected Losee\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on the merits. <em>See </em>354 N.W.2d at 244-45. We may not grant habeas relief on the claim unless the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, the standard articulated by the [United States] Supreme Court in <em>Strickland.\u201d Owens v. Dormire, </em>198 F.3d 679, 681 (8th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied </em>530 U.S. 1265, 120 S.Ct. 2725, 147 L.Ed.2d 988 (2000); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (Supp. III 1997). We conclude the state court did not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>Strickland </em>unreasonably. Even if the attorney\u2019s decision to call the witness was deficient, Losee cannot show a reasonable probability that he would have been acquitted absent admission of the psychologist\u2019s testimony, given the other evidence against him. <em>See </em>354 N.W.2d at 244. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Losee\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
