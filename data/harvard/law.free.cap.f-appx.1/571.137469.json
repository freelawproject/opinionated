The Osloonds claimed defendants conspired to deprive them of their property without due process and in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, by seizing certain vehicles from a storage unit pursuant to a state court writ of execution, and later selling them at a sheriffs auction. Upon de novo review, we agree with the district court that the Os-loonds have failed to show defendants violated any federal statutory or constitutional right. <em>See Johnson v. Outboard Marine Corp., </em>172 F.3d 531, 535-36 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review; alleged facts or evidence must suggest violation of rights under Constitution or United States statutes as prerequisite to \u00a7 1983 liability). Because the seizure occurred under a valid writ of execution, and a post-deprivation remedy was available, there was no violation of the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments. <em>See id. </em>at 536-37 (seizure was not unreasonable where sheriff erroneously seized third party\u2019s boat located on property levied under valid writ of execution; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>post-deprivation hearing satisfied due process); S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 15-18-31 (1984) (third party may claim ownership of levied property in trial by special jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-16\">. The HONORABLE KAREN E. SCHREIER, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
