Williams violated a release condition based on her failure successfully to participate in a community corrections center program. Following a revocation hearing at which she stipulated to the violation, the district court revoked supervised release and imposed 16 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>imprisonment and 20 months additional supervised release. Williams challenges her sentence on appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">When a district court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a supervised release condition, the district court may revoke supervised release and impose imprisonment without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Having reviewed the record and Williams\u2019s brief, we conclude her revocation sentence neither exceeds the limits of section 3583(e), nor constitutes an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 472, 3559(a), 3583(e)(3), 3583(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We thus affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
