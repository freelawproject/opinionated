The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-24\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>petitioner Willie James Williams seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to enable him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Williams is not entitled to a COA unless he can make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Williams can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1603-04, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Williams challenged the decision by a state Joint Committee on Special Claims denying his claims for damages in the amounts of $999,000,000 and $100,000,000,000. Williams\u2019 claims involved allegations that state prison officials lost his legal papers. Although the district court acknowledged that Williams had failed to exhaust his state remedies, the court concluded that Williams\u2019 petition failed to allege any violation of federal law that is properly brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and dismissed the petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">This court has reviewed Williams\u2019 request for a COA and accompanying brief and has conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order and the entire record on appeal. On appeal, Williams has failed to identified any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, and this court finds none. Accordingly, this court denies Williams\u2019 request for a COA for substantially those reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order dated October 30, 2000, and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
