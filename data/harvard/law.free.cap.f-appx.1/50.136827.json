Newell appeals from the sentence of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Berman, /.) imposed June 1, 2000, sentencing him following his guilty plea to 77 months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Newell argues on appeal that his sentence violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. Because he failed to raise this objection in the district court, he forfeited this argument; however, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), this Court may exercise its discretion to review his argument if the error alleged constituted \u201cplain error[] ... affecting substantial rights.\u201d For the reasons explained below, we find that the district court committed no error in its imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Newell argues that his sentence of 77 months violates the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition because it is greater than the statutory maximum in effect before September 1994, when \u00a7 1326(b)(l)\u2019s maximum penalty was increased from five years to ten years. <em>See </em>Violent Crime Control and Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 130001(b), 108 Stat. 1796, 2023 (Sept. 13, 1994) (amending \u00a7 1326(b)(1) to increase the maximum penalty from five years to ten years). Newell argues that he should be sentenced based on \u00a7 1326(b)(1) as it existed when he reentered the country in November 1992, thus prior to September 1994. This argument is based partially on a document, alleged to have informed the Immigration and Nationalization Service (\u201cI.N.S.\u201d) of his location in the United States, dated December 1994. Newell contends, first, that he should be considered \u201cfound in\u201d the United States as of that date and, second, that he should be \u201ccredited\u201d with three months because of his allegation that the I.N.S. failed to exercise due diligence in locating him. He bases his due diligence argument on the fact that he was arrested under an alias in Massachusetts in March 1993, and the I.N.S. should have noted his presence in the United States then.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Section 1326 provides that the offense of illegal re-entry is complete when \u201cany of three events occurs: when a previously deported alien (1) \u2018enters,\u2019 or (2) \u2018attempts to enter,\u2019 or(3) \u2018is at any time found in\u2019 the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Ventura, </em>72 F.3d 277, 281 (2d Cir.1995). \u201c[T]he offense of being \u2018found in\u2019 the United States in violation of \u00a7 1326(a) is not complete until the authorities both discover the illegal alien in the United States, and know, or with the exercise of due diligence typical of law enforcement authorities, could have discovered, the illegality of his presence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282 (internal citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Santana-Castellano, </em>74 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1996) (holding that a previously deported alien is \u201cfound in\u201d the United States when his presence is discovered and noted by immigration authorities, and knowledge of illegality, through due diligence, can be attributed to immigration authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">To dispose of Newell\u2019s argument, we can assume <em>arguendo, </em>that Newell was \u201cfound\u201d in the United States on December 8, 1994 as he asserts. His argument that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>should be \u201ccredited\u201d for three months because of what he alleges to be a lack of due diligence in locating him on the part of the I.N.S. and be considered \u201cfound\u201d on September 8, 1994 is entirely without merit or support. First, as demonstrated by the quoted portion of <em>Rivera-Ventura, </em>72 F.3d at 281, set forth above, the due diligence requirement primarily applies to the I.N.S.\u2019 bfforts in discovering the illegality of his presence, not to locating him. Second, in any event, the I.N.S. did not fail to exercise due diligence. <em>Cf. United States v. Bencomo-Castillo, </em>176 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (10th Cir.1999) (alien who was arrested under an alias and not discovered by I.N.S. until more than one year later was not \u201cfound\u201d at the time of his arrest). Therefore, even if we accept for argument\u2019s sake that Newell was \u201cfound\u201d on December 8, 1994, his crime was completed as of that date, and he was sentenced properly based on \u00a7 1326(b)(1) as it existed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In the alternative, we could also assume for the sake of argument that Newell\u2019s use of his invalid alien registration card at the time he reentered the country in November 1992 gave the I.N.S. notice of his physical presence but not of the illegality of that presence. <em>See United States v. Acevedo, </em>229 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir.2000). Even under this assumption, however, the record fails to substantiate the notion that the I.N.S. failed to exercise the \u201cdiligence typical of law enforcement authorities.\u201d <em>Rivera-Ventura, </em>72 F.3d at 282; <em>see United States v. Yu-Leung, </em>51 F.3d 1116, 1121 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he error must be so plain that the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant\u2019s timely assistance in detecting it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Under either assumption, no <em>ex post fac-to </em>clause violation exists. <em>See Collins v. Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 42, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990) <em>(ex post facto </em>clause prohibits punishment that was made more burdensome after the crime was committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Finally, Newell\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a lower sentence based on the notice of possible penalties given to him at the time of his deportation is without merit. <em>See United States v. Cruz-Flores, </em>56 F.3d 461, 463-64 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
