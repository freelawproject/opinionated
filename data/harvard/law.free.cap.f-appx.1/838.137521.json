Upon consideration, we conclude that petitioner has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and we deny his application for a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1603-04, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">In 1990, Mr. Moore was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree (Count I), five counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (Counts II \u2014 VI), and one count of maiming (Count VII). The charges arose out of a single incident in which Mr. Moore drove his car through the wall of an apartment, killing one occupant and injuring five others. One of the occupants, a seventeen-year-old girl, was severely injured when the car struck the back of her right leg, nearly amputating the limb. Tr. at 202, 207-08. Following the jury\u2019s recommendations, the trial court sentenced Mr. Moore to seven consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>terms: thirty years for Count I, no less than twenty years each for Counts II through VI, and twenty-five years for Count VII. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed Mr. Moore\u2019s conviction and sentences. His application for state post-conviction relief was denied, and the OCCA again affirmed on appeal. In 1997, he filed the present petition in federal court; the district court dismissed the petition and denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Mr. Moore raises three arguments in his application to this court. First, he argues that <em>Flores v. State, </em>896 P.2d 558, 562 (Okla.Crim.App.1995), requires that his conviction be reversed on the basis of the trial court\u2019s instruction that the defendant was \u201cpresumed to be not guilty\u201d rather than \u201cpresumed innocent.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 18. Second, he asserts that his \u201cTrial and Appellate Counsel were both ineffective ... for failure to conduct an adequate legal research investigation of \u2018presumed to be not guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Finally, Mr. Moore argues that he was improperly punished seven times for a single act. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Under OMahoma law, the defendant waives all claims that could have been \u2014 but were not \u2014 raised on direct appeal. Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1086; <em>e.g., Slaughter v. State, </em>969 P.2d 990, 999 (Okla. Crim.App.1998). Mr. Moore did not object to the trial court\u2019s \u201cpresumed to be not guilty\u201d instruction, nor did he challenge the instruction on direct appeal. Accordingly, when the OCCA affirmed the lower court\u2019s denial of Mr. Moore\u2019s application for post-conviction relief, the court held that Mr. Moore had \u201cwaived and bypassed the right to assert the issue and it may not be the basis of this post-conviction application.\u201d <em>Moore v. Oklahoma, </em>No. PC 96-1500, slip op. at 3 (Okla.Crim.App. Feb. 18, 1997). The doctrine of procedural default prohibits a federal court, on habeas review, from considering claims which the state\u2019s highest court declined to reach because of an adequate and independent state procedural defect, unless the habeas petitioner can meet the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Mr. Moore appears to argue that because <em>Flores </em>established a new rule in 1995, he could not have objected to the trial court\u2019s instruction in 1990. This argument arises under state law. <em>See Walker v. State, </em>933 P.2d 327, 338 (Okla.Crim. App.1997) (holding that <em>\u201cFlores </em>simply reiterated and enforced long standing case law and statutory rules\u201d and that a pre<em>Flores </em>failure to challenge a \u201cpresumed not guilty\u201d instruction was waiver). It is therefore an inadequate basis for federal habeas relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Mr. Moore then asserts that his trial and appellate counsels\u2019 failure to conduct adequate legal research regarding the \u201cpresumed to be not guilty\u201d instruction was constitutionally deficient under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and that he was thereby prejudiced. We recently considered and rejected an identical argument in <em>Sherrill v. Hargett, </em>184 F.3d 1172, 1175-76 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1009, 120 S.Ct. 507, 145 L.Ed.2d 392 (1999). Although an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, if meritorious, is \u201ccause\u201d excusing procedural default, <em>United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir.1996), the district court properly concluded that Mr. Moore\u2019s ineffective assistance of <em>appellate </em>counsel claim was without merit. <em>Moore v. Hargett, </em>No. 97-CV-273-K, slip op. at 13-14 (N.D.Okla. Mar. 31, 2000) (Doc. 19). \u201c[I]t was reasonable for petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel to rely on the general principle that an instruction using the particular phrase \u2018presumption of inno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>cence\u2019 is not required\u201d to preserve his constitutional rights. <em>Sherrill, </em>184 F.3d at 1176. Given that Mr. Moore had different trial and appellate counsel, however, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of <em>trial </em>counsel claim is barred by procedural default. Doc. 19 at 14-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Third, Mr. Moore asserts that he was improperly punished seven times for a single act. Aplt. Br. at 19.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The OCCA rejected this claim on the merits in Mr. Moore\u2019s direct appeal. <em>Moore v. Oklahoma, </em>No. CF 90-1098, slip op. at 10-11 (Okla.Crim.App. Feb. 28, 1994). In his brief to this court, Mr. Moore relies primarily on state authority, including a lengthy quote from a dissenting opinion in an unidentified case. Aplt. Br. at 19.5-.6. Although the quote includes a number of citations to federal double jeopardy cases, none of those cases indicates that the OCCA\u2019s state law-based rejection of the multiple punishments argument \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We therefore reject this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Mr. Moore\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b865-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\">. Mr. Moore's brief includes several inserted pages, including six between pages 19 and 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
