We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The time periods for filing notices of appeal are governed by Fed .R.App.P. 4. These periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). Parties to civil actions are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). The only exceptions to the appeal period are when the district court extends the time to appeal upon a motion made within thirty days of the appeal period, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period upon a motion filed within 180 days of the judgment, or within seven days of the receipt of notice, whichever is earlier, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The district court entered its order on October 5, 1999. Appellant filed his notice of appeal on April 19, 2000, which is beyond both the thirty-day appeal period and the 180-day period within which to move the district court to reopen the appeal period. Because Appellant failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny his motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
