We add only that even if judgment had not been entered previously by the state court, appellant received everything she was entitled to receive under R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 12-25-6(b) (1998); no alleged promises by state officials or others can change that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>and her misunderstanding of the terms of the settlement cannot alter our analysis. Given this, any alleged error by the district court in ordering certain subpoenas quashed is harmless at best. Despite appellant\u2019s reasonable criticisms of the adequacy and speed of the victim\u2019s compensation system in Rhode Island, this court obligated to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"><em>Affirmed.
