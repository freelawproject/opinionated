Scheindlin, <em>District </em>Judge). Gonzalez was convicted on October 7, 1991, in New York Supreme Court, New York County (Bookson, J.), following trial, of Murder in the Second Degree under N.Y.P L. \u00a7 125.25[1], and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of twenty years to life. On direct appeal, Gonzalez argued that his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him was violated when the trial court permitted a police officer to testify that a non-testifying third party had indicated through gestures that Gonzalez had shot the murder victim. The Appellate Division affirmed, rejecting his claim as both unpreserved and harmless. <em>See People v. Gonzalez, </em>225 A.D.2d 417, 418, 641 N.Y.S.2d 5 (1st Dep\u2019t 1996). Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals was denied. <em>See People v. Gonzalez, </em>88 N.Y.2d 936, 647 N.Y.S.2d 169, 670 N.E.2d 453 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">This habeas petition, filed in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, raises the same Confrontation Clause claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>was rejected on direct appeal. The district court held that the habeas petition was procedurally barred because the Appellate Division found the claim unpre-served, and the petitioner had failed to allege cause or prejudice for the procedural default. We shall only summarize those facts most relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On July 10, 1989, shortly after Louis Paulino was shot, Police Officer Brattasia-ni arrived at the scene of the shooting. He testified at trial that a man, identified as Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez, approached him at the scene, handed him a photograph of the petitioner, and pointed to the scene of the shooting. Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez wrote petitioner Julio Gonzalez\u2019s name and address for the Officer. Because Officer Brattasiani did not understand Spanish, Brattasiani pantomimed a pistol with his hand and pointed to the photograph. Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez nodded his assent. Brattasiani then gave the photograph to his supervisor, Detective Small. Two other people, Cesar and Maria Perez, testified that they had witnessed the shooting. After Detective Small showed them the photograph separately, each identified the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The trial court permitted the introduction of the testimony that Perez had been shown the photograph, and that Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez had nodded in assent to Brattasiani\u2019s pantomime, after defense counsel had \u201copened the door\u201d by using the picture to discredit Maria Perez\u2019s testimony of her identification of petitioner at a subsequent line-up. Five days later, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the pantomime testimony with the following instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">I now instruct you as follows, with respect to the testimony of Officer Bratta-siani, that at the time that he came upon this incident ... he spoke with an individual by the name of Gonzalez, I charge you that you may only consider as evidence only those statements by Mr. Gonzalez \u2014 that\u2019s the individual who spoke with Mr. Brattasiani \u2014 which relate to the identification of the individual portrayed in the photograph that Mr. Gonzalez handed to Officer Brattasiani. Nothing else, no other conversation, no hand motion, no intimations, nothing else is to be considered by you, and any other testimony you must dismiss from your minds and disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The district court determined that the issue of \u201cwhether or not the admission of [Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez\u2019s nodding in assent to Officer Brattasiani\u2019s pantomime] rises to the level of constitutional error, it can provide no basis for habeas review. The Appellate Division expressly held that the alleged error was both \u2018unpreserved and harmless.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>People v. Gonzalez, 225 </em>A.D.2d 417, 418, 641 N.Y.S.2d 5 (1st Dep\u2019t 1996)). Because the petitioner did not then allege cause for the non-compliance with a state procedural rule, and prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation, <em>see Coleman v.. Thompson, 501 </em>U.S. 722, 747-48, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <em>Roman v. Abrams, </em>822 F.2d 214, 222 (2d Cir.1987), or a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989), the district court held that he was procedurally barred from raising the issue on habeas. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\u201c[A]n adequate and independent finding of procedural default will bar federal habeas review of the federal claim, unless the habeas petitioner can show cause for the default, and prejudice attributable thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Under <em>Harris, </em>\u201ca procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on ... habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u2018clearly and expressly\u2019 states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263 (citing <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi </em>472 U.S. 320, 327, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Here, the Appellate Division\u2019s decision rested on a state procedural bar, which was clearly and expressly stated. The Appellate Division wrote: \u201c[Sjince the court ultimately instructed the jury to disregard the declarant\u2019s gesture, limiting instructions that defendant did not challenge, and since the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, the error was both unpreserved and harmless.\u201d <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>225 A.D.2d at 418, 641 N.Y.S.2d 5. This statement was plainly adequate to announce that the petitioner\u2019s claim was procedurally barred. <em>See Glenn v. Bartlett, </em>98 F.3d 721, 724 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Neither here nor in the district court has the petitioner asserted cause and prejudice for its procedural default. Nor does petitioner assert that the New York laws regarding preservation of error are not \u201cfirmly established.\u201d Nor does petitioner assert that he is actually innocent, which would permit habeas review notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to assert cause and prejudice. <em>See Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986). Petitioner claims only that the Appellate Division improperly concluded that the error was not preserved. But the law is plain that in the absence of a showing of cause and prejudice, we may not review the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim in the face of a state procedural bar. <em>See Edwards v. Carpenter, </em>529 U.S. 446, 120 S.Ct. 1587, 1591, 146 L.Ed.2d 518 (2000). While an exception to that rule exists if the petitioner can demonstrate a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. at 262, or if the state procedural rule was not \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed,\u201d <em>Ford v. Georgia, </em>498 U.S. 411, 423-24, 111 S.Ct. 850, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991); <em>James v. Kentucky, </em>466 U.S. 341, 348 \u2014 49, 104 S.Ct. 1830, 80 L.Ed.2d 346 (1984), neither situation is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">A state court\u2019s finding of procedural default may be deemed \u201cinadequate\u201d if a reviewing court finds that determination is not supported by a \u201cfair or substantial basis in state law.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Lewis, </em>188 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.1999). Here a fair or substantial basis existed, as the petitioner did not object to the court\u2019s curative instructions or move for a mistrial on the ground that the curative instructions were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Because we find that the Confrontation Clause claim is procedurally barred, we do not reach petitioner\u2019s other claims. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
