Jesse Daniel ROBARDS, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b136-10\">No. 00-7103.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b136-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b136-12\">Submitted Dec. 15, 2000.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b136-13\">Decided Jan. 4, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-21\">Jesse Daniel Robards, pro se. Banuma-thi Rangarajan, Assistant United States Attorney, Raleigh, NC, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b136-22\">Before MOTZ and KING, Circuit Judges, and HAMILTON, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b136-23\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b136-24\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b136-25\">Jessie D. Robards appeals from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000) motion, attacking on numerous grounds his conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3). For the following reasons, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-26\">Regarding Robards\u2019 claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal following his sentencing, the district found that Robards failed to show prejudice, citing <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), as authority for this position. This finding was erroneous, however, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993). In <em>Peak, </em>we held that counsel\u2019s failure to pursue an appeal requested by a defendant constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel regardless of the likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Id. </em>Thus, if counsel promises to note an appeal and then fails to do so, petitioner is entitled to relief in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>a belated appeal. <em>Id; see also Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029,145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for compliance with this opinion and <em>Peak. </em>We decline to address any other claims on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
