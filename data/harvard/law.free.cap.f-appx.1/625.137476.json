He argues the record compels the finding that he was persecuted on account of his actual and imputed political opinion. He also argues that the BIA erred, as a matter of law, in holding that he must prove a threat of country-wide persecution to be eligible for asylum. We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We grant the petition for review and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">I. ACTUAL POLITICAL OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Luna-Castro was not persecuted, and does not have the requisite fear of persecution, on account of his political opinion. The only evidence in the record of Luna-Castro\u2019s actual opinion is his statement that he was a peaceful person and did not \u201cwant to help the guerrillas.\u201d That Luna-Castro resisted or refused to assist the guerrillas does not, without additional support, provide sufficient evidence of a political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">II. IMPUTED POLITICAL OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">The BIA did not discuss whether Luna-Castro might be eligible for asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>or withholding of deportation based on imputed political opinion. However, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that he was persecuted for this reason. Evidence of \u201cpolitical revenge\u201d may be sufficient to show persecution on account of imputed political opinion. <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 934 (9th Cir.2000). Although persecution of an applicant\u2019s family members is also highly probative in determining asylum eligibility on the basis of imputed political opinion, the evidence must show the persecutors imputed a political opinion to the applicant himself. <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 659 n. 18 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">While the record contains some evidence that the guerrillas held a grudge against Luna-Castro and his family based on his brother\u2019s military service, that evidence does not prove the guerrillas\u2019 conduct was motivated by political revenge. Rather, the bulk of the evidence points to the apolitical, economic motives of the guerrilla persecutors. Luna-Castro testified that when the guerrillas came to his family\u2019s house they asked \u201cthat we give them food, clothing, money.\u201d Only when the family objected did the guerrillas mention that they were looking for Luna-Castro\u2019s brother. Further, Luna-Castro testified that other villagers, who had no family members in the military, were wounded by the guerrillas in the same raid.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In short, Luna-Castro has not demonstrated that the evidence compels the conclusion he was persecuted on account of actual or imputed political opinion. Accordingly, we affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of political asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\">.
