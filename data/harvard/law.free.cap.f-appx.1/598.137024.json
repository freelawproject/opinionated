Allison declined a transfer to a new job position at Treadco, Inc. After Allison retired, he brought this action against Tre-adco asserting age discrimination and constructive discharge. The district court granted Treadco summary judgment, concluding Allison failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on the questions of constructive discharge and pretext. On appeal, Allison contends he presented a jury question on whether Treadco had created an intolerable work environment that forced him to resign and whether the transfer decision was a pretext for discrimination. We agree with the district court that Allison failed to put forth evidence to show an objective person would have felt forced to quit. There was no evidence the new position required Allison to perform duties he was incapable of performing, or that Treadco could reasonably foresee Allison would resign as a consequence of the reassignment. Indeed, the evidence showed Treadco made the reassignment to continue providing Allison with a company vehicle to drive to work after the manager, who allowed Allison to drive his company truck as a courtesy, was replaced with a new manager who needed to drive the manager\u2019s truck. Further, the reassignment involved no decrease in salary or benefits, Allison had performed many of the duties of the new job before, and Allison did not ask to remain in his old position. Allison also failed to present evidence that Treadco\u2019s reason for reassigning Allison was both incorrect and a pretext for intentional age discrimination. We thus affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s summary judgment opinion and order. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
