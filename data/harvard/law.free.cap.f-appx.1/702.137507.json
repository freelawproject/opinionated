Meyer has not waived the arguments she raised before the district court and this court. The Social Security Appeals Council has a duty to examine the entire record in determining whether to grant review, even if the claimant has not specified those issues as to which she thinks the ALJ erred. <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103,120 S.Ct. 2080, 2086, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">2. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Dr. Greils\u2019 conclusion that Meyer suffers from an incapacitating mental impairment. The ALJ found that Greils\u2019 conclusion that the organic brain syndrome is incapacitating was inconsistent both with Greils\u2019 concurrent finding of a Global Assessment Functioning level of 70 (indicating that Meyer suffers only from mild psychological symptoms), and with the activities in which Meyer engages. These are clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Greils\u2019 uncon-tradicted evidence. <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035,1041 (9th Cir.1995). Contrary to Meyer\u2019s representation, no other doctor concluded that she suffers from an organic brain syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">3. Because he provided specific, cogent reasons for doing so, the ALJ did not err in discrediting Meyer\u2019s testimony regarding her pain. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1996). The administrative record supports the ALJ\u2019s findings that: (1) Meyer\u2019s treating doctors found that her pain was disproportionate to her medical condition; (2) there was evidence that she was eager not to return to work and that she was malingering; and (3) there was reason to believe that Meyer was motivated by \u201csecondary gain,\u201d the attention and sympathy one gains from having an illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">4. Because the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Meyer can return to her past relevant work is supported by substantial evidence, he was not required to call a vocational expert to testify about the jobs available to her in the national economy. <em>Crane v. Shalala, </em>76 F.3d 251, 255 (9th Cir.1996). We therefore need not consider the sufficiency of the hypothetical question the ALJ posed to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"AzS\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-16\">.
