The district court did not err in failing to establish a factual basis before accepting Vergara-Sosa\u2019s guilty plea because a trial judge is only required to establish the factual basis for an offense before entering judgment against the defendant. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(f). The district court found a sufficient factual basis before entering judgment based on the colloquy during the change of plea hearing and the presen-tence report. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-26\">Rule 11(f) states: \u201cNotwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such a plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d The Advisory Committee notes to the 1974 amendments to this rule explain that the factual basis inquiry \u201cmight be made of the defendant, of the attorneys for the government and the defense, of the presentence report when one is available, or by whatever means is appropriate in a specific case.\u201d The plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>language of the rule and the Advisory Committee notes, therefore, clearly contemplate the scenario where a judge establishes the factual basis after accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">A district court judge may look to the presentence report when establishing the factual basis for a conviction. <em>See Burton v. United States </em>483 F.2d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.1973) (reh\u2019g granted). The district court found a sufficient factual basis before entering judgment based on the colloquy during the change of plea hearing and the presentence report. VergaraSosa argues that <em>Burton </em>should not control because <em>Burton </em>ignored the heightened procedural protections for plea agreements created by <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969) and no longer represents the law of this circuit. We reject this argument insofar as it fails to recognize a crucial distinction between case law interpreting Rule 11(c) and cases dealing with 11(f). <em>McCarthy </em>concerned Rule 11(c) which explicitly requires the judge to inform a defendant of his constitutional rights before accepting his guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 89 S.Ct. 1166. <em>Burton </em>remains good law because it is limited to the 11(f) context.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
