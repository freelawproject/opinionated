The SSA determined that Cook was not entitled to benefits. Cook requested a hearing by an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and was represented by counsel in a January 14, 1997 hearing. Although Cook\u2019s treating physician, Dr. S. Gohar, concluded that Cook was disabled, the ALJ found that this conclusion was not supported by his records, clinical findings or other evidence during the relevant time period before March 31, 1994, the date her insured status expired. The ALJ concluded that Cook retained the residual functional capacity to return to her past work on March 31, 1994. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner when the Appeals Council denied Cook\u2019s request for review on August 28, 1998. On August 3, 1999, the District Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Cook was not disabled and granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>In reviewing the denial of Social Security benefits by the Commissioner, this Court conducts a plenary review of the administrative record. We \u201cset aside [an] ALJ\u2019s decision only where it is based upon legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Balsamo v. Chater, </em>142 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">An ALJ, however, \u201ccannot reject a treating physician\u2019s diagnosis without first attempting to fill any clear gaps in the administrative record.\u201d <em>Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir.1999). There was such a gap in this case. In 1997, Dr. Gohar, Cook\u2019s treating physician since 1987, submitted a one page boiler-plate letter stating that Cook could not return to her past work and that she was unable to perform other full-time work because of \u201ctotal\u201d limitations. Dr. Gohar also submitted an evaluation of her residual functioning capacity in 1996 that corresponded with this assessment. The ALJ rejected Dr. Gohar\u2019s assessment as to the period before March 31, 1994 because he found that \u201cDr. Gohar\u2019s assessments are not consistent with the clinical and laboratory findings included in the records of his treatment.\u201d In short, the ALJ found that the medical records provided did not indicate that her conditions prevented her from performing her past relevant work on or before March 31,1994. Cook submitted evidence from 1991 and 1992 documenting her back and neck pain resulting from a car accident and her treatment for depressive disorder. Cook also submitted assessments by other physicians finding that she is unable to perform a full range of sedentary work, but the ALJ noted that those opinions were made well after Cook met the earnings requirement. None of those additional opinions indicated they were retroactive to 1994. Notably, however, Dr. Gohar\u2019s 1997 assessment leaves blank the date he believes her total disability to have begun. Dr. Gohar\u2019s September 21, 1996 evaluation of her residual functioning capacity also provides no indication of when her disability began to limit her capacity to perform work.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">A further inconsistency arises from Dr. Gohar\u2019s varying statements about his support of Cook\u2019s foster care application. In 1994, Dr. Gohar completed a foster/ adoptive parent medical form, in which he stated that Cook did not have a psychiatric/ behavior disorder and that it was his general impression that Cook\u2019s health was excellent. The ALJ relied upon this form in rejecting Dr. Gohar\u2019s more recent assertions that Cook was, in fact, disabled. In her application for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision before the Appeals Council, Cook submitted an additional letter, dated April 7, 1997, by Dr. Gohar. Dr. Gohar explained that he believes that Cook suffers \u201cfrom deep seated reactive Depression and should be considered totally disabled.\u201d Dr. Gohar acknowledged his statement on her foster care application, but explained that he \u201csuggested and helped her for foster parenting back in 1994 ... [i]n hoping that taking care of a child might help her to be functional ...\u201d The Appeals Council considered this new evidence but found that the decision of the ALJ was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Given Cook\u2019s 1991-92 history, the lack of clarity in the record as to the period covered by Dr. Gohar\u2019s 1996 and 1997 assessments, and the discrepancy between those assessments and Dr. Gohar\u2019s 1994 evaluation, the ALJ should have directed Cook or her attorney to ask Dr. Gohar to clarify whether his later assessments of Cook\u2019s condition apply to the relevant time period and the clinical basis for those assessments, and to explain any inconsistencies between these evaluations and his earlier evaluation of her. <em>See Rosa, </em>168 F.3d at 80; <em>Hartnett v. Apfel, </em>21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>F.Supp.2d 217, 221-22 (E.D.N.Y.1998). Once Dr. Gohar submits this information, the ALJ should reweigh all of the evidence including the other physicians\u2019 assessments of the disabling condition after 1996. <em>See Arnone v. Bowen, </em>882 F.2d 34, 39 (2d Cir.1989) (evidence regarding a claimant\u2019s condition after the period for which the claimant is seeking disability can be relevant to the question of whether the claimant was disabled prior to the date last insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We believe a remand to the Commissioner for further development of this evidence is appropriate. Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the District Court with instructions to remand the matter to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Once Dr. Gohar submits additional information, the ALJ should reweigh all of the evidence, including Dr. Gohar\u2019s 1997 letter explaining his statements on Cook\u2019s foster care application. In so doing, however, we express no view on the merits of the appellant\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
