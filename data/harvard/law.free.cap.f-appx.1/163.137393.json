Orr was convicted for his role in three separate robberies which left one man dead and two other men with gunshot wounds. On appeal, Orr suggests that the district court erred in imposing sentence on his second and third firearms charges. Orr also contends that the district court committed reversible error in denying his Fed. R.Crim.P. 29 motion for acquittal on those two counts. Additionally, Orr suggests that the district court improperly instructed the jury in describing the charges under \u00a7 924(c) as \u201cdrug trafficking offenses\u201d and failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on a lesser included offense. Finding no merit to any of Orr\u2019s contentions, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">Orr first suggests that his conviction and sentence violate the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215,143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), the Court held that, under the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2119 (West Supp.2000), certain penalty-enhancing factors (the existence of death or serious bodily injury) are additional elements of the offense rather than sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52. In so finding, the Court relied on the principle that \u201cany fact (other than a prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 243 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In this case, however, Orr\u2019s increased penalties for the second and third counts were applicable solely because of the existence of the prior conviction on the employment of the firearm in the first count. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Because there were \u201cthree separate uses and/or carryings of the weapons, [Orr] properly received five years for the first use, twenty years consecutive for the second, and twenty years consecutive for the third.\u201d <em>United States v. Camps, </em>32 F.3d 102, 106 (4th Cir.1994). The factor increasing Orr\u2019s sentence on the second and third offenses was the \u201cpri- or conviction\u201d the Supreme Court explicitly exempted from the holding in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Apprendi. See Apprendi, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2362-63; <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 243 n. 6. The district court did not commit error with respect to Orr\u2019s increased sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Orr\u2019s remaining claims need not detain us for long. There was ample evidence at trial, taken in the view most favorable to the Government, to demonstrate that the robberies Orr perpetrated were \u201cdrug robberies\u201d that would satisfy the \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29; <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1141, 119 S.Ct. 1032, 143 L.Ed.2d 41 (1999). As for Orr\u2019s claim that the district court erred in instructing the jury, Orr has not demonstrated that the court\u2019s description of the offense charged in the indictment, which tracked the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), was in error. Neither has Orr shown plain error in the court\u2019s failure to sua sponte issue a lesser included offense instruction. <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 239 (4th Cir.1998). There is no merit to either of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Accordingly, Orr\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
