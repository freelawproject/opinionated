No. CV-96-01081-JBR/LRL.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b657-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b657-14\">Argued and Submitted Nov. 16, 2000.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGy\">Decided Jan. 5, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Before KOZINSKI, MICHAEL DALY HAWKINS and BERZON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b658-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">No evidence supports Beauty Center\u2019s claims of civil conspiracy and conspiracy in restraint of trade. Instead, the only plausible explanation for the termination of Beauty Center\u2019s at-will contract is that defendants-appellees intended to enforce the restriction on the resale of certain products.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Beauty Center\u2019s misrepresentation, es-toppel, and breach of contract claims are also without merit. Beauty Center breached the contract by offering to sell and selling Matrix products retail in sizes intended only for salon use.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The claim of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage fails because no evidence suggests that defendants-appellees took \u201c[ijmproper or illegal\u201d actions. <em>Las Vegas-TonopahReno Stage Line, Inc. v. Gray Line Tours, </em>106 Nev. 283, 792 P.2d 386, 388 n. 1 (Nev. 1990). As for the claim of intentional interference with contract, it is undisputed that Phoenix Beauty had agreed not to sell Matrix products to \u201cany salon or individual who has in the past diverted or reasonably has been suspected of diverting\u201d such products. The fact that Matrix asked Phoenix Beauty to honor that agreement does not amount to unlawful interference with contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">This leaves the claim that defendants-appellees made slanderous statements about Beauty Center in connection with the termination of sales. We find Beauty Center\u2019s allegations and evidence inadequate substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Finally, we are troubled by Beauty Center\u2019s counsel\u2019s vehement representations that Matrix was unaware of retail gallon sales until discovery. The deposition of Patrick Anthony Munson contains the following testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Q. Did you subsequently discuss [Patricia Urban\u2019s phone] call ... ?</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">A. ... 30 minutes later I got a call from Jon Hveem about it....</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">Q. And how long between the time you spoke with Mr. Hveem did it take for you to call Patti Urban?</p>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">A. Hang up and dial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-17\">Q. And what was your conversation with [Urban]?</p>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">A. ... She [Urban] says, <em>\u201c... You can\u2019t sell gallons. They are marked \u2018Not for Retail Sale\u2019 so you\u2019re not allowed to sell them.\u201d </em>I said, \u201cThis is news to me. We\u2019ve never heard that before.\u201d She goes, \u2018Well, it\u2019s in your agreement.\u201d And I said, <em>\u201c ... 1 </em>had no idea that we were violating any kind of agreement.... We\u2019ve sold gallons before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">Excerpts of Record at 400-01 (emphasis added). Placed in context, Munson\u2019s admission to having previously sold gallon containers could only refer to retail sales. Counsel\u2019s repeated assertions that Matrix did not learn of these sales until significantly later appear inconsistent with an attorney\u2019s obligation to act in good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>when providing information to the court. We expect more.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
