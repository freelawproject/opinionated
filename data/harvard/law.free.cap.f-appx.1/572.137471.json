Robert Lloyd WILLIAMS, also known as \u201cCart-Rob,\u201d Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b598-10\">No. 99-1063.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b598-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b598-12\">Submitted Dec. 7, 2000.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b598-13\">Decided Jan. 9, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b598-15\">Before RICHARD S. ARNOLD, LOKEN, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b598-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">After Robert Lloyd Williams pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the government\u2019s departure motion, made under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1 .1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), and sentenced Williams to 120 months imprisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal, appointed counsel moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising issues concerning the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Williams a mitigating-role reduction; the court\u2019s denial of his motion to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3; the court\u2019s drug-quantity finding; and its refusal to depart below the mandatory minimum. Williams has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">The foregoing arguments fail. Williams stipulated in his plea agreement that a mitigating role-reduction would not apply, <em>see United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995), and the drug quantity that he contends he should be responsible for produces a Guidelines range that is still above the 120-month departure sentence he received, <em>see United States v. Wyatt, </em>26 F.3d 863, 864 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam). His remaining arguments, like his drug-quantity challenge, would require us to examine the extent of the district court\u2019s departure, which we will not do. <em>See United States v. Dutcher, 8 </em>F.3d 11, 12 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-22\">In accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have reviewed the record for any non-frivolous issue. As we have found none, we now affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-19\">. The HONORABLE MICHAEL J.
