We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversing the decision of the district court. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-21\">We note that although plaintiff has failed to exhaust his claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>and hence cannot maintain the present action under that Act, the defendant insurance company (\u201cdefendant\u201d) has now informed plaintiff and this Court that defendant has given plaintiff until December 31, 2000, to submit any additional documentation he wishes in support of his disability benefits claim, and that defendant will issue a final determination of that claim on or before January 31, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
