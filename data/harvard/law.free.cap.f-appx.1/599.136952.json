The land was financed by a deed of trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to a bank and the mobile home was financed by Green Tree Financial Servicing. The Letts later sold half of the land and, by mistake, the bank released its security interest for the entire property. After construction and improvements, the mobile home became a permanent structure on the land contrary to the Letts\u2019 agreement with Green Tree, and when the Letts sold the remaining land with the home, Green Tree\u2019s security interest in the mobile home was not discovered on the land records. Two days after First American Title Insurance Company filed a complaint against the Letts, the Letts filed a petition in bankruptcy. First American and Green Tree filed adversary proceedings seeking an exception from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (money or property obtained by false pretenses, false representation, or actual fraud) and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6) (willful or malicious conversion of another\u2019s property without their knowledge or consent). The bankruptcy court held the Letts\u2019 debt to First American was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and the Letts\u2019 debts to First American and Green Tree were nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). <em>See In re Lett, </em>238 B.R. 167 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Mo.1999). The bankruptcy court also imposed a constructive trust on the Letts\u2019 Kansas real estate, which the Letts had purchased with the ill-gotten proceeds from the sale of their Missouri property, and denied the Letts a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). <em>See id. </em>The district court affirmed. On appeal, the Letts assert a shotgun array of issues. Having considered them all, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s thorough, twenty-seven page order. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
