Singley appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Singley v. Hodges, </em>No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>CA-99-3120 (D.S.C. July 20, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-27\"> We note that the district court\u2019s opinion refers to multiple plaintiffs. Although there were other plaintiffs listed on the complaint, Sing-ley was not entitled to represent others. <em>See Oxendine v. Williams, </em>509 F.2d 1405, 1407 (4th Cir.1975). Further, only Singley signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the notice of appeal, so he is the only Appellant. <em>Covington v. Allsbrook, </em>636 F.2d 63, 64 (4th Cir. 1980). Accordingly, this action resolves only those claims raised by Singley personally.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
