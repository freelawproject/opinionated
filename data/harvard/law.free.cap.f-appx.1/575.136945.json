ARNOLD, HANSEN, and BYE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b602-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Carlos Sanchez-Perez pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States, having previously been deported subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to seventy-eight months imprisonment and three years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Sanchez-Perez renews on appeal the argument he presented below, that the statute \u2014 which penalizes an alien \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) \u2014 is ambiguous. \u201cSubsequent to\u201d could mean either \u201cafter\u201d or \u201cas a result of,\u201d Sanchez-Perez argues, and he is entitled to the more lenient reading. He contends that, as his deportation resulted from illegally re-entering the United States in violation of a prior deportation order, not being convicted for an aggravated felony, his offense level should not have been enhanced by sixteen levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">Sanchez-Perez concedes in his brief that \u201cnearly all dictionaries define the word \u2018subsequent\u2019 to connote \u2018following in time\u2019 or sequential.\u201d We conclude that the word should be understood to carry its common meaning. <em>See Beef Nebraska, Inc. v. United States, </em>807 F.2d 712, 716 (8th Cir.1986) (fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning); BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1427 (6th ed.1990) (subsequent means following in time, coming or being later than something else, or succeeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">This meaning is accurately reflected in the Guidelines commentary. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.l) (\u201c \u2018Deported after a conviction\u2019 means that the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such conviction.\u201d); <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (Guidelines commentary that interprets or explains particular Guideline is authoritative unless it violates Constitution or federal statute, or is inconsistent with or is plainly erroneous reading of, that Guideline).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\">. The Honorable Susan Webber Wright, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
