After de novo review, we conclude the judgment was proper because the un-controverted evidence clearly demonstrated an absence of causation. See <em>Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1237 (8th Cir. 1997) (standard of review); <em>Smith v. Brut-ger Co., </em>569 N.W.2d 408, 423-14 (Minn. 1997) (negligent misrepresentation); <em>Johnson v. Minnesota, </em>553 N.W.2d 40, 49 (Minn.1996) (negligence); <em>Drager by Gutz-man v. Aluminum Indus. Corp., </em>495 N.W.2d 879, 882 (Minn.App.1993) (strict products liability); <em>Craft Tool &amp; Die Co. v. Payne, </em>385 N.W.2d 24, 26 (Minn.App.1986) (breach of warranty). We also conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clausen\u2019s motion for a continuance. See <em>Dulany, </em>132 F.3d at 1238 (standard of review); <em>United States v. Light, </em>766 F.2d 394, 397-98 (8th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (nonmoving party must show that opposition is meritorious, and must affirmatively demonstrate how postponement of ruling will enable him to rebut moving party\u2019s showing of absence of genuine issue of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-18\">. The Hon. James M. Rosenbaum, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Hon. Franklin L.
