Haight (\u201cHaight\u201d), a federal prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his ninety-two month sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253, and 2255. We review a district court\u2019s decision to either deny or grant a federal prisoner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion de novo, <em>see United States v. Chacon-Palomares, </em>208 F.3d 1157, 1158 (9th Cir.2000), and we review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo, <em>see United States v. Span, </em>75 F.3d 1383 (9th Cir.1996) (evaluating claim raised in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion). For the reasons below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-19\">We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Haight\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal. A defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must show both that counsel\u2019s representation, \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that the attorney\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), the Supreme Court identified factors courts are to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>sider in determining whether the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel failed to file notice of appeal on the defendant\u2019s behalf. <em>See id. </em>at 1035-38 (concluding that district court must determine whether counsel had a duty to consult with defendant; if so, whether that duty was met; and whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendant would have timely appealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Because the district court did not make findings regarding these particular factors, and because the record is not sufficient to allow us to do so, we vacate the denial of Haight\u2019s motion solely on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file an appeal and remand for further proceeding consistent with <em>Flores-Ortega. See id. </em>at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-22\">.
