He argues that the district court erred by not granting him a two-level reduction as a \u201cminor participant\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Given the nature of Santiago\u2019s extended participation, his agreement to supply 550 grams of crack cocaine at a price of $11,000, his soliciting a supplier, his recruitment of a courier, and his giving of instructions concerning the exchange of drugs for money, the district court was well justified in rejecting Santiago\u2019s claim of entitlement to the minor-participant reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
