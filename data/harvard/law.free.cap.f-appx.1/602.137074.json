The magistrate judge, sitting by consent of the parties, conducted a bench trial and found Landreth did not prove defendants (1) were aware of any risk of harm to Landreth posed by the arrestee, (2) responded unreasonably after Landreth was attacked, or (3) were deliberately indifferent to his later need for medical attention. Landreth appeals. Because the undisputed facts support the ultimate finding of no liability on the part of defendants, we affirm without further discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
