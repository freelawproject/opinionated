Holiday contends that the district court erred in assigning to him a base offense level of 16 on the ground that he used force within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(l), and that the amount of restitution ordered by the district court lacks sufficient documentary support. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The record supports the district court\u2019s determination that Holiday used force during his abusive sexual contact with the victim. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4, comment. (n.l) (1999); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a). The district court considered the entire record, and credited the victim\u2019s statements that Holiday \u201cgrabbed\u201d her arms to prevent her from leaving and to kiss her, lay on top of her, threatened her, and dragged her behind a couch. The court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Archdale, </em>229 F.3d 861, 868 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Fulton, </em>987 F.2d 631, 632-33 (9th Cir.1993). Moreover, it is well-settled that the district court can use relevant conduct to select the appropriate offense level under the applicable Sentencing Guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 (1999); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>164 F.3d 1235,1239 (9th Cir.1999) (analyzing a cross-reference contained within a Guideline and holding that a district court must consider \u201call acts and omissions committed ... by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction\u201d); <em>United States v. Reese, </em>2 F.3d 870, 894-95 (9th Cir.1993) (recognizing that the overall policy of the Guidelines is to punish a defendant for all harm that resulted from his actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-15\">Contrary to Holiday\u2019s assertions, the district court\u2019s restitution order is supported by several documents, including a restitution affidavit filed in an Arizona Superior Court and a supporting memorandum filed by the probation officer. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it relied on these documents and ordered Holiday to pay restitution in the amount of $5,970. <em>See United States v. Miguel, </em>49 F.3d 505, 511-12 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>991 F.2d 609, 611-12 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">Finally, because Holiday failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(d)(1) &amp; (2), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>sua sponte order this court\u2019s records and all documents in this case that mention the child\u2019s name sealed. <em>See United States v. Gavin, </em>959 F.2d 788, 792 (9th Cir.1992) (ordering records sealed because \u201c[disclosure of the child victim\u2019s name would be \u2018detrimental\u2019 to the child within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(d)(3)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-13\">.
