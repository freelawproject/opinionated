We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>We review de novo a grant of summary judgment, <em>Balint v. Carson City, </em>180 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc), and we affirm for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment filed on February 8, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Garland also objects to the district court\u2019s award of $3,172.38 in costs to the City for depositions. We review the district court\u2019s award of costs for abuse of discretion. <em>LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, </em>205 F.3d 1146, 1157 (9th Cir.2000). The costs of obtaining depositions and copies of deposition transcripts are allowable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 where the transcripts were reasonably necessary to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Alflex Corp. v. Underwriters Lab., Inc., </em>914 F.2d 175, 177 (9th Cir.1990). In this case, the district court awarded only \u201cthose expenses incurred by either party for a deposition actually used in support of or opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d Although the clerk\u2019s order does not specifically itemize the deposition costs, the City points out that the amount awarded equals the total amount set forth in the itemized listing of deposition costs for those depositions of which portions were submitted as a part of summary judgment proceedings. It is reasonable to assume that those depositions actually used in the summary judgment proceedings were \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the award of costs in this case does not constitute an abuse of discretion and is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b746-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
