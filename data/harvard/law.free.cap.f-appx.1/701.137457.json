We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-18\">The district court correctly concluded that it had jurisdiction of Tam\u2019s petition and that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act by \u00a7 304(b) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) applies to Tam because his removal proceedings were initiated after April 1, 1997. <em>Richards-Diaz v. Fasano, </em>233 F.3d 1160 (9th Cir.2000). However, because Tam has alleged that he relied on the availability of \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief when he decided to plead guilty, we remand for an evidentiary hearing on that claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1165. If Tam makes a \u201c \u2018specific factual showing that a plea was entered in reliance on the availability of discretionary waiver under \u00a7 212(c),\u2019 \u201d he \u201cmay be able to establish that [IIRIRA \u00a7 304(b)] has an impermissible retroactive application as to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ma-gana-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 613 (9th Cir.1999)). In examining Tam\u2019s claim, the court should employ its \u201csound instinct in applying the familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\u201d <em>Magana-Pizano, </em>200 F.3d at 613 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-23\">.
