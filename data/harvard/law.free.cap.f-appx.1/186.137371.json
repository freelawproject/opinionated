The district court imposed a 145-month sentence. Following the filing of a timely notice of appeal, McCrorey\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In his brief, counsel states that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raises the following issues: whether the district court (1) complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 at the plea hearing, and (2) sentenced McCrorey in contravention of law or the Sentencing Guidelines. We have reviewed the record and find that the district court did not err during the plea hearing, <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n. 2 (4th Cir. 1999), or in sentencing. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">We have examined the entire record in this case including the issues raised in McCrorey\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, in accordance with the requirements of <em>An-ders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm McCro-rey\u2019s sentence and conviction. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">We grant McCrorey\u2019s motion to decon-solidate his appeal from <em>United States v. Brice, </em>1 Fed.Appx. 186 (4th Cir.2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-24\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b212-25\">The court amends its opinion filed January 10, 2001, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>On the cover sheet, section 6 \u2014 the status line is corrected to read \u201cAffirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
