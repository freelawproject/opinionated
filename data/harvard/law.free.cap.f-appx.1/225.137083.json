Greenfield\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that the district court erred by denying an eviden-tiary hearing on Greenfield\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Greenfield filed two pro se supplemental briefs in which he alleges that: (1) the indictment was facially defective; (2) the district court imposed an illegal sentence; (3) he was improperly sentenced in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (4) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (1994) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">It is well-settled that a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). It is equally clear that a defendant does not have an automatic right to an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Before he is entitled to a hearing, a defendant must first present a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing his plea. <em>Id. </em>We find that Greenfield failed to make the requisite showing. Although the court asked him to submit evidence supporting his motion to withdraw his plea, Greenfield did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">We have considered the arguments presented in Greenfield\u2019s pro se supplemental briefs and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. The court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">We therefore affirm Greenfield\u2019s convictions and sentence. Greenfield\u2019s motion to file a second pro se supplemental brief is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>granted. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> We have considered the effect of <em>Apprendi </em>and find that because Greenfield\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), any error in failing to present his drug amounts to the jury was harmless. <em>United States v. Angle, </em>230 F.3d 113, 123 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
