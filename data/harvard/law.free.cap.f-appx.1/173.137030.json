Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Mandamus relief is only available when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted, <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987), and may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re Catawba Indian Tribe, </em>973 F.2d 1133, 1135-36 (4th Cir.1992). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u201d and that his entitlement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>such relief is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The district court ruled upon Adams\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion on December 19, 2000. Therefore, the petition for a writ of mandamus is moot because Adams received the relief he sought. Accordingly, we deny Adams\u2019 petition for mandamus relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
