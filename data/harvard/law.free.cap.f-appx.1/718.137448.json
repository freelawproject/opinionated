The district court determined that the parties had settled all claims, including any claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. Bohanan admitted accepting $1,000 from the defendants and admitted signing a release which covered \u201cany and all claims, liens and or damages pending or in the future.\u201d The district court\u2019s conclusion that the parties had settled was adequately supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">Settlement agreements are contracts, which a federal court interprets by looking to the contract law of the state in which it sits. <em>Jeff D. v. Andrus, </em>899 F.2d 753, 759 (9th Cir.1990). The court\u2019s interpretation of the settlement release was not erroneous. <em>Chadwick v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>33 Wash.App. 297, 654 P.2d 1215, 1217 (Wash.App.1982) (a \u201crelease generally extends to all matters within the parties\u2019 contemplation at the time it is executed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">The fact that the defendants, who were unrepresented at the time, negotiated the settlement directly with Bohanan does not render the settlement unenforceable. <em>See In re Patterson, </em>93 WashApp. 579, 969 P.2d 1106 (Wash.App.1999). Bohanan has not alleged any facts that would support a claim of duress or fraud or otherwise justify setting aside the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-15\">.

The district court decision was without prejudice to any claims the attorney might have in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>own name and on his own behalf in state court, whether against his client, or against the defendants for tortious third party interference with valid contractual relations. <em>See Calbom v.
