She appeals. Upon review of the record, we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s determination, and we therefore affirm the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Vanessa Long, a 26-year-old resident of Paducah, Kentucky, applied for Supplemental Security Income benefits on August 18, 1995. She had no significant work experience<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and relied on AFDC and food stamps to support her three children, one of whom may also have a disability. She took care of her personal needs but welcomed her mother\u2019s help in looking after her children. Beginning on February 26, 1991, she claims, a combination of physical problems associated with her weight rendered her severely impaired and unable to work. She suffered from severe headaches, a pseudo tumor cerebri, and morbid obesity. However, she identified no specific work-related limitations resulting from her obesity or other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">At the administrative hearing to review her application for benefits, Reed testified that she experienced all-day headaches twice a week. The prescription medication \u201cPaxil\u201d partially alleviated her headaches but \u201cdidn\u2019t completely stop them. It made them to where I could more or less tolerate them.\u201d She testified that, when a headache strikes, \u201c[a]ll I can do is [lie] down where it\u2019s real quiet in a nice dark place and try to relax.\u201d Additionally, the shunt in her lower back (described below) caused discomfort: \u201cit pulls real bad ... makes my back hurt ... shoots all the way back down the back of my leg ... makes my leg want to give out.... [I]t hurts usually, you know, when I\u2019m trying to do a lot of stuff, you know. It bothers me all the time. I\u2019m limited to everything that I try to do.\u201d She testified that she can sit, occasionally stand and move around, and bend over from a standing position to pick something up from the floor but claimed that she was \u201cnot supposed to lift over 10 pounds.\u201d She said that she can stand on her feet for 45 minutes to an hour at a time before pain begins, and that sitting, too, makes her uncomfortable. These impairments, Long claims, limit her ability to perform housework, although she can take care of personal needs like \u201cbathing, dressing, [and] things of that nature.\u201d Long\u2019s extensive medical treatment history confirms the nature of her ailments but, consistent with her own description, discloses no severe work-related limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">During a January 1992 admission to Western Baptist Hospital, examinations revealed no significant visual, cerebellar, or locomotion abnormalities, but Dr. John E. Grubbs. M.D., diagnosed a pseudo tu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>mor cerebri.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He recommended a series of lumbar punctures to alleviate pressure from excess spinal fluid associated with this condition. When the spinal taps failed to provide relief, Dr. Grubbs told Long that she would, sooner or later, need surgery to insert a shunt into her spinal cord to drain the fluid on an ongoing basis. On January 24, 1992, Dr. Robert P. Meriwether, M.D., implanted a lumboperitoneal shunt in Long\u2019s lower spine that drained excess spinal fluid into her abdomen so that she could evacuate it during urination. At this time, she weighed 269 pounds and stood 5'6\" tall.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Post-operative notes indicated that the surgery went well and show a recommendation that Long increase her activity as tolerated. In March 1992, both Drs. Meri-wether and Grubbs noted that Long reported significant improvement since the surgery, with headaches occurring rarely, although she complained of pain in her abdomen, which she associated with the surgery. Dr. Meriwether\u2019s treatment notes for May 1992 relate that Long\u2019s headaches were \u201cless intense and less frequent than before the shunt placement.\u201d In June 1992, Long no longer suffered from headaches, and the abdominal sear was \u201ccausing her much less difficulty.... \u201d In September 1992, Long had \u201cno complaints\u201d of headaches and stated that she felt \u201cnormal .\u201d Dr. Meriwether found her \u201cneurologically intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In March 1995. Long went to the emergency room complaining of headaches. Two months later, emergency room records indicate, she had a urinary tract infection, a fever of 100 degrees, and \u201clow back and flank pain. She ha[d] ... pain across her lower back and abdomen with frequent urination.\u201d She sought no further treatment at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Dr. Grubbs\u2019s notes from December 6, 1995, observed that since the surgery, Long \u201chad generally [sic] resolution of her symptoms with normalization of her vision corrected for nearsightedness and no significant headaches in that respect. She still continues to have migraine type headaches ... occurring once a week or so.... \u201d He was uncertain whether Long\u2019s pseudo tumor cerebri caused her headaches but noted that she complained of only \u201coccasional low back pain with pain sometimes shooting in the area of the previous shunt.\u201d His examination revealed nothing unusual. On February 1, 1996, Dr. Grubbs noted that Long complained of \u201cstill having frequent headaches, even increasing headaches,\u201d and that she went to the emergency room for treatment of them on several occasions. Dr. Grubbs prescribed Paxil for the headaches. On February 21, 1996, Long remarked that Paxil had eliminated her headaches and that she felt \u201cf\u00edne.\u201d In his treatment notes for February 29,1996, Dr. Grubbs wrote, \u201cShe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>returns in follow up, says she has not had any headaches since starting on the medication. She feels very good and has lost 10 lbs. feeling fairly well____ The shunt path is nontender. Gait is normal.... [W]hen she has any mild breakthrough tendencies she takes over the counter Aleve 2 at a time and this wears off the headache and she is only having to do this on very rare occasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">On December 22, 1995, non-examining state agency physicians reviewed the evidence in Long\u2019s medical history and determined that she could perform medium level work. They found that she could: (1) lift up to 50 lbs. occasionally and 25 lbs. frequently; (2) sit, stand, and/or walk about six hours in an eight-hour workday; (3) perform unlimited pushing and/or pulling and operate hand or foot controls; (4) climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl occasionally, but (5) never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds and avoid working around \u201cheights, hazardous machinery, etc.\u201d A re-assessment completed on April 2, 1996, reached the same conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">After the August 20, 1996, administrative hearing, Long complained of frequent nausea and some bifrontal headaches, and Dr. Grubbs decided that he would consider increasing the dosage of Paxil.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The Social Security Administration initially denied Long\u2019s application for SSI benefits on January 2, 1996. She immediately sought reconsideration, but benefits were again denied on April 8, 1996. After the August 20th hearing that Long requested, the Administrative Law Judge rendered a decision on January 23, 1997, finding that Long did \u201cnot have any severe impairment which significantly limits her ability to perform basic work-related functions; therefore, the claimant does not have a severe impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He specifically found Long\u2019s statements so unsupported by objective evidence as to severely undermine her credibility. On December 11, 1997, the Appeals Council summarily rejected her request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s ruling the final position of the Commissioner. Long filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky on February 2, 1998. After receiving objections and replies to the recommendation of a magistrate judge, the district court affirmed the Commissioner, holding that the plaintiff failed to carry her burden of showing severe impairment. Neither the magistrate judge nor the district judge made any findings with respect to plaintiffs credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Long timely appealed. She attacks as unsupported by substantial evidence the Commissioner\u2019s findings that her medical problems do not constitute a severe impairment and that her testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3), which provide for review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision by a civil action filed in federal district court, all reviewing courts must accept as conclusive \u201c[t]he findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence .... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see also Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). \u201cMore than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance,\u201d <em>Brainard v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>889 F.2d 679, 681 (6th Cir.1989), substantial evidence \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Perales, </em>402 U.S. at 401 (internal quotation omitted). If supported by substantial evidence, this court must approve the Commissioner\u2019s decision \u201ceven if that evidence could support a decision the other way.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Sullivan, </em>2 F.3d 692, 695 (6th Cir.1993); <em>see also Her v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>203 F.3d 388, 389-90 (6th Cir. 1999). Because appellate review is confined to determining (1) whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, and (2) whether the ALJ employed the proper legal standards in reaching his conclusion, this court may \u201cnot review the evidence de novo, make credibility determinations []or weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Brainard, </em>889 F.2d at 681 (citing <em>Reynolds v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>707 F.2d 927 (6th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">B. Severe Impairment</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">An individual claiming disability \u201cbears the ultimate burden of establishing the existence of a disability.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>2 F.3d at 695. The ALJ resolves whether the claimant suffers a disability by applying the five-step test set forth in the implementing regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920; <em>see also Young v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>925 F.2d 146,147-48. First, if a claimant is working and this work amounts to substantial gainful activity, the ALJ will find the claimant not disabled, regardless of medical condition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 419.920(b). Second, the ALJ must determine if the claimant suffers a severe impairment(s). Then, if the claimant suffers a severe impairment, the ALJ proceeds to other tests of disability. Since the ALJ found Long\u2019s disability not severe, we review only that question and note that, were we to reverse, we would remand to the ALJ to continue the five-step process.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Here, \u201c[ejvaluating the evidence in the best possible light for the claimant the Administrative Law Judge [found] that the claimant performed work activity for no more than three months and that it ended as a result of her impairments. Thus, [working in the convenience store part-time] constituted an unsuccessful work attempt and is not considered substantial gainful activity.\u201d Accordingly, the evidence presented by Long satisfied step 1 of the five-step test. The Commissioner did not challenge this finding in subsequent proceedings. Thus, the critical issue in this case, which the ALJ resolved against the claimant, is whether she suffers a severe impairment within the meaning of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">To conclude that the claimant has a \u201csevere impairment,\u201d the ALJ must find that an impairment or combination of impairments significantly limits the claimant\u2019s ability to do basic work activity (without considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, or work experience).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(c); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.921. An \u201cimpairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. A physical or mental impairment must be established by medical evidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, not only by [claimant\u2019s] statement of symptoms.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.908. The ALJ must resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.927, 416.929; <em>Perales, </em>402 U.S. at 399; <em>Casey v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>987 F.2d 1230, 1234-35 (6th Cir.1993). The ALJ need not find credible a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints or medical assessments not supported by the medical evidence or the record as a whole. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929; <em>Walters v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>127 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Higgs v. Bowen, </em>this court declared that \u201can impairment can be considered not severe only if it is a slight abnormality that minimally affects work ability regardless of age, education, and experience.\u201d <em>Higgs v. Bowen, 880 </em>F.2d 860, 862 (6th Cir.1988). The <em>Higgs </em>court observed that \u201cthis lenient interpretation of the severity requirement in part represents the courts\u2019 response to the Secretary\u2019s questionable practice in the early 1980s of using the step two regulation to deny meritorious claims without proper vocational analysis.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But the court also recognized that \u201cCongress has approved the threshold dismissal of claims obviously lacking medical merit....\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That is, \u201cthe severity requirement may still be employed as an administrative convenience to screen out claims that are \u2018totally groundless\u2019 solely from a medical standpoint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863. Indeed, the <em>Higgs </em>court approved of that practice; it affirmed dismissal because the record contained no objective medical evidence to support Ms. Higgs\u2019s claims of severe impairment. Particularly relevant to the case at bar, the <em>Higgs </em>court observed. \u201cThe mere diagnosis of [an ailment], of course, says nothing about the severity of the condition.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When doctors\u2019 reports contain no information regarding physical limitations or the intensity, frequency, and duration of pain associated with a condition, this court has regularly found substantial evidence to support a finding of no severe impairment. <em>See, e.g., ibid, </em>(citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Caselaw since <em>Higgs </em>confirms this circuit\u2019s practice in that respect. <em>Compare Maloney v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1269 (table), No. 99-3081, 2000 WL 420700 at *2, (6th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (finding substantial evidence to support denial when record indicated claimant showed symptoms and was diagnosed with disorder but did not contain evidence of a disabling impairment that would prevent work); <em>and Foster v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>899 F.2d 1221 (table). No. 88-1644, 1990 WL 41835 at *2 (6th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (finding substantial evidence to support denial when the claimant produced no evidence regarding the frequency, intensity, and duration of arthritic pain; the record indicated that he was no more than slightly or minimally impaired); <em>with Burton v. Apfel, </em>208 F.3d 212 (table), No. 98-4198. 2000 WL 125853 at *3 (6th CSr.2000) (re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>versing finding of no severe impairment because record contained diagnoses and remarks from a number of treating physicians and psychologists to the effect that claimant was \u201c \u2018unable to work ... due to the complexity of her health problems\u2019 \u201d (quoting physician)); <em>and Childrey v. Chater, </em>91 F.3d 143 (table). No. 95-1353, 1996 WL 420265 at *2 (6th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (reversing finding of no severe impairment because record contained an assessment by a consulting physician reflecting a variety of mental problems that left her \u201c \u2018not yet able to really care for herself alone,\u2019 \u201d reports of two other physicians corroborating this, consistent testimony from the claimant, and no medical evidence to the contrary (quoting physician)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The record in this case does not contain a single statement by a treating physician indicating that Long\u2019s health problems result in any specific work-impairing limitations. On the contrary, all medical evidence shows that treatment progressed well and that most of Long\u2019s ailments had been resolved or could be treated with prescription and over-the-counter medication. The only medical evidence suggesting Long has any impairment at all comes from the non-examining state agency physicians, who specifically found that she could perform medium-level work. The ALJ discounted Long\u2019s non-specific statements about pain and physical limitations because he found her not entirely credible. This record accordingly contains substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding of no severe impairment that significantly limits Long\u2019s ability to do basic work activity, <em>See Perales, </em>402 U.S. at 402 (concluding that \u201ca written report by a licensed physician who has examined the claimant and who sets forth in his report his medical findings in his area of competence ... may constitute substantial evidence supportive of a finding by the hearing examiner adverse to the claimant\u201d); <em>cf. Higgs, </em>880 F.2d at 864 (affirming denial of benefits because nothing backed by objective clinical findings suggested severe impairment; the court gave little or no weight to unsupported medical assumptions and subjective descriptions of pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Long argues that her \u201chuge size alone constitutes a severe impairment that would significantly limit her physical ability to perform basic work activities. Similarly, the migraine headaches due to her pseudo tumor cerebri and spinal shunt constitute severe impairments in and of themselves. The combination of the impairments is not only severe, but disabling....\u201d PI. Br. at 8-9. The medical evidence directly conflicts with her uncorroborated complaints of unresolved headaches, pain associated with the shunt placement, and daily fatigue. Thus, the ALJ had before him more than substantial evidence from which he could conclude that Long\u2019s only persistent physical impairment was obesity itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Johnson v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services </em>resolved whether obesity <em>can be </em>a disabling impairment under the Social Security regulations. <em>See Johnson v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Svcs., </em>794 F.2d 1106, 1112 (6th Cir.1986) (looking to the former Listing 10.10 in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 for guidance). The court determined that obesity <em>can </em>support a finding of disability because \u201cSection 10.10 reflects a policy decision by the agency that obesity, regardless of type, <em>can be </em>a disabling impairment when it is severe and is accompanied by certain complications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1113 (emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the court held that the specific conditions in Listing 10.10 prevailed over the more general statement that a condition reasonably remediable by following medical advice does not amount to a disabling severe impairment. <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(discussing applicability of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1530 to obesity cases). However, <em>Johnson </em>in no way held or even implied that obesity alone <em>always </em>constitutes a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">While typically analyzed in step three of the five-step test, the Listings\u2019s treatment of obesity provides guidance in determining whether Long suffers a severe impairment, <em>of. id. </em>at 1112-13, which claim is, as explained above, based on the fact of her obesity alone. Under the Listings in effect through the time of the district court\u2019s decision, obesity by itself did not amount to a severe impairment. Instead, the Listing required \u201c[wjeight equal to or greater than the values specified in ... Table II for females (100 percent above desired level)\u201d, and one of the following: pain or limited movement in a weight-bearing joint, hypertension, a history of congestive heart failure, chronic venous insufficiency, or respiratory disease.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 9.09 (1998). That the Listings required additional impairments beyond obesity confirms the ALJ\u2019s finding that Long\u2019s obesity, unaccompanied as it was by any other specific impairments, does not amount to a severe impairment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A recent Social Security Ruling, SSR 00-3p (May 15, 2000), which directly addresses the significance of obesity in the step 2 inquiry, confirms this conclusion because it recognizes that obesity will constitute a severe impairment when \u201cit significantly limits an individual\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities .... [The Administration] will do an individualized assessment of the impact of obesity on an individual\u2019s functioning when deciding whether the impairment is severe.\u201d SSR 00-3p. Policy Interpretation Question 6. Here, the record does not even suggest that Long\u2019s obesity limits her ability to work, notwithstanding the unfortunate difficulties she has had in undergoing medical treatment. The non-treating state physicians reported that Long had few physical limitations and specifically found that she could perform medium-level work. Although Long goes to great lengths to call attention to the fact of her obesity, this by itself does not constitute a severe impairment. Accordingly, we hold that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Long does not suffer a severe impairment within the meaning of the Social Security regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Finally, Long\u2019s arguments about insufficient evidence concerning whether she can perform light or sedentary (less than medium-level) work and the number of suitable jobs in the national economy are unavailing. Those facts are relevant to the fourth and fifth steps of the disability determination. Her claim failed at the second step.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">C. Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Long argues that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>finding that she was not entirely credible. Nothing in the record indicates that either party presented this issue to the magistrate judge or the district court. A litigant generally may not \u201craise an issue before the court of appeals that was not raised before the district court.\u201d <em>Young, </em>925 F.2d at 149 (citing <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976)); <em>see also Foster v. Barilow, </em>6 F.3d 405, 408 (6th Cir.1992) (\u201cThis court is not compelled to hear, nor should it hear, an issue not presented to the district court unless reaching that issue serves an over-arching purpose beyond that of arriving at the correct result in an individual case.\u201d). Accordingly, we do not address the merits of Long\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Because substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision finding that Long does not suffer a \u201csevere impairment,\u201d we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision affirming denial of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\">. Ms. Long worked as a cashier for approximately five hours per day four times a week in May and June, 1996, at a friend\u2019s convenience store, resulting in earnings of $95 per week. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found this \"an unsuccessful work attempt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\">. As Long described it, a pseudo tumor cere-bri occurs \"when your body makes too much spinal fluid for your brain to absorb, and the spinal fluid sits on your brain, and it puts pressure on it and makes it swell.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. Long failed to disclose specifics of her height and weight at various times throughout the course of her treatment and application for benefits. At the administrative hearing, she testified that she was 5 and weighed \"over 300.\u201d She could not give a specific weight because, when she had been weighed last, she asked not to be told the actual figure. Some of Dr. Grubbs\u2019s notes indicate Long reporting a weight of \"around 340 pounds.\u201d An undated slip from RediCare walk-in care center submitted into the record after the administrative hearing reflected height of 5'4\" and weight of 334 lbs. The ALJ found the lack of objectively verifiable data troubling. Long stresses on appeal that she could not undergo an MRI because she was too large to fit in the machine and that she required the assistance of five people in getting on a tilt table.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\">. In the ALJ\u2019s view:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The record reveals that the claimant was able to perform work activity. Although she alleges that her physical condition precluded her ability to continue working, there is no corroborating evidence that the claimant's employment ended due to her physical condition.... Although limited, the claimant\u2019s ability to work and her ability to care for her personal needs and for the needs (to some extent) of her children fails to support her allegation of disability. This when considered with the lack of supporting objective evidence, the noted periods of time in which the claimant failed to seek medical care, and the lack of corroboration concerning the claimant's inability to work, so weakens the claimant's credibility that the Administrative Law Judge does not find the claimant\u2019s allegations of disability credible. There is no persuasive evidence that the claimant's obesity, history of headaches and shunt placement have resulted in significant vocational limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. \"Basic work activity\" means \"the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs.
