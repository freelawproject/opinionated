The Government responded to the \u00a7 2255 motion and attached the affidavit of McDonald\u2019s former trial counsel. Thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>without giving any notice to McDonald, the district court dismissed McDonald\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In his motion to reconsider, filed in the district court, McDonald complained that \u201cbefore the Petitioner could respond to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s motion to dismiss ... this court dismissed the Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims....\u201d (R. 36 at p. 1). Nonetheless, the district court also denied McDonald\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We grant a certificate of appealability and vacate and remand this case to the district court for failure to comply with this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Roseboro v. Garrison, </em>528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir.1975). Before a judgment may be entered against a pro se party, the district court must notify the pro se party, against whom summary judgment may be granted, of his right to file counter-affidavits or other appropriate materials, and give him a reasonable opportunity to do so. <em>Id. </em>Here, despite McDonald\u2019s notice to the court, in his motion to reconsider, that he was unaware of any duty to respond to the Government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court failed to provide him with proper notice and time under <em>Roseboro. </em>Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability and vacate and remand to the district court for proceedings in compliance with this opinion. We expressly decline to rule on the propriety of the district court\u2019s grounds for dismissal on the merits of McDonald\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
