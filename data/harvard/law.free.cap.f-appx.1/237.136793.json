We dismiss the appeal of the underlying order for lack of jurisdiction because Excell\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed, and affirm the denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment to note an appeal, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 12, 2000. Excell\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on October 3, 2000. Because Excell failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">Excell also appeals from the district court order denying his Rule 60(b) motion seeking reconsideration of the court\u2019s prior order dismissing as untimely his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000) motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no abuse of discretion. <em>In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 3 (4th Cir.1992). Accordingly, although we grant Excell\u2019s motion for clarification, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Excell, </em>No. CR-95-49-4; CA-00-60-4 (E.D.Va. July 12, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\"> An appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed only with respect to the grounds set forth in Rule 60(b). The merits of the underlying order are not reviewable where, as in this case, the appellant failed to timely appeal the underlying order. <em>In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 3 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
