The complaint was filed in 1999, more than 50 years after the internment ceased. The district court dismissed, and plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">Plaintiffs contend that their claims are not barred by the relevant statutes of limitations because the government maintained a policy of invidious discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>against persons of Japanese descent even after the internment, and that the government is therefore guilty of a continuing violation of their rights. The plaintiffs, however, have had no relationship with the United States government that is any way related to these claims since the internment ended, and the cases upon which plaintiffs rely are therefore inapposite. <em>See, e.g., Gutowsky v. County of Placer, </em>108 F.3d 256 (9th Cir.1997)(continuing violation for employee\u2019s entire term of employment was properly alleged where defendant county denied female clerical employee the opportunity to become a heavy equipment operator for the duration of the employment relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We need not determine whether the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims would fall within any statutory waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-16\">.
