Hawkins appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Missouri following his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(a)(2). The district court sentenced appellant to 30 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. For reversal appellant argues the district court erred in calculating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (applicable to, inter alia, a defendant with a prior felony conviction for <em>\u201ca </em>crime of violence\u201d), because his undisputed prior conviction for second-degree burglary of a commercial building, i.e., a gun store, did not constitute \u201ca crime of violence\u201d as contemplated by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">As appellant concedes, in <em>United States v. Hascall, </em>76 F.3d 902, 906 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 948, 117 S.Ct. 358, 136 L.Ed.2d 250 (1996), a panel of this court determined that second-degree burglaries of commercial buildings are indeed crimes of violence. We are not at liberty to overrule another panel\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>116 F.3d 328, 329 (8th Cir.1997) (refusing to consider argument that <em>Hascall </em>was wrongly decided).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-16\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
