Garcia argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>court erroneously refused to give his requested instruction on entrapment, and that the district court erroneously refused to give him a minor role reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines. We agree that Garcia was entitled to an entrapment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">A defendant is entitled to an entrapment instruction if he presents \u201csome evidence that (1) a government agent induced him or her to commit an illegal act that (2) he or she was not predisposed to commit.\u201d <em>United States v. Sotelo-Murillo, </em>887 F.2d 176, 179 (9th Cir.1989). Only \u201cslight evidence\u201d is needed to get this issue to a jury, and the evidence can be \u201cweak, insufficient, inconsistent, or of doubtful credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 178 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In <em>United States v. Kessee, </em>992 F.2d 1001 (9th Cir.1993), the defendant participated in a cocaine sale to an undercover informant, making the introductions and arranging the sale on the telephone. <em>Id. </em>at 1002. The defendant contended that he only agreed to participate after \u201crepeated entreaties\u201d from undercover officers, and because he needed the money such a sale would provide. <em>Id. </em>at 1004. Although Kessee\u2019s credibility was significantly weakened on cross-examination (he retracted a previous admission of participation in over fifty prior narcotics deals), <em>id. </em>at 1003-04, we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of Kes-see\u2019s requested entrapment instruction, holding that he was entitled to present an entrapment defense. Although the \u201ctrial judge\u2019s skepticism\u201d of Kessee\u2019s story was \u201ccertainly well-founded,\u201d the \u201cburden was on the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not induce Kessee to break the law, or that he was predisposed to break the law as he did before being approached by government agents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1005. The government\u2019s evidence made Kessee\u2019s account \u201cunlikely,\u201d but it did not rebut the evidence of entrapment \u201cto such an extent that no rational jury could entertain a reasonable doubt as to either element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The evidence in this case, as in <em>Kessee, </em>meets this low standard and entitles Garcia to an entrapment instruction. Garcia\u2019s evidence that he had no prior convictions for narcotics, and that a search of his apartment revealed no narcotics is \u201csome evidence\u201d that he was not predisposed to commit narcotics offenses. Garcia\u2019s testimony about repeated phone calls from undercover officers, so frequent that he would instruct his friends to tell callers he was not at home, and his need for money is \u201csome evidence\u201d of inducement. <em>See, e.g., Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 441, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932) (holding that entrapment defense was warranted when officers engaged in \u201crepeated and persistent solicitation\u201d); <em>United States v. Poehlman, </em>217 F.3d 692, 701 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that inducement can consist of \u201cexcessive pressure by the government\u201d); <em>Kessee, </em>992 F.2d at 1004 (holding that defendant\u2019s testimony of \u201crepeated entreaties\u201d and economic need raised inducement issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\"><em>United States v. Garza-Juarez, </em>992 F.2d 896, 909 (9th Cir.1993), which dealt with entrapment as a matter of law, does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Since we resolve the entrapment issue in appellant\u2019s favor, we do not reach the sentencing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The appellant\u2019s conviction is REVERSED, and this matter is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-16\">.
