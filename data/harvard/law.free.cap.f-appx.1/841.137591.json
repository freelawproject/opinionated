The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-23\">This case is before the court on Charles Anthony Golden\u2019s <em>pro se </em>request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Golden seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>\u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Golden challenged as unconstitutional the actions of Oklahoma prison officials in resetting his parole hearing date based on the newly-enacted Truth in Sentencing Act. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). The magistrate judge issued a comprehensive report and recommendation, concluding as follows: (1) each of Golden\u2019s three claims were time barred under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); (2) Golden had not identified any circumstances that would entitle him to equitable tolling and no such circumstances were apparent; and (3) Golden\u2019s second and third claims, which claims related to alleged deficiencies in Oklahoma\u2019s post-conviction procedures, failed to present a viable habeas claim, <em>see Sellers v. Ward, </em>135 F.3d 1333, 1336 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1024, 119 S.Ct. 557, 142 L.Ed.2d 463 (1998). Upon <em>de novo </em>review, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed Golden\u2019s petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Golden is entitled to a COA only upon making a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(b)(2). He can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1603-04, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has reviewed Golden\u2019s request for a COA and accompanying brief and has conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal. That close review reveals that the district court\u2019s resolution of Golden\u2019s petition is not debatable or deserving of further proceedings. Accordingly, this court DENIES Golden\u2019s request for a COA for substantially those reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation dated August 15, 2000, and the district court\u2019s order dated August 31, 2000. Golden\u2019s appeal is, therefore, DISMISSED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\">. The court also has before it Golden\u2019s omnibus request that the appellate filing fee be refunded and that he be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>After the district court denied Golden\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, Golden simply paid the filing fee in full. Golden then filed in this court a motion requesting that this court order the district court to refund the fee. Golden has not identified any precedent supporting such a request and this court has not discovered any. Accordingly, Golden\u2019s request that this court order the district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>refund the appellate filing fee is DENIED. His request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">. Although Golden identified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 as the appropriate statutory basis for his habeas corpus petition, the district court correctly noted that the petition was actually brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. This is so because the petition attacks the execution of Golden\u2019s sentence rather than the validity of his conviction. <em>See Montez v. McKin-na, </em>208 F.3d 862, 864-65 (10th Cir.2000) (discussing distinction between \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2254 petitions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
