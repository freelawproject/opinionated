Prior to sentencing, the district court determined, pursuant to our decision in <em>United States v. Hascall, </em>76 F.3d 902 (8th Cir.1996), that McElroy\u2019s previous conviction for burglary of a commercial building constituted a crime of violence for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. Accordingly, the district court increased McElroy\u2019s base offense level from 20 to 24 and sentenced McElroy to an 87 month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>McElroy urges us to reverse the district court, overrule <em>Hascall, </em>and hold that his burglary conviction was not a crime of violence. As McElroy recognizes, however, we are bound by Hascall, because \u201cone panel is not at liberty to overrule a decision of another panel.\u201d <em>United States v.
