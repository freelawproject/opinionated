He contends that the district court should have grouped the offenses under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3D1.2(c) (1998). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">When considering the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines, we review factual findings for clear error and legal interpretations de novo. <em>United States v. Colton, </em>231 F.3d 890, 911 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989) (noting that application of grouping principles in USSG \u00a7 3D1.2 moves closer to de novo review). The plain language of the commentary to USSG \u00a7 2A6.1 provides that \u201cmultiple counts involving making a threatening ... communication to the same victim are grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2[,] ... [but][m]ultiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2A6.1, comment, (n. 2). Because we \u201caccept the Application Notes as authoritative unless they are inconsistent with the Constitution, a federal statute, or a plain reading of the Guidelines,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>United States v. Hams, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993)), and because each of the counts to which Moore pled guilty involved a separate victim, we find that the district court properly declined to group the offenses. <em>See United States v. Achiekwelu, </em>112 F.3d 747, 755 (4th Cir.1997) (\"We must follow the clear, unambiguous language of a particular guideline unless there is a manifestation of contrary intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
