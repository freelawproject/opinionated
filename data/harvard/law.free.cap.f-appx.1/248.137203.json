We have reviewed the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny certificates of appealability and dismiss the appeals on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Carr v. Robinson, </em>Nos. CA-00-68AM; CA-99-1483-AM (E.D.Va. Feb. 7, 2000; Apr. 19, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Carr\u2019s motion to consolidate is granted. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-29\"> Although the district court\u2019s orders were marked as \"filed\u201d on February 2, 2000, and April 18, 2000, respectively, the district court\u2019s records show that they were entered on the docket sheet on February 7, 2000, and April 18, 2000. Pursuant to Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the date that the orders were entered on the docket sheet that we take as the effective date of the district court\u2019s decisions. <em>Wilson v.
