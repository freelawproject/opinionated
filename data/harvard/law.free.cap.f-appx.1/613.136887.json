Having closely scrutinized the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Berkner\u2019s lawsuit based on his lack of cooperation in the discovery process, culminating in his failure to comply with its order compelling discovery, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Schojfstall v.. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Henderson, </em>223 F.3d 818, 823 (8th Cir. 2000) (standard of review; district court may dismiss action as sanction for failing to comply with discovery orders if there is order compelling discovery, it is willfully violated, and there is prejudice to other party). We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to appellee. <em>See Comiskey v. JFTJ Corp., </em>989 F.2d 1007, 1012 (8th Cir. 1993) (Rule 37 authorizes award encompassing all expenses, whenever incurred, that would not have been sustained had party conducted itself properly). To the extent Berkner is requesting an in camera hearing, we deny his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-15\">. The Honorable Paul A.
