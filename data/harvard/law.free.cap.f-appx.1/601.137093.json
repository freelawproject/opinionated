An administrative law judge (ALJ) decided that Laney could not return to his past relevant work as a custodian, but that Laney retained the residual functional capacity to perform other sedentary work. The Commissioner denied benefits, and Laney sought judicial review. The district court concluded the decision was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. On appeal, Laney contends the ALJ committed error in not calling a vocational expert to testify and in failing to make appropriate credibility determinations of Laney\u2019s witnesses. Having carefully reviewed the record, we reject Laney\u2019s contentions for the reasons given in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We thus affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
