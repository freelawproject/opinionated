The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-23\">Defendant Roel Lee Lahi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault on a child in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a), 2241(c), and 2246(2)(A) and (D). As part of the plea, Mr. Lahi stipulated that he had (1) used force in committing the offenses, and (2) that the victims were under his care and custody at the time the crimes occurred. At sentencing, the court imposed enhancements based on those stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>In this appeal, he presents a single issue for the court\u2019s consideration. Mr. Lahi maintains, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his sentence must be vacated because he was not put on notice that he was subject to increased penalties under the Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, he argues the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancements violates <em>Apprendi. </em>Because we conclude Mr. Lahi has not presented a colorable <em>Apprendi </em>claim, however, we dismiss this matter for lack of jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The only relief which Mr. Lahi seeks is remand for new sentencing. Thus, we turn first to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) for guidance in determining the proper scope of our jurisdiction. Under that statute, we possess jurisdiction to review sentences imposed \u201cin violation of law, or as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>919 F.2d 1478, 1479 (10th Cir.1990). Because Mr. Lahi argues neither with specificity, the United States maintains we have no authority to consider the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In contrast, appellant maintains, based on the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, that the issue presented is not one related to sentencing, but rather, one regarding the sufficiency of the indictment. Mr. Lahi argues the indictment was flawed because it did not mention either the \u201cuse of force\u201d or \u201ccare and custody\u201d enhancement factors which were used to increase Mr. Lahi\u2019s sentence. He maintains the failure to mention those factors in the indictment renders it insufficient to support the crime charged. <em>See United States v. Bullock, </em>914 F.2d 1413, 1414 (10th Cir.1990) (noting \u201cthat the failure of an indictment to state an offense is a fatal defect that may be raised at any time\u201d). The argument follows that the resulting sentence is, therefore, illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The essence of Mr. Lahi\u2019s argument relates to the sentence itself. Specifically, he maintains the indictment did not include elements which were essential to the sentencing procedure. He does not take issue with any other aspect of the process, and, indeed, admits that prior to <em>Apprendi </em>there was no constitutional issue to raise. Moreover, he does not seek remand to withdraw his guilty plea to begin the process over. Rather, he seeks only reconsideration of the sentence. Thus, it is the sentence, and not the indictment procedure, which is at the core of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Although not argued as such in the opening brief, we conclude this is an argument regarding the constitutional validity of the sentence. <em>See Garcia, </em>919 F.2d at 1479-81 (discussing legislative history of \u00a7 3742(a) and noting Congressional intent to limit review of sentences imposed within a proper Guideline range); <em>see also United States v. Neary, </em>183 F.3d 1196, 1198 (10th Cir.1999) (defining facially illegal sentences \u201cas those based on race, gender, or other considerations contravening clearly established public policy\u201d). Consequently, we consider the arguments presented in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">In doing so, however, we conclude Mr. Lahi does not state a reviewable claim. He maintains <em>Apprendi </em>applies to cases where, as here, the sentence imposed is within the statutory maximum. This argument is unavailing. See <em>United States v. Hishaw, </em>235 F.3d 565 (10th Cir.2000) (concluding defendant could not prevail in showing plain error <em>on Apprendi </em>claim where he admitted cocaine possession and received a sentence within the statutory maximum proved at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The maximum penalty for the crime charged is life imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). Mr. Lahi was sentenced to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. That is at the low end of the applicable guideline range and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>is significantly lower than the potential maximum. Because the sentence is well below the maximum penalty, Mr. Lahi has not presented a colorable <em>Apprendi </em>claim. <em>United States v.. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 166 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Angle, </em>230 F.3d 113, 121 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Mack, </em>229 F.3d 226, 235 n. 12 (3d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 934 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513; <em>see also United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 1231 (10th Cir.2000) (concluding district courts may not impose a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum unless drug quantity is included in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt). As a result, he cannot make an arguable \u201cviolation of law\u201d claim under \u00a7 3742(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Consequently, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
