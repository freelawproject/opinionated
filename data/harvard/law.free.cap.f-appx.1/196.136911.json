Mitchell appeals his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846 (West 2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-23\">On appeal, Mitchell contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requires that his conviction and sentence be vacated. Because Mitchell\u2019s sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release does not exceed the twenty-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment or unspecified maximum term of supervised release set out in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999) for the core offense without enhancement for drug quantity, we find that his sentence is permissible under <em>Apprendi See United States v. Angle, </em>230 F.3d 113 (4th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, de</em>nied'\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 518 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm Mitchell\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
