He appeals both his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">He challenges his conviction on the ground that the district court erred in admitting a statement that Naha volunteered after being advised of his Miranda rights. The evidence that was admitted apparently was a statement made immediately after Naha said that he was going to get a lawyer. The comment concerning the lawyer was not admitted, because it was properly held inadmissible as an invocation of the right to counsel. Statements that follow such invocation, however, may be admitted; <em>see United States v. Valencia, </em>773 F.2d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.1985). We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the statements admitted were not part of the invocation of the right to counsel. Moreover, the statements admitted did not share the same indicia of culpability that renders a request for counsel inadmissible. <em>See U.S. v. Kallin, </em>50 F.3d 689, 693 (9th Cir.1995) (as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">Naha challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court engaged in impermissible double counting under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines by looking to the same conduct to increase the base offense level for use of force and also to enhance the sentence for having the victim under his \u201ccare, custody and control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">The district court\u2019s decision was not in error. The district court determined Naha\u2019s sentence by applying different portions of the guidelines to different aspects of Naha\u2019s conduct, which created independent harms. <em>See U.S. v. Parker, </em>136 F.3d 653, 654 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (holding that a court may apply different portions of the Guidelines to the same course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of conduct when such conduct creates different harms).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-14\">.
