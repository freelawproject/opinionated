After de novo review, <em>see Weaver v. Clarke, </em>45 F.3d 1253, 1255 (8th Cir.1995), we agree with the district court Thompson failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim against the prison doctor. The Eighth Amendment does not prohibit a prison doctor from exercising his own independent medical judgment, and inmates do not have a constitutional right to any particular type of treatment. <em>See Long v. Nix, </em>86 F.3d 761, 765 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
