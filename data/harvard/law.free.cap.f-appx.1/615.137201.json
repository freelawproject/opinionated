The Honorable John B.

The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate after determining that the policy unambiguously excludes coverage for such injuries. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">On appeal, the Garretts contend: (1) that the court should have stayed the federal action until a state court action filed by Linda Garrett against her husband and Allstate has been concluded, (2) that the contract provision relied upon by Allstate is ambiguous and therefore must be construed in favor of the Garretts, and (3) that the provision is unenforceable as contrary to Arkansas public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">First, we conclude that it was proper for the district court to deny the Garretts\u2019 motion for a stay. We review the district court\u2019s decision to entertain a declaratory judgment action for abuse of discretion. <em>Capitol Indem. Corp. v. Haverfield, </em>218 F.3d 872, 874 (8th Cir.2000). The district court \u201cmust consider the scope and nature of the pending state court proceeding to ascertain whether the issues in controversy between the parties to the federal action ... can be better settled by the state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Haverfield, </em>we held that a district court had abused its discretion by allowing a federal declaratory judgment suit to proceed when a state court was considering the same issue between the same parties. <em>Haverfield, </em>218 F.3d at 875. In that case, the parties, issue, and arguments were the same in the pending state and federal actions, while the relevant state law, decisive in the case, was unclear and the subject of a split in the decisions of the courts within the state. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">In this case, Linda Garrett is suing in state court to establish her husband\u2019s liability to her for her injuries. The case has not yet reached a conclusion, and although Allstate is named in the state court action, no indemnity action against Allstate has been filed. In contrast, this federal declaratory action seeks a ruling on the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage. Thus, the arguments and the relevant issues are not the same. Additionally, unlike the situation in <em>Haverfield, </em>Arkansas law is settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>on the general status of exclusionary clauses like the one at issue in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant the Garretts\u2019 motion to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Second, we agree with the district court that Allstate relies on a contractual provision that is unambiguous and excludes coverage for Linda Garrett\u2019s injuries. Section II of the insurance policy states that Allstate will pay \u201call sums arising from an accidental loss which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage resulting\u201d from the ownership, maintenance, or use of covered property. Appellants\u2019 App. at tab 2, boat owners\u2019 policy at 12 (emphasis omitted). Section II also lists those losses that are excluded from coverage and includes the following provision: \u201c2. We do not cover bodily injury to an insured person or property damage to property owned by an insured person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13 (emphasis omitted). The definitions section of the policy provides that: an \u201cinsured person\u201d means \u201cyou and, if a resident of your household: (a) any relative .... \u201d \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d under the policy \u201cmeans the person named on the declarations page as the insured and that person\u2019s resident spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">It is undisputed that the Garretts are both named on the declarations page of the policy as insured persons. Linda Garrett\u2019s injuries are therefore excluded from coverage. The Garretts contend, however, that the exclusionary provision at issue could be interpreted as excluding coverage only for those losses that are self-inflicted by an insured person. We agree with the district court that the clause is unambiguous and not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation offered by the Garretts.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Finally, we reject the Garretts\u2019 contention that state statutes requiring boat owners to obtain general liability insurance on their watercraft indicate that public policy forbids exclusionary clauses like the one in question. The Arkansas Supreme Court has concluded, however, that in the context of automobile insurance neither public policy nor the statutory requirement of liability insurance prohibits exclusionary clauses similar to the one in this case. <em>See Cook v. Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>299 Ark. 520, 772 S.W.2d 614, 615-16 (Ark.1989); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Cartmel, </em>250 Ark. 77, 463 S.W.2d 648, 650 (Ark.1971) (\u201cAlthough [such exclusionary clauses] are quite far reaching and at times appear to have unfortunate effects, such clauses, absent statutory strictures to the contrary, are generally enforced according to their terms.\u201d). In the light of these decisions, we conclude that the exclusionary clause in the Gar-retts\u2019 policy is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-16\">.
