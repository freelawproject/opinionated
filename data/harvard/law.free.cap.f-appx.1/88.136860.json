Ntoutoum argues that (i) the district court committed reversible error by receiving into evidence certain pre-and post-arrest statements that were arguably taken in violation of Ntoutoum\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and (ii) the district court abused its discretion when it denied Ntout-oum\u2019s motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, to dismiss on the ground that the government failed to present adequate proof that the bank from which the proceeds of the check would have been withdrawn was insured by the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">With respect to Ntoutoum\u2019s statements, the other evidence against him so powerfully proved his guilt that, even assuming the statements should not have been received, the error would be harmless. With respect to the federally insured status of the defrauded bank, we find no merit in Ntoutoum\u2019s contention that the government was obligated to prove the insured status of the drawee bank (Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.) rather than the bank (Chase Manhattan) in which the defendant sought to deposit the counterfeit check, or his contention that the federally insured status of Chase was not adequately proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
