We held in abeyance the defendants/appellants\u2019 cross-appeal of summary judgment in favor of eight plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim, and as to that issue, certified a question to the California Supreme Court. On August 16, 2000, the California Supreme Court responded that under California law,</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">An employer may terminate a written employment security policy that contains a specified condition, if the condition is one of indefinite duration and the employer makes the change after a reasonable time, on reasonable notice, and without interfering with the employees\u2019 vested benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\"><em>Asmus v. Pacific Bell, </em>23 Cal.4th 1, 18, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 999 P.2d 71 (Cal.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s response to the certified question makes clear that Pacific Bell had the right to terminate its Management Employment Security Policy as it did. The MESP did not have a fixed period of duration; its termination was preceded by reasonable notice and did not interfere with vested employee benefits. Accordingly, the eight plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment concerning the breach of contract claim should have been denied, and the defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment should have been granted. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for entry of judgment consistent with this Memorandum.
