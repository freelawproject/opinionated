The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b696-16\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-17\">Attorney Usha Viswanathan appeals pro se 1) the district court\u2019s summary judgment against her on claims she brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000, and the Unruh Act, California Civil Code \u00a7 51; 2) the district court\u2019s denial of Ms. Viswana-than\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion for additional discovery; and 3) the district court\u2019s order granting in part Stanford\u2019s motion for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Viswanathan is a graduate of Stanford Law School (\u201cStanford\u201d) who sued Stanford, Stanford\u2019s Career Services Office and its director Gloria Pyszka (collectively, \u201cStanford Defendants\u201d), Cooley Godward LLP (\u201cCooley\u201d) and Cooley attorney Jeffrey Zimman after she failed to obtain employment with a private law firm. As the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-18\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">A. Statute of Limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-19\">Viswanathan was required to file her administrative charge with the EEOC within 300 days from the date of the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>leged discriminatory act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (2000). A claim for discrimination accrues upon notice of the unlawful act. <em>Aronsen v. Crown Zellerbach, </em>662 F.2d 584, 593 (9th Cir.1981). Viswanathan testified that she \u201cput all the pieces together\u201d as to the \u201cdiscriminatory behavior\u201d when she graduated from Stanford in June 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Reasoning that commencement occurred, at the latest, by June 30, 1994, the district court held that Viswanathan\u2019s action is time-barred because her administrative complaint was filed some 495 days after she recognized the alleged discriminatory conduct. To avoid this result, Viswanathan contends that \u201cwhen\u201d she graduated refers to her post-graduation interactions with Pyszka, which took place from February to November 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Viswanathan\u2019s post-hoc interpretation of her own testimony is insufficient to present a triable issue regarding the timeliness of her claim. In fact, it is directly contrary to her argument that Stanford had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d of its discrimination against her while she was student. Vis-wanathan fails to explain why <em>she </em>did not have notice of discrimination which allegedly occurred during law school until eight months after graduation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The continuing violations doctrine does not save Viswanathan\u2019s claim. It applies when a plaintiff shows either 1) an organization-wide policy and practice of discrimination, or 2) a series of related discriminatory acts directed toward an individual. <em>Fielder v. UAL Corp., </em>218 F.3d 973, 983 (9th Cir.2000). Either way, plaintiff must establish that the discriminatory practice or acts occurred, at least in part, during the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Viswanathan fails to provide evidence of any discriminatory act during the limitation period or of a \u201ccontinuing\u201d relationship between alleged acts. Between early 1994 and early 1995 there was a gap of ten to twelve months during which Viswana-than had no communication with Pyszka. There was no opportunity for discrimination during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Nor is there any evidence of discrimination after Viswanathan graduated from law school. Viswanathan\u2019s claims that 1) she was not allowed to interview on campus while other graduates were, and 2) that Pyszka relayed negative information about her to Zimman are completely unsupported by the record. There is no triable issue as to a continuing violation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Accordingly, Viswanathan failed to bring her claim within the period of limitation established by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">B. Denial of Viswanathan\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Viswanathan also failed to carry her burden of establishing a nexus between the discovery sought and the dispositive issue of the timeliness of her claims. Viswanathan admitted she had already deposed the \u201cprincipal witnesses\u201d in the case and failed to explain her cancellation, delay, or continuation of several depositions. Defendants provided Viswanathan ten weeks\u2019 notice of their intent to file for summary judgment and the motions were filed ten months after the complaint. Viswanathan had ample time to conduct discovery and failed to show how more time would help her overcome the statute of limitation bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">C. Discrimination under Title VTI and the Unruh Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">Even if Viswanathan\u2019s claim had been timely filed, she failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. There is no evidence that the Defendants denied Viswanathan referrals for interviews for law firm positions either before or after graduation, nor that she was \u201ctracked\u201d into lesser-paying government positions. It is undisputed that Viswanathan had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>eighty-five on-campus interviews with private law firms which were randomly assigned to her without reference to any immutable characteristic or her grades. Viswanathan has failed to provide any evidence that she did not have access to every opportunity afforded other Stanford students and graduates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">D. Attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Attorneys\u2019 fees are available under Title VII if the suit was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d <em>Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>484 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the Stanford Defendants $10,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Viswanathan not only failed to present any credible evidence of discrimination by the Stanford Defendants, but her own personal knowledge indicated a lack of foundation for her claims. Viswanathan admitted that she was never denied employment referrals by Stanford and conceded that the only employment offers she received in law school were due to Pyszka\u2019s efforts on her behalf. The record supports a finding that her claims lacked any factual or legal support.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">The amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the district court was reasonable. Taking into account Viswanathan\u2019s limited resources and the fees incurred by the Stanford Defendants ($121,732.52 through summary judgment), an award of $10,000 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">E. Failure to name parties in administrative charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">The failure to name a party in an EEOC charge precludes the possibility of suing under Title VII unless the unnamed party was 1) involved in acts which were the subject of the EEOC charge, or 2) \u201cshould have anticipated\u201d that it would be named in a Title VII suit. <em>Ortez v. Washington County, 88 </em>F.3d 804, 808 (9th Cir. 1996). Neither exception absolves Viswanathan\u2019s failure to name the Cooley firm and Mr. Zimman in her EEOC claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">Viswanathan amended her administrative charges on three occasions over a seven month period, however all of her allegations involved actions by Pyszka. In light of Viswanathan\u2019s baseless theory on Zimman (and Cooley\u2019s) liability,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court was correct in finding that the latter parties could not have anticipated being named in this lawsuit. The record reveals that Zimman interviewed Viswana-than at the behest of Pyszka and made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>decision not to offer her a call-back based on Viswanathan\u2019s poor interview skills, poor grades, and her failure to take and pass the bar examination. These facts do not constitute participation in a discriminatory act, nor should they have put Zimman and Cooley on notice of a possible lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The judgment and award of attorneys\u2019 fees is affirmed in all respects. Pursuant to their request and this Court\u2019s holding, Stanford Defendants are hereby granted costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-12\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. The Unruh Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 51, requires an intentional denial of equal accommodations, advantages, facilities or services and applies only to \u201cbusiness establishments.\u201d Not only has Viswanathan failed to make the requisite showing, but it is self-evident that this claim cannot apply to Ms. Pyszka since she is not a \"business establishment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. While Viswanathan is pro se in this action, it should be noted that she is a Stanford Law graduate and a member of the California Bar. The reasonableness of her decision to file this lawsuit should be evaluated in light of her professional qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">. The district court correctly observed that Title VII actions which have been held proper against \"unnamed\u201d parties have involved agents or employees of the party named in the administrative complaint. Here, Cooley and Zimman are independent parties and it would be anomalous to hold that they were \"on notice\u201d by virtue of Viswanathan\u2019s administrative charges against the Stanford Defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b698-16\">. Viswanathan claims that 1) Pyszka conveyed negative information about her to Zim-man prior to her interview with him, 2) Zim-man acted on this negative information by denying her a callback, and 3) Zimman should have known his \u201cparticipation in the act\u201d would make him amenable to Title VII suit. Notably, Viswanathan does not claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>that Zimman conveyed negative information about her to other firms or otherwise engaged in any discriminatory conduct proscribed by law. While Zimman was contacted by the DFEH investigator as a <em>witness </em>regarding Vis-wanathan's charges against Pyszka, it is hard to imagine that he would anticipate being named in a suit based on these unsupported assertions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
