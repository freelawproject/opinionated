Swindell argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter, a defense theory of the case, violated Swindell\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-24\">A criminal defendant is entitled to adequate instructions on a defense theory of the case \u201cprovided that [the defense theory] is supported by law and has some foundation in the evidence.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>States v. Mason, </em>902 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir.1990). Because we find that Swindell\u2019s theory of the case had no foundation in the evidence, we conclude that the trial judge did not commit error, much less constitutional error, in refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Judge JAMES R.
