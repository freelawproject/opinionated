We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Sturgis, </em>No. CR-93-373-A (E.D. Va. Nov. 24 <em>&amp; </em>Dec. 20, 1999).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We also deny Sturgis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>motion to have a copy of a transcript prepared at government expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\"> Although the district court\u2019s order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion is marked as \"filed\u201d on November 23, 1999, the district court\u2019s records show that it was entered on the docket sheet on November 24, 1999. Pursuant to Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the date that the order was entered on the docket sheet that we take as the effective date of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>Wilson v. Murray, </em>806 F.2d 1232, 1234-35 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
