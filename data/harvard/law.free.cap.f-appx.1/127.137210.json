He was sentenced to a total of 1120 months imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On appeal, Hughes argues that: (l)the district court plainly erred in admitting prior consistent statements of government witnesses; there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun; and (3) there is insufficient evidence to support the Hobbs Act convictions in the absence of the jurisdictional element of an interstate commerce nexus. We have reviewed the briefs submitted by the parties, and the material presented in the joint appendix, and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Hughes\u2019 convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
