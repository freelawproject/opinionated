Porter, Jr., et al., sued appellee, Boyd Bingham (Bingham), in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County as the result of an automobile accident. They alleged that Bingham operated his motor vehicle \u201cin a grossly negligent, reckless, wanton and outrageous manner, and with utter indifference to his obligations to exercise due care in general and to the plaintiff in particular, * * * while intentionally under the influence of alcoholic beverage\u201d and claimed punitive damages. A demurrer by Bingham was sustained with leave to amend, Judge Moorman having held on the strength of <em>Davis v. Gordon, </em>183 Md. 129, 36 A. 2d 699 (1944), that the declaration was \u201cnot sufficient as a matter of law to justify a claim for punitive damages.\u201d Cf. <em>Conklin v. Schillinger, </em>255 Md. 50, 71, 257 A. 2d 187 (1969). Porter filed an amended declaration on July 24 and on the same day filed an appeal to this Court \u201cfrom the Opinion and Order of Judge Moorman * * * sustaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Demurrer to the original Declaration * * * and thereby prohibiting the plaintiffs from suing for punitive damages for gross negligence as alleged\u201d and requests that we pass upon this action on the part of Judge Moorman.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">With the exception of the matters specified in Code (1968 Repl. Vol.) Art. 5, \u00a7 1A, not here pertinent, appeals from courts of law are to be only from final judgments. See Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 1 and <em>Merlands Club v. Messall, </em>238 Md. 359, 361, 208 A. 2d 687 (1965), and cases there cited. In <em>Evans v. Shiloh Baptist Church, </em>196 Md. 543, 551, 77 A. 2d 160 (1950), in an opinion by Judge (later Chief Judge) Markell this Court specifically held \u201cthat an order sustaining a demurrer to the bill, with leave to amend, is not appealable\u201d and proceeded to dismiss the appeal. In this instance the fact that the matter is at law rather than in equity in no way changes the situation. This is not an appeal allowed by law and, therefore, under Maryland Rule 835 the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
