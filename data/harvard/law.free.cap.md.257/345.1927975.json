Following argument on motions for judgment N.O.V. and for a new trial, judgment on the verdict was made absolute in favor of Carmody against the appellant (Sun) in the amount of $55,777. Sun urges us to set at naught $17,200 (issues four and five) of the judgment, invoking, as it did below, section IV (5) of the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 2, C. 3, \u00a7 IV (5) (1676), 2 <em>Alexander\u2019s British Statutes </em>689 (Coe ed. 1912). Judge Grady held, correctly we think, that the Statute is not applicable. Our recital of the pertinent facts is a distillate of more than 1,000 pages of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Upon finishing law school Carmody, now 67, sought employment in the insurance industry. In time he became vice president, in charge of claims, of National Mutual Insurance Company of Washington. Eventually Herbert Glassman, who owned Sun, acquired control of National. Sun had been insured by National for many years, during which time there was an agreement between the two companies in respect of collections from tortfeasors causing damage to Sun\u2019s taxicabs in motor vehicle accidents. National was paid 50% of the amounts recovered out of which it had to pay its expenses, including attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>neys\u2019 fees. In 1961 Glassman, having decided to sell his interest in National, offered Carmody the same arrangement. Carmody accepted. He began working on Sun\u2019s claims in December 1961. The arrangement was never reduced to writing. Carmody\u2019s status was that of independent contractor. He testified that under his arrangement with Sun he was not to be called upon to perform any other services without compensation. Glassman, on the other hand, testified that Carmody was to \u201cassist Mr. Schiff [Sun\u2019s president and Glassman\u2019s brother-in-law] and pay his attorneys that represent him in all matters pertaining to insurance. Also, if * * * [he] had enough time\u201d to handle \u201cthe safety end of the cab company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In 1962 American Insurance Company, one of Sun\u2019s compensation carriers, demanded a retrospective premium of $23,000. Carmody testified Schiff proposed to him that he resist American\u2019s claim on the same contingent basis that applied in respect of the damage cases, i.e., 50% of any amount he could save for Sun. Schiff denied this. He said Carmody was obliged to do this free of charge. As a result of Carmody\u2019s activities American abandoned its entire claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">A year or more after American made its demand Security Insurance Company, another compensation carrier, billed Sun for an $11,000 retrospective premium. Schiff again, according to Carmody, solicited his assistance on the same terms. Schiff denied this also. Again as a result of Carmody\u2019s efforts Security abandoned its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On Christmas Eve, 1966, Schiff told Carmody the company had been sold and that all of Sun\u2019s personnel \u201cwas to go with the new owners with two exceptions, he [Schiff] was out and so was [Carmody].\u201d When Carmody asked for an accounting and payment Schiff said \u201che wasn\u2019t going to pay [him] for anything.\u201d He said \u201che was getting out and he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d He invited Carmody to \u201cgo ahead and sue Sun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">In denying Sun\u2019s motion for a directed verdict Judge Grady held, paraphrasing 2 Corbin, <em>Contra\u00e9is </em>\u00a7 448 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(1950), that \u201cthe agreement must be one of which it can truly be said that it is not to be performed within one year * * *, that there must not be the slightest possibility that it can be fully performed within one year.\u201d Judge Grady thereupon instructed the jury (as to issues four and five) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cNow, Issue Four reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cDo you find any money due to the plaintiff from the defendant as a result of an alleged verbal agreement between the plaintiff and Mr. Schiff of the Sun Cab Company concerning the plaintiff\u2019s services rendered in connection with a claim made by the American Insurance Company against the defendant for retrospective insurance premiums ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201cIssue Five is exactly the same except that. instead of relating to the American Insurance Company it relates to the other insurance company mentioned in the evidence, the Security Insurance Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cIn order for the plaintiff to recover under Issues Four and Five, you must find that he has established from the evidence that there was an agreement between the plaintiff and Mr. Schiff of the Sun Cab Company to the effect that the plaintiff would receive for his services in these two matters an amount equal to one-half of any savings to the Sun Cab Company, which he might accomplish. You must further find that these savings were in fact accomplished as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s services. So that if you find that this agreement was made and that the plaintiff did render services under this agreement concerning workmen\u2019s compensation insurance policies and that his services did effect savings for the defendant company, then your answer to part A of Issues Four and Five will be \u2018yes.\u2019 You will then go on and consider part B under each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of those two issues, and your answers then would be one-half of whatever savings you should find the plaintiff effected through his efforts. On the other hand, if you find that the plaintiff has failed to prove that such an agreement was made, or if your minds are in a state of even balance on that question, or if you find that he failed to prove that these services did effect the savings to the company, then your answer to part A of Issues Four and Five would be \u2018no.\u2019 If you answer \u2018no,\u2019 to both of these issues, then you would not consider part B which relates to the amount of money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Counsel\u2019s exception to the instruction set forth above was based entirely on the ground that the cause of action stated in each of the two issues was barred by the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Despite Sun\u2019s somewhat tortured arguments to the contrary we think our predecessors have given the applicable principles of law a solid foundation. In <em>Ellicott v. Peterson\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>4 Md. 476, 488 (1853), Chief Judge Le Grand, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201cThese principles have been recognized by innumerable decisions both in England and this country. And in pursuance of the principles which they sustain, especially that of the case of <em>Peter vs. Compton </em>[Skinner, 353], it has been held both in England and in these States, the statute will not apply where the contract can, <em>by any possibility, </em>be fulfilled or completed in the space of a year, <em>although the parties may have intended its operation should extend through a much longer period.\u201d </em>(Original emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In <em>Cole v. Singerly, </em>60 Md. 348, 354 (1883), Judge Yellott, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201cThe learned Chief Judge [Le Grand] who delivered the opinion of the Court in that case <em>[Ellicott, </em>supra] supported this construction of the Statute by the citation of a number of authorities, both English and American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThis is therefore no longer a mooted question in Maryland. When there is a possibility that the services may be performed within a year, the remedy for a breach of the contract is not barred by the Statute. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The principles of law enunciated in <em>Ellicott </em>and <em>Cole </em>have been approved and followed in <em>Lipscomb v. Hess, </em>255 Md. 109, 119 (1969) ; <em>Home News, Inc. v. Goodman, </em>182 Md. 585, 595 (1944) ; <em>Warren v. Ayres, </em>126 Md. 551, 557 (1915) ; <em>Campbell v. Burnett, </em>120 Md. 214, 224 (1913) ; <em>H. J. McGrath Co. v. Marchant, </em>117 Md. 472, 479-80 (1912) ; and <em>Lewis v. Tapman, </em>90 Md. 294, 302 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">We have found nothing in this record to indicate that the parties \u201cexpressly and specifically\u201d agreed that their oral contracts were <em>not </em>to be performed by Carmody within a year. Indeed there is nothing to show what, if anything, either of them had in mind in this regard. Carmody said he \u201chad no idea how long it would take <em>* </em>* * [him].\u201d Sun, of course, denies there ever were any such agreements. Nevertheless, even if there were, performance within a year was impossible, argues Sun and, to be sure, its argument in this regard is quite persuasive of the <em>improbability </em>of performance within a year but, in our judgment, it falls conspicuously short of coming to grips with the concept of <em>impossibility. </em>It is at once apparent that Carmody is anything but a tyro in this branch of the insurance business. He emerges from this record as an experienced, competent, hard-nosed claims man who, when the need arose, did not hesitate to speak his mind. He related in colorful detail how he harassed American and that its entire claim ultimately was ab\u00e1ndoned is hardly cause for surprise. We think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>rather obvious that the entire matter could have been wrapped up in much less than a year. After Carmody had pointed out irregularities in a few selected cases he considered he had American \u201cvery much on the run.\u201d Indeed, before long he was actually threatening to sue for the recovery of a sum greater than the $23,000 claimed. In these circumstances a compromise settlement might very well have been worked out or American might have done sooner what it did later, i.e., abandon its claim. Security\u2019s claim presented a similar situation and its disposition was accomplished in like manner. If not the most persuasive, surely the most diverting tidbit supporting the possibility of performance within a year is found in the cross-examination of Schiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u201cQ. Let me ask you this, sir: In the past when you have handled this yourself, have you had any particular difficulty with any of them? [Claims for retrospective premiums.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\u201cQ. My question is: On some of these, that you handled in the past, you closed out within twelve months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I would say \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">That Carmody has fully performed the contracts in respect of the claims of American and Security is beyond dispute. Indeed Sun, in effect, concedes what the jury has found to be so. If Carmody is denied compensation Glass-man obviously will be enriched by $17,200. As Judge Le Grand said, for the Court, in <em>Ellicott, supra, </em>\u201c[t]he law will not allow a man to accept a delivery of goods [or the performance of services] without making him liable to pay for them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. He went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201cWhere there is a contract for the performance of services, or for the sale and delivery of goods which is within the statute, if the services be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>rendered or the goods delivered and be accepted, the party doing the work or delivering the goods may recover on a <em>quantum meruit, </em>and he may give in evidence the agreement under which the labor was performed or the goods delivered as a part of the <em>res gestae \u201d Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Quite recently, in <em>Lipscomb v. Hess, supra </em>at 119, Judge Singley, for the Court, said that \u201c [w] e have consistently held that an agreement which has been fully performed by the party seeking to enforce it is not within the Statute of Frauds,\u201d citing <em>Home News, Inc. v. Goodman, supra, </em>and <em>Ellicott, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Were we to hold that these two contracts do fall within the Statute, Carmody would be entitled to have his case remanded for the assessment of damages by a jury on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis. It is doubtful the result would be any different since the contracts would be admissible evidence and it seems to us unlikely that any jury, in measuring its verdict, would fail to adopt the percentage agreed upon. But there is no need to remand the case because we are fully persuaded, as was Judge Grady, that the Statute has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
