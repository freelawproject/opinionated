He is a Pole; she was born in Colombia. He is fluent in Spanish and English; she speaks no Polish and only kitchen English. From the beginning, according to him, their marriage was plagued by her \u201cterrible and uncontrollable moods.\u201d There were times, he said, when coming home was \u201cjust like walking into a hell.\u201d She, on the other hand, said they were \u201cvery happy together.\u201d There are no children.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In April 1968 they left New York and came to Baltimore County so that Andrew could be near his work. He had been hired as an engineer by the Head Ski Company. With them came Norita Cortez, a maid sent from Colombia by Ligia\u2019s family and Maria Gornyzka, a visitor from Poland, related distantly to Andrew. Ligia got the notion that Maria was not only carrying on with a number of men, including Andrew, but that she also had Lesbian designs on Norita. Andrew testified that she chased him around the house with \u201cknives and crystal vases\u201d and threw at him whatever was at hand. On two occasions he was obliged to call the police. Maria witnessed Ligia\u2019s armed pursuit of Andrew one night in August. She said she had \u201cnever in * * * [her] life seen a wife have knives toward her husband.\u201d She left the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">On the night of 10 October, according to Andrew, Ligia slipped a note under his bedroom door. The note, in Spanish,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is dated \u201c9-7/68.\u201d She calls it her last note <em>(carta) </em>to him and she went on to say that on the day following she (and Norita) would leave the house for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ever <em>(\u201cma\u00f1ana nos vamos para siempre de esta casa\u201d). </em>She had gone when Andrew returned home from work the next day. He assumed, correctly it seems, that she \u201cwent to the house of one of her Colombian friends\u201d in New York. He moved to a nearby small hotel a day or so later. On 15 October he filed a bill for a divorce a mensa et thoro. She testified she returned home on 16 October but the sheriff\u2019s return shows that service of process was made upon her, on 17 October, at the New York address. At about this time she wrote to Andrew\u2019s mother saying she didn\u2019t want him any more. Counsel for the parties seem to have tried, without success, to resolve their differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On 6 January 1969, Ligia answered the bill of complaint and filed a \u201cCounter Complaint\u201d alleging desertion by Andrew but asking only for alimony, counsel fees and general relief. The case came on for trial before Maguire, J., on 31 January 1969. After two days of testimony Judge Maguire said, from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201c(The Court) Gentlemen, in this case we have two apparently essentially different stories. It is obvious to the Court that the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Styka was a very unpleasant one for some period of time. These matters are normally not very difficult, particularly when there are no children involved, and there are none in this case, so it becomes a matter for the Court to determine whom does it believe. If I believe Mr. Styka, then whatever Mrs. Styka has had to say to me, has testified to, and her maid, are complete perjury. If I choose to believe her as to what her testimony and her witnesses, and not Mr. Styka, then his testimony is completely of a perjured nature. That is exactly where we stand, whom the Court may or may not believe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">\u201cThis letter [9-7/68] has to be given a great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>deal of weight because of the contents of the letter and there is no question about what it says. Properly interpreted, it says we are not getting along and I am going to leave.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cIt is most unfortunate to get into these situations where in a court of law, where two adult people are testifying, and somebody lies from the very beginning. It shocks the conscience of the Court to do a thing like that because it is obvious fco me one or the other has no respect for the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cThere are no children involved, so if the Court sees fit not to grant the a mensa divorce, the status of the husband and wife doesn\u2019t change any. If the Court sees fit to grant, of course, it changes. It seems to me under the circumstances that exist, the husband said he could never live with her and the wife says well, he can come back \u2014 but it is hard to believe that she is sincere about that. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cThere is no problem with respect to the Court because there are no children involved. I think that that, and the letter written by the wife, she fully intended to separate, no longer live with Mr. Styka. And I think that she left for New York with the intention to go to New York and to come back when she was good and ready. I think she deserted the husband at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201cIf you will prepare a decree for a divorce a mensa et thoro * * *, I will sign it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Placing great reliance on <em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>177 Md. 687 (unreported), 11 A. 2d 461 (1940), Ligia insists that \u201ca five day absence is not desertion.\u201d The record suggests her stay may have been a little longer. We did say in <em>Boyd, </em>where the wife filed her bill for a divorce a mensa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>within 48 hours after her husband\u2019s departure, that the length of time during which the separation has existed ought to be considered in determining whether an alleged abandonment is real, or exists merely in the imagination or desire of the complaining party. But we also said that \u201ca divorce for abandonment and desertion under the provisions of * * * [Code, Art. 16, \u00a7 25 (1966 Repl. Vol.)] may be granted without regard to the duration of the abandonment.\u201d 11 A. 2d at 464. The chancellor was reversed, not because of the hasty filing of Mrs. Boyd\u2019s bill of complaint but because there was a complete lack of corroboration of her testimony. In different circumstances it very well might be that a \u201cfive day absence\u201d would not amount to desertion but, even if we assume it has the significance Ligia assigns to it, there is attenuating evidence here which cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">To support her argument that Andrew consented to her leaving, Ligia refers us to her testimony that he asked her for a divorce early in the morning of the day she left the house. But she also testified that earlier that same morning he came to her bedroom, admitted Maria was not \u201chis cousin,\u201d that \u201che wanted her here * * * and [he] apologized.\u201d Then, she went on, Andrew said, \u201cOh Ligia, you love me and I love you.\u201d She made no reply; as she put it, \u201cI do not say nothing, I show her.\u201d That Judge Maguire chose not to believe her is understandable. She argues further that Andrew\u2019s refusal of her several offers of reconciliation amounts to a consent to her desertion. Judge Maguire found it \u201chard to believe that she * * * [was] sincere about that.\u201d <em>See </em>Code, Art. 16, \u00a7 26A (1969 Cum. Supp.), and <em>Jester v. </em>Jester, 246 Md. 162, 169-70 (1967). In this regard there comes to mind the letter, dated 17 October 1968, to her mother-in-law in which she said she didn\u2019t \u201cwant him any more because he is very disonest person.\u201d In the same letter, after noting that\u2019 Andrew was \u201calmost 47,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t loos to much because I am a-young -woman.\u201d In conclusion she informed her mother-in-law that she was \u201cfeeling very well,\u201d that she had lost 14 pounds (she testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>fied she had been \u201cvery heavy\u201d) ; that her clothes were a better fit and that \u201con Saturday * * * [she expected to] go for a party with orquesta, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">There remain only the proforma contentions that the letter of 7 September 1968 (in Spanish) is not sufficient evidence of an intention to desert and that there is no corroboration. Judge Maguire thought her \u201cintention was obvious\u201d and that the letter \u201c * * * basically, said T am going to leave\u2019.\u201d We are unwilling to say that he is clearly in error in this regard. Familiar to all lawyers is the rule \u201c[t]hat <em>every </em>element <em>must </em>be corroborated\u201d but that \u201cin a contested divorce case where there is no basis for inferring collusion the corroboration need only be slight.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>257 Md. 263 (1970). We said recently, in <em>Ballan v. Ballan, </em>251 Md. 737, 740 (1969), what has been said so often, i.e., that \u201c[d]esertion has two elements, the ending of cohabitation and the intention to desert.\u201d That the ending of cohabitation has been corroborated is too obvious for further discussion. While the letter of \u201c9-7/68\u201d to Andrew and the letter of 17 October 1968 to Andrew\u2019s mother might have failed to provide the corroboration (of Ligia\u2019s intention to desert) required by former Maryland Rule S75 (deleted as of 1 October 1968) we think they amount to sufficient corroboration in the case at bar since the deletion of Rule S75 restored Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 4 (1969 Cum. Supp.) to its former effectiveness. The 1968 amendment to \u00a7 4 left undisturbed the clause construed in <em>Maranto v. Maranto, </em>192 Md. 214, 217 (1949), which is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Judge Maguire was presented with \u201ctwo apparently essentially different stories.\u201d He was there; he saw the witnesses; he heard them testify. He must have learned about them much more than the cold record reveals to us. Rule 886 a requires us to give \u201cdue regard\u201d to his \u201copportunity * * * to judge * * * [their] credibility.\u201d He elected to believe Andrew. We cannot say his judgment was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">. As translated by Andrew (Ligia does not agree), it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKA\">\u201cAndrew, this is the last letter I am writing, about leaving tomorrow, while going forever, from this house. This is sad after ten years of living together. I am on the street without money, without work and leaving the little that I have, without knowing where I am going. I am very sick. Please take care of my things until the time when the lawyers are going to get in touch with you. Thank you for the food and facilities to live for these ten years, Ligia\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
