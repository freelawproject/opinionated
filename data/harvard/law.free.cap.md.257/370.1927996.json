Morgan L. Amaimo, a lawyer who practiced in Baltimore, came to Grampa\u2019s bar in connection with his representation of the son of one of Grampa\u2019s barmaids. In the course of conversations with Grampa, Amaimo learned that Grampa was considering retiring from the tavern business and might have some money to invest. Amaimo introduced Frank J. lula, a friend and client, to Grampa.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In December of 1961 Grampa loaned $6,000 to lula and Edward Davis, an associate of Iula\u2019s, and took back 12 of their joint confessed judgment notes for $625 each,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one of which matured each month commencing in February of 1962. The money borrowed by lula and Davis was supposed to be used for the purchase of a tavern at Riviera Beach, a transaction which was never consummated. By March of 1962, two of the notes were in default. Grampa complained to Amaimo who arranged for Grampa to buy from Carmela A. lula, Frank J. Iula\u2019s mother, a judgment for $15,000 which she had entered on 21 February 1962 on a confessed judgment note of Peacock Land Corporation (Peacock), of which Frank J. lula was president. Grampa paid $11,250 for the judgment : $10,000 in cash and the two $625 notes of lula and Davis which were then in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Both the notes and the judgment later proved to be worthless. Grampa had judgment entered on eight of the notes in November of 1962 and by February of 1964 all hope of collecting on the judgment assigned to Grampa by Mrs. lula had vanished.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u25a0 In March, 1965, Grampa filed a bill of complaint in Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City against Amaimo, lula, Mrs. lula and Davis in which he sought a rescission of the transactions and an award of damages because of the fraud and deceit allegedly practiced upon him. Davis could never be found, and the case came on for hearing against Amaimo, lula and Mrs. lula. From a decree re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>scinding the assignment of the judgment and entering judgment for $11,250 with interest from 13 March 1962 and costs against Amaimo and lula, this appeal was taken. No cross appeal was entered in respect of the portion of the decree dismissing the bill as against Mrs. lula or because the court refused to rescind the promissory-notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Amaimo challenges the decree on the ground that it was error for the chancellor to find that Amaimo defrauded Grampa. Iula\u2019s argument is somewhat more complex: on the one hand he says that Grampa, having entered judgments on the eight notes, has elected his remedy and could not later seek equitable relief in connection with an obligation arising from the same transaction. On the other hand, lula argues that there can be no fraud when the value of the assigned judgment eroded subsequent to the assignment as a result of events beyond his control.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In an effort to achieve simplicity, we propose to deal with these contentions in reverse order of presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Election of Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">While lula is quite correct in arguing that not more than one suit may be instituted on the same instrument, Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl. Vol.) Art. 50 \u00a7 2 and that rights cannot be enforced piecemeal, <em>Ex parte Carlin, </em>212 Md. 526, 129 A. 2d 827 (1957) ; <em>Olmstead v. Bach, </em>78 Md. 132, 27 A. 501, 22 L.R.A. 74 (1893) ; <em>Whitehurst v. Rogers, </em>38 Md. 503 (1873), these principles are not applicable here. The short answer to this contention is that there were two wholly different and quite distinct obligations: One was the joint obligation of lula and Davis on the eight promissory notes which were ultimately reduced to judgment. The other was the judgment entered in favor of Carmela lula against Peacock Land Corporation, which was assigned by Mrs. lula to Gram-pa. Without passing on whether the rescission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>notes was barred by limitations, as the court held, or because Grampa had elected his remedy, as lula contends, we think that the chancellor was quite correct when he treated the transactions as separate and distinct and allowed recovery on the judgment and denied relief on the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The question whether Amaimo and lula or either of them practiced fraud and deceit on Grampa should be viewed in the.light of two prior cases, <em>Carozza v. Peacock Land Corp., </em>231 Md. 112, 188 A. 2d 917 (1963) and <em>Iula v. Progress Fed. S &amp; L Ass\u2019n, </em>247 Md. 421, 231 A. 2d 510 (1967) both of which bear peripherally on the problem. In <em>Carozza, </em>we sustained the purchaser\u2019s exceptions to the ratification of a sale at foreclosure of Peacock\u2019s property in Baltimore County for $275,700, holding that the inaccurate description of the property in the advertisement of sale amounted to a material misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In <em>Iula, </em>we held that when the same property, correctly described in the advertisement, had been resold in March of 1963 for $224,000, there could be no recovery of damages under the facts of that case, by lula, the mortgagor, against the mortgagee and the trustee who conducted the foreclosure sale because while neither the mortgagee nor the trustee was aware that the advertisement was in error, lula did know and failed to disclose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">What is salient here, however, goes beyond the rubric of the two cases. Peacock defaulted on its mortgage prior to 4 August 1961. On 25 September 1961, Peacock entered into a deed of trust for the benefit of creditors. On 10 November 1961, the property was sold for $275,700. The purchaser\u2019s exceptions were filed on 15 December 1961. Mrs. lula entered her confessed judgment on 21 February 1962, more than two months after the exceptions had been filed. The exceptions were overruled on 18 May 1962, and on 19 March 1963, we filed our opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ion, holding that the exceptions should have been sustained and remanded the case in order that the property could be resold.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">It was during the period between the institution of the foreclosure in August, 1961, and the hearing on the exceptions in May of 1962 that Grampa\u2019s conversations with Amaimo and lula took place. Grampa described them in his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cQ * * * How often after you met Mr. Amaimo did you see him thereafter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cA Pretty often. I would say, once every eight or ten days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">\u201cQ I see. And would you describe to the Judge in your own words what you all said to each other and what you all conversed about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cA Well, it was something like an acquaintance and we started talking and \u2014 Amaimo likes his beer, and he start talking. He start asking me different questions. How long had I been in business and so forth, and how old I was. I told him how old I was and I told him how long I was in business and that I had intentions to retire about a year after that. And he asked me what I intended to do after I retired. Well, I said, \u2018After I sell my business, I have a piece of property and I intend to buy some more and take care of that.\u2019 And he told me he knew a lot about property. In fact, he says, \u2018I have a shopping center and a gasoline station.\u2019 And he told me, \u2018I know about a lot of property. If I run into something, would you consider it?\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s too early yet. I intend to stay in business one more year and maybe more.\u2019 He said, \u2018But it takes time to find something suitable.\u2019 He say, \u2018Better start looking now.\u2019 I say, \u2018Mr. Amaimo, I got plenty of time.\u2019 He say, \u2018If I run into something, don\u2019t lose more time looking for anything.\u2019 So, that was it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>'\u201cSo, one day he stopped in my place and he asked me \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cQ You are talking about Mr. Amaimo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cQ Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cA Mr. Amaimo, he asked me if I had time to take a little ride with him. I said, \u2018Well, barmaid\u2019s here; business is slow.\u2019 I say, \u2018All right, I take a ride with you.\u2019 He didn\u2019t told me where he going to take me or nothing. So, we take a ride out Belair Road and we stop by Mr. Iula\u2019s restaurant. I didn\u2019t know Mr. lula until then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cQ Excuse me. Is this the gentleman here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cA That\u2019s Mr. lula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cQ You say you stopped in his restaurant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">\u201cA Yes. He introduced me to Mr. lula. He introduced Mr. lula as his friend and his campaign manager.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">Grampa said he went with lula and Amaimo to the Peacock Restaurant which was closed. According to Grampa\u2019s testimony, Amaimo asked Grampa to lend lula $60,000, which Grampa refused to do. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">\u201cQ What other deals did Mr. Amaimo come to you about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">\u201cA A real estate deal. One time he took me out to West Baltimore one place. It was a block of row houses. He told me, if I wanted to buy them; it was a changing neighborhood; I could buy them very cheap. And I told him that I didn\u2019t like it and that was it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-17\">\u201cSo, one time he come in with Mr. lula and wanted me to buy a slaughterhouse in South Carolina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">\u201cQ Buy a slaughterhouse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">\u201cA Yes. I said, T don\u2019t got the money to buy a slaughterhouse. I don\u2019t know nothing about the slaughterhouse.\u2019 He say, Mr. Amaimo say, \u2018Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>lula is going to run it for you and all you got to do is sit back and get your money.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Then, according to Grampa, Amaimo returned in late November, 1961:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cQ Who came?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cA Mr. Amaimo \u2014 always Mr. Amaimo. Mr. lula never did come by himself. And he say, that Mr. lula say, he had a place of business, the restaurant, but it was closed up and this manager, the restaurant manager, was without a job. He say, he wants to buy this business at Riviera Beach so this, Mr. Iula\u2019s manager, could run that business. So, Mr. Amaimo, we got in his car and he took me to Riviera Beach to look at this place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cQ I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cA And he said \u2014 Mr. Amaimo now \u2014 after paying me $625.00 a month, plus $250.00 rent, Mr. Amaimo said, it was set for him, $250.00 rent \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cQ The rent was $250.00 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cA It was over $800.00 a month. I say, T don\u2019t think this place can make it.\u2019 And he say, \u2018Oh, I know this place.\u2019 Mr. Amaimo say, \u2018I know this place from A to Z.\u2019 He say, \u2018The slot machine take over $600.00 a week,\u2019 he told me. And he told me he knew the licensee and he knew the actual owner of that place, which was Francis Dippel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">Grampa told what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">\u201cQ And now, what happened after that, Mr. Grampa ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">\u201cA Well, Mr. Amaimo kept on hammering, and he told me that he was my lawyer and my friend. He told me to trust him; that he will never let me do anything that I would regret and he told me also to have a confidence in him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>because he wasn\u2019t a bum. He said his name was Mr. Morgan Amaimo, attorney, candidate for governor, running for governor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cQ What, if anything, did you do with regard to this $6,000.00 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cA Well, finally, on this great persistence and perseverance I give in and I gave him $6,000.-00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cQ Now, who did you give the money to ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>I gave the money to Mr. Amaimo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cQ Where did this take place ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201cA In my place of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201cQ On Broadway, at the Norge Cafe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201cQ And who was there at the time the money changed hands ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201cA Mr. lula and Mr. Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">\u201cQ I see. Was this money given in cash or by check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">\u201cA In cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">\u201cQ In cash. And did you get anything for this $6,000.00 in cash at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-18\">\u201cA I get confessed judgment notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-19\">\u201cQ Who. gave you the confessed judgment notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-20\">\u201cA It was signed by Mr. Iula and Mr. Davis, prepared by Mr. Amaimo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-21\">\u201cQ The notes were prepared by Mr. Amaimo ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-22\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">When the notes were not paid, Grampa said he got in touch with Amaimo. Then he described what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-24\">\u201cQ * * * Now, you had started to\u2019 say that sometime later Mr. Amaimo and Mr. lula came in about that Peacock deal. I ask you about when did they talk to you about the Peacock deal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-25\">\u201cA I can\u2019t remember exactly the date this is. After all, it\u2019s been eight years. It must have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>sometime in March, I think around about the 10th or 12th of March of 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cMR. PIERSON [counsel for Amaimo] : 1962?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201cA That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cQ Now, who first mentioned the Peacock deal to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cA Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">\u201cQ Who first mentioned the Peacock deal to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">\u201cA Mr. Amaimo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u201cQ Mr. Amaimo ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">\u201cQ All right. Now, what was said to you by Mr. Amaimo about the Peacock deal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">\u201cA He told me that Mr. lula need the money very badly and if I would give him $10,000.00 to take the assignment, which was $15,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">\u201cQ An assignment of what ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-17\">\u201cA Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-18\">\u201cQ An assignment of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-19\">\u201cA For the \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Something that belonged to Mrs. lula. Something that Mrs. lula had in the Peacock Corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-20\">\u201cQ I see. What, if anything, did Mr. lula ever say to you about the Peacock deal ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-21\">\u201cA Mr. lula?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-22\">\u201cQ Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-23\">\u201cA Well, Mr. lula done hardly any talking. Mr. Amaimo done it all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-24\">\u201cQ I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-25\">\u201cA Mr. lula had hardly anything to say.\u201d Then Grampa continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-26\">\u201cQ * * * When you paid the $10,000.00 to Mr. Amaimo, whatever happened in connection with that deal ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-27\">\u201cA Well, they give me that assignment, as I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-28\">\u201cQ They gave you the assignment in what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201cA That\u2019s right. They took me down to Mr. Iula\u2019s house for Mrs. lula to sign the assignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cQ Uh-huh. Where did that take place ? Where did Mrs. lula sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cA At Timonium, York Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cQ Was that at her home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201cA Yes, that\u2019s her home, supposed to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201cQ Who all went out there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">\u201cA Mr. Amaimo and Mr. lula and I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">\u201cQ I see. And were you there when she signed the assignment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>I was there when she signed and she knew what was she signing, I don\u2019t doubt. While Mr. Amaimo asked Mrs. lula if she knew and Mrs. lula said to Mr. Amaimo, she said, \u2018Knew what?\u2019 And he pointed to the assignment. In other words, if she knew what she signed, and Mrs. lula said, \u2018No.\u2019 Good thing that she don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-13\">\u201cQ Let me ask you this. Who prepared or who made the assignment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">\u201cA Who what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-15\">\u201cQ Who made, who prepared the assignment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-16\">\u201cA They had already prepared it when they came to me. Mr. Amaimo had already prepared when he came to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-17\">\u201cQ All right. Now, after Mrs. lula sighed the paper, where did you all go ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-18\">\u201cA To Mrs.. lula to sign the paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-19\">\u201cQ No. I say, after she signed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-20\">\u201cA After that we went to Towson Courthouse, Towson Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-21\">\u201cQ Who went to the Towson Courthouse ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-22\">\u201cA Mr. lula and Mr. Amaimo. Mr. Amaimo wants to put the things on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-23\">\u201cQ I see. And what happened in the Towson Courthouse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201cA Well, as far as I understand, they put those things on record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201cQ I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cMR. PIERSON: He what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201cQ He put those things on record, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cA The assignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201cQ He put the assignment on record ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\u201cA Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">\u201cQ And did you talk to anybody else while you were in the Courthouse ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">\u201cA Talk about what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">\u201cQ Did you talk to anybody else while you were in the Courthouse ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">\u201cA I don\u2019t recall precisely. I think I talked to someone there, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">\u201cQ Do you remember who it was and what was said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-16\">\u201cA That I don\u2019t remember who it was, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-17\">\u201cQ Do you remember who introduced you to these people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-18\">\u201cA Mr. Amaimo did, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-19\">\u201cQ I see. Do you know who the people were ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-20\">\u201cA No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-21\">Amaimo and lula tell a different version of the affair. They say that among the people Grampa saw in Towson were a court clerk, who helped to count Grampa\u2019s money, and assured him that the assignment was valid, and Nolan P. Chipman, a lawyer who was the trustee under Peacock\u2019s deed of trust for the benefit of creditors, and who said that the price of $275,700 obtained at the first foreclosure sale would satisfy the mortgage debts and leave $50,000 for creditors, including Grampa. Neither the clerk nor Chipman was produced as a witness. Another lawyer who was supposed to have given Grampa similar assurances, appeared voluntarily, and flatly denied any recollection of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">The factual issue is whether on 12 March 1962, when Mrs. lula sold to Grampa for $10,000 her $15,000 judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ment against Peacock, Amaimo and lula knew, or should have known, that exceptions to the sale had been pending for three months; that there was a possibility that the sale might be set aside; and that the collectibility of Mrs. Iula\u2019s judgment hinged on the ratification of the sale for $275,700 or on a resale at some lesser amount sufficient to satisfy the first mortgage of about $120,000 held by Progress, a second mortgage of some $50,000 held by Empire Realty Company, arrearages of interest on both mortgages, another mortgage held by Regent Building Company, amounting to some $15,000, judgments of some $10,000, and the expenses which had been incurred incident to foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In an oral opinion delivered from the bench at the conclusion of the testimony, the chancellor (Prendergast, J.j made findings of fact, which need only be summarized here:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">1. That late in 1961 or early in 1962, lula was \u201cabsolutely broke\u201d, and in desperate need of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">2. That Amaimo knew of Iula\u2019s financial difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">3. That Amaimo brought lula to the Norge Bar and introduced him to Grampa.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">4. That Grampa loaned lula $6,000 on notes prepared by Amaimo.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">5. That Amaimo received from one of Iula\u2019s corporations a fee of $700 for arranging this loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">6. That when two of the notes were not paid at maturity Amaimo and lula suggested that Grampa buy Mrs. Iula\u2019s $15,000 judgment for $11,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">7. That at this time; the $15,000 judgment was \u201cabsolutely worthless\u201d and this fact was known to Amaimo and lula.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">8. That Amaimo, who prepared the assignment of the judgment and received it from the' clerk\u2019s' office \u25a0 after it had been recorded, was at this point acting as counsel for Grampa, and continued to act for Grampa in May of 1962, when he received a- fee of $150 for \u00e9ntering a general issue plea for Gr\u00e1mpa in a damage suit and in November of 1962, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>he arranged for another attorney to enter confessed judgments on the Iula-Davis notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">There was also evidence from which the chancellor could have found: (i) that Grampa had given Amaimo $50 and a case of whiskey for his representation of the son of the barmaid at the Norge Bar; (ii) that Amaimo and lula were close personal friends, since lula had been Amaimo\u2019s campaign manager in Amaimo\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the governorship, and Amaimo had represented Iula for 15 years or more; (iii) that Amaimo himself admitted that he was aware of Iula\u2019s financial difficulties, since he had raised some $225,000 in an abortive effort to avert the first Peacock foreclosure. It should also be noted that he represented Iula in <em>Iula, v. Progress </em>Fed. <em>S &amp; L Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>247 Md. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We have reviewed the testimony in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, <em>Space Aero Products Co. v. R. E. Darling Co., </em>238 Md. 93, 106, 208 A. 2d 74, 699 (1965), and conclude on the record before us that the chancellor\u2019s findings are not erroneous, much less clearly erroneous. Rule 886. Based on these findings, he correctly concluded that Amaimo and lula had perpetrated a fraud on Grampa. Judge Marbury, speaking for the Court, stated the elements of fraud in Suburban. <em>Properties Management, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>236 Md. 455, 460, 204 A. 2d 326 (1964) which were reiterated by the Court, speaking through Judge Barnes in <em>James v. Goldberg, </em>256 Md. 520, 261 A. 2d 753 (1970) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201c* * * (1) that a representation made by a party was false; (2) that either its falsity was known to that party or the misrepresentation was made with such reckless indifference to truth to impute knowledge to him; (3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding some other person; (4) that that person not only relied upon the misrepresentation but had the right to rely upon it with full belief of its truth, and that he would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>done the thing from which damage resulted if it had not been made; and (5) that that person suffered damage directly resulting from the misrepresentation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Compare <em>McKeever v. Washington Heights Realty Corp., </em>183 Md. 216, 225, 37 A. 2d 305 (1944) with <em>Lambert v. Smith, </em>235 Md. 284, 288, 201 A. 2d 491 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Transactions arising out of an attorney-client relationship are by no means insulated from scrutiny or challenge, and when challenged are prima facie void, thus . imposing on the attorney the burden of proving understanding on the part of his client, fairness and the absence of undue influence and deception. <em>Lopez v. Lopez, </em>250 Md. 491, 505, 243 A. 2d 588 (1968) ; <em>Keyworth v. Israelson, </em>240 Md. 289, 304, 214 A. 2d 168 (1965) ; <em>Hughes v. McDaniel, </em>202 Md. 626, 632-33, 98 A. 2d 1 (1953) ; <em>Baker v. Otto, </em>180 Md. 53, 22 A. 2d 924 (1941). This Amaimo failed to do. While lula did not share so heavy a burden, the argument that he was unaware of the uncertainties surrounding his mother\u2019s judgment is too transparent to be worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">.
