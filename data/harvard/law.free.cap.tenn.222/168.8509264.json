Hartford has appealed and assigned this action as error. We agree, and reverse on authority of our opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Tbe \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions invalidated in our opinion were those which undertook to reduce the particular insurer\u2019s coverage of the insured because of the existence of other liability coverage of the insured. There is nothing in the opinion to indicate we intended to invalidate an endorsement fixing- the amount of coverage available, except to this extent. In fact, the amount of coverage by the insurer, which was sought to be reduced by the invalid \u201cother insurance\u201d provision was not discussed, but was assumed to be the amount fixed by the policies and valid endorsements; this assumption being based on the universal rule recognizing the validity of endorsements or riders fixing, in the first instance, the coverage afforded. <em>Brown v.
