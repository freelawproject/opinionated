K. Brown and wife, Alice Brown, conveyed a tract of land of approximately seventy acres to their two sons, J. 0. Brown and J. N. Brown. On September 18, 1956, J. N. Brown conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the property to J. 0. Brown. The deed was recorded on September 22 1956, and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>same day J. 0. Brown conveyed to his wife, Hope M. Brown, an estate by the entirety in the same tract of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">J. 0. Brown is now deceased, and the question is whether Hope M. Brown holds the entire seventy acre tract as an estate by the entirety, or whether she has an estate by the entirety in an undivided one-half interest in said tract. The trial judge held Hope M. Brown held the entire tract as a surviving tenant by the entireties, and certain of her children have appealed, assigning this ruling as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The deed is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cI, J. 0. Brown, Greene County, Tennessee, grant, bargain, sell, transfer and convey unto my wife, Hope M.

Brown, a single man, dated September 18,1956, and of record in Deed Book 197, page 56, in the Office of the Register for Greene County, at Greeneville, to which recording reference is here made for the purpose- of incorporation; the other one-half undivided interest having been conveyed to J. 0. Brown by warranty of E. K. Brown and wife, Alice Brown, dated March 6,1915, which deed has been destroyed and was not placed of record and the one-half undivided interest of J. N.

Brown \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number> We concur in the holding of the trial judge, and overrule the assignment of error. Conceding the rules of deed construction to be as set forth in the appellants\u2019 thorough brief, it is clear when these rules are applied that J. 0. Brown intended to convey Hope M. Brown an estate by the entireties in the entire seventy acre tract. This is made unavoidably manifest by the granting clause wherein, by clear and express terms, Hope is granted an undivided one-half interest as tenant by the entireties in the entire' seventy acre tract of land. The later inept and inartificial reference to this interest as \u201cbeing the one-half undivided interest conveyed by J. 0. Brown by deed of J. N. Brown,\u201d cannot negate this plain and clear grant. So to hold would be to allow that which is ambiguous to prevail over that which is certain; which we cannot allow. <em>Hicks v. Strangle, </em>149 Tenn. 310, 257 S.W. 1044; <em>Trapp v. McCormick, </em>175 Tenn. 1, 130 S.W.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Nor, does it matter that in the habendum clause there is an ambiguous reference to Hope M. Brown\u2019s estate by the entireties as \u201csaid one-half interest\u201d. This reference, as the others in the deed, was evidently made on the assumption that although Mr. Brown had been conveyed an estate by the entirety in the entire tract, it was necessary to refer to this interest in some particular language, and that this could be accomplished by so referring to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The references to Hope M. Brown\u2019s interest appearing in the deed following the granting clause are not intended to limit the estate first granted, but evidently proceed on the mistaken assumption by the draftsmen of the deed that Hope M. Brown\u2019s entirety estate should be referred to as an undivided one-half interest, with right of sur-vivorship in the entire tract, implied from referring to her interest as a tenancy by the entireties, a not un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>common but altogether erroneous assumption. We think the grant of an estate by the entirety in the entire tract must prevail, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Unless the later provisions are so reconciled, the only alternative would be to hold that the later provisions irreconcilably conflict with the granting clause, in which event it would prevail with the same result. <em>Bennett v. Langham, </em>214 Tenn. 674, 383 S.W.2d 16; <em>Roberts v. Hale, </em>216 Tenn. 578, 393 S.W.2d 155; <em>Teague v. Sowder, </em>121 Tenn. 132, 114 S.W. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We have considered appellants\u2019 contention that the deed does not conform with T.C.A. sec. 64-109 so as to create an estate by the entirety by direct conveyance, and have concluded the contention is not sound. This statute (See Footnote<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) permitted Hope M. Brown\u2019s husband to deed her an estate by the entireties in the entire seventy acre tract. And since we are of opinion this is what he did, appellant\u2019s objection in this regard is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The judgment of the trial court on this matter is affirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-8\">Burnett, Chief Justice, and Dyer, Chattin, and Cre-son, Justices, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> Sec. 64-109.
