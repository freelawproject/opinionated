Justice Humpheeys</author>\n<p id=\"Afr6\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Edith Williams sued Elmer F. Smith, an individual, and Mark Shoe Corporation, d/b/a Craig\u2019s Red Cross Shoes, in a common law action for personal injury damages. The defendants filed a plea in abatement alleging plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy lay under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Tennessee. The plea in abatement was sustained, and plaintiff Williams has appealed. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In her declaration plaintiff alleged that she had worked for six years as a saleslady for the defendant company at its ret\u00e1il shoe store in Chattanooga. On -the morning of September 29, 1967, she was fired by defendant Elmer F. Smith, \u00e1 fellow employee who was store manager!. She was \u00bft work on the premises of the company at the time. After she was fired, the store manager went to his office where she was allegedly assaulted by th\u00e9 store manager. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Her snit was to recover for personal injuries allegedly-received during the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Defendant\u2019s plea in abatement asserted that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were incurred by accident arising out of and in the course of employment and that her remedy was exclusively under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, and that her common law cause of action should be abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The plea in abatement was sustained by the trial judge and, after plaintiff\u2019s petition to rehear was overruled, appeal was perfected to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Two basic questions are presented by the appeal: Whether or not the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act bars a common law action where an employer corporation acting through its employee alter ego intentionally commits an assault and battery upon an employee, so as to restrict the assaulted employee\u2019s remedy exclusively to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The second question, is whether or not the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides immunity to an employee who commits an intentional and malicious assault and battery upon a co-employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">There are no Tennessee cases on all fours with this one. We have cases dealing with an employee\u2019s right of recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which establish the rule that, generally, where an employee is injured by a fellow servant, there is no liability under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, <em>Milne v. Sanders, </em>143 Tenn. 602, 228 S.W.2d 702, unless the assault is causally related to the work. That an assault is causally related to the work and arises out of employment if, after the event, there is apparent to the rational mind a causal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>connection between the work and the resulting injury. <em>Whaley v. Patent Button Company, </em>184 Tenn. 700, 202 S.W.2d 649. In the <em>Whaley </em>case, where an employee was shot by a former employee after the latter had been discharged for incompetency or insubordination, it was held the assault was an accident arising out of employment, and compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">We have authority for the proposition that an employee who is injured by a third person at a time when he is acting in the course of his employment suffers an \u201caccident arising out of employment\u201d, which is compensable. <em>Chamber of Commerce v. Turner, </em>158 Tenn. 323, 13 S.W.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">All of these cases treat the injuring incident as an \u201caccident\u201d on the theory the incident was unexpected or unusual, or unintended from the standpoint of the employee. But none of our eases have dealt with the specific questions we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Larson deals with this problem, and his conclusions are summarized as follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u201cSee. 68.00. Intentional injury inflicted by the employer in person on his employee may be made the subject of a common-law action for damages on the theory that, in such an action, the employer will not be heard to say that his intentional act was an \u2018accidental\u2019 injury and so under the exclusive provisions of the compensation act. But when the intentional injury is committed by a supervisory employee, although there are cases permitting similar common-law suit, against the employer on the ground that the supervisory employee is the alter ego of the employer, the better rule holds such a suit barred against the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Larson states that the theory sustaining a common-law \u00e1ction against an' employer for an intentional injury is that the employer will not he heard to allege that the injury was - \u2018\u2018accidental\u201d and hence. \u00fander the exclusive provisions of the \"Workmen\u2019s- Compensation Act,- when he himself intentionally committed the act. It'is also suggested that a second theory supporting the act is that the employer severs the employment relation by his act of violence. See <em>Boek v. Wong Hing, </em>180 Minn. 470, 231 N.W. 233, 72 A.L.R. 108 (1930); <em>Le Pochat v. Pendleton, </em>187 Misc. 296, 63 N.Y.S.2d 313 (1946); <em>Rumbolo v. Erb, </em>19 N.J.Misc. 311, 20 A.2d 54 (1941); <em>Blake v. Head, </em>106 L.T.Rep. (N.S.) 822; <em>Readinger v. Gottschall </em>201 Pa. Super. 134, 191 A.2d 694 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">Concerning the particular problem presented by this appeal, Larson says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">.. . \u201cSec. 68.21. Employer\u2019s personal act versus assault by agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">. \u2022 When the person who intentionally injures the employee is not the employer in person but a foreman, supervisor or manager, both the legal and the moral reasons for permitting a common-law suit against the employer collapse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH4\">The legal reason for permitting the common-law suit for direct assault by the employer, as we have seen, is \u25a0that the same person cannot commit an intentional assault and-then allege it was accidental. This does hot \u25a0 apply when -the assailant and the defendant are two \u2022\u2022 entirely- different people. Unless the employer has commanded or expressly authorized the assault, it cannot be said to be intentional from his standpoint any more than from the standpoint of any third person. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Realistically, it to. Mm is just one more industrial mis-Rap in the factory, of the sort h\u00e9 has a right to consider .^exclusively.covered by the compensation\u2019 system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">#\u2019# #'# # # ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">-v Ttis.a commonplace rule of-respondeat-.superior that a master may, in certain circumstances, be held vicariously liable for the violent and intentional acts of his \u25a0 employee, even if the violence is a direct violation of the employer\u2019s orders. To impose a penalty on the employer in tMs situation, which may amount to many thousands of dollars, when he has done all he can do .personally to.provide compensation protection and to treat his employees well,, is an outrage far worse than ... the .fancied one which is supposed to be prevented by allowing the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">The cases allowing the action proceed upon the fiction'that the supervisory employee is the \u2018alter ego\u2019 of ' the employer. As has been remarked at several other points, there is no place for fictions in compensation law; this is especially true when your particular rule is built up largely on the basis of personal moral culpability in an individual, and. the effect of the fiction is to assume that the shifting of technical legal liability under the arbitrary principle of respondeat superior connotes .also the shifting of the moral and ethical .\u25a0 responsibility for the wrong \u2014 a completely erroneous \u25a0conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In reaching this conclusion <em>Stewart v. McLellan\u2019s Stores, </em>194 S.C. 50, 9 S.E.2d 35 (1940), and <em>Heskett v. Fisher Laundry &amp; Cleaners Co., Inc., </em>217 Ark. 350, 230 S.W.2d 28 (1950), both of which are relied on here by plaintiff Edith Williams, as well as <em>Lavin v. Goldberg </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Building Material Corp., </em>274 App.Div. 690, 87 N.Y.S.2d 90 (1949), are criticized on the ground they have tacitly assumed the authorities supporting common law actions for direct employer assaults, like <em>Boek v. Wong Hing, </em>supra, or <em>Blake v. Head, </em>supra, are adequate precedent to sustain the action where the assault is by a company manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The discussion of this question by Larson is concluded with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cPerhaps the strongest argument against allowing suit against the employer for a supervisory employee\u2019s intentional assault is a practical one; acceptance of this rule would mean that in all assault cases by one co-employee on another, of which there are hundreds, you would have only to show that the assailant was one notch higher on the totem-pole than the victim, and the compensation act would go out the window. So, in a large factory, with layer upon layer of foremen, supervisors, managers, executives and officers, the exclusiveness of compensation would no longer depend on whether the assault was merely another work-connected quarrel, but would turn on the relative rank of participants \u2014 a consideration which has no bearing on work-connection at all.\u201d Yol. 2, sec. 68.23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Upon analysis, we are of opinion Larson\u2019s reasoning is better than that of the three cases he criticizes <em>(Lavin v. Goldberg Building Material Corp., </em>which followed <em>DeCoigne v. Ludlum Steel Co., </em>251 App.Div. 662, 297 N.Y.S. 636, <em>McLellan\u2019s Stores </em>and <em>Heskett), </em>and hold the Tennessee Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act bars this suit against Mark Shoe Corp. d/b/a Craig\u2019s Bed Cross Shoes, but not against defendant Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The discussion in Larson which we have cited, concluding the employer is saved from suit by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation, closes with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\"><em>\u201cIn any event, it should be remembered that the victim ccm always sue the person himself who was guilty of the assault, and that therefore the corporateness of the employer does not leave the plaintiff altogether \u2022without a common-laio defendant.\u201d </em>Yol. 2 sec. 68.22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Larson refers to three cases in which the assaulted employee had sued both the employer and the supervisory employee at common law in which the action against the employer had been dismissed and that against the actual assailant sustained. <em>Echols v. Chattooga Mercantile Co., </em>74 Ga.App. 18, 38 S.E.2d 675 (1946); <em>Gardner v. Stout, </em>342 Mo. 1206, 119 S.W.2d 790 (1938), <em>Mazarredo v. Levine, </em>274 App.Div. 122, 80 N.Y.S. 237 (1948). We think these cases reach the right conclusion, and that our case of <em>Majors v. Moneymaker, </em>196 Tenn. 698, 270 S.W.2d 328 (1954) is not to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Actually, what we have to decide is whether or not the fiction, that the employee-victim of an intentional, deliberate assault has sustained an accident because it was unexpected and unintended on his part, can be availed of by an assaulting co-employee to compel his victim to proceed under the Act. And we think the assaulter cannot so compel the victim, because the fiction was created and is allowed to operate solely because this is the fair, right and just thing to do. It is a conclusion based entirely on the effect on the assaulted employee. So that it would be a travesty on justice, indeed, to make this fiction operate in favor of one whose act has been wilful and malicious and intentionally harmful and is in no conceivable sense an \u201caccident\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We hold that while the fiction- of accident is available to the assaulted employee to sustain a recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, this being-just and right, this fiction created for the benefit.of the injured employee is not available to the intentional assaulter to require \u25a0 that \u25a0 the injured employee proceed under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, so to do being unfair'and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This is not contrary to <em>Majors v. Moneymaker, </em>supra, as that case involved an injury which was accid\u00bfntal in fact and not in fiction, growing out of a negligent act \u00f3f a co-employee. From any point of view, either that of the injured-employee or the negligent co-employee, the entire incident was an accident and\u2019 so clearly came under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation; which as we have pointed out is not true of the present case where the assault was not an accident on the part of defendant Elmer F. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Since writing the -above, we have found the following discussion in Larson, which relates somewhat to what we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax9\">\u201cIt'is interesting to'observe that -this holding'has the rather remarkable-effect of'giving the employee in these circumstances an option to claim compensation or sue at common law, although such options' \u00e1re usually not supposed to exist. The option comes about-in this way: it is well established that delib\u00e9rate -assault upon ail innocent employee by some third person of co-employee is \u00e1n <em>\u2018 </em>accidental injury\u2019. It will be recalled from the discussion of assaults that the early difficulty presented by the argument that such an injury was the result of intention as distinguished from accideilt was overcome by the simple expedient of viewing the affair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>from the point of view of the victim rather than of the assailant, since from the victim\u2019s point of view the assault was an unexpected and' untoward mishap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZL\">\u201cHowever, if the incident gets into court not as a compensation claim but as a damage suit by the employee- mgainst .an: employer-assailant, it is the employer who must affirmatively plead the exclusiveness of the Act as a defense: To do this he must allege that the injury was an accident \u2014 and how can he do this, when he\u2018himself has deliberately produced it? Thus, from the point of view of the person who, as a matter of pleading, must allege the accidental character of the injury, the occurrence was not accidental but inten-tion\u00e1l.--'-' ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">, , \u201c There is nothing, inconsistent in, :this - result, curious .. as.it may. seem on the-surface, since it is quite proper -\u25a0-to-analyze the-incident in each type of action from the \u2022standpoint of the person having the burden of establishing his case or defense.\u201d Yol. 2, sec. 68.12</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201c This statement, which is sound, is a further reason for .distinguishing, the present case from <em>Majors v. Moneymaker, </em>supra. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u25a0The action of the trial court in sustaining the plea in abatement-in favor of Mark Shoe Corp., d/b/a Craig\u2019s Bed Cross ..Shoes is affirmed. The action of the trial judge \u2022sustaining the-plea in abatement of Elmer E. Smith, is set aside and the case is remanded for trial as to this defendant. The costs are taxed equally against plaintiff-in-error Edith Williams and defendant-in-error Elmer F. Smith; \u2022</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-8\">. \u25a0 Burhett, Chiee.
