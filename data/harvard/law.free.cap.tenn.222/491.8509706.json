It must be said that the record we are furnished is as poor an example of record compilation as it has been our misfortune to observe.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Tommy Willis, the respondent here, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Criminal Court of Sullivan County. The petition does not appear in the record, nor is there any indication of the date on which it was filed. The petition was evidently denied on July 11, 1967. No order of denial is in the record. The date of denial appears in a handwritten \u201cmotion to rehear\u201d filed by Willis.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The \u201cmotion to rehear\u201d urges the trial court to \u201creconsider\u201d the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The record contains a handwritten \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d apparently filed along with the \u201cmotion to rehear.\u201d Neither handwritten document is dated.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In a \u201cfinding of facts and order\u201d entered December 7, 1967, nunc pro tunc for August 3, 1967, the trial court denied the \u201cmotion to rehear\u201d and granted an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Counsel for Willis was appointed by the Court of Criminal Appeals. After hearing of the cause, that Court held there was no basis for appellate jurisdiction, but reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the case \u201cfor a new trial of the habeas corpus petition dismissed by the trial conrt on Jnly 11,1967.\u201d The Conrt of Criminal Appeals concluded that such result was required by (1) the denial by the trial court of Willis\u2019 \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to full appellate review of the judgment against him, and (2) the need for a proper record under the holding of <em>Nelms v. State </em>(1966), 219 Tenn. 727, 413 S.W.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\">With regard to the purported lack of appellate jurisdiction, there appears to be some misapprehension of the law or record.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">T.C.A. see. 27-310 allows parties to pray and obtain appeals from adverse judgments. Apparently the Court of Criminal Appeals is of opinion that T.C.A. sec. 27-310 requires the record explicitly and literally to show, in writing, that an appeal was both prayed and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The instant record, however defective, does explicitly show that an appeal was granted. The initial paragraph of the \u201cfinding of facts and order\u201d of the Criminal Court of Sullivan County, dated December 7, 1967, reveals as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cThis is a habeas corpus petition which the Court dismissed on the fact of the writ earlier because it showed no grounds for relief. And, in it he also asks for an appeal. The appeal will have to be granted and the clerk will have to certify the record up to the Court of Appeals. I guess it goes to the new Criminal Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Again, near the end of the same Minute Book entry, the following statement appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cThe rehearing is denied, and the appeal is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The Court of Criminal Appeals cites <em>Gray v. State </em>(1960), 207 Tenn. 39, 336 S.W.2d 22, in support of its conclusion that it was without jurisdiction to hear the case because no appeal had been prayed or granted. The opinion in <em>Gray v. State, </em>supra, may not be so read.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">In Tennessee, as a general rule, an appeal must be both prayed and granted to vest an appellate court with jurisdiction of a cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><em>Gray v. State, </em>supra, states an exception to the general rule. See <em>Duke v. Scott </em>(1965), 216 Tenn. 391, 392 S.W.2d 809. <em>Gray v. State, </em>supra, holds that the requisite showing in the record that an appeal has been prayed and granted, may be made indirectly, and that such indirect showing is made where the final decree allows the party seeking an appeal time to perfect it. It must be added that the exception noted in <em>Gray v. State, </em>supra, is entirely consistent with prior constructions of statutes creating and regulating right of appeal. See <em>Bozeman et al. v. Naff </em>(1927), 155 Tenn. 121, 290 S.W. 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In the view of this Court, the above-quoted portions of the record show that an appeal was granted. The granting\u2018of the appeal shows implicitly that such appeal was prayed for; and, consequently, jurisdiction to hear the case vested in the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Court of Criminal Appeals cites <em>Nelms v. State, </em>supra, as requiring reversal of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">\u201cThe rationale and teaching of <em>Nelms v. State, </em>219 Tenn. 727, 413 S.W.2d 378, require the reversal of this case for a new trial of the petitioner\u2019s petition for the writ of habeas corpus, \u2018in order that a proper record may be made and in order that the accused may be afforded an effective appellate review if desired.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Nelms v. State, </em>supra, does not support the proposition for which it is cited. That case holds that reversal may he required to afford effective appellate review, if such is desired, where the statutory right of appeal is denied by \u201cdelay or non-action\u201d of State agencies and where the right of appeal has not been voluntarily waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"> The essence of the instant case revolves about the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus without evidentiary hearing. A full evidentiary hearing may not be required for every petition for the writ. Unless facts sufficient to establish the void character of the proceedings which led to imprisonment are alleged, an eviden-tiary hearing' is not warranted. The writ will not issue where the petitioner fails to allege facts showing that the writ should issue. See <em>State ex rel. Need, v. Heer (1966), </em>218 Tenn. 338, 403 S.W.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The \u201cmotion to rehear\u201d filed by Willis sets out the grounds upon which the writ of habeas corpus was sought in the original petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cMOTION TO REHEAR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Your petitioner, Tommy Willis, respectfully request his Honor to reconsider, and re-hear his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the above styled cause, denied July 11, 1967, for the following reason:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">1. Petitioner appreciates the feeling of frustration of having apparently failed to get the point across to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">2. The gist of petitioners entire argument was the simple legal proposition that it was a State action to place petitioner in another jeopardy before first hearing his petition for writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>3. The records show he was tried for escape first. Therefore, if he was available for trial for escape, he conld have been afforded a hearing on his petition, on the same date, and perhaps tried for escape the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\">4. The Court although young \u2014 must surely be aware of the basic meaning of habeas corpus proceedings in that the only relief available in this type writ, is total release, therefore, when the State deliberately chose to place your petitioner in another jeopardy, before determining the legality of his instant restraint, it <em>mooted petitioner\u2019s habeas action, as well as his appeal from the adverse decision thereon.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">5. The Court dismissed the foregoing \u2018State Action\u2019 with the assertion, \u2018that it was immaterial,\u2019 and then attempted to take the position that petitioner\u2019s sole argument was that he had a right to escape \u2014 because of the inordinate delay in hearing his matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Petitioner merely point out that had he been afforded a hearing within a reasonable time from the date of filing \u2014 the escape would probably never have occurred as he would been back in custody of the Warden. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">It appears that Willis was arrested, tried and convicted for burglary and receiving stolen property. Complaining of these convictions, Willis petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. Pending an evidentiary hearing on his petition, Willis escaped from the Sullivan County jail. He was apparently tried and convicted for escape before the evidentiary hearing was held on his first petition for habeas corpus. As revealed in the above-quoted \u201cmotion to rehear,\u201d the substance of the present petition for habeas corpus is that the State placed Willis \u201cin another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>jeopardy\u201d by trying him for escape before the eviden-tiary hearing was held on the first petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The skeleton record with which we are provided suggests that any delay in hearing of the petition for habeas corpus in the trial court resulted from application by Willis for postponement. Obviously, a complete record should show what did, in fact, occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">However this be, we see nothing wrong in the action of the trial judge, constitutionally, legally or morally. Thus, we feel that a remand of this case for retrial of the petition for habeas corpus would be nothing more than idle, even had there been error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">As noted above, the transcript in this cause was improperly and badly compiled. Under T.C.A. sec. 8-2120, the fees to which the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Sullivan County would otherwise be entitled must be, and are, forfeited. See <em>Sible v. State </em>(1871), 50 Tenn. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">It results that the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and that of the Criminal Court of Sullivan County affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-9\">Burnett, Chief Justice, and Dyer, Chattin and Humphreys, Justices, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
