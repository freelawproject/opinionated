Senter, Jr.</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>This suit originated in the Circuit Court of Shelby County, Tennessee. We are referring to the parties according to their status below; that is, Herman J. Seeley as plaintiff, and Pilot Fire <em>&amp; </em>Casualty Company as defendant. Plaintiff seeks to recover from defendant certain medical expenses incurred by him in the amount of $700.00 pursuant to a certain Family Combination Automobile Policy issued to plaintiff by defendant; and to recover the statutory penalty for refusal to pay. The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer to the amended declaration, and plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\">Of the three Assignments of Error filed by plaintiff, the first two raise the question that the demurrer was waived by an advance step in the pleadings and that the subject demurrer is not a credible pleading. It is therefore appropriate to review the pleadings, both the sequence and format.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">To the original declaration defendant filed a demurrer which states briefly that the declaration is not sufficient in law because it does not allege an injury \u201ccaused by accident\u201d and there is no coverage within the terms of the policy. Plaintiff then obtained leave to amend his declaration, the amended declaration describing with more specificness how plaintiff was injured. To the amended declaration defendant filed a pleading entitled \u201cDEMURRER AND ANSWER TO DECLARATION AS AMENDED\u201d. The first portion of the conjoined pleading constitutes a demurrer and the latter portion an answer. It is filed as one document. The plaintiff thereupon filed a replication to the demurrer and answer and joined issue thereon. The court sustained the demurrer to the amended declaration and dismissed the suit. In this Order it is recited that \u201cThis cause came on to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>heard on the Demurrer to the Declaration as Amended, upon statement of counsel, Memorandum Brief submitted and upon the entire record, \u2014 The transcript contains a \u201cMemorandum on Demurrer of Defendant\u201d filed by counsel for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The first two Assignments charge that the Court erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201c1. In not overruling the demurrer in that at law a demurrer cannot be pleaded at the same time as a plea to the merits, the advance step in pleading having the effect of waiving and overruling the demurrer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">2. In not overruling the demurrer as there is no credible pleadings to sustain such a ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">By his first Assignment, plaintiff insists that since the answer of defendant was filed simultaneously with his demurrer, both being incorporated in the one document of pleading, this constituted an advance step in pleading and effectively waived the demurrer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\u201cThis is the order of pleading existing at the common law, and it should be observed because an advance step in pleading waives all defenses which should be ante-cedently made.\u201d Caruthers History of a Lawsuit, 7th Ed. P. 210, Sec. 169.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">We agree that this is the recognized rule in Tennessee, and had the plaintiff raised this question in the court below we assume that the trial court would have sustained his position. However, we also think that the right to raise this defense to the demurrer can be waived, as can the right to question the regularity of any other pleading. <em>(Wilson v. Eifler, </em>47 Tenn. 31). A review of this Record, has convinced us that the question of advance pleading was not .raised in the court below. The only written re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sponse to the demurrer and the amended declaration is the replication filed by plaintiff on May 23, 1967. On the same day plaintiff filed a \u201cMemorandum on Demurrer of Defendant\u201d. This is a Brief containing citations of authorities and argument on the matters raised by the demurrer. This Memorandum was, seemingly without objection, included in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\">On May 26, 1968, the demurrer was heard by the trial judge \u201cupon statement of counsel, Memorandum Brief submitted and upon the entire record\u201d. The Memorandum Brief nowhere suggests that the demurrer is being challenged because filed with an answer, but does argue in detail the legal questions raised by the demurrer. We think it is clear that the trial court was led or permitted to assume that the technical question was being waived and that both parties were amenable to a disposition of the demurrer upon its merits. In this situation the following statement should govern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">\u2018 \u2018 The reason for the rule is that a party shall not allow the trial court to fall into error inadvertantly, but to require that the attention of the court be specifically directed to the exact point involved.\u201d Caruthers History of a Lawsuit. 8th Ed. Sec. 205, P. 252.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Our conclusions apply also to the second Assignment of Error and it results that the first two Assignments are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The third Assignment of Error contends that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer since the allegations in the declaration set out a question of fact as to whether or not the injuries were \u201ccaused by accident\u201d within the meaning of the automobile insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The amended declaration alleges in so many words that the injuries received by plaintiff were \u201ccaused by accident\u201d and alleges that the plaintiff received a lumbar strain as he was entering his pickup truck. It further alleges that the medical expenses \u201cwere incurred by treatment of injuries arising out of an accident which occurred on January 3,1967 when the plaintiff was entering and occupying said vehicle and in entering his vehicle, he stepped from the ground into the vehicle without stepping on the running board, in this manner twisting his back which resulted in his being hospitalized and incurring the approximate sum of $700.00 in medical expenses.\u201d The insurance policy that is the subject of this suit is reproduced in full in the transcript. The pertinent provisions of this policy as set forth in the declaration of plaintiff are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cTo pay all reasonable expenses incurred within one year from the date of accident for necessary medical, surgical, x-ray and dental services, including prosthetic devices, and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing and funeral services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">Division 1. To or for named insured and each relative who sustains bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, hereinafter called \u2018bodily injury\u2019, caused by accident (a) while occupying the owner automobile etc. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">Definitions: Occupying means in or upon, or entering, or alighting from.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Since the policy defines occupying as meaning \u201cin or upon, or entering or alighting from\u201d such vehicle, the only question is whether or not, as a matter of law, the allegations in the declaration sufficiently allege that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>injury was caused by aecident. The word \u201caccident\u201d is not defined in the policy. We must therefore determine whether or not an injury resulting from a person twisting his back while stepping from the ground into a vehicle without using the intermediate platform of the running board can be described as an injury caused by accident under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In seeking to find the intention of the parties to a contract, words in the contract, unless otherwise defined, will be given their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Hahn v. Home Life Insurance Company, </em>169 Tenn. 232, 237, 84 S.W.2d <em>361; Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Hobbs, </em>168 Tenn. 690, 80 S.W.2d 662, 663. In this policy the key words are \u201c* * * who sustains bodily injury * * * caused by accident\u201d, and the question is how the insurer and the insured should reasonably have interpreted and understood these words, giving them their ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">We find no case in Tennessee defining these particular words in the context of the medical coverage provisions of an automobile liability policy. There are a number of decisions, however, in cases which required a definition and construction of the language frequently used in general accident insurance policies and which provide payment or indemnity for bodily injury or death <em>resulting solely through external, violent, and accidental means. </em>It will be noted that in these cases the emphasis is placed on the words \u201caccidental means\u201d, rather than on the words \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d. In view of the basic similarity of facts, the conclusions and decisions in those cases -oan be guiding beacons in this case, if we can equate the words \u201cbodily injury * * * caused by accident\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the words \u201cbodily injury * * * resulting through * * * accidental means \u201d.\u00a5e think the meaning and intendment of these provisions are intrinsically the same, that an injury \u201cresulting through accidental means\u201d was \u201ccaused by accident\u201d, and that these terms could properly be used interchangeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary supplies these definitions, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><em>Means </em>\u2014 \u201ca measure or measures employed to effect a purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\"><em>Ccwse </em>\u2014 \u201cthat which produces an effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">So in the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s injury was <em>caused </em>by the <em>means </em>he employed to enter his pickup truck \u2014 stepping from ground to vehicle without using the running board.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The Tennessee decisions on this question make a controlling distinction between \u201caccidental means\u201d and \u201caccidental results\u201d. <em>Scott v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, </em>169 Tenn. 351, 87 S.W.2d 1011; <em>Rollins v. Life </em>&amp; <em>Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee, </em>190 Tenn. 89, 228 S.W.2d 70; <em>Stone v. Fidelity and Casualty Company, </em>133 Teun. 672, 182 S.W.2d 252, L.R.A.1916D 536; <em>Provident Life </em>&amp; <em>Accident Insurance Company v. Wallace, </em>23 Tenn.App. 697, 137 S.W.2d 888. Typical are the cases of <em>Scott v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, </em>supra; and <em>Provident Life </em>&amp; <em>Accident Insurance Company v. Wallace, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In the <em>Scott </em>case the insured died as the result of a sun stroke and a fall while he was firing a boiler. Suit was brought for the additional indemnity provided if the insured\u2019s death resulted \u201csolely through external, violent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>and accidental means\u201d. The insured\u2019s exposure was voluntary and there were no intervening factors. In affirming the action of the trial court sustaining a demurrer, Mr. Chief Justice Creen noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-3\">\u201cNor is there any averment that the insured\u2019s exposure to the means \u2014 his firing the boiler \u2014 was anything but an intentional act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The Court then quoted as follows from <em>Stone v. Fidelity and Casualty Company, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that an injury is not produced by accidental means, within the meaning of this policy, Avhere the injury is a natural result of an act or acts in which the insured intentionally engages. A person may do certain acts the result of which produces unforeseen consequences resulting in what is termed an accident; yet it does not come within the terms of this contract. The policy does not insure against an injury that may be caused by a voluntary, natural, ordinary movement, executed exactly as was intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Therefore, to determine the matter, we look, not to the result merely, but to the means producing the result. It is not sufficient that the injury be unusual and unexpected, but the <em>cause </em>itself must have been unexpected and accidental.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">A conscious and voluntary act results in an injury in <em>Provident Life </em>&amp; <em>Accident Insurance Company v. Wallace, </em>supra. The insured\u2019s car would not start and the insured started pushing it from the rear to start it, knowing that to engage the motor the car must be left in gear and this would require more effort and strain on his part. Because of this effort and strain, a hernia developed. The Court held that he could not recover under a policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>offering benefits for bodily injury \u201csustained solely through external, violent, and accidental means, \u2019 \u2019 saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201cIt is not insisted that he slipped, or that the car bumped into him or that anything unexpectedly happened to him other than the injury. He intended to push the car in order to start it, and to do so the car must be in gear requiring force to turn over the engine. He was conscious of the strain he was voluntarily exerting and necessarily anticipated the strain, but of course, he did not expect a hernia to result from the strain; the only unforeseen and unexpected thing that happened was the rupture, which naturally resulted from the excessive strain voluntarily exerted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201cUpon this state of facts, under the rules adopted in this state, the court is of the opinion that the injury which was effected was not caused solely through external, violent, and accidental means. And this being true, the policy did not cover the injury and the plaintiff was not entitled to a recovery. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The above case follows the majority rule announced in the annotation found in 55 A.L.R.2d, 1186. This same rule is followed in the majority of .the states. The Supreme Court of Louisiana uses this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u201cUnless there is an accidental element in the act which precedes and causes the injury, there can be no recovery under a policy which insures only against injuries caused by accidental means.\u201d <em>Parker v. Provident Accident </em>&amp; <em>Insurance Company, </em>178 La. 977, 152 So. 583.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">This same principle is found in the following definition (among others) of \u201caccident\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u201c* * * any unexpected personal injury resulting from any unlooked for mishap or occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">The texts also support this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">\u201cDefinitions of the terms \u201caccident\u201d and \u201caccidental means\u201d include the idea that the means as well as the result must he unforeseen, involuntary, unexpected, and unusual, and that it must be a happening by chance.\u201d Blashfield\u2019s Cyclopedia of Automobile Law and Practice, Vol. 6, Part 2, Perm.Ed. Sec. 4125, p. 372.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Testing the allegations in plaintiff\u2019s amended declaration in the light of the above holdings and authorities, it is clear that plaintiff, in entering his vehicle, decided to forego the use of the . running board as an intermediate step, and purposely took the higher step from ground to floorboard. This additional strain and effort caused the twisting of the back and the injury that prompted this suit. We find nowhere in plaintiff\u2019s allegations any hint or inference that anything untoward, unforeseen, unexpected or fortuitous happened, except the injury. He does not claim that his foot slipped, or that he accidentally failed to see or missed the running board, or that there was any other intervening factor. Under these circumstances there can be no doubt that only the result, the injury, was accidental, and that plaintiff\u2019s injury was not \u201ccaused by accident\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We have carefully examined the authorities submitted by plaintiff, and have been forced to conclude that they do not govern under the circumstances existing in the instant case. Nor can this case be brought within the more liberal ambit of Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases. Particular interpretations of the Workmen\u2019s Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tion Act and the words used therein have been impelled by the purposes underlying this statutory field of compensation for industrial injuries or disease. In <em>Scott v. Metropolitan Insurance Company, </em>supra, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201cThe decisions in Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases may be left out of consideration. Under that statute, the employer is liable for injuries from accidents to employees arising out of and in the course of their employment. The statute is concerned to afford protection against accidental results. In the sense of the statute, broadly speaking, the employment itself is the means of the accident, and the employment, of course, is never accidental.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As indicated above, we agree with the trial judge. The Third Assignment of Error is also overruled, the action of the trial court in sustaining the demurrer is affirmed, and the suit will be dismissed at the cost of plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-7\">Buenett, Chief Justice, and Cbeson, Dyer, and Humphreys, Justices, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
