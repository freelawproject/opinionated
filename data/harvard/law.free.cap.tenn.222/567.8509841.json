In this opinion Joe W. Lovell, Executor of the Estate of Hall Lovell, will be referred to as plaintiff, and the other parties as defendants, or by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">This case arose as a result of a vehicle accident involving a pickup truck driven by the defendant Jesse Lee McCullough, with the plaintiff\u2019s decedent as a passenger, and a car driven by the defendant, Biehard Stephen Forester. Plaintiff-decedent and Jesse Lee McCullough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>were both, employed by the City of Murfreesboro. It was alleged the truck was owned by said City and was being driven at the time upon the business of the City. The basis of the action for the injuries and death of plaintifPs decedent was the concurrent negligence of the defendants Jesse Lee McCullough and Richard Stephen Forester. Upon a trial before a jury, the trial court entered a judgment in the amount of $23,500.00 against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">The trial court granted the motion for a new trial filed by the defendants McCullough and the City of Murfrees-boro upon the grounds the injuries and death of plaintiff\u2019s decedent was covered under our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statutes and at the same time sustained the motion of these two defendants for a directed verdict dismissing the suit as to them. To this action plaintiff prayed and perfected an appeal in error to the Court of Appeals. Plaintiff, prior to this appeal, did not file a motion for a new trial and the Court of Appeals on authority of <em>Bostick v. Thomas, </em>137 Tenn. 99, 191 S.W. 968 (1916); <em>Badger v. Tennessee Electric Power Co., </em>12 Tenn. App. 361 <em>(1930); Scott v. St. Louis, San Francisco Railroad Co., </em>39 Tenn.App. 534, 286 S.W.2d 347 (1954), found upon motion it could not entertain this appeal upon the facts. We affirm this holding of the Court of Appeals. This case, insofar as these two defendants are concerned, was closed upon the passage of the time within which to file a motion for a new trial by plaintiff after the trial court dismissed the case as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The motion for a new trial by defendant Forester was overruled and this appeal perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The first issue presented by this case is in regard to the jury verdict and the judgment entered thereon. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>return of the jury into open court to return its verdict the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">THE COURT: G-entlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">FOREMAN CRAMER: We have, Your Honor. We the jury feel that there was negiigence on both Mr. McCullough and Mr. Forester, and we recommend a judgement of $23,500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">THE COURT: $23,500.00. Now that is against both Mr. McCullough and Mr. Forester?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">FOREMAN CRAMER: Total.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">THE COURT: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">FOREMAN CRAMER: $23,500. total.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">THE COURT: Now, what about the City of Murfrees-boro?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">FOREMAN: No \u2014 we didn\u2019t find anything on the City of Murfreesboro, Your Honor \u2014 on the part of the City of Murfreesboro.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">THE COURT: You find in favor of the City of Mur-freesboro then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-14\">FOREMAN CRAMER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s see if I understand you now. You may be seated. Gentlemen of the jury, as I understand your verdict is you find in favor of the Executor, Mr. Lovell of Hall Lovell, against both the defendants, Jesse Lee McCullough and Richard Stephen Forester, and assess the damages at $23,500. and you find in favor of the City of Murfreesboro?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>JUROR #4 (Helton): We\u2019ll need some discussion on that, I think we need some discussion on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">THE COURT: Well, all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">JUROR #4: I\u2019m not clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">THE COURT: It is almost twelve o\u2019clock, so you may go to your lunch and then come hack and retire to your jury room and resume your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">After the luncheon recess the jury returned to the Courtroom, at which time the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">THE COURT: G-entlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">FOREMAN CRAMER: We have, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">THE COURT: What is your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">FOREMAN CRAMER: We were under the assumption on our first report that since the City of Murfreesboro could not be separated that they were as one. Therefore, the City is equally as guilty as Mr. McCullough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-14\">THE COURT: You find in favor of the plaintiff against McCullough and the City of Murfreesboro and Richard Stephen Forester?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-15\">FOREMAN: Yes, sir, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-16\">THE COURT: And you assess the damages at the same amount you gave this morning \u2014 $23,500.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-17\">FOREMAN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-18\">THE COURT: So say you all, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">JURY ASSENTS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-20\">MR. STEGALL: Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>THE COUNT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">ME. STEGALL: On behalf of Bichard Stephen Forester, I\u2019d like to request the privilege of polling the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">. THE COUNT: All right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">MN. BOULDIN: Yonr Honor, the Oonrt is the one that polls the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">THE COUNT: Well, I mean I have to poll them if he asked for it. If he demands the jury to be polled I have to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">MN. BOULDIN: Yes, sir, but he was about to do it himself. I wanted Your Honor to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">MN. STEGALL : He is mistaken, Your Honor, it is to the discretion of the Court as to the method and means of doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">THE COUNT: In order to clear up any questions, I\u2019ll call them. I\u2019ll start right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">THE COUNT: All right, you right there, as between the plaintiff and Mr. Forester, how do you find?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">MN. DUNNAWAY: I found both of them guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\">THE COUNT: Now, I said between the plaintiff, that\u2019s Mr. Lovell, and the defendant Forester, how do you find?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">MN. DUNNAWAY: I don\u2019t know what you mean, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-16\">THE COUNT: Ah\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-17\">MN. BOULDIN: Your Honor, could I make a suggestion? Could the question be phrased simply to ask the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>different jurors if the verdict stated by the foreman was also his individual verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-3\">THE COURT: No, sir, that would not he polling the jury. If you are going to poll the jury, the juror has got to state how he stands on the specific question, Mr. Bouldin. As I understand the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">MR. WOODS: Your Honor, please, I think I can clarify this so that the jury, I believe, will be able to answer the questions. I move to poll the jury in behalf of these other two defendants, in other words poll them as to all the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">MR. STEGALL: Your Honor, that is Mr. Woods\u2019 privilege, but I think they should be polled separately for each defendant, if he wants to so move. I made a motion on behalf of Mr. Forester, and I think we are entitled to have the jury polled solely on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">THE COURT: Now, gentlemen, when yoxi said you did not understand \u2014 the only question you have to determine is as to the plaintiff, Mr. Lovell, and as to the defendant, Mr. Forester, first. How do you find as against him \u2014 as against, or if you find against Mr. Forester, and you have said that you did find?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">MR. DUNNAWAY: Find against Mr. Forester.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">THE COURT: Do you want them polled on the amount of damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">MR. DUNNAWAY: Well, we just split it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">THE COURT: You mean you split the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">MR. DUNNAWAY: $23,500. I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>THE COURT: That was the amount you found?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\">MR. DUNNAWAY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">THE COURT: And you \u2014 do you find that amount against Mr. Forester?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">MR. DUNNAWAY: Half of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">THE COURT: Half of it against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">MR. DUNNAWAY: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">THE COURT: And half against who ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">MR. DUNNAWAY: City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">THE COURT: What about Mr. McCullough?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">MR. DUNNAWAY: And McCullough too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">THE COURT: You next man \u2014 how do you stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">JUROR #7: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">THE COURT: What is your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">JUROR #7: I would say about the same way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">THE COURT: Exactly the same as he said?

WOODS: Yonr Honor, I believe tbe Conrt does bave tbe right to bold tbe verdict in accordance with the verdict of tbe jury. Tbe verdict is found against both defendants and assess tbe total amount at $23,500. I think that is tbe verdict tbe Court should enter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">THE COURT: All right, gentlemen, you may be excused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">In tbe poll of tbe jury tbe trial judge in substance stated: \u201cIs this your verdict against tbe defendant Forester?\u201d In tbe poll of tbe jury to pose such question in an action against tort-feasors is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Tbe only object of polling a jury is to ascertain if tbe verdict announced by their foreman is tbe verdict of each and every juror. This is generally done by tbe trial judge in announcing tbe verdict given by tbe foreman and then asking each and every juror individually in substance tbe question: \u201cIs this your verdict?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">In this state polling of juries upon request is mandatory under T.C.A. secs. 20-1324, 20-1325. These statutes require no particular method in tbe conduct of tbe poll and under <em>Dixon Stave </em>&amp; <em>Heading Co., Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Archer, </em>40 Tenn.App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603 (1956), such, was in the sound discretion of the trial judge. In the <em>Archer </em>case the court quoted with approval from 53 Am. Jur., Trial, Sec. 1015:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cExamining the jury by the poll is the most generally recognized means of ascertaining whether they are unanimous in their decision. In no other way can the rights of the parties to the concurrence of the jurors be so effectually secured as to have each juror answer the question, \u2018Is this your verdict?\u2019 in the presence of a court and counsel. By this means it can be ascertained for a certainty that no one has been coerced or induced to agree to a verdict to which he does not fully assent. <em>The poll of each member of the jury on the question whether the verdict rendered is the verdict of each juror represents the extent to which the court may go in inquiring of the jurors as to the method of reaching their verdict.\u201d </em>40 TenmApp. at 336, 291 S.W.2d at 608. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">As authority for the italicized sentence Am.Jur. cited <em>Miller v. Blue Ridge Transportation Co., </em>123 W.Va. 428, 15 S.E.2d 400 (1941). This was an action against tort-feasors wherein the jury returned a general verdict against all defendants. Defendants requested the trial judge to poll the jury, propounding to them the question of whether their verdict was arrived at by an agreement in advance for each juror to put down the amount he thought the verdict should be and the aggregate of these sums divided by twelve would be the amount of the verdict. The trial judge refused to propound this question to the jury. The appellate court, affirming the trial judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>held the trial judge in polling the jury should not inquire as to the methods used by the jury in reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><em>Labor v. Koplin, </em>4 N.Y. 547 (1851), was an action against joint tort-feasors wherein the jury returned a general verdict against all defendants. The trial judge refused the request of defendants to poll the jury propounding to them the question of whether the verdict was against each of the defendants. The appellate court, in affirming the action of the trial court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">In the case under consideration the verdict announced was clearly against both defendants, and the question proposed to be put to the jury was not only unusual, but seemed to require an explanation of the verdict. It was in substance asking them whether they intended or designed the verdict to be against each and both of the defendants. Such a departure from the established practice can produce no good result, and may lead to much evil, and the judge did right in refusing to permit it. 4 N.Y. at 551.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\"While the facts in the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Lobar </em>cases are different, we think the reason supporting both decisions is the same. The question proposed in each case was an attempt to go further than ask each juror if the verdict announced by the foreman was his verdict which is an attempt, in a manner of speaking, to get behind the verdict announced by the foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In suits against joint tort-feasors seldom are the defenses of the defendant in complete accord, and most often, as in the case at bar, the defenses are antagonistic to each other. In the case at bar the foreman announced a general verdict against all three defendants. To then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>allow on a poll of the jury a question, in substance: \u201cDo you find against this particular defendant?\u201d is to probably invite again before the jury a contest between the defendants already waged in the trial of the case and by the jury in its deliberations. We agree with the court in <em>Lobar v. Koplin, </em>supra, to do so may lead to much evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">It could be argued the error here in the polling of the jury is harmless error and we have given consideration to such. We think any degree of implied approval we might give to the manner of the polling of the jury in this case by anything other than reversal could be harmful to the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">It results the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new trial in accord with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-7\">Burnett, Chiee Justice, and Chattin, Creson and Humphreys, Justices, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
