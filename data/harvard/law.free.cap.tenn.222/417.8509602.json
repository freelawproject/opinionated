C. Schultz, Deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Appellant\u2019s claim, as filed in the trial court, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cA claim for damages in an amount not to exceed $150,000.00 is hereby made against the Estate of E. C. Schultz, Deceased, by Ethel Pay Bass, natural guardian and next friend of Sheila Fay Darby, a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-3\">This claim is based on the negligence of the deceased in his diagnosis of the condition of the said minor, who was a patient under the care of the deceased; the negligence of the deceased in his prognosis of the future condition and disability of the said minor; and the negligence of the deceased in approving and recommending the settlement of a personal injury claim on behalf of the said minor, the claim being predicated on the said minor having no permanent disability, when the deceased knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known that the said minor had permanent disability or that a great likelihood of permanent disability existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">In reliance on the negligently incorrect diagnosis, prognosis and evaluation, as related, a settlement was effected of the said minor\u2019s personal injuries for $13,-500.00. The amount of settlement was grossly inadequate to compensate said minor for her permanent disability which decedent negligently failed to disclose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Union Planters National Bank, Executor of the Estate of Dr. Schultz, excepted to appellant\u2019s claim, insisting (1) that the Probate Court of Shelby County had no jurisdiction to try the claim for the reason that it is based on the alleged negligence of the decedent and thus sounds in tort, (2) that appellant is not a creditor within the provisions of T.O.A. sec. 30-510, and (3) that, without waving the jurisdictional grounds for exception just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>above referred to, Dr. Schultz; was not. negligent as alleged in the claim. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">The exceptions were heard July. 23, 1968, upon '.argument of counsel. The court found (1) ' that appellant\u2019s claim is-\u201cbased, on tort,\u201d and .(2) that the court.was without jurisdiction to hear it. The claim was dismissed and an appeal \u201cto the proper Appellate Court\u201d, was prayed and granted.\u2022 \u25a0 . .</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\" Appellant has filed one assignment of error iif this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdP\">\u201cThe Probate Court erred in dismissing Appellant\u2019s claim, since the , claim furnishes ample . basis . for a breach of contract action, and the Probate Court therefore has jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u2022 Appellant insists that the issue to be decided' is whether or not her claim can \u201cbe based on breach of contract.\u201d More accurately, the issues presented.are (1) does the claim stated sound in tort or in contract,'and (2) does the .trial court have jurisdiction to try the cl\u00e1im stated?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u25a0This case presents' a-situation in which \"\u2019a physician undertook to diagnose and treat a patient; The patient now contends that the. diagnosis was negligently-performed, to- her detriment. She insists that her action sounds in contract and, for the purposes of asserting a claim against the est\u00e1te of the physician, that her claim should be viewed as arising from \u00e1 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">This Court is of opinion that the view thus contended for cannot be accepted. There is little doubt that the undertaking of a physician'to diagnose and treat the ills of a patient is, -in part, contractual in nature.-The relationship thus -arising between a -physician'and patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>.creates a duty on the part of the physician to exercise .proper-care. If a. physician-renders his services negligently, he is liable in tort for the breach of the duty owed .to the patient. An action against a physician for negligent diagnosis or treatment sounds in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">The gravamen of the claim asserted in the Probate Court is, and must be, that deceased negligently breached his duty to have and exercise that degree of knowledge, skill, diligence and care standard to the medical profession in the community in which performed. It seems reasonably clear, then, that the claim stated is one sounding in tort and the damages sought are of that kind and character indigenous to the action for negligence. In this fabric, the so-called contract is not significant beyond its imposition of the duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">This Court, in <em>Collins v. Ruffner </em>(1947), 185 Tenn. 290, 206 S.W.2d 298, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\"><em>\u201cIn Langford v. Fly, </em>26 Tenn. 585, 586, the Court said: \u2018A party who has a right of action for a tort, cannot be deemed a \u201ccreditor\u201d until he obtains a judgment. The wrong-doer is in no sense a debtor by reason of the wrong, until the judgment of a court shall fix upon him a pecuniary burden for the redress of the wrong.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Under T.C.A. sec. 30-510 and <em>Collins v. Ruffner, </em>supra, appellant is not a creditor until such time as a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined whether or not the estate of deceased is liable for the alleged negligent wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">It is correct to say, and the trial court has so held, that it is without jurisdiction to entertain the claim in the present case. See <em>Collins v. Ruffner, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>It results that the judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s claim must he, and is, affirmed. Costs are taxed to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-5\">Burnett, Chief Justice, and Dyer, Chattin and Humphreys, Justices, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
