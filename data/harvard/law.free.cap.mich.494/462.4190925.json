When Harris sought treatment for his injuries under MCL 500.3114(5)(a), the legally assigned insurer, defendant Auto Club Insurance Association (ACIA), became hable for all of Harris\u2019s PIP expenses. Because BCBSM\u2019s policy plainly provides that BCBSM is not hable for expenses that Harris does not legally have to pay, Harris cannot cohect expenses from both ACIA and BCBSM. Accordingly, we reverse in part the December 27, 2011 judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the OaHand Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On July 11, 2008, Harris was injured when he was struck by a motor vehicle while operating a motorcycle. Harris had a health insurance policy, referred to as a Professional Services Group Benefit Certificate (the policy or the certificate), with BCBSM. The owner of the motor vehicle that struck Harris was insured under a no-fault insurance policy issued by ACIA. Under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq., </em>the statutory definition of motor vehicle expressly \u201cdoes not include a motorcycle.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, MCL 500.3114 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">(5) A person suffering accidental bodily injury arising from a motor vehicle accident which shows evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>involvement of a motor vehicle while an operator or passenger of a motorcycle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the motor vehicle involved in the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Accordingly, if Harris claimed PIP benefits, ACIA would be responsible for paying those benefits, despite the fact Harris did not purchase a no-fault insurance policy from ACIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Following his accident, Harris sought insurance coverage for his medical bills from both ACIA and BCBSM. Harris expected BCBSM to pay the bills submitted by his medical care providers and expected ACIA to send a check directly to him in the same amount as the BCBSM payments. BCBSM initially paid $19,801.75 in benefits, but then retracted those payments and denied coverage, relying on provisions in its policy that stated BCBSM would not pay for medical care and services for which benefits are paid by another plan. In light of BCBSM\u2019s denial of coverage, ACIA paid all Harris\u2019s medical bills, including those bill payments retracted by BCBSM. ACIA has paid in excess of $85,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Harris then filed this lawsuit naming ACIA as the only defendant. Harris alleged that ACIA was required to pay him directly the same amounts paid by BCBSM to any healthcare provider for medical expenses arising from the motor vehicle accident. ACIA subsequently filed a third-party complaint against BCBSM. Harris then filed an amended complaint naming BCBSM as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">BCBSM and Harris filed motions for summary disposition. ACIA opposed the motions. The circuit court determined that because ACIA\u2019s policy was uncoordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>nated,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ACIA was the primary insurer. The court also opined that the BCBSM certificate coordinated benefits with the no-fault policy. The court emphasized that the BCBSM certificate included a \u201cCoordination of Benefits\u201d provision. The court additionally relied on the \u201cPhysician and Other Professional Provider Services That Are Not Payable\u201d and \u201cCare and Services That Are Not Payable\u201d provisions in concluding that BCBSM does not pay for care and services for which the insured legally does not have to pay or for which the insured would not have been charged if the insured did not have coverage. The court held that ACIA was primarily responsible for the payment of Harris\u2019s medical expenses. Accordingly, the court denied Harris\u2019s motion for summary disposition, but granted BCBSM\u2019s motion, resulting in the dismissal of all the claims asserted against BCBSM by Harris and ACIA. The court also granted summary disposition in favor of ACIA against Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Harris appealed, challenging only the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing his claims against BCBSM. ACIA did not appeal the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing its third-party claims against BCBSM. A split panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s order to the extent that it granted summary disposition to BCBSM.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority characterized the dispute as \u201cwhether the BCBSM certificate coordinates with the no-fault policy.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority rejected BCBSM\u2019s reliance on several provisions in the certificate that the circuit court relied on to preclude coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The majority expressly addressed the provision of the BCBSM certificate titled, \u201cCare and Services That Are Not Payable,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which as previously stated, provides: \u201cWe do not pay for the following care and services: Those for which you legally do not have to pay or for which you would not have been charged if you did not have coverage under this certificate.\u201d Rather than applying the language of this provision, however, the majority looked to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions in <em>Shanafelt v Allstate Ins Co </em>and <em>Bombalski v Auto Club Ins </em>Ass\u2019n.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In those cases, the panels \u201cexamined the meaning of the term \u2018incurred\u2019 in MCL 500.3107(1) and considered the no-fault insurer\u2019s contention that the plaintiff did not \u2018incur []\u2019 expenses that were paid by the health insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As noted by the majority, <em>Shanafelt </em>explained that \u201c[t]he primary definition of the word \u2018incur\u2019 is \u2018to become liable for.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In applying this definition, <em>Shanafelt </em>reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">[o]bviously, [the] plaintiff became liable for her medical expenses when she accepted medical treatment. The fact that plaintiff had contracted with a health insurance company to compensate her for her medical expenses, or to pay directly the health care provider on her behalf, does not alter the fact that she was obligated to pay those expenses.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Relying on this reasoning, the majority concluded that Harris had incurred expenses when he sought treatment for his injuries that arose from the motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>accident, and that once he became liable for those expenses, BCBSM was in turn liable to cover those expenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The majority concluded in part that the circuit court \u201cerred in determining that the BCBSM certificate coordinated with the no-fault policy.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The majority also addressed BCBSM\u2019s contention that <em>Shanafelt </em>and <em>Bombalski </em>were inapposite because they addressed the no-fault act while the instant case turns on the language of BCBSM\u2019s certificate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The majority rejected this claim because the term \u201cincurred\u201d is synonymous with the phrase, \u201clegally obligated to pay.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The majority opined that the rationale of <em>Shanafelt </em>and <em>Bombalski </em>was nonetheless applicable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That is, \u201cthat a party receiving services has a legal obligation to pay for them when rendered and incurs the expense even if the expense is paid by an insurer, is applicable here, although the phrase and context are different.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Judge MURRAY partially dissented.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Judge MURRAY found controlling the provision in the certificate, titled \u201cCare and Services That Are Not Payable.\u201d Judge MURRAY noted that this provision was stated in the present tense, and that \u201cwhether we look to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>factual situation at the time the complaint was filed or when plaintiff submitted his demand upon BCBSM, we know that plaintiff did not legally have to pay anything.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We granted BCBSM\u2019s application for leave to appeal, instructing that \u201c[t]he parties shall include among the issues to be briefed whether [Harris] is entitled to a double recovery from both [ACIA] and [BCBSM] of medical expenses arising from a motorcycle accident involving a motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">This Court reviews a circuit court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We also review de novo the proper interpretation of a contract.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In <em>Smith v Physicians Health Plan, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court acknowledged that an insured who had elected an uncoordinated no-fault policy may, under certain circumstances, be able to obtain a double recovery from both the no-fault insurer and the health insurer for medical expenses arising from the same accident. \u201cIt is when both the no-fault automobile insurance and the health insurance are uncoordinated policies that multiple recovery is possible for the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>example, in Shanafelt,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals permitted an insured who had an uncoordinated no-fault policy, and was allegedly injured in a motor vehicle accident, to collect the costs of her PIP benefits from her no-fault insurer despite the fact that the insured\u2019s health insurer had already covered the expense.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">However, in this case, Harris\u2019s claim is fundamentally at odds with those cases. Unlike the claimant in <em>Shanafelt, </em>and other cases in which a double recovery of insurance benefits was awarded, Harris is not claiming benefits under a no-fault insurance policy that he or anyone else procured. Harris is neither a third-party beneficiary<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> nor a subrogee<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> of the no-fault policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>issued to the person that struck him and thus he is not eligible to receive benefits under that policy. Rather, Harris\u2019s right to PIP benefits arises solely by statute. As previously noted, MCL 500.3114 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">(5) A person suffering accidental bodily injury arising from a motor vehicle accident which shows evidence of the involvement of a motor vehicle while an operator or passenger of a motorcycle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the motor vehicle involved in the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Court of Appeals majority erred when it concluded that Harris was covered by the uncoordinated no-fault insurance policy held by the motor vehicle driver involved in the accident. Harris is entitled to PIP coverage because MCL 500.3114(5)(a) designates ACIA as the responsible insurer. This conclusion is consistent with our holding in <em>Smith, </em>where we concluded that an insured must pay a premium to obtain insurance policies that provide for double recovery.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Harris has simply not shown that he paid the necessary premiums to receive a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Under MCL 500.3114(5)(a), Harris was not obligated to pay his medical expenses because, as a matter of law, ACIA was liable for Harris\u2019s PIP expenses. This dispo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>sition is generally consistent with Judge Murray\u2019s partial dissenting opinion, except that it focused almost entirely on the present tense of the phrase \u201cfor which you legally do not have to pay,\u201d to determine the applicability of MCL 500.3114(5)(a). Judge MURRAY considered only whether Harris had potential liability \u201cat the time the complaint was filed or when [he] submitted his demand upon BCBSM.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that ACIA was liable regardless of when Harris first received treatment, when Harris filed a complaint against BCBSM or when Harris submitted his demand to BCBSM. Consequently, the provision of the BCBSM certificate titled \u201cCare and Services That Are Not Payable,\u201d is directly applicable when Harris claimed PIP benefits under MCL 500.3114(5)(a). Regardless of when Harris sought treatment for his injuries, those services are \u201c[t]hose for which [Harris] legally [did] not have to pay . .. .\u201d Accordingly, Harris is not entitled to a double recovery. We reverse in part the December 27, 2011 judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the Oakland Circuit Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-4\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> MCL 500.3107(1)(a) provides that \u201cpersonal protection insurance benefits are payable for . . .
