The Court of Appeals held that the admission of defendant\u2019s confession violated <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), and <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981), because Evans was a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>We respectfully disagree because this is not a sufficient condition for the application of these decisions. Even if every parole officer constitutes a \u201claw enforcement officer,\u201d neither an accused\u2019s right under <em>Miranda </em>to be given a series of warnings nor an accused\u2019s right under <em>Edwards </em>to have counsel present apply absent \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d by the officer. Because defendant was not subjected to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d by the parole officer as that term has come to be understood under <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny, neither defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>nor defendant\u2019s <em>Edwards </em>rights were violated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>regardless of whether the parole officer was a law enforcement officer. Thus, the trial court did not err by admitting defendant\u2019s confession. By focusing on the wrong constitutional question, the Court of Appeals considerably expanded the domain of <em>Miranda, </em>particularly with regard to parole officers. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In 2006, defendant was convicted of unarmed robbery in violation of MCL 750.530, and the trial court sentenced him to serve a prison term of 3 to 15 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In February 2010, at the discretion of the parole board, defendant was granted parole and provisionally released from prison. Upon release, defendant was placed under the supervision of a parole officer and required to abide by certain conditions of parole. These conditions included that defendant not engage in behavior that constitutes a violation of any federal, state, or local law, that he not use or possess controlled substances, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that he follow the parole officer\u2019s instructions and report as required by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On June 17, 2010, defendant was taken into custody by police pursuant to a warrant for failing to report, and the next day, his parole officer, Jason Golightly, served defendant with a notice of parole violation pertaining to that failure. On the same day, after advising defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, detectives of the Jackson Police Department questioned defendant concerning a robbery that had occurred at approximately 4:00 a.m. on June 16, 2010, at a Jackson gas station. After voluntarily answering several questions, defendant requested an attorney. The police then discontinued the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">On June 21, 2010, while defendant was still incarcerated, his parole officer was on vacation, so another officer, Cheryl Evans, went to the jail to serve defendant with an amended notice of parole violation that identified three additional parole violations, one of which related to the June 16 robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Evans testified as follows regarding what occurred at the jail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\"><em>Q. </em>And what, exactly does [\u201cserve him parole violation charges and get his statement\u201d] mean? What do you do? What\u2019s the process when that happens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\"><em>A. </em>When a person is served with a parole violation charge, when we determine they - or we believe they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>violated a condition of their parole, we have charges made up. They\u2019re on a piece of paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">We then go and meet with the person. We serve them the charges, which means I say \u201cCount I,\u201d \u201cCount II\u201d - or, for him, it was Count - it was an additional count, so it was Count III, Count IN Count V And then I review it with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">I ask him for a statement. We talk a little bit. And then he decides whether he signs the bottom - not saying he\u2019s guilty - just signs that he received the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">Then he\u2019s offered a preliminary parole violation hearing, which is a probable cause hearing. And, again, he waived that, but waiving that does not admit he\u2019s guilty. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s waiving the preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">Q. So, did you do all this with the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\"><em>Q. </em>And did he give you a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\"><em>Q. </em>Did one of the charges have to do with the robbery at the Admiral gas station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\"><em>Q. </em>Did he give you a statement as to those charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\"><em>Q. </em>And what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">A. We talked generally about everything that was going on and he said that he\u2019d been having a rough time. He said that he was living with his cousin, Laurie Brooks, who has a couple of kids, and that he felt - he wasn\u2019t able to get a job and hold a job - and he felt that he was putting a lot of financial stresses on her. And he also said, you know, he, himself, got a little stressed about it and was having a lot of trouble adjusting and he slipped and started using his cocaine again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">And he said he went into the Admiral gas station. He told me that he walked in there to the clerk, asked the clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>for some cigarettes. The clerk turned around to get cigarettes. As the clerk turned around - he actually showed me what he did \u2014 he leaned forward like this onto the counter and told the guy in a low voice to \u2014 told him to give him the money and he wouldn\u2019t get hurt, and then he said the guy gave him the money and he left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Relevant here, the meeting between Evans and defendant took place in the jail library and lasted approximately 15 to 25 minutes. Evans did not inform defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights or tell defendant that he was not required to speak to her absent a lawyer being present. According to Evans, during the meeting, defendant told her that he had submitted a letter indicating that he wished to talk to the police again, and at the end of the meeting, defendant asked Evans to convey to the police that he wished to speak to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Defendant was eventually charged with armed robbery for the gas station incident, and he was tried before a jury. At the beginning of trial, defendant moved to suppress Evans\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s confession, arguing that it was improperly obtained because defendant had not been informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and because defendant had previously requested counsel. After conducting a hearing, the trial court determined that Evans had not been acting in concert with law enforcement officials and that Evans was not herself a law enforcement officer obligated to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Accordingly, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion and admitted Evans\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s confession. The jury convicted defendant of armed robbery, and he was sentenced as a fourth-offense habitual offender to a prison term of 15-30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court had erred when it denied his motion to suppress Evans\u2019s testimony regarding his confession and that the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>was not harmless. In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals held that a parole officer is a law enforcement officer for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>that defendant was in custody when Evans interrogated him, and that the statements made by defendant were thus \u201cinadmissible in a subsequent trial [because] the parolee invoked the right to counsel before questioning.\u201d <em>People v Elliott, </em>295 Mich App 623, 646; 815 NW2d 575 (2012). The Court of Appeals agreed with defendant that the trial court\u2019s error in denying the motion to suppress was not harmless given the significance the prosecutor had placed on Evans\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 647-648. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 626. We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>People v Elliott, </em>491 Mich 938 (2012).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s factual findings in a ruling on a motion to suppress for clear error. To the extent that a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>involves an interpretation of the law or the application of a constitutional standard to uncontested facts, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>People v Attebury, </em>463 Mich 662, 668; 624 NW2d 912 (2001). Whether a court applied the correct constitutional standard is reviewed de novo. <em>People v McRae, </em>469 Mich 704, 710; 678 NW2d 425 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against compelled self-incrimination requires that the accused be given a series of warnings before being subjected to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 444 (\u201cPrior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d). The right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation is a corollary of the right against compelled self-incrimination, because the presence of counsel at custodial interrogation is one way in which to \u201cinsure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466; see also <em>id. </em>at 470. If the custodial interrogation is not preceded by an adequate warning, statements made during the custodial interrogation may not be introduced into evidence at the accused\u2019s criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>at 444-445.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The prosecutor concedes that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given by the parole officer. Thus, the pertinent question is whether the meeting with the parole officer that resulted in defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements constituted custodial interrogation. If the meeting did not constitute custodial interrogation, the ruling of the trial court was correct and the statements were properly admitted into evidence. See <em>People v Hill, </em>429 Mich 382, 397; 415 NW2d 193 (1987) (indicating that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required unless the accused is subject to custodial interrogation). On the other hand, if the meeting did constitute custodial interrogation, the ruling of the trial court was in error and the statements were improperly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">There is no dispute that defendant invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation when he was questioned on June 18 by Jackson police detectives about the gas station robbery and that the invocation triggered certain safeguards pursuant to <em>Edwards, </em>451 US at 484-485. In <em>Edwards, </em>the United States Supreme Court created \u201cadditional safeguards\u201d for when the accused invokes his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights.... [HJaving expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, [he] is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police. [Edwards, 451 US at 484-485.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"><em>Edwards </em>concerns only the manner in which the accused, after invoking his right to have counsel present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>during custodial interrogation, can validly waive that right and thereafter be subjected to further custodial interrogation absent counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the accused is never subjected to custodial interrogation after he has invoked his right to counsel, <em>Edwards </em>is inapplicable. In other words, according to <em>Edwards, </em>the right the accused invokes under <em>Miranda </em>is the right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation. <em>Edwards, </em>451 US at 485-486 (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment right identified in <em>Miranda </em>is the right to have counsel present at any custodial interrogation.\u201d). In the absence of a post-invocation custodial interrogation, there can be no infringement of that right. See, e.g., <em>Maryland v Shatzer, </em>559 US 98, 111; 130 S Ct 1213; 175 L Ed 2d 1045 (2010). (\u201cIn every case involving <em>Edwards, </em>the courts must determine whether the suspect was in custody when he requested counsel <em>and when he later made the statements he seeks to suppress.\u201d); Edwards, </em>451 US at 487 (\u201cWe think it is clear that Edwards was subjected to custodial interrogation [at a second meeting with the police] . . . and that this occurred at the instance of the authorities.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The pertinent question in this case is not, as the Court of Appeals believed it to be, \u201cwhether Evans was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>a law enforcement officer under <em>Miranda </em>as a matter of law given her status as a parole officer . .. <em>Elliot, </em>295 Mich App at 636. Although <em>Miranda </em>discussed the constitutional safeguards in terms of \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers,\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 444, neither <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>right to be given a series of warnings nor <em>Edwards\u2019s </em>right to have counsel present apply absent custodial interrogation, regardless of whether a parole officer constitutes a law enforcement officer. Thus, to determine whether a defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Edwards </em>rights have been violated, we must first resolve whether the meeting with the parole officer constituted custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>conclude that defendant was not subjected to custodial interrogation by the parole officer, we need not further consider whether a parole officer not acting in concert with or at the request of the police may be considered a law enforcement officer for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>By focusing on the wrong constitutional question, the Court of Appeals considerably expanded the domain of Miranda, particularly with regard to parole officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">A. \u201cCUSTODIAL INTERROGATION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the United States Supreme Court defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Custodial interrogation occurs \u201cduring \u2018incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v Perkins, </em>496 US 292, 296; 110 S Ct 2394; 110 L Ed 2d 243 (1990), quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 445. \u201cThat atmosphere is said to generate \u2018inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins, </em>496 US at 296, quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 467. \u201c \u2018Fidelity to the doctrine announced in <em>Miranda </em>requires that it be enforced... only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins, </em>496 US at 296, quoting <em>Berkemer v McCarty, </em>468 US 420, 437; 104 S Ct 3138; 82 L Ed 2d 317 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Where, as here, a parolee is incarcerated for an alleged parole violation, \u201ccustodial\u201d means more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>just the normal restrictions that exist as a result of the incarceration. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cimprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of Miranda.\u201d <em>Howes v Fields, </em>565 US _, _; 132 S Ct 1181, 1190; 182 L Ed 2d 17 (2012); see also <em>Shatzer, </em>559 US at 112-113. Instead, whether \u201cincarceration constitutes custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes . . . depends upon whether it exerts the coercive pressure that <em>Miranda </em>was designed to guard against \u2014 the \u2018danger of coercion [that] results from the <em>interaction </em>of custody and official interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shatzer, </em>559 US at 112 (emphasis and alteration in original), quoting <em>Perkins, </em>496 US at 297. In determining whether defendant was presented with the same inherently coercive pressures that were the basis for the decision in <em>Miranda, </em>we find <em>Fields </em>instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In <em>Fields, </em>a Michigan prisoner, Randall Fields, was escorted from his prison cell by a corrections officer to a conference room in which he was questioned by two sheriffs deputies about criminal activity he had allegedly engaged in before coming to prison. Fields was questioned for between five and seven hours and was at no time given <em>Miranda </em>warnings or advised that he did not have to speak with the deputies. Fields was told more than once that he was free to leave and return to his cell. The deputies were armed, but Fields remained free of restraints. The conference room door was sometimes open and sometimes shut. Several times during the interview Fields stated that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies, but he did not ask to go back to his cell. After Fields eventually confessed and the interview concluded, he had to wait an additional 20 minutes for an escort before returning to his cell well after the time when he generally went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Under these facts, the United States Supreme Court held that Fields was not in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>and set forth the following constitutional standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">As used in our <em>Miranda </em>case law, \u201ccustody\u201d is a term of art that specifies circumstances that are thought generally to present a serious danger of coercion. In determining whether a person is in custody in this sense, the initial step is to ascertain whether, in light of \u201cthe objective circumstances of the interrogation,\u201d a \u201creasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d And in order to determine how a suspect would have \u201cgauge[d]\u201d his \u201cfreedom of movement,\u201d courts must examine \u201call of the circumstances surrounding the' interrogation.\u201d Relevant factors include the location of the questioning, its duration, statements made during the interview, the presence or absence of physical restraints during the questioning, and the release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">Determining whether an individual\u2019s freedom of movement was curtailed, however, is simply the first step in the analysis, not the last. Not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>We have \u201cdecline[d] to accord talismanic power\u201d to the freedom-of-movement inquiry, and have instead asked the additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda. </em>\u201cOur cases make clear... that the freedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for <em>Miranda </em>custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody should focus on all of the features of the interrogation. These include the language that is used in summoning the prisoner to the interview and the manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the interrogation is conducted. <em>[Fields, 565 US </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1189-1190, 1192 (citations omitted; alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The Court then held that questioning a person in prison does not generally \u201cinvolve the shock that very often accompanies arrest,\u201d that \u201cwhen a prisoner is questioned, he knows that when the questioning ceases, he will remain under confinement,\u201d that a prisoner \u201cis unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release,\u201d and that a prisoner knows his questioners \u201cprobably lack the authority to affect the duration of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1190-1191. The Court found it \u201cimportant\u201d that Fields \u201cwas told at the outset of the interrogation, and was reminded again thereafter, that he could leave and go back to his cell whenever he wanted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1193. However, it also noted that Fields \u201cwas not advised that he was free to decline to speak with the deputies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1193. Despite this failing, the Court held that Fields was not in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Pursuant to <em>Fields, </em>the first constitutional step is to determine \u201cwhether an individual\u2019s freedom of movement was curtailed. . . .\u201d <em>Fields, </em>565 US at _; 132 S Ct at 1189. If so, the court should then ask \u201cthe additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda.\u201d Id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1190. Thus, \u201c[n]ot all restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody for purposes of <em>Miranda.\u201d Id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">In the instant case, the meeting at issue took place in the jail library, it was of short duration (15 to 25 minutes), defendant was not physically restrained, and he was escorted to the library by a deputy, not by the parole officer. We note, as does the dissent, that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>difference between this case and <em>Fields </em>is that defendant in this case was never told that he was free to leave the meeting and return to his cell. However, given that the meeting in this case lasted approximately 15 to 25 minutes, and the one in <em>Fields </em>lasted for five to seven hours, we do not think this fact is particularly compelling, much less dispositive, under the circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> More significant is the fact that defendant was not free to leave the jail library by himself.

See also <em>United States v Salyers, </em>160 F3d 1152, 1159 (CA 7, 1998) (\u201cCustody \u2018implies a situation in which the suspect knows he is speaking with a government agent and does not feel free to end the conversation; <em>the essential element of a custodial interrogation is </em>coercion.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>United States v Martin, </em>63 F3d 1422, 1429 (CA 7, 1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">In this case, there is no evidence of coercion or any other manner of psychological intimidation. The parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>officer visited defendant as part of her job as a parole officer; her only reasons for speaking to defendant were to advise him of parole violation charges,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> advise him of his right to a preliminary hearing on those charges,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to see if he was prepared to waive his right to a preliminary hearing. The officer was required to do all of this as part of her job, regardless of whether defendant was in or out of jail. Defendant cannot show inherently coercive pressures that caused him to discuss the robbery with the parole officer. Defendant was in jail for other parole violation charges (absconding) that were unrelated to the charges Evans was there to serve. Also, unlike in Fields, defendant was not questioned for an extended period of time by <em>armed </em>police officers who used a \u201c \u2018sharp tone\u2019 \u201d and \u201cprofanity.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>565 US at _; 132 S Ct at 1193 (citation omitted). And also unlike in <em>Fields, </em>in which the defendant indicated on several occasions during the interview that he did not want to talk to the police officers, defendant in this case did not even once indicate that he did not want to talk to the parole officer. Nor is there any evidence that the meeting \u201ccontinued well past the hour\u201d when defendant \u201cgenerally went to bed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct at 1193, that the officer had the authority to alter the duration of defendant\u2019s incarceration,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that defendant could not terminate the meeting. This situation does not represent custodial interrogation because defendant was not subjected to the type of coercive pressure against which <em>Miranda </em>was designed to guard. It is hardly the sort of incommunicado, police-dominated atmosphere involving custodial interrogation and the \u201coverbearing\u201d of the subject\u2019s will toward which <em>Miranda </em>was directed. Accordingly, in our judgment, there was no \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as that term has come to be understood under <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The dissent argues that <em>Fields </em>and <em>Shatzer </em>(another opinion that held that imprisonment alone is insufficient to create a custodial interrogation situation within the meaning of Miranda) are significantly distinguishable from the instant case because the defendants in those cases \u201cwere both serving sentences for unrelated crimes and living in the prison in which they were interviewed.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 327. However, the dissent fails to recognize that a parolee who is incarcerated as a result of violating a condition of his parole is at that juncture no different than a prisoner who was never paroled in the first place, at least in the sense that both are imprisoned as a result of their underlying offenses. Defendant here was arrested by the police pursuant to a warrant that was issued because he had absconded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>from parole. Because defendant was on parole and a warrant for his return had been issued as a result of his violation of a condition of parole, defendant, pursuant to Michigan law, could not be considered anything other than a \u201cprisoner,\u201d as were the defendants in <em>Fields </em>and <em>Shatzer. People v Holder, </em>483 Mich 168, 172-173; 767 NW2d 423 (2009) (\u201cA paroled prisoner is not considered released; rather, the prisoner is simply permitted to leave the confinement of prison.\u201d); MCL 791.238(1) (\u201cEach prisoner on parole shall remain in the legal custody and under the control of the department.\u201d); MCL 791.238(2) (\u201cA prisoner violating the provisions of his or her parole and for whose return a warrant has been issued by the deputy director of the bureau of field services is treated as an escaped prisoner ....\u201d). Therefore, we do not agree that <em>Fields </em>and <em>Shatzer </em>are distinguishable, much less \u201csignificantly\u201d so, on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In viewing the totality of circumstances in <em>Fields </em>and in the present case, we believe that if there was no custodial interrogation in the <em>Miranda </em>sense in <em>Fields, </em>there was certainly no custodial interrogation in the instant case. In <em>Fields, </em>the defendant was questioned by armed police officers; here, defendant was questioned, if you can even call it that, by an unarmed parole officer. In <em>Fields, </em>the defendant was questioned by armed police officers who were trying to obtain a confession from the defendant; here, defendant met with an unarmed parole officer who was there for the principal purpose of serving defendant with an amended notice of parole violations. In <em>Fields, </em>the defendant was questioned by armed police officers for about 5 to 7 hours; here, defendant met with an unarmed parole officer for 15 to 25 minutes. In <em>Fields, </em>the armed police officers used a \u201csharp tone\u201d and \u201cprofanity\u201d while questioning the defendant for several hours; here, the unarmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>parole officer was altogether cordial and sympathetic with defendant during their brief meeting. In <em>Fields, </em>the armed police officers continued to question the defendant until well past his regular bedtime; here, the unarmed parole officer did not keep defendant up late at night. In <em>Fields, </em>the defendant repeatedly stated that he did not want to talk to the armed police officers; here, defendant never indicated in any manner that he did not wish to talk to the unarmed parole officer. We believe it is clear that the totality of circumstances in <em>Fields </em>far more closely resembles the kind of custodial interrogation that generated the extraordinary protections of <em>Miranda </em>than does the totality of circumstances in the present case- yet even in <em>Fields, </em>such circumstances were viewed by the United States Supreme Court to he insufficient to trigger the requirements of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Moreover, the \u201cinherently coercive\u201d attributes of the parolee/parole officer relationship that the Court of Appeals relied on in reaching its conclusions are wholly inapplicable here because Evans <em>was not defendant\u2019s supervising officer. </em>The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">The rationale for the suppression of statements elicited during a custodial interrogation by a law enforcement officer who does not adhere to <em>Miranda </em>is to \u201ccombat\u201d the \u201cinherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 467; see also <em>[People v] Williams, </em>244 Mich App [533, 539; 624 NW2d 575 (2001)]. Such \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d exist in the relationship between a parolee and a parole officer. Indeed, this Court has recognized that \u201cboth parolees and probationers are under heavy psychological pressure to answer inquiries made by their supervising officers.\u201d <em>People v Faulkner, </em>90 Mich App 520, 524; 282 NW2d 377 (1979) (quotation marks and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>citations omitted). This heavy psychological pressure exists because of the unique relationship between a parolee and parole officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">... [T]he parolee-parole officer relationship often becomes a relationship of trust and confidence, as does the probationer-probation officer relationship addressed by Justice Marshall in <em>Murphy. </em>See Murphy, 465 US at 459-460 (Marshall, J., dissenting). As a parolee develops trust and begins to confide in a parole officer, the parole officer is more likely to elicit from the parolee incriminating statements that the parolee would likely <em>not make to a </em>police interrogator. [Elliot, 295 Mich App at 643.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">However, the Court of Appeals failed to recognize that the parole officer in the instant case was not <em>defendant\u2019s </em>parole officer and thus that they did not have the kind of \u201cunique relationship\u201d of \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d that the Court of Appeals assumed that they did.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, much, if not all, of the persuasive authority cited by the Court of Appeals seems inapposite when someone <em>other </em>than the defendant\u2019s supervising parole officer is conducting the meeting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">B. <em>MINNESOTA v MURPHY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In <em>Minnesota v Murphy, </em>465 US 420; 104 S Ct 1136; 79 L Ed 2d 409 (1984), the respondent was given a suspended prison sentence and placed on probation. During the course of a meeting at his probation officer\u2019s office, the respondent, upon questioning by his probation officer, admitted that he had committed a rape and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>murder in 1974. The probation officer had previously received information from a treatment counselor that respondent had admitted to the 1974 crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The respondent moved to suppress the confession, but the trial court found that he had not been in custody at the time of the confession and that the confession was neither compelled nor involuntary despite the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, holding that the respondent\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">failure to claim the privilege when he was questioned was not fatal to his claim \u201c[bjecause of the compulsory nature of the meeting, because [the respondent] was under court order to respond truthfully to his agent\u2019s questions, and because the agent had substantial reason to believe that [the respondent\u2019s] answers were likely to be incriminating.\u201d [Murphy, 465 US at 425, quoting <em>State v Murphy, </em>324 NW2d 340, 344 (Minn, 1982) (first alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not necessary during the course of a routine probation interview, even when there is a connection between the probation officer-interviewer and the criminal investigative process. The Court rejected the proposition that the fact that the probation officer was consciously seeking incriminating evidence was relevant. <em>Murphy, </em>465 US at 431 (\u201c[T]he probation officer\u2019s knowledge and intent have no bearing on the outcome of this case.\u201d). The Court also rejected the argument that the respondent might have reasonably expected that his statements to the probation officer would remain confidential:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">[W]e cannot conclude that [the probation officer\u2019s] actions would have led a reasonable probationer to believe that his statements to her would remain confidential. A probationer cannot pretend ignorance of the fact that his probation officer \u201cis a peace officer, and as such is allied, to a greater or lesser extent, with his fellow peace offic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ers.\u201d ... The fact that [the respondent] apparently expressed no surprise on being informed that his statements would be made available to the police, moreover, strongly suggests that he was not misled by any expectation that his statements would remain confidential. <em>[Id. </em>at 432.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Finally, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation derives in large measure from an interrogator\u2019s insinuations that the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained. Since [the respondent] was not physically restrained and could have left the office, any compulsion he might have felt from the possibility that terminating the meeting would have led to revocation of probation was not comparable to the pressure on a suspect who is painfully aware that he literally cannot escape a persistent custodial interrogator. <em>[Id. </em>at 433 (citation omitted).][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Some courts have noted that a parole officer\u2019s questioning can be inherently more coercive than a law enforcement officer\u2019s questioning because the parole officer can put the parolee in prison more easily than can a police officer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, whatever the merits of this analysis, this concern does not exist to the same extent once the accused is <em>already </em>in jail for a parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>violation because the primary source of the parole officer\u2019s potential for coercion no longer exists. In this sense, a meeting <em>after </em>the accused has been arrested for violating his parole presents a less threatening situation than one conducted by a parole or probation officer before the accused has been arrested. In this case, defendant had already been given notice that his parole was being revoked and that he was in jail for that reason. Thus, no parole officer could threaten to put him in jail; he was already there. Moreover, this was not <em>his </em>parole officer. Defendant could not reasonably be under any illusions that Evans would have possessed any power to immediately free <em>or </em>detain him when he was not even her charge. As was the case in <em>Murphy, </em>there \u201cis no direct evidence that [defendant] confessed because he feared that his probation would be revoked if he remained silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. Similarly, defendant\u2019s request at the end of the meeting that the parole officer convey to the police that he wished to speak to them \u201cstrongly suggests that he was not misled by any expectation that his statements would remain confidential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">C. <em>ESTELLE v SMITH</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Unlike the dissent, we disagree that <em>Estelle v Smith, </em>451 US 454; 101 S Ct 1866; 68 L Ed 2d 359 (1981), is particularly \u201cinstructive\u201d with regard to the question at issue here-custody. <em>Post </em>at 333. Indeed, <em>Estelle </em>did not even address that issue. Instead, <em>Estelle </em>simply assumed that the respondent in that case was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes because he \u201cwas in custody at the Dallas County Jail when the examination was ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>and when it was conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. Moreover, since <em>Estelle </em>was decided, the Court has affirmatively held that prisoners are not invariably in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>See Fields, 565 US at _; 132 S Ct at 1190. Because <em>Estelle </em>predated <em>Fields </em>and thus did not engage in the analysis that <em>Fields </em>now requires in determining whether an accused/prisoner was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, we do not believe that <em>Estelle </em>is relevant with regard to whether defendant was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, which the dissent agrees is the controlling issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Moreover, <em>Estelle </em>is also significantly distinguishable because it involved a court-ordered psychiatric examination. In <em>Estelle, </em>the Court held that the admission of a psychiatrist\u2019s testimony to establish an element of proof necessary to support the imposition of capital punishment violated the respondent\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The psychiatrist\u2019s testimony related to a 90-minute pretrial competency examination that the psychiatrist had administered to the respondent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>phasized that the competency examination \u201cwas ordered even though defense counsel had not put into issue [the respondent\u2019s] competency to stand trial or his sanity at the time of the offense,\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>451 US at 457 n 1, and that this was a \u201ccompulsory examination,\u201d to which the respondent was \u201ccompelled to respond,\u201d yet \u201che was given no indication that the compulsory examination would be used to gather evidence necessary to decide whether, if convicted, he should be sentenced to death,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 467-468. The Court summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">To meet its burden, the State used respondent\u2019s own statements, unwittingly made without an awareness that he was assisting the State\u2019s efforts to obtain the death penalty. In these distinct circumstances, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Fifth Amendment privilege was implicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">A criminal defendant, who neither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce any psychiatric evidence, may not be <em>compelled to respond </em>to a psychiatrist if his statements can be used against him at a capital sentencing proceeding....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">. .. [U]nder <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>we must conclude that, when faced while in custody with a <em>court-ordered psychiatric inquiry, </em>respondent\u2019s statements to Dr. Grigson were not \u201cgiven freely and voluntarily without any compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>influences\u201d and, as such, could be used as the State did at the penalty phase only if respondent had been apprised of his rights and had knowingly decided to waive them. <em>[Id. </em>at 466, 468 (citation omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Unlike what occurred in <em>Estelle, </em>there was no court-ordered \u201ccompulsory examination\u201d to which defendant was \u201ccompelled to respond\u201d in this case. As a result, <em>Estelle </em>is wholly inapplicable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Neither an accused\u2019s right under <em>Miranda </em>to be given a series of warnings nor an accused\u2019s right under <em>Edwards </em>to have counsel present apply absent custodial interrogation. Because defendant was not subjected to custodial interrogation by the parole officer, even if she was a law enforcement officer, neither of those rights were violated, and thus the trial court did not err by admitting defendant\u2019s confession. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-8\">Kelly, Zahra and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> Defendant was adjudicated responsible as a juvenile in 1982 for assault and battery and in 1983 for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. In 1987, defendant pleaded guilty to minor in possession. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and in 1991, he pleaded guilty to three counts of assault and battery and one count of disturbing the peace. In that same year, he also pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and, when he violated probation, he was sent to prison. Also in 1991, in separate cases, he pleaded guilty to malicious destruction of property over $100 and malicious destruction of property under $100. In 1992, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor resisting a police officer and spent 20 days in jail. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to both possessing an open intoxicant and urinating in public.

Rather, he simply argues that defendant did not have the right to have counsel present during his meeting with Evans. Because we agree, we also do not address waiver in this opinion. That is, unlike the dissenting opinion, we conclude that because the parole officer did not subject defendant to custodial interrogation, defendant had no right to counsel dining his meeting with the parole officer. Because we conclude that defendant had no right to counsel to waive, we do not need to address the concurring opinion\u2019s conclusion that defendant waived that right. The dissenting opinion would broaden the concept of custodial interrogation and thereby ensure that in some unknown number of future cases, voluntary confessions such as that which occurred in this very case, would be rendered inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\"> Although we agree with the dissent that defendant \u201ccould not be subjected to further <em>custodial interrogation </em>about the robbery until counsel had been made available to him or he initiated communication,\u201d <em>post </em>at 325-326 (emphasis added), we disagree that \u201cEvans\u2019s interview of defendant about the robbery [cannot] be viewed as noncustodial because custody, for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>was not broken between the initial interrogation by the police and Evans\u2019s subsequent questioning three days later,\u201d <em>post </em>at 326. For all of the reasons set forth in this opinion, we believe that defendant\u2019s meeting with the parole officer cannot be viewed as the same as his meeting with the police in terms of constituting \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d Further, however, we believe it is clear that these constituted entirely distinct episodes, distinct in terms of when they occurred, distinct in terms of their participants, distinct in terms of who was doing the interrogation, distinct in terms of their venue, distinct in terms of their subject matter and purpose, distinct in terms of their coercive aspects, and distinct in terms of the overall environment in which they took place. That <em>one </em>of these episodes can be characterized as involving custodial interrogation carries no particular significance in terms of whether the <em>other </em>can be similarly characterized, as it must be, before defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights are implicated. Although, by treating these distinct episodes as part of a \u201ccontinuing\u201d sequence of events that \u201cnever ceased\u201d the dissent can impute the attributes of one meeting to the other meeting, we do not believe this accurately describes the relationship between the events. Indeed, the dissent itself acknowledges that the police \u201cstopped questioning\u201d defendant when he invoked his right to have counsel present, and the dissent identifies no reason why the custodial interrogation that existed during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the meeting with the police should necessarily be thought to carry over to the meeting with the parole officer.

I believe that the Court of Appeals correctly reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial.

While the nature of the relationship between the questioner and the defendant may inform the determination of whether custodial interrogation occurred, it is not the lynchpin of the analysis. However, because I conclude in this case that defendant was subject to custodial interrogation by the parole officer, I disagree with the majority that his statements to her were admissible at trial.

APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Because the majority correctly sets forth much of the applicable law and determines that custodial interrogation is the decisive issue, I turn right to the case at hand: Did the circumstances surrounding parole officer Cheryl Evans\u2019s questioning of defendant amount to custodial interrogation, making his statements inadmissible at his later trial for the robbery because the interrogation violated <em>Miranda v </em>Arizona<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Edwards v Arizona,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in light of defendant\u2019s prior request for counsel? Unlike the majority, I conclude that the answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">A. DEFENDANT\u2019S INITIAL ARREST AND INTERROGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Like the parties, the majority does not dispute that the initial police interrogation concerning the robbery for which defendant was convicted constituted custodial interrogation to which <em>Miranda </em>applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor can that conclusion be seriously questioned. Defendant was arrested and taken to jail, depriving him of his freedom of movement, and he was subjected to the precise \u201cstation house questioning\u201d by police officers that was found to be inherently coercive in <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The officers were thus obligated to, and did, give defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Because <em>Miranda </em>applied, defendant\u2019s request for counsel triggered <em>Edwards, </em>and he could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>be subjected to further custodial interrogation about the robbery until counsel had been made available to him or he initiated communication. The detectives honored his request, stopped questioning him, and according to Smith, even told Evans that defendant had invoked his right to counsel before she interviewed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">B. DEPENDANT WAS SUBJECT TO CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION WHEN EVANS QUESTIONED HIM</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">This leaves one issue: whether Evans\u2019s questioning of defendant three days later violated <em>Edwards. </em>I disagree with the majority that Evans\u2019s interview of defendant about the robbery can be viewed as noncustodial because custody, for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>was not broken between the initial interrogation by the police and Evans\u2019s subsequent questioning three days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">1. EDWARDS, NOT <em>FIELDS, </em>CONTROLS HERE</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">I conclude that Evans\u2019s interview with defendant violated <em>Edwards </em>because the custodial environment established at the initial police interview never ceased, and defendant did not initiate this conversation. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Maryland v Shatzer </em>described the \u201cparadigm <em>Edwards </em>case\u201d as one in which \u201cthe suspect has been arrested for a particular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial custody while that crime is being actively investigated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While defendant was technically arrested for violating his parole, the custodial interrogation that immediately followed his arrest indisputably involved the gas station robbery. Thus, that defendant was not initially arrested for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>robbery is of no moment. As in other paradigmatic <em>Edwards </em>cases described in <em>Shatzer, </em>defendant never \u201cregained a sense of control or normalcy\u201d after he was \u201cinitially taken into custody for the crime under investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, just as in <em>Edwards, </em>defendant made the inculpatory statements at issue three days after his initial police interview, during which everyone agrees he invoked his right to counsel while confined to the local jail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">These facts stand in stark contrast to those of the defendants in <em>Shatzer </em>and <em>Fields, </em>who were both serving sentences for unrelated crimes and living in the prison in which they were interviewed. In those cases, the defendants were interviewed in their \u201caccustomed surroundings,\u201d and when returned to the general prison population they simply resumed their \u201cdaily routine.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, defendant did not live at the Jackson County Jail. The majority asserts that defendant \u201ccould not be considered anything other than a \u2018prisoner,\u2019 as were the defendants in <em>Fields </em>and Shatzer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That argument is untenable given the similarities between this case and the paradigmatic <em>Edwards </em>case and the significant differences between this case and <em>Shatzer </em>and <em>Fields. </em>Defendant had not been placed back into his \u201cnormal\u201d correctional facility environment, although he might legally have been a \u201cprisoner\u201d due to his parole status.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, and most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>important, it is not in dispute that he was not placed in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes for violating parole, but rather so that the police could interrogate him about the robbery. In short, it is unclear the extent to which <em>Shatzer </em>and <em>Fields </em>apply outside the context of prison inmates incarcerated on an unrelated charge and interviewed somewhere within the correctional facility that serves as their day-to-day home. But it is clear to me that here <em>Edwards, </em>and not <em>Fields, </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Further, the custodial environment established during the initial police interview was not broken merely because it was a parole officer rather than a police officer who later questioned defendant about the same subject. First, the relationship between the questioner and the offender is not decisive. Second, Evans questioned defendant about the very crime for which he was previously questioned by the police officers and had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s prior assertion of his right to counsel was still in effect when Evans interviewed him in the jail library. Because he did not initiate that discussion, it was in violation of <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Some of the facts relied on by the majority to support its position, in fact, further illustrate why this case is governed by <em>Edwards </em>and not <em>Fields. </em>For example, the majority notes that, as in <em>Fields, </em>defendant here was not free to leave the jail library by himself and roam free. But the significance of that fact in <em>Fields </em>was to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s freedom of movement was curtailed <em>all the time </em>because he lived in a prison as a result of a prior conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>words, being unable to roam free was the defendant\u2019s normal life, which inherently made that restriction less coercive. By contrast, before his arrest and custodial interrogation by the police three days earlier, defendant\u2019s freedom of movement was not restricted by daily incarceration. While the facts of <em>Fields </em>may be similar on this point, their legal significance is not.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">2. EVEN UNDER <em>FIELDS, </em>CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION OCCURRED</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Even assuming that the majority is correct that defendant\u2019s ongoing <em>Miranda/Edwards </em>status was irrelevant and the <em>Fields </em>framework is applicable here instead, and I firmly believe it is not, a comparison between the facts of this case and <em>Fields </em>demonstrates that defendant was subjected to custodial interrogation. As in <em>Fields, </em>defendant did not invite the interview with Evans or consent to it in advance and he was not advised that he was free to decline to speak with Evans. Unlike in <em>Fields, </em>however, defendant in this case was not told that he was free to leave. Notably, the <em>Fields </em>majority cited the fact that the defendant in that case was told he was free to leave as the \u201c[m]ost important\u201d factor in its determination that the defendant was not in custody.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court went to the trouble to repeat its emphasis on this factor as \u201cespecially\u201d important at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>end of its opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, I disagree with the majority that this fact is neither controlling nor particularly compelling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The majority believes that defendant\u2019s parolee status itself is relevant to the freedom of movement inquiry because it makes him more familiar with law enforcement and the type of environment in which he was interviewed. However, given that <em>Miranda </em>requires an analysis of whether \u201cin light of \u2018the <em>objective </em>circumstances of the interrogation,\u2019 a \u2018reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s <em>subjective </em>beliefs about his freedom of movement are irrelevant. As the United States Supreme Court has held, \u201ca suspect\u2019s prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I see no distinction between a defendant\u2019s prior history with law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and his parolee status. A parolee is a parolee <em>because of </em>his or her prior history with law enforcement. That \u201cinquiry turns too much on the suspect\u2019s subjective state of mind and not enough on the \u2018objective circumstances of the interrogation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Also in critical contrast to <em>Fields, </em>when defendant was questioned by Evans, he indisputably had asserted his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Fields, who had been incarcerated for some time for some other unrelated offense and presumably had become acclimated with his incarceration, was not previously questioned about the subject of his interrogation, nor had he therefore previously asserted his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Irrespective of the reason for defendant\u2019s initial arrest, defendant here had been continually incarcerated during the three days after the police had questioned him and he had invoked his right to counsel. The effect of this difference is hard to underestimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Because a reasonable person faced with these objective circumstances would not have felt at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave, the first part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the <em>Miranda </em>inquiry is satisfied. I also conclude that Evans\u2019s interview with defendant presented the \u201csame inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in Miranda\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> even if it is considered as a discrete event distinct from defendant\u2019s initial custodial interrogation. Defendant was summoned to the jail library and was given no indication that he could decline to attend or leave the interview at any time. He was interviewed about the basis for his parole violations by Evans, the person serving as his parole officer for purposes of their meeting and with whom defendant had a prior relationship.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Perhaps most importantly, defendant had already been advised that he had a right to counsel before answering questions about the robbery, had taken that invitation up and requested counsel, but had not yet been provided counsel when he found himself questioned again about the same subject. Finally, Evans plainly had \u201cauthority to affect the duration of his sentence,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as she was present at the jail to serve parole violation charges on defendant that could undoubtedly affect the amount of time defendant spent incarcerated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under these cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>cumstances, the interview subjected defendant to inherently coercive pressures for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>Accordingly, Evans\u2019s interview with defendant constituted its own custodial interrogation even under the <em>Fields </em>framework on which the majority relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><em>Estelle v Smith </em>is also instructive in determining whether Evans\u2019s interview with defendant constituted its own custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In that case, a psychiatrist interviewed the defendant in jail to evaluate the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The United States Supreme Court held that the state could not introduce the defendant\u2019s statements or the psychiatrist\u2019s conclusions, which were based on those statements. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he considerations calling for the accused to be warned prior to custodial interrogation apply with no less force to the pretrial psychiatric examination at issue here.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The <em>Estelle </em>Court further observed that the defendant was in custody when the examination was conducted, and noted that the fact that he was questioned by a psychiatrist designated by the trial court to conduct a neutral competency examination, rather than by a police officer, government informant, or prosecuting attorney, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cimmaterial.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The crucial inquiry, rather, was the role the psychiatrist played at the defendant\u2019s trial, which included testifying for the prosecution on the crucial issue of respondent\u2019s future dangerousness. In providing that testimony, the Court ruled, \u201chis role changed and became essentially like that of an agent of the State recounting unwarned statements made in a postarrest custodial setting.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">It is not disputed that defendant was in physical custody when Evans conducted the interview, that his interrogation was related to the robbery, or that he had previously asserted his Fifth Amendment right to counsel when questioned by police about the same subject. The role Evans played at the time of the interview is \u201cimmaterial\u201d per Estelle.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The significant issue about Evans\u2019s role is the one she played at defendant\u2019s trial when she was directly adversarial to defendant; she testified that he made statements admitting to the robbery at issue, which were presented as substantive evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, and the prosecution referred to her as \u201cprobably the most crucial\u201d witness. Just like in <em>Estelle, </em>regardless of her previous role in collecting defendant\u2019s statement in the first place, by providing such testimony, Evans\u2019s \u201crole changed and became essentially like that of an agent of the State\u201d recounting statements obtained in violation of <em>Edwards.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">II. WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Chief Justice joins the majority\u2019s result on the basis that defendant waived his Fifth Amendment right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to counsel by initiating further communication with the police. I respectfully disagree with his waiver argument for three reasons. First, I do not believe and I know of no authority to support, the proposition that <em>Miranda </em>can be circumvented by an ex post facto waiver analysis when defendant, having asserted his right to counsel, did not in fact initiate the subsequent conversation in which the incriminating statements were made.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is undisputed that defendant did not initiate the interview with Evans. Second, the prosecution never made a waiver argument, in this Court or in the lower courts. Third, defendant\u2019s alleged letter appears nowhere in the record and there is no evidence the police ever actually received it, so I would not rely solely on Evans\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s statement about sending a letter in order to find waiver here.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I would hold that the custodial environment established during defendant\u2019s initial police interview as well as his invocation of his right to counsel remained in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>time Evans interviewed him. Because defendant did not initiate the interview with Evans, the admission of Evans\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s statements to her violated <em>Edwards. </em>Alternatively, I would hold that Evans\u2019s questioning of defendant constituted its own custodial interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that defendant\u2019s statements to Evans were inadmissible and should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding this case for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with McCormack, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> See <em>People v Elliott, </em>295 Mich App 623, 633; 815 NW2d 575 (2012) (\u201c[I]t is not disputed that defendant\u2019s June 18, 2010, police interrogation constituted a custodial interrogation under Miranda.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> <em>Howes v Fields, </em>565 US _, _; 132 S Ct 1181, 1190; 182 L Ed 2d 17 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> <em>Maryland v Shatzer, </em>559 US 98, 106; 130 S Ct 1213; 175 L Ed 2d 1045 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-5\"> <em>Id. </em>at 107.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\"> See <em>id. </em>(describing the facts in <em>Edwards).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> See <em>ante </em>at 314.

First, that quote appears nowhere in the <em>Fields </em>discussion of the freedom-of-movement inquiry; rather, it is mentioned in the discussion of whether \u201cimprisonment alone,\u201d i.e., <em>when the deprivation of freedom of movement is already established, </em>is sufficient to create a custodial situation within the meaning <em>o\u00ed Miranda. </em>Second, the quotation only establishes that the questioner\u2019s power over the <em>defendant </em>is relevant. It does not make relevant whether a reasonable parolee would know that his parole officer \u201chas no control over the jail, its staff, or the individuals incarcerated there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b430-4\"> <em>Fields, </em>565 US at _; 132 S Ct at 1190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b430-5\"> The majority attaches great significance to the fact that Evans was not defendant\u2019s regular parole officer.
