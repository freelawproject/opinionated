We hold, consistent with traditional definitions of the term \u201cdomicile\u201d under the common law and as that term is used in MCL 500.3114(1), that a child of divorced parents has only one domicile at any given point in time. Further, in the event that the child\u2019s parents are divorced and a family court has entered an order relating to custody, we hold, consistent with the common law of domicile as it pertains to minors and the legally binding nature of custody orders, that the child\u2019s domicile is established by operation of law and that the custody order is thus determinative of the child\u2019s domicile for all purposes, including the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In both <em>Grange </em>and <em>ACIA, </em>the respective judgment of divorce and custody order conclusively established the minor children\u2019s domiciles. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Grange, </em>which erroneously held that a minor of divorced parents can have two domiciles, and we remand to the circuit court for entry of summary disposition in favor of Grange Insurance Company. In <em>ACIA, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which erred by concluding that a question of fact existed regarding the child\u2019s domicile, and we remand to the circuit court for entry of summary disposition in favor of ACIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\">A. <em>GRANGE v LAWRENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Edward Lawrence and Laura Rosinski were married in 1997 and had two daughters, Katelyn and Josalyn, the latter of whom is the deceased insured in this case. Lawrence and Rosinski divorced in 2005; Rosinski remained in the marital home and Lawrence moved into his parents\u2019 home, both located in Muskegon, Michigan. The judgment of divorce granted Lawrence and Rosinski joint legal custody of Josalyn and Katelyn, but Rosinski was given \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d of the girls. The judgment of divorce provided Lawrence with frequent parenting time, including alternating weekends, Wednesday evenings, alternating holidays, liberal phone contact, and liberal parenting time when Rosinski was unavailable. The judgment of divorce further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">A parent whose custody or parenting time of a child is governed by this order, shall not change the legal residence of the child except in compliance with [MCL 722.31], which prohibits moving a child out of the State of Michigan or greater than 100 miles from the non-custodial parent without a court order. The party awarded custody must notify the Friend of the Court, in writing, immediately, when the minor child is moved to another address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On September 24, 2009, eight-year-old Josalyn was a passenger in a car owned and driven by Rosinski when another driver ignored a stop sign and hit Rosinski\u2019s vehicle, resulting in fatal injuries to Josalyn. Rosinski and Lawrence were appointed as joint personal representatives of Josalyn\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>After the accident, Rosinski and Lawrence submitted claims for personal injury protection (PIP) insurance benefits to their respective insurers. Rosinski was the named insured on an automobile insurance policy provided by Farm Bureau General Insurance Company of Michigan (Farm Bureau); Lawrence was the named insured on an automobile insurance policy provided by Grange Insurance Company (Grange). Farm Bureau insured the car that was involved in the accident and Grange did not insure any vehicle involved in the accident. With regard to Rosinski\u2019s claim, Farm Bureau paid more than $30,000 in PIP benefits for Josalyn\u2019s injuries and death; Grange denied Lawrence\u2019s claim for PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Subsequently, Farm Bureau asserted that Grange was in the same order of priority for the payment of PIP benefits because, in its view, Josalyn was \u201cdomiciled\u201d in both parents\u2019 homes pursuant to MCL 500.3114(1); Farm Bureau thus sought from Grange partial reimbursement of benefits pursuant to MCL 500.3115(2). Grange denied the claim and filed a complaint for declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that Josalyn was domiciled with Rosinski, not Lawrence, at the time of the accident. Grange asserted that it was not required to reimburse Farm Bureau for any of the PIP benefits that Farm Bureau had paid because Josalyn was not \u201cdomiciled\u201d with Lawrence at the time of the accident as required by MCL 500.3114(1), and Michigan law does not recognize dual domiciles. Grange further asserted that it was not obligated to pay PIP benefits for Josalyn\u2019s injuries because Josalyn was not a named insured under its policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Farm Bureau filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that Josalyn was domiciled with each of her parents at the time of the accident and that Farm Bureau was entitled to partial reimbursement of the PIP benefits it had paid. Farm Bureau also argued that the Grange policy conflicted with the no-fault act by excluding Josalyn as an insured through its automatic attribution of domicile to the residence of the custodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Both insurance companies filed motions for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10) and the circuit court granted summary disposition to Farm Bureau. Applying the factors that are traditionally used to determine domicile under the no-fault act as set forth in <em>Workman v Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange</em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>Dairyland Insurance Co v Auto-Owners Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the circuit court concluded that Josalyn had two domiciles at the time of the accident, one with each parent. The circuit court thus ordered Grange to reimburse Farm Bureau for 50 percent of the PIP benefits Farm Bureau had paid and 50 percent of Farm Bureau\u2019s processing expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Grange appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals rejected Grange\u2019s argument that Michigan law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>does not recognize dual domiciles for a minor child of divorced parents because, according to the panel, \u201c[t]he Michigan Supreme Court has . .. determined ... for purposes of the no-fault act, [that] the terms \u2018domicile\u2019 and \u2018residence\u2019 are \u2018legally synonymous\u2019 \u201d and \u201cnothing in MCL 500.3114(1) . . . limits a minor child of divorced parents to one domicile or defines domicile as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After applying the domicile factors from <em>Workman </em>and <em>Dairyland, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that the undisputed evidence established that Josalyn resided with both parents. Regarding the effect of the judgment of divorce, which established primary physical custody with Rosinski, the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cthat order does not change the fact that the evidence showed that Josalyn actually resided with both her parents, which is the relevant inquiry under the no-fault act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also held that Grange\u2019s policy was invalid because the policy, which requires a court adjudication of custody to be conclusive for determining a child\u2019s principal residence, would limit Grange\u2019s \u201cobligation where the no-fault act does not... .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Grange sought leave to appeal, which this Court granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>B. <em>ACIA V STATE FARM</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In this case, Sarah is the minor child fatally injured in a motor vehicle accident. Sarah\u2019s parents, Francis Campanelli and Tina Taylor, were divorced in Michigan in 1995. The original judgment of divorce granted joint legal custody of Sarah and her sister, Ashley, to both parents and \u201cphysical custody\u201d to Campanelli, allowing Taylor only reasonable visitation. Additionally, the judgment of divorce contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">DOMICILE OF THE MINOR CHILDREN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">The domicile or residence of said minor children shall not be removed from the State of Michigan without the prior approval of the Court, and that [Campanelli] shall promptly notify the Friend of the Court whenever said children Eire moved to Emother address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">A little more than a year after the family court granted the judgment of divorce, Campanelli secured a job in Tennessee that offered a considerable improvement in his career. He moved the family court to modify the original judgment of divorce and successfully obtained an order in February 1996, as the custodial parent, permitting him to change the children\u2019s domicile to the state of Tennessee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the terms of that order, Taylor was entitled to six weeks of visitation in the summer, and Campanelli and Taylor were to alternate the one-week Easter, Christmas, and winter school vacations. The February 1996 order did not otherwise modify either the joint legal custody originally granted to both parents or the physical custody awarded to Campanelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In 2007, when Sarah was 16-years-old, she went to Michigan to stay for the summer with her mother, who lived with Sarah\u2019s great-uncle, Terry Gravelle, in Howell, Michigan. During the time that she lived with her mother, Sarah decided that she wanted to get to know Taylor better and, with Campanelli\u2019s permission, remained in Michigan with her mother and attended high school that fall.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On November 26, 2007, Sarah was a passenger in a car driven by her friend, Kayla, and insured by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Kayla lost control of the car, which careened off the road and into a tree, resulting in what would ultimately be fatal injuries to Sarah. The severe injuries Sarah sustained required medical care. Automobile Club Insurance Association (ACIA), as the insurer of Sarah\u2019s uncle, Gravelle, in whose household Sarah resided, paid Sarah\u2019s medical bills during the period before her death.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ACIA commenced an action in the circuit court to secure determinations that (1) Sarah was not \u201cdomiciled\u201d in Michigan, (2) ACIA, therefore, was not responsible for Sarah\u2019s PIP benefits under MCL 500.3114(1), and (3) State Farm, as the insurer of the vehicle in which Sarah was a passenger when she was injured, was the responsible insurer pursuant to the no-fault priority provision of MCL 500.3114(4). State Farm denied liability and both providers filed cross-motions for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The circuit court granted summary disposition in favor of State Farm, finding that Sarah \u201chad residency in Michigan with her mother and her uncle at the time of the motor vehicle accident.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The circuit court noted the conflicting testimony on the issue of Sarah\u2019s intent to return to Tennessee, but then concluded that the record reflected a \u201clack of evidence of a clear intent to return to Tennessee . ...\u201d In support, the circuit court cited the absence of any definite actions by Sarah to withdraw from school in Michigan and reenroll in school in Tennessee, coupled with indications that Sarah regarded her mother\u2019s residence as her own. Accordingly, because the circuit court found that Sarah was domiciled in Michigan, it ruled that ACIA was responsible for Sarah\u2019s PIP benefits under MCL 500.3114(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the evidence of Sarah\u2019s domicile, and in particular her intent, presented a question of fact for resolution by the jury and that summary disposition was, thus, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>proper for either party.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also rejected ACIA\u2019s argument that the judgment of divorce and subsequent February 1996 order modifying domicile conclusively established Sarah\u2019s domicile for all purposes. According to the panel, the family court \u201cdid not determine Sarah\u2019s domicile for the purpose of insurance coverage, and there is no authority that suggests that [the circuit court in the insurance dispute] was required to adopt the ruling of different jurisdictions deciding the issue for a different purpose for different parties.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">State Farm applied to this Court for leave to appeal and ACIA filed a response to that application, as well as a cross-application. We ordered argument on whether to grant the applications or take other action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">II. STANDARD of review</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">This Court reviews de novo a decision to grant or deny a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10) is appropriately granted where no genuine issue of material fact remains and the moving party is entitled to judgment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>a matter of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A domicile determination is generally a question of fact; however, where the underlying material facts are not in dispute, the determination of domicile is a question of law for the circuit court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We likewise review de novo issues of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Michigan\u2019s no-fault act generally abolishes tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, insurance companies are required to provide first party insurance benefits for accidental bodily injury arising out of the use of a motor vehicle, which are commonly referred to as personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In this regard, MCL 500.3114(1), which is at the center of the litigation in both these cases, provides the general rule for determining which Michigan insurer is liable to provide PIP benefits. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">[A] personal protection insurance policy described in [MCL 500.3101(1)] applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either <em>domiciled in the same household, </em>if the injury arises from a motor vehicle accident.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In these cases, the parties dispute whether the injured individual was a relative of the insured who was \u201cdomiciled in the same household\u201d as the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In the instance that more than one insurer\u2019s policy is applicable to the injured person under this provision, then the priority provision of MCL 500.3115(2) is triggered and may allow an insurer to recoup benefits from other insurer(s) of equal priority.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This is the legal situation in <em>Grange, </em>wherein the lower courts held that Josalyn had two \u201cdomiciles\u201d within the meaning of MCL 500.3114(1) \u2014 one with Lawrence insured by Grange and another with Rosinski insured by Farm Bureau. Pursuant to MCL 500.3115(2), the lower courts thus concluded that Grange is an insurer of equal priority with Farm Bureau, thereby entitling Farm Bureau to partial recoupment of the PIP benefits that it had paid on Josalyn\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Comparatively, in some instances no insurer\u2019s PIP policy is applicable to the injured person under MCL 500.3114(1) because the person is not \u201cthe person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, [or] a relative of either domiciled in the same household ....\u201d In this event, MCL 500.3114(4) may apply such that the insurer of the accident vehicle is liable for PIP benefits to the occupant of a motor vehicle. MCL 500.3114(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Except as provided in [MCL 500.3114(1)-MCL 500.3114(3)], a person suffering accidental bodily injury arising from a motor vehicle accident while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">(b) The insurer of the operator of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">This is the legal posture of <em>ACIA, </em>where the dispute involves whether Sarah was \u201cdomiciled with a relative\u201d in Michigan for the purposes of MCL 500.3114(1), or instead, whether MCL 500.3114(4) applies. The circuit court concluded that Sarah was domiciled in Michigan, thus making ACIA, the insurer of Sarah\u2019s uncle with whom she resided in Michigan, liable for PIP benefits rather than State Farm, the insurer of the accident vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The pivotal inquiry in both these insurance-coverage disputes, then, turns on the interpretation of the term \u201cdomiciled\u201d as it is used in MCL 500.3114(1). Mainly, the meaning of \u201cdomicile,\u201d and specifically how a child\u2019s domicile is determined, will dictate the ultimate determination of which insurer is liable for PIP benefits in each case. Our inquiry first addresses the preliminary issue raised only in <em>Grange: </em>whether a child of divorced parents injured in a motor vehicle accident can be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in more than one household for purposes of the no-fault act. We next consider the question posed in both <em>Grange </em>and <em>ACIA: </em>whether a family court order pertaining to a child\u2019s custody conclusively establishes a child\u2019s domicile under the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">A. DOMICILE AND THE NO-FAULT ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Notably, the no-fault act does not define the term \u201cdomiciled.\u201d The unambiguous language of MCL 500.3114(1) simply states that \u201ca personal protection insurance policy . . . applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either <em>domiciled </em>in the same house<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>hold . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When construing this statutory language, our main objective is to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent through the language plainly expressed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Normally, this Court will accord an undefined statutory term its ordinary and commonly used meaning.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, where the Legislature uses a technical word that has acquired a particular meaning in the law, and absent any contrary legislative indication, we construe it \u201caccording to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The term \u201cdomicile\u201d is just such a word that has a precise, technical meaning in Michigan\u2019s common law, and thus must be understood according to that particular meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">For over 165 years, Michigan courts have defined \u201cdomicile\u201d to mean \u201cthe place where a person has his true, fixed, permanent home, and principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Similarly, a person\u2019s domicile has been defined to be \u201c \u2018that place where a person has voluntarily fixed his abode not for a mere special or temporary purpose, but with a present intention of making it his home, either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In this regard, the Court has recognized that \u201c[i]t may be laid down as a settled maxim that every man must have such a national domicile somewhere. It is equally well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>settled <em>that no person can have more than one such domicile, at one and the same </em>time.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> From this settled principle, it follows that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">a man retains his domicile of origin [upon his birth] until he changes it, by acquiring another; and so each successive domicile continues, until changed by acquiring another. And it is equally obvious that the acquisition of a new domicile does, at the same instant, terminate the preceding one.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In this way, our common law has recognized that from the time of a person\u2019s birth \u2014 from childhood through adulthood \u2014 a person can only have a single domicile at any given point in time. Indeed, there are few legal axioms as established as the one providing that every person has a domicile, and that a person may have one \u2014 and <em>only </em>one \u2014 domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In furtherance of this understanding of domicile, the common law has necessarily distinguished between the concepts of \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">The former, in its ordinary acceptation, was defined to be, \u2018A place where a person lives or has his home,\u2019 while \u2018[a]ny place of abode or dwelling place,\u2019 however temporary it might have been, was said to constitute a residence. A person\u2019s domicile was his legal residence or home in contemplation of law.[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Stated more succinctly, a person may have only one domicile, but more than one residence.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> For purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>distinguishing \u201cdomicile\u201d from \u201cresidence,\u201d this Court has explained that \u201cdomicile is acquired by the combination of residence and the intention to reside in a given place .... If the intention of permanently residing in a place exists, a residence in pursuance of that intention, however short, will establish a domicile.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The traditional common-law inquiry into a person\u2019s \u201cdomicile,\u201d then, is generally a question of intent, but also considers all the facts and circumstances taken together.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Returning to the language of MCL 500.3114(1), there is no indication that the Legislature intended to deviate from this well established common-law meaning of the term \u201cdomicile.\u201d And, because a person, from the moment of his birth onward, can only have one domicile within the traditional meaning of that term, it follows that a child, regardless of his parents\u2019 marital status or his multiple legal residences, may also have only one domicile at any given point in time.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Indeed, rather than there being any indication that the Legislature intended to deviate from this common-law rule, there is, in fact, evidence that the Legislature <em>favored </em>this single-location rule. Had the Legislature intended to make insurers liable for PIP benefits for dual coexisting \u201cdomiciles,\u201d then it would have used the term \u201cresided,\u201d not \u201cdomiciled,\u201d because, as previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>explained, a person may have more than one residence at a time, but only one domicile. However, the Legislature instead expressly chose to use the more restrictive term, \u201cdomiciled,\u201d thereby limiting the universe of insurers that are potentially liable under MCL 500.3114(1). In fact, the Legislature specifically rejected use of the term \u201cresidence,\u201d as used in the uniform act on which the no-fault act is modeled, in favor of the term \u201cdomiciled\u201d in defining those eligible for PIP benefits under MCL 500.3114(1).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Legislature thus affirmatively chose a term that it knew had a particular meaning, and we must accord this legislative choice its full weight when determining the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Therefore, given the absence of any indication that the Legislature intended a contrary meaning, the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cdomiciled,\u201d evinces an intent to incorporate all those common-law legal concepts related to that term, including the law of domicile as it relates to minors more fully addressed below. Accordingly, consistent with the traditional common-law principle that a person may have only one domicile at a given point in time, we hold that a child, whose parents are divorced and who has more than one legal residence, may have only a single domicile at any one point in time that continues until the child acquires a different one.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Farm Bureau, however, suggests that we should reach the opposite conclusion \u2014 that a child of divorced parents who has two legal residences may also have two coexisting domiciles, one with each parent. In support, Farm Bureau, like the Court of Appeals in <em>Grange, </em>asserts that our decision in <em>Workman </em>specifically recognized \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cdomicile\u201d to be legally synonymous for purposes of MCL 500.3114(1), meaning that, just as a person can have more than one residence, a person can also have more than one \u201cdomicile.\u201d In <em>Workman, </em>the seminal case in which we interpreted the phrase \u201cdomiciled in the same household\u201d as used in MCL 500.3114(1), we considered whether the claimant, the insured\u2019s adult daughter-in-law, was domiciled in the same household as the insured. After noting that no caselaw interpreted the phrase, \u201cdomiciled in the same household,\u201d we articulated a flexible multi-factor test to aid courts in determining domicile, in which no one factor is determinative.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The factors to be considered included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">(1) the subjective or declared intent of the person of remaining, either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time, in the place he contends is his \u201cdomicile\u201d or \u201chousehold; (2) the formality or informality of the relationship between the person and the members of the household; (3) whether the place where the person lives is in the same house, within the same curtilage or upon the same premises, (4) the existence of another place of lodging by the person alleging \u201cresidence\u201d or \u201cdomicile\u201d in the household ... <em>.[</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>In articulating this test, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">Although the statutory language of [MCL 500.3114(1)] refers to persons <em>\u201cdomiciled </em>in the same household\u201d as an insured, we believe this body of law [that deals with the question of whether a person is a \u2018resident\u2019 of an insured\u2019s \u2018household\u2019 under particular insurance policies,] is analytically applicable to the consideration before us. We conclude this because, in this state, <em>the terms \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d are legally synonymous (except in special circumstances)[</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">It is this final phrase \u2014 \u201cthe terms \u2018domicile\u2019 and \u2018residence\u2019 are legally synonymous\u201d \u2014 on which Farm Bureau and the Court of Appeals rely. This statement, however, when read in context of the entire opinion, does not stand for the proposition that domicile is the equivalent of residence under MCL 500.3114(1). Rather, <em>Workman </em>merely acknowledged that, generally, \u201cresidence\u201d has sometimes been given the equivalent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>meaning of \u201cdomicile.\u201d <em>Workman </em>did not, however, establish that interpretation as an absolute rule. Indeed, this point is bolstered by the cases <em>Workman </em>cites in support of its statement that \u201cthe terms \u2018domicile\u2019 and \u2018residence\u2019 are legally synonymous.\u201d <em>Workman </em>first cited to <em>Gluc v </em>Klein,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> where this Court recognized the traditional common-law distinction between \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cdomicile,\u201d but noted that sometimes the Legislature has given residence the same meaning as domicile. We later made the same point in both <em>Hartzler v </em>Radeka<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and <em>Reaume &amp; Silloway, Inc v Tetzlaff.</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Further, the two cases <em>Workman </em>cited as \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d in which \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d <em>are not </em>synonymous both involved determining a minor\u2019s domicile for purposes of applying relevant statutes.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">However, the corollary \u2014 that domicile has sometimes been given the same meaning as residence \u2014 is simply not true. This Court has never interpreted \u201cdomicile\u201d to be the equivalent of \u201cresidence,\u201d as demonstrated by the cases <em>Workman </em>cites and the preceding discussion regarding the common-law meaning of domicile. Indeed, <em>Workman </em>itself cannot reasonably be interpreted to advocate such a conclusion, given that <em>Workman </em>adopts a multifactor domicile test that is analytically the same as the traditional domicile test employed for more than a century at common law. Stated otherwise, <em>Workman </em>is entirely consistent with our conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>that the term \u201cdomicile\u201d is to be interpreted the same as its common-law meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Our holding thus clarifies, that to the extent that <em>Workman </em>has been understood to imply that \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d retain no independent significance for the purposes of the no-fault act, such a conclusion is not valid and that \u201cdomicile\u201d must be understood consistent with its historical underpinnings. Further, although <em>Workman </em>recognized that \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d are often used interchangeably by the Legislature in other contexts and, therefore described the terms as synonymous in those situations, <em>Workman </em>also explained that it is often necessary to distinguish between the terms consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent, as in the instant case.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Grange </em>therefore erred by interpreting <em>Workman </em>to mean that domicile is the equivalent of residence and that a minor child can be \u201cdomiciled\u201d for purposes of MCL 500.3114(1) in multiple residences.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Neither <em>Workman </em>nor the plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>guage of MCL 500.3114(1) support this conclusion. The Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Grange, </em>and Farm Bureau\u2019s adherence to that position, is plainly inconsistent with our jurisprudence regarding the meaning of \u201cdomicile\u201d and the clear language of MCL 500.3114(1) which, as we have explained, incorporates the common-law meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">B. DETERMINING A CHILD\u2019S DOMICILE</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Our holding, that a child may have only one domicile at any one time consistent with traditional common-law principles, does not establish how a child\u2019s single domicile is determined. <em>Workman </em>and its progeny applying the traditional domicile test defined domicile in relation to an adult but, for reasons that we will explain, these factors are not helpful in determining a child\u2019s domicile. To resolve how a child\u2019s domicile is determined \u2014 and given our conclusion that the Legislature intended that the term \u201cdomiciled,\u201d as used in MCL 500.3114(1), be interpreted consistent with its common-law meaning \u2014 we further consider the law of domicile as it pertains to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">i. THE COMMON LAW OF DOMICILE PERTAINING TO MINORS</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Our common law recognizes three means of acquiring a domicile, which are generally applicable to all persons depending on the factual circumstances, including: (1) domicile of origin or of nativity; (2) domicile of choice; and (3) domicile by operation of law.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> A domicile of origin or of nativity is established when a person is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>born, fulfilling the maxim that every person has a domicile from the time of birth.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Meanwhile, a domicile by choice occurs when a person replaces his current domicile by choosing another, consistent with the proposition that every person must have a domicile until a new domicile is determined. Finally, a domicile by operation of law occurs when a person with a legal disability lacks the capacity to acquire a domicile of choice, and thus the domicile is established by operation of law.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Typically, as indicated in the preceding discussion and demonstrated by the <em>Workman </em>factors, an adult acquires a new domicile by choosing one of his or her choice, which makes the question of intent a preeminent concern in determining an adult\u2019s domicile. One of the requisites for acquiring a domicile of choice, then, is the <em>legal capacity </em>necessary to form the intent required to select a new domicile.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Regarding children, a child\u2019s ability to acquire a new domicile is limited in ways that an adult\u2019s ability to acquire a domicile is not. This is because, for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of our legal system, an unemancipated child, unlike a competent adult, lacks the legal capacity to make legally binding determinations for him or herself and, therefore, a child lacks the <em>capacity </em>to acquire a domicile of choice.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Thus, while intent is critical for determining the domicile of an adult, a child\u2019s intent regarding domicile is simply irrelevant, and the traditional factors applied in determining an adult\u2019s domicile are likewise irrelevant. Instead, the child\u2019s domicile is determined by reference to the domicile of his or her parents.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> For instance, our common law has recognized that when a child is born, the child acquires a domicile of origin, which is that of his father.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The child\u2019s domicile of origin remains the child\u2019s domicile until a new domicile is acquired through the actions of the child\u2019s parents or until that point in time when the minor, either through emancipation or by reaching the age of majority, can acquire a domicile of choice.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The inquiry into a child\u2019s domicile becomes more complicated when the child\u2019s parents are divorced. Our common law, however, has accounted for these types of familial situations. Specifically, nearly a century ago in <em>In re Volk,</em><footnotemark><em>57</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court considered the domicile of a child for purposes of determining whether Michigan courts must accord full faith and credit to Ohio judgments pertaining to a child. In that case, the parents of the minor child had previously lived in Ohio, but after their divorce the mother established a new domicile in Michigan. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\"><em>[U]nder the decree of divorce, the mother was given [the child\u2019s] unrestricted custody. His domicile thereafter became that of his mother, </em>and, when she removed to this State and became domiciled here, the domicile of the child was in Michigan.[<footnotemark>58</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">By acknowledging that the child\u2019s domicile changed by operation of law as a result of the decree of divorce, this Court expressly recognized that a child\u2019s domicile, upon the divorce or separation of the child\u2019s parents, is the same as that of the parent to whose custody <em>he has been legally given </em>pursuant to a custody order.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> More simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>put, <em>In re Volk </em>held that a custody determination is determinative of a child\u2019s domicile.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Under our common law, then, a child\u2019s domicile upon the divorce of his parents and entry of a custody order is established by operation of law consistent with the terms of the custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We reaffirm these common-law principles and, in doing so, we emphasize that domicile is a singular concept. Just as a person does not have two domiciles, a person likewise does not have a domicile set by operation of law for some purposes and perhaps a different domicile for other purposes \u2014 such as for consideration under the no-fault act or any other statute that uses the term \u201cdomicile.\u201d A person\u2019s domicile for one purpose is his domicile for all purposes; similarly, a child does not have a domicile set by court order only for certain purposes, but not others.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The Legislature made a deliberate choice in selecting the term \u201cdomiciled\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Michigan\u2019s no-fault act, and where domicile is set by operation of law, that determination must be given full legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Our analysis could end with articulation of this common-law rule and affirmation of these principles. We would be remiss, however, not to acknowledge that child custody orders are created pursuant to the provisions of the Child Custody Act,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> which was enacted 40 years after <em>In re Volk </em>was decided. Consequently, because we have concluded that MCL 500.3114(1) incorporates the common law of domicile, which provides that a custody order is determinative of a child\u2019s domicile, it is necessary to further consider whether the Child Custody Act is consistent with this common-law directive. We conclude that the Child Custody Act <em>is consistent </em>with the common-law rule and that the Act\u2019s provisions enforce the traditional determinations regarding what entities have the <em>legal capacity </em>to establish a minor child\u2019s domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">ii. THE CHILD CUSTODY ACT AND DOMICILE</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The Child Custody Act governs the creation of child custody orders and provides a comprehensive statutory scheme for resolving custody disputes.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> With it, the Legislature has sought to promote the best interests of children, which is the hallmark of any custody order. To this end, the Legislature has charged courts, in any dispute regarding custody, with \u201cdeclaring] the child\u2019s inherent rights and establishing] the rights and duties as to the child\u2019s custody... in accordance with this act.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>At the outset, we note that the Child Custody Act is consistent with the notion that a child may have only a single domicile at any given point in time. Nowhere does the Child Custody Act indicate that a child may have dual domiciles, as Farm Bureau suggests. Rather, while the Child Custody Act permits a child to have a \u201clegal residence with each parent,\u201d that language serves merely as an acknowledgment that a child may have more than one residence.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Absent an express indication that the Legislature intended a different result, we will not presume that the Legislature intended to modify the common-law rule applicable to children and adults alike that a person may have only a single domicile at a given point in time.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">However, no provision of the Child Custody Act expressly provides that an order establishing custody or domicile is conclusive evidence of a child\u2019s domicile for purposes of the no-fault act or otherwise. Moreover, the Act allows for myriad possible scenarios in postdivorce familial relationships, recognizing different combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tions of legal and physical custody, and offering flexibility in terms of parenting time arrangements.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Ultimately though, we believe that the Child Custody Act and related court rules lend further support to the conclusion that a child\u2019s domicile is established by a custody determination of the family court because that entity is the single entity entrusted by our laws with the <em>capacity </em>to determine domicile under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Once a custody order is entered pursuant to a judgment of divorce or otherwise, that custody order is legally binding on the parents and the order cannot be modified absent court approval or compliance with the applicable provisions of the Child Custody Act.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Because parents are legally bound by the terms of the custody order, the order therefore negates the parents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>legal capacity, which is necessary to establish a domicile of choice for the minor child that is different from that established in the custody order. Specific provisions of the Child Custody Act support the notion that a parent\u2019s ultra vires acts do not, as a matter of law, effect a change in a child\u2019s court-ordered domicile: If a parent wishes to modify a custody order, the Act requires a parent to move for modification of the custody order and to demonstrate a proper cause or change of circumstances related to the established custodial environment.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> And, in the instance that a parent seeks to change the child\u2019s legal residence, the parent is prohibited from moving a child across state lines without court approval and, in some situations, is prohibited from moving the child more than 100 miles without prior court approval.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Therefore, that parents are legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>bound by custody orders mandates the conclusion that a child\u2019s domicile is established by the court order as a matter of law.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We thus believe that our prior conclusion \u2014 that in the instance where a child\u2019s parents are divorced, the family court\u2019s custody order entered pursuant to the Child Custody Act establishes the child\u2019s domicile by operation of law and is determinative of the child\u2019s domicile for purposes of the no-fault act \u2014 is consistent with the Child Custody Act itself.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> This holding gives the best effect to the provisions of the Child Custody Act, which entrusts courts with making custody determinations in a child\u2019s \u201cbest interests,\u201d including those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>related to living arrangements. Any contrary rule could foster noncompliance with custody orders entered under the Child Custody Act by implicitly sanctioning conduct that might establish a minor child\u2019s domicile in contravention of a controlling custody order. Instead, adherence to the rule that the custody order controls the determination of a minor child\u2019s domicile encourages compliance with legally binding court orders and statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Therefore, courts presiding over an insurance coverage dispute involving the minor child of divorced parents must treat a custody order as conclusive evidence of a child\u2019s domicile.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Where a court order sets a child\u2019s custody or domicile by operation of law, the factual circumstances or the parents\u2019 or child\u2019s intentions are irrelevant to the domicile determination.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Rather, the appropriate analysis is focused on the terms of the custody order. In directing courts to abide by the custody order, we are cognizant that the Child Custody Act draws a distinction between physical custody and legal custody: Physical custody pertains to where the child shall physically \u201creside,\u201d whereas legal custody is understood to mean decision-making authority as to important decisions affecting the child\u2019s welfare.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Because the focus under our common law with respect to domicile mostly concerns a question of location and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>same is true with respect to a child\u2019s domicile in the instance that the parents are divorced,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> the relevant consideration is which parent has <em>physical custody </em>under the terms of the order.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> By way of example, a child\u2019s domicile will be with a parent if the custody order grants that parent primary or sole physical custody, or expressly establishes domicile with that parent through a domicile provision, regardless of whether the parents share joint legal custody.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AX4\">i. <em>GRANGE V LAWRENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">When the family court entered the 2005 judgment of divorce between Lawrence and Rosinski, their child Josalyn acquired a domicile by operation of law consistent with the terms of the judgment of divorce. Specifically, the order granted Lawrence and Rosinski joint legal custody, while Rosinski was granted primary physical custody and Lawrence liberal parenting time. Because the order granted Rosinski primary physical custody, Josalyn\u2019s domicile was with Rosinski. So long as Josalyn lacked the legal capacity to acquire a new domicile of choice and neither of her parents successfully moved to modify the order through a motion to change custody or residence under MCL 722.27 or MCL 722.31 in a family court of continuing jurisdiction, Josalyn\u2019s domicile would remain with Rosinski pursuant to the terms of the judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">At the time of the accident in 2009 the judgment of divorce had never been modified pursuant to the provisions of the Child Custody Act. Nor had Josalyn reached the age of majority or become emancipated, such that she could acquire a different domicile of her own choosing. Therefore, at the time of the accident, Josa-lyn\u2019s domicile was with Rosinski pursuant to the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of the judgment of divorce. In reaching the contrary conclusion that Josalyn was domiciled with both parents, the lower courts erred by concluding that a person could have dual domiciles, erred by failing to recognize the legal effect of the family court\u2019s custody order, and erred by applying the <em>Workman </em>factors that are inapplicable to a person whose domicile is set by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Therefore, because Josalyn can only have one domicile, it follows that she was not domiciled with Lawrence, Grange\u2019s insured. The terms of the judgment of divorce provide conclusive evidence of Josalyn\u2019s domicile and, there being no ambiguity in that order, there is no question of fact that Josalyn was domiciled in Rosinski\u2019s household. It further follows that because Josalyn was not domiciled with Lawrence, Grange is not liable for Josa-lyn\u2019s PIP benefits under MCL 500.3114(1). For this same reason, Grange is not an insurer of equal priority with Farm Bureau and, thus, Grange is not required to reimburse Farm Bureau under MCL 500.3115(2) for the PIP benefits it paid for Josalyn\u2019s care following her accident.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The lower courts therefore erred by denying Grange summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">ii. <em>ACIA V STATE FARM</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In <em>ACIA, </em>the 1995 judgment of divorce granted Taylor and Campanelli joint legal custody, Campanelli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>primary physical custody, and, in an express domicile provision, established Sarah\u2019s domicile in Michigan with Campanelli. Upon entry of this order, Sarah\u2019s domicile was established by operation of law and her parents no longer had the legal capacity to establish a different domicile of choice on Sarah\u2019s behalf, and nor could Sarah, not having reached the age of majority and not being emancipated, acquire a new domicile of her own choosing. Campanelli, however, successfully moved for a change of residency in 1996 and the family court entered an order modifying the judgment of divorce by changing Sarah\u2019s domicile to Tennessee. Taylor and Campanelli retained joint legal custody and Campanelli retained primary physical custody. Sarah\u2019s domicile, then, was changed by operation of law to Tennessee upon entry of the 1996 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">There is no dispute that the 1996 order expressly establishing Sarah\u2019s domicile in Tennessee remained in effect at the time of the accident in 2007, when Sarah was only 16 years of age. Although Sarah was then residing with her mother in Michigan, Sarah was domiciled in Tennessee at the time of the accident as established by the 1996 order. There being no question of fact as to Sarah\u2019s domicile in Tennessee, it is clear that ACIA, the insurer of the Michigan household, is not liable for Sarah\u2019s PIP benefits under MCL 500.3114(1). Instead, State Farm is the insurer in first priority to pay PIP benefits, and the lower courts thus erred by denying ACIA summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">It has long been established in our common law that a person, including a child, may have only a single domicile at any one time. We reaffirm this principle and hold that a child of divorced parents who may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>more than one legal residence, nevertheless still has only one domicile at a given point in time, including for purposes of the no-fault act. In the instance that the child\u2019s parents are divorced and a family court has entered an order relating to custody, we hold, consistent with our common law and the Child Custody Act, that the child\u2019s domicile is established by operation of law and that the custody order is determinative of the child\u2019s domicile for purposes of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In <em>Grange, </em>the judgment of divorce conclusively established the minor child\u2019s domicile with her mother at the time of the accident and, thus, Grange is not hable for providing PIP benefits following the child\u2019s automobile accident.

To begin with, we emphasize that an award of joint physical custody alone does not automatically create this potentially perplexing situation because although an order may award joint physical custody, it may also establish that one parent has <em>primary </em>physical custody. Alternatively, the details of the physical custody division may reveal that one parent has physical custody of the child more often than the other parent despite the joint physical custody arrangement. Thus, it is only in the very rare event that a custody order awards joint physical custody <em>and </em>grants both parents an equal amount of time to exercise physical custody that this issue arises. Indeed, MCL 722.26a(7) does not require that parents share <em>equal </em>physical custodial time for a court to award joint physical custody; rather, [MCL 722.26a(7)(a)] merely defines joint physical custody as an order \u201c[t]hat the child shall reside <em>alternately for specific periods </em>with each of the parents.\u201d Emphasis added.

Restatement, \u00a7 22 (1971). Thus, the child\u2019s domicile is with the parent who has physical custody as established by the custody order at the specific time of the incident at issue.

I concur in the result reached by the majority in these cases. I also agree with the majority that a person, including a minor child, can have only one domicile at any given time. I disagree, however, with the rule the majority has adopted for determining the domicile of a child with two legal residences under the Child Custody Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for several reasons. The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>holds that the domicile of a child with two legal residences is necessarily equated with a family court order establishing physical custody of that child, regardless of whether the parents in fact follow the family court\u2019s order. Although this rule appears to have the benefit of reaffirming the legally binding nature of a custody order, such a perfunctory rule falls far short of addressing the practical realities of post-divorce familial relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The majority assumes that physical custody orders are the same as domicile determinations as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 question this assumption. Instead, I believe the Child Custody Act grants the family court the authority to establish the <em>custodial environment(s) </em>of the child or children subject to that order. It is from this custodial environment that the legal determination of domicile can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">I also disagree that a family court order of joint physical custody can establish an alternating domicile system, whereby the minor child\u2019s domicile is wherever the custody order indicates the child is supposed to be. Such a system is a semantic end-run around our traditional rule that a person may only have one domicile and ignores the practical reality that in virtually all cases, a child will have a primary residence that will constitute the child\u2019s domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">I conclude that the majority\u2019s rule unduly impinges on the ability of an insurer to accurately assess its risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>when entering insurance agreements and places an unreasonable burden on insurers to inquire about, obtain, and interpret family court orders. This is because the majority rule places no-fault personal protection insurance (PIP) liability on the insurer of the parent who has been ordered physical custody, even when the child is not primarily living with that parent. The majority\u2019s rule, in my view, is inconsistent with the no-fault act, which provides PIP protection for \u201caccidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in <em>the same household </em>. . . .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It is an undeniable fact that parents involved in custody disputes often reach an agreement between themselves to provide for a different custodial environment than that provided in the family court\u2019s initial order of custody. I would adopt a rule that recognizes this reality. Specifically, I would conclude that family court orders of custody establish a presumption of domicile that may be rebutted when the child\u2019s actual living arrangements are so clearly inconsistent with the family court\u2019s custody order that it is reasonable to conclude that the parents have expressly or impliedly reached an agreement regarding the child\u2019s domicile. To rebut this presumption, I would require courts to consider the factors traditionally used to assess domicile to determine the domicile of minor children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Thus, in <em>Grange, </em>I conclude that the presumption of domicile created by the family court\u2019s judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>divorce is not rebutted under the facts of this case and, consistent with the majority, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the circuit court for entry of summary disposition in favor of Grange. In <em>ACIA, </em>I conclude that the Court of Appeals erred by finding a question of fact regarding the child\u2019s domicile. Reviewing the record as a whole, I conclude that the evidence did not rebut the presumption, created by the family court\u2019s orders, that the child was domiciled in Tennessee. Consistent with the majority, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the circuit court for entry of summary disposition in favor of ACIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">A. DOMICILE GENERALLY</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">A person\u2019s domicile is significant in a variety of legal contexts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and it is a concept with deep roots in Michigan law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Court stated in 1847 that it is \u201cwell settled that no person can have more than one [national] domicile, at one and the same time . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court has recently reiterated that a person may have only one domicile, and \u201ca domicile is \u2018the place where a person has his home, with no present intention of removing, and to which he intends to return after going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>elsewhere for a longer or shorter time.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Generally, domicile is \u201ca question of fact and intent[,]\u201d and a determination of domicile involves looking at all the facts and circumstances to determine whether the evidence that a person is domiciled in one location outweighs the evidence that a person is domiciled in another location.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">As observed by the majority, there are three means of acquiring a domicile, depending on the factual context: \u201c(1) domicile of origin or of nativity; (2) domicile of choice; and (3) domicile by operation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Miss Band of Choctaw Indians v Holyfield, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States discussed the concept of domicile, drawing on \u201ccommon-law principles of domicile\u201d and explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cDomicile\u201d is, of course, a concept widely used in both federal and state courts for jurisdiction and conflict-of-laws purposes, and its meaning is generally uncontroverted. \u201cDomicile\u201d is not necessarily synonymous with \u201cresi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>dence,\u201d and one can reside in one place but be domiciled in another. For adults, domicile is established by physical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one\u2019s intent to remain there. One acquires a \u201cdomicile of origin\u201d at birth, and that domicile continues until a new one (a \u201cdomicile of choice\u201d) is acquired. Since most minors are legally incapable of forming the requisite intent to establish a domicile, their domicile is determined by that of their parents.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Domicile by operation of law occurs when a person lacks the capacity to establish a domicile by choice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, because a minor child typically cannot form the requisite intent to establish a domicile by choice, a minor child\u2019s domicile is determined, by operation of law, by the domicile of the child\u2019s parents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One\u2019s domicile of origin is the starting point, and it remains a person\u2019s domicile until that domicile is usurped by a subsequent domicile attained by choice or by operation of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where a child\u2019s parents have changed their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>domicile, the domicile of the child likewise changes by operation of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, these common law notions of domicile do not resolve the question of where a child is domiciled when the child\u2019s parents share, at a minimum,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> joint legal custody such that the child has two legal residences pursuant to the Child Custody Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">B. DOMICILE AS IT RELATES TO THE MICHIGAN NO-FAULT ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Pursuant to MCL 500.3114(1), the no-fault act provides PIP protection for \u201caccidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household .. . .\u201d Generally speaking, domicile determinations for purposes of assessing insurer liability in the no-fault context are made by considering the factual circumstances surrounding the party\u2019s living situation and by balancing and weighing several factors, none of which is determinative on its own.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A non-exhaustive list of factors for determining whether a person is \u201cdomiciled in the same household\u201d under the no-fault act was articulated by this Court in <em>Workman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Among the relevant factors are the following: (1) the subjective or declared intent of the person of remaining, either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time, in the place he contends is his \u201cdomicile\u201d or \u201chousehold\u201d; (2) the formality or informality of the relationship between the person and the members of the household; (3) whether the place where the person lives is in the same house, within the same curtilage or upon the same premises; (4) the existence of another place of lodging by the person alleging \u201cresidence\u201d or \u201cdomicile\u201d in the household.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">To address \u201cthe particular problems posed by young people departing from the parents\u2019 home and establishing new domiciles as part of the normal transition to adulthood and independence[,]\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals has considered whether a child of majority age is \u201cdomiciled\u201d with the child\u2019s parents in several cases.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the first of these cases, <em>Dairyland, </em>the Court of Appeals laid out additional relevant factors for determining whether a child is domiciled with his or her parents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">[(1)] whether the claimant continues to use his parents\u2019 home as his mailing address, [(2)] whether he maintains some possessions with his parents, [(3)] whether he uses his parents\u2019 address on his driver\u2019s license or other documents, [(4)] whether a room is maintained for the claimant at the parents\u2019 home, and [(5)] whether the claimant is dependent upon the parents for support.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>However, this Court has not yet addressed where a <em>minor </em>child is \u201cdomiciled\u201d for purposes of no-fault insurance when the child\u2019s parents maintain two separate households, which both constitute a legal residence of the child pursuant to the Child Custody Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because domestic relations law and the Child Custody Act are implicated in this no-fault context, it is appropriate to review the law regarding child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">C. CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Under the Child Custody Act, until a child turns 18, the family court has jurisdiction to make child custody determinations when there is a child custody dispute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Child Custody Act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">(1) If a child custody dispute has been submitted to the circuit court as an original action under this act or has arisen incidentally from another action in the circuit court or an order or judgment of the circuit court, for the best interests of the child the court may do 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">(a) Award the custody of the child to 1 or more of the parties involved or to others and provide for payment of support for the child, until the child reaches 18 years of age....[<footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The Child Custody Act first provided for joint custody in 1981.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> MCL 722.26a requires the family court to advise parents of joint custody and, upon request of either parent, to consider awarding joint custody of a child. \u201cJoint custody\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">... an order of the court in which 1 or both of the following is specified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>(a) That the child shall reside alternately for specific periods with each of the parents[, or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">(b) That the parents shall share decision-making authority as to the important decisions affecting the welfare of the child.

A MINOR CHILD MAY NOT HAVE DUAL DOMICILES</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Complications arise in determining the domicile of a child for purposes of no-fault insurance where the child has two legal residences because his or her parents share legal custody. The trial court and the Court of Appeals both reached the extraordinary conclusion in <em>Grange </em>that Josalyn had <em>two </em>domiciles: one with Ros-inski and one with Lawrence. This conclusion departs from established Michigan law that a person may have only one domicile.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> I join the majority in reaffirming this long-standing principle. Further, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Workman<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cdoes not stand for the proposition that domicile is the equivalent of residence under MCL 500.3114(1).\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Am4\">As this Court stated in <em>Gluc v Klein:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">Under the common law, there was a distinction between \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence.\u201d The former, in its ordinary acceptation, was defined to be, \u201cA place where a person lives or has his home,\u201d while \u201cAny place of abode or dwelling place,\u201d however temporary it might have been, was said to constitute a residence. A person\u2019s domicile was his <em>legal </em>residence or home in contemplation of law.[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>While \u201cresidence\u201d may be defined in more restrictive ways under Michigan law,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> for example, <em>\u201clegal </em>residence\u201d as discussed in <em>Gluc, </em>the underlying distinction between the concepts of domicile and residence remains: while a person may have only one domicile, he or she may have more than one residence. And while legal residence is often equated with domicile, because there can be only one domicile, where two legal residences exist, it is axiomatic that only one can be determined to be the domicile. The fact that a domicile determination is complicated by the factual circumstances of the inquiry does not constitute a sound reason to depart from the established principle that a person can have only one domicile. Therefore, even where a child is considered to have a legal residence with each parent, his or her domicile must be that of only <em>one </em>of the child\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">E. THE MAJORITY\u2019S DOMICILE BY OPERATION OF LAW APPROACH</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The majority attempts to extend the common-law doctrine of domicile by operation of law beyond its logical and practical bounds. I agree with the majority that unemancipated minor children cannot establish a domicile by choice, given that they are incapable of forming the requisite intent.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> But domicile by operation of law, the means by which unemancipated minors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>acquire the domicile of their parents, is not easily determined when parents share joint legal custody, given that joint legal custody creates two legal residences for the child, either of which could constitute the child\u2019s domicile.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> While the domicile-by-operation-of-law framework indicates that there are two potential residences where a child could be considered domiciled in this context, given that there can only be one domicile, it stops short of answering, \u201cWhich legal residence constitutes the child\u2019s domicile?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Despite the fact that the majority and I agree that a child may only have one domicile at any given time, the majority\u2019s alternating-domicile theory for children whose parents share joint physical custody contradicts this long-standing principle and in substance permits dual domiciles for such children. This alternating-domicile concept is unprecedented in the domicile jurisprudence of this state, which views domicile as that place where a person ultimately returns, despite going elsewhere for a period of time.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As the majority states, \u201cFor over 165 years, Michigan courts have defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u2018domicile\u2019 to mean \u2018the place where a person has his true, fixed, permanent home, and principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The fact that a child cannot establish a domicile by choice is not a sufficient reason to ignore that <em>permanence </em>underpins the concept of domicile in our jurisprudence.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Further, the majority opinion assumes that a custody order establishes domicile as a matter of law. While a family court\u2019s orders pertaining to custody and the legal residence of a child, if implemented, can certainly establish custodial environments from which a domicile arises and, thus, a legal determination of domicile can be made, I question whether the family court has the authority under the Child Custody Act to explicitly <em>set </em>a child\u2019s domicile by court order. The Child Custody Act speaks in terms of \u201clegal residence\u201d and only uses the word \u201cdomicile\u201d in one section of the statute, MCL 722.27b(9), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">The court shall not enter an order prohibiting an individual who has legal custody of a child from changing the domicile of the child if the prohibition is primarily for the purpose of allowing a grandparent to exercise the rights conferred in a grandparenting time order entered under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Significantly, the use of \u201cdomicile\u201d in this section does not suggest that family courts have the authority to establish, as a matter of law, a child\u2019s domicile in making a custody determination. Rather, this section assumes a parent has legal custody of a child, and it prohibits a court from barring that parent from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>change of domicile so that a grandparent may seek or maintain visitation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Moreover, the majority rule now requires insurance companies to inquire about custody orders, obtain a copy of those orders, and interpret those orders to properly assess its risks,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> which unduly burdens insurers and injects unreasonable uncertainty into an insurer\u2019s risk-assessment process.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s rule prevents an insurer from being able to simply ask, \u201cWho resides with you?\u201d to assess its risks. Ultimately, the majority\u2019s rule, in my view, is inconsistent with the no-fault act, which provides PIP protection \u201cto accidental bodily injuiy to the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in <em>the same household .. </em>. ,\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s rule, a child could be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in one state pursuant to a custody order, but actually live in another state.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> It is difficult to discern how such a situation could constitute being domiciled <em>in the same household.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>F. DETERMINATION OF DOMICILE OF CHILDREN WITH TWO LEGAL RESIDENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">A domicile determination for a minor child of parents who have separate domiciles brings with it unique considerations due to the family court\u2019s involvement in making child custody determinations and the court\u2019s involvement in circumstances where a change in the legal residence of a child is disputed.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Like the traditional examination of a person\u2019s domicile, in my view, the determination of the domicile of a child with two legal residences requires a review of all the facts and circumstances to determine whether the evidence that the child is domiciled in one legal residence outweighs the evidence that the child is domiciled in another legal residence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But in light of the family court\u2019s involvement in determining where a child resides, and the deference owed to that court\u2019s determinations, an inquiry into where a child is domiciled also necessarily involves consideration of the family court\u2019s orders relating to custody of a child and a child\u2019s legal residence(s). While generally no one factor is conclusive in determining domicile,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> in this unique context, a family court\u2019s custody and residence determinations are the starting point for determining a child\u2019s domicile because \u201c[a] party must obey an order entered by a court with proper jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Therefore, I would begin with the presumption that the parties to family court orders relating to custody and residence of the child have in fact obeyed and implemented those orders.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Further, custody and residence determinations are made by family courts when <em>disputes </em>arise between parents.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> A family court\u2019s custody and residence determinations inform where and with whom the child is <em>supposed </em>to live, sleep, spend his or her time, and ultimately return, though the child may spend time elsewhere. I would establish a rule that presumes that these determinations reflect the actual living situation of the child, and, thus, function as a proxy for the intent of the parents regarding the child\u2019s domicile, due to the parents\u2019 inability to form a joint parental intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Nonetheless, I recognize the reality that, with the passage of time, a child\u2019s living situation will not always align with the family court\u2019s orders, despite the general rule that a party must follow the orders of a court. It is common for parents, after the bitterness of a custody dispute has subsided, to resolve their differences over time and to reach an agreement regarding the living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>arrangements for their child.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Parents commonly reach amicable, private agreements, reflective of their joint intent, that conflict with an existing family court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Regarding a change in legal residence, the Child Custody Act requires parents to seek the family court\u2019s approval before moving a child more than 100 miles from his or her legal residence, unless, among other exceptions, the other parent <em>consents </em>to the move.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Regarding a modification of a custody order, however, the Child Custody Act envisions parents returning to the family court to seek modifications.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>while parents have a legal duty to seek the family court\u2019s approval of amicable agreements regarding custody modifications, this does not always occur. The majority\u2019s view fails to take this reality into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In consideration of these realities, while at the same time recognizing the need for a rule that fosters consistency, I would hold that, for purposes of determining domicile under the no-fault act, where the facts regarding the child\u2019s living arrangements are reasonably consistent with the provisions of the family court\u2019s orders, those orders will be determinative of the child\u2019s domicile.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> However, where the facts of the child\u2019s living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>arrangements are so clearly inconsistent with the family court\u2019s orders that it is reasonable to conclude that the child\u2019s parents have expressly or impliedly reached an agreement regarding the child\u2019s domicile that differs from the domicile indicated by the family court\u2019s orders, the presumption of domicile created by the family court\u2019s orders would be rebutted.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Under this rule, courts would make domicile determinations in light of the actual facts of the custodial situation, rather than solely on a court order that may have little relevance to the actual living situation of the child after the passage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>of time, namely, with regard to which parent actually has physical custody of the child.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> This presumption would promote certainty regarding domicile determinations in the no-fault context,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> maintain the longstanding character of the no-fault domicile inquiry as an inquiry focused on the actual facts of the situation,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and afford the appropriate deference that custody and legal-residence determinations ought to be given outside the domestic relations context.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In determining whether this presumption can be rebutted, I would have courts look to the traditional nonexclusive factors for determining domicile for purposes of no-fault insurance articulated by this Court in <em>Workman </em>and, particularly, those articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Dairyland, </em>which specifically address whether a child is domiciled with his or her parents under the no-fault act. While <em>Dairyland </em>involved a child that had reached the age of majority, I find these factors to be similarly relevant for determining the intent of a minor child\u2019s parents regarding the child\u2019s domicile because they focus on objective indicators of the intent to have the child remain permanently in a given home. Additionally, there are other relevant factors that are unique to the context of minor children whose parents share joint custody: (1) where the child actually spends the majority of his or her time, and (2) where the child actually sleeps the majority of the nights of the week. It bears repeating, however, that none of these domicile factors would alone be determinative.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">II. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">A. <em>GRANGE INS CO OF MICH v LAWRENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Because the underlying facts necessary to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Josalyn\u2019s domicile at the time of her death are not in dispute, where Josalyn was domiciled is a question of law.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In the present case, the judgment of divorce granted joint legal custody to both Lawrence and Ros-inski, but primary physical custody to Rosinski and a significant amount of parenting time to Lawrence. The family court\u2019s judgment demonstrates that it was intended that Josalyn would spend the majority of her time at Rosinski\u2019s residence, and while there was the intent for Josalyn to spend time with Lawrence at his residence, the intent was always for the child to return to Rosinski\u2019s residence. Therefore, under the rule I would establish, the custody determination contained within the judgment of divorce in this case would create a rebuttable presumption that the child was domiciled with Rosinski.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">With regard to whether this presumption created by the family court order could be rebutted, I would conclude that it cannot under the facts of this case. Because Rosinski\u2019s residence was identified whenever an address was needed for the child, the little mail Josalyn received would have been sent to this address. The accident report and Josalyn\u2019s death certificate both listed Rosinski\u2019s home as the child\u2019s home. While Lawrence did maintain a room for the children in his apartment, the sisters shared a bed, and the majority of Josalyn\u2019s clothing and her pets were kept at Rosinski\u2019s residence. Josalyn depended on both of her parents for support. The facts also indicate that Josalyn spent the majority of her time and the majority of her overnights at Rosinski\u2019s home. Significantly, both Lawrence and Rosinski indicated that Rosinski\u2019s home was Josalyn\u2019s primary residence, given the ordinary meaning of the phrase. Overall, the facts in this case indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Lawrence and Rosinski implemented the custody order and do not demonstrate that Lawrence and Rosinski jointly intended for Lawrence\u2019s residence to be the child\u2019s only domicile. On this basis, I would conclude that the lower courts erred by concluding that Josalyn was domiciled with both Lawrence and Rosinski and that Grange was liable for PIP benefits arising out of Josalyn\u2019s injuries and death.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>B. ACIA <em>V STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTO INS CO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><em>The </em>material facts necessary to determine Sarah\u2019s domicile at the time of her death are not in dispute; therefore, where Sarah was domiciled is a question of law.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The original judgment of divorce granted physical custody to Campanelli and indicated that the child\u2019s domicile was to be in Michigan. However, Campanelli obtained permission as the custodial parent, by order of the court, to change the child\u2019s domicile to Tennessee. Before the child\u2019s death, an ex parte order from the circuit court purportedly transferred custody of Sarah to Taylor and changed Sarah\u2019s domicile to Taylor\u2019s Michigan address; however, this order was subsequently vacated and declared void <em>ab initio. </em>The judgment of divorce granting physical custody to Campanelli and the subsequent order changing the child\u2019s domicile to Tennessee demonstrate that it was intended that Sarah would spend the majority of her time with Campanelli in Tennessee. While there was the intent for Sarah to leave Tennessee to spend time with Taylor in Michigan, the intent was always for Sarah to return to Tennessee. Therefore, I would conclude that these orders would establish a presumption that Sarah was domiciled in Tennessee with Campanelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">With regard to whether this presumption could be overcome in this case, the factual situation presented in <em>ACIA </em>is a closer question than the situation presented in <em>Grange. </em>However, as in <em>Grange, </em>I would conclude that the presumption likewise cannot be rebutted under the facts of <em>ACIA. </em>The fact that Sarah stayed in Michigan after her summer break, attended high school in Michigan the following fall, and obtained a part-time job in Michigan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>indicates that Sarah used Taylor\u2019s address as her mailing address and on documents. Taylor\u2019s address was also listed as Sarah\u2019s address on Sarah\u2019s hospital records and death certificate. Given the length of Sarah\u2019s stay in Michigan, it can be inferred that she had a significant amount of possessions at Taylor\u2019s Michigan residence. The facts indicate that Sarah had her own room in Michigan and that Taylor provided for Sarah while she was in Michigan. It is also clear that for the period of time that Sarah was staying in Michigan, she actually spent most of her time and overnights in Michigan; however, prior to Sarah coming to Michigan, she spent nearly 11 years in Tennessee with Campanelli, only occasionally visiting Taylor in Michigan. None of the facts in the record suggest that Sarah\u2019s domicile in Tennessee ceased to exist; the facts indicate that Campanelli gave Sarah permission to stay temporarily in Michigan after the summer to attend school in the fall so that Sarah could get to know Taylor better. Campanelli stated, \u201cI did eventually agree that she could stay on a temporary basis and enroll in high school!,]\u201d and further stated, \u201cIt was never intended to be permanent....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The facts in this case are not so clearly inconsistent with the family court\u2019s orders so as to rebut the presumption that domicile is established by the custody order. Absent evidence of a clear joint intent on the part of Sarah\u2019s parents to change Sarah\u2019s domicile, the presumption that Sarah was domiciled in Tennessee would stand. While the facts certainly indicate that there was the intent for Sarah to remain for an extended period of time in Michigan, the facts do not clearly indicate that Sarah\u2019s parents jointly intended for her to remain in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In my view, the lower courts improperly focused on Sarah\u2019s intent with regard to her domicile and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>she intended to remain in Michigan or return to Tennessee. While Sarah was an older teen at 16 years old, she was not emancipated. An unemancipated minor child\u2019s intent is <em>not pertinent </em>in determining where the child is domiciled under the no-fault act.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The appropriate inquiry instead focuses on whether the <em>child\u2019s parents </em>have reached a joint intent regarding the child\u2019s domicile that differs from the domicile indicated by the family court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">I would conclude that Sarah was domiciled with Campanelli in Tennessee at the time of her death; therefore, ACIA is not liable for providing PIP benefits for Sarah\u2019s injuries and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Consistent with the majority opinion, I would reaffirm Michigan\u2019s long-standing principle that a person, including a minor child, can have only one domicile. Further, I concur in the majority\u2019s results in these cases. I would reach those results instead by holding that when a minor child has two legal residences pursuant to the Child Custody Act, family court orders relating to custody of the child and the child\u2019s residence(s) create a rebuttable presumption of domicile under the no-fault act. Under the facts of these cases, the presumptions in these cases would not be rebutted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-7\">Markman and McCormack, JJ., concurred with Zahra, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> MCL 722.21 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> The majority is equating <em>physical </em>custody with domicile by operation of law, despite the fact that a child whose parents share, at a minimum, joint legal custody has a legal residence with each parent.

But domicile determinations in no-fault decisions have no effect in family court adjudications regarding a child\u2019s custody and legal residence. Family courts are charged with making determinations that focus on the best interests of the child. See MCL 722.27(1) (\u201cIf a child custody dispute has been submitted to the circuit court as an original action under this act or has arisen incidentally from another action in the circuit court or an order or judgment of the circuit court, for <em>the best interests of the child </em>the court may do 1 or more of the following!.]\u201d) (emphasis added); see also MCL 722.31(4) (\u201cBefore permitting a legal residence change otherwise restricted by subsection (1), the court shall consider each of the following factors, <em>with the child as the primary focus </em>in the court\u2019s deliberations!.]\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Gagnon v Glowacki, </em>295 Mich App 557, 570; 815 NW2d 141 (2012) (\u201cAfter granting a change of domicile, the trial court must determine whether there will be a change in the established custodial environment and, if so, determine whether the relocating parent can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the change is in <em>the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). No-fault decisions regarding insurer priority on the basis of domicile determinations are inapposite to custody and legal residence determinations in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>family court context because no-fault law focuses on the practical issue of which insurer is liable for insurance coverage and does not take into consideration the best interests of the child. Again, I question whether the family court has the authority under the Child Custody Act to explicitly <em>set </em>a child\u2019s domicile, as opposed to establishing the custodial environment in which the child will live.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> The majority approach fails to recognize that a court order may allow parents to modify the time a child spends with each parent.

The majority would ignore a subsequent decision by the parents to make the father the new primary custodian in fact, reasoning that such changes only alter parenting time and not the domicile. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we believe the better approach is to make domicile determinations on the basis of the actual living situation of the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> It is important to note that while \u201cphysical custody\u201d is a term commonly associated with the custody described in MCL 722.26a(7)(a), this phrase is not defined in the Child Custody Act.

The Court of Appeals in <em>Bierbusse </em>also stated, <em>\u201cWhile agreeing that the statute should be interpreted in a manner that allows an insurer to reasonably calculate the scope of risk and the premium incidental thereto, </em>we do not believe that a per se rule excluding from coverage any relative not domiciled in the same household as the named insured is in accord with the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> <em>Workman, </em>404 Mich at 496-497; <em>In re High, </em>2 Doug at 523.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"><em> </em>The rule I propose is consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Volk </em>in which the child was determined to be domiciled with the child\u2019s mother where the mother was given unrestricted custody.

Additionally, this statement of the Court of Appeals cannot fairly he interpreted as indicating that the court considered the custody determination in the judgment of divorce to be conclusive of domicile, given that the court, in the same breath, pointed to where the child spent the majority of his time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> <em>Workman, </em>404 Mich at 496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> See <em>Fowler, </em>254 Mich App at 364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> In our grant order, this Court asked the parties to address in part \u201cwhether an insurance policy provision giving preclusive effect to a court-ordered custody arrangement is enforceable.\u201d <em>Grange Ins Co of Mich v Lawrence, </em>493 Mich 851 (2012).

The policy\u2019s statement that a court adjudication regarding custody is conclusive constitutes Grange\u2019s attempt to close what it saw as a potential gap in the no-fault act that could have been interpreted to expand Grange\u2019s liability.
