Respondent has filed a petition asking this Court to reject that recommendation. We affirm the JTC\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, but conclude at the same time that it is necessary and appropriate to remove respondent from office for the remainder of her term. The evidence establishes that respondent: (a) committed perjury; (b) signed her former attorney\u2019s name on legal documents without the latter\u2019s permission and filed these documents also without such permission; and (c) made numerous misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>sentations of fact under oath during the JTC proceedings. The cumulative effect of respondent\u2019s misconduct convinces this Court that respondent should not remain in judicial office, and we therefore remove her from such office. In addition, because respondent engaged in conduct involving \u201cdeceit or intentional misrepresentation,\u201d pursuant to MCR 9.205(B), we order respondent to pay costs of $8,498.40 to the JTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On April 17, 2012, the JTC filed Formal Complaint No. 89 against respondent, alleging three counts of misconduct. It asserted that respondent had engaged in: (a) \u201cmisrepresentations under oath;\u201d (b) \u201cforgery and filing of forged and unauthorized pleadings;\u201d and (c) \u201cmisrepresentations to the commission.\u201d With regard to count one, the complaint asserted that while respondent was the defendant in a divorce case before Oakland Circuit Court Judge Mary Ellen Brennan, respondent repeatedly called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers despite being advised each time by Judge Brennan\u2019s staff that such contact was improper while respondent was represented by counsel. At a subsequent hearing and while under oath, when Judge Brennan told respondent that she must stop calling her chambers, respondent denied ever doing so while she was represented by counsel. Respondent stated that she had her clerk call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on one occasion to determine if the time of the hearing could be changed. Judge Brennan\u2019s secretary, Kirsten Turner, testified that on March 15, 2011, she spoke to a woman who identified herself as Judge Adams. In response, respondent stated, \u201cthat\u2019s not correct.\u201d When Judge Brennan noted that respondent had previously stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>that she had her clerk call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers, respondent denied ever having said that.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">With regard to count two, the complaint alleged that after attorney Andra Dudley was released from representing respondent, respondent prepared a motion to set aside or modify the judgment of divorce, a supporting brief, and a notice of hearing, to all of which she signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name without the latter\u2019s knowledge or permission and filed them with the court, also without such knowledge or permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">With regard to count three, the complaint alleged that respondent falsely told the JTC that: (a) she had been walking away from counsel\u2019s table, on her way out of the courtroom, when Judge Brennan asked respondent about calling her chambers the day before; (b) she had only contacted Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on four occasions; (c) nobody in Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers had told her that it was improper for her to call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers while she was represented by counsel; (d) she had Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to file pleadings on Ms. Dudley\u2019s behalf; (e) she also had permission to sign Ms. Dudley\u2019s name to the motion that was filed on May 5, 2011; (f) she had provided a copy of the motion to Ms. Dudley; and (g) she had provided Ms. Dudley with notice of the hearing date for the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Also on April 17, 2012, the JTC filed a request for the appointment of a master. Nine days later on April 26, 2012, this Court appointed the Honorable Donald G. Miller as the master, and a hearing began on September 11, 2012, and concluded on September 17, 2012. On October 9, 2012, the master filed his findings of fact and conclusions of law with the JTC. With regard to count one, the master concluded that \u201cthe Examiner has, by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>preponderance of the evidence,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] shown that Respondent did in fact violate MCL 750.423 by making false statements under oath.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With regard to count two, the master concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that respondent violated the forgery statute, MCL 750.248,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or the uttering and publishing statute, MCL 750.249,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because there was no evidence presented to indicate that respondent had acted with an \u201cintent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>injure or defraud\u201d when she signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on the legal documents and filed them with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Finally, with regard to count three, the master concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support three out of the seven allegations of misrepresentations to the JTC. Specifically, the master concluded that there was sufficient evidence that respondent had lied to the JTC about: (a) having contacted Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on only four occasions; (b) having never been told by Judge Brennan\u2019s staff that it was improper for her to call them while she was represented by counsel; and (c) having Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to affix her signature to the motion filed on May 5, 2011. But the master found that there was insufficient evidence to find that respondent had lied about: (a) having been walking out of Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom when Judge Brennan asked her about calling her chambers the day before; (b) having Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to file pleadings on her behalf; (c) having supplied a copy of the motion to Ms. Dudley; and (d) having supplied a copy of the notice of the hearing to Ms. Dudley.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The JTC then held a hearing on December 3, 2012, and issued its decision and recommendation for discipline on December 28, 2012. The JTC adopted the master\u2019s findings except, unlike the master, the JTC determined that: (a) \u201cRespondent could not possibly believe that she had Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to sign and file pleadings under Ms. Dudley\u2019s signature;\u201d and (b) \u201cRespondent failed to provide Ms. Dudley with a copy of the May 5, 2011 Motion and accompanying documents.\u201d The JTC concluded that the examiner had proven by a preponderance of the evidence all the allegations in counts one and two<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the complaint and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>with a single exception, all the allegations in count three of the complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It concluded that respondent violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1), MCR 9.104(A), MCR 9.208(B), and Canons 1 and 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. In determining an appropriate sanction, the JTC considered the seven factors that this Court set forth in <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291, 1292-1293; 625 NW2d 744 (2000). Finding that respondent\u2019s misconduct implicated at least five of the seven <em>Brown </em>factors and recognizing that this Court has held that \u201c[l]ying under oath is the antithesis of judicial integrity,\u201d <em>In re James, </em>492 Mich 553, 582; 821 NW2d 144 (2012) (Markman, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>concurring in part and dissenting in part), the JTC recommended that respondent be suspended without pay for 180 days and be ordered to pay costs in the amount of $8,498.40.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 4 provides that \u201c[t]he supreme court shall have general superintending control over all courts.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">[o]n recommendation of the judicial tenure commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, retire or remove a judge for conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties, misconduct in office, persistent failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">MCR 9.225 provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings and file a written opinion and judgment, which may accept or reject the recommendations of the commission, or modify the recommendations by imposing a greater, lesser, or entirely different sanction.\u201d This Court reviews de novo the JTC\u2019s factual findings, conclusions of law, and disciplinary recommendations. <em>In re James, </em>492 Mich at 560; <em>In re Halloran, </em>466 Mich 1219, 1219; 647 NW2d 505 (2002).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">A. FACTUAL FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">After reviewing the record and hearing oral arguments, we agree with and adopt the factual findings of the JTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">1. COUNT ONE: PERJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The master and the JTC both found that respondent made false statements under oath in Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom. We agree. While respondent was under oath in Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom, Judge Brennan asked respondent whether she had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on the preceding day, March 15, 2011, and respondent said that she had not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, respondent repeatedly denied ever having called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers while she was represented by counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ever, both Judge Brennan\u2019s secretary, Kirsten Turner, and her clerk, Ryan Mathews, testified that respondent had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on several occasions while represented by counsel. Respondent herself now admits that she did call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on March 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Respondent argues, however, that she did not intentionally or willfully make any false statements because when she denied calling Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers, she was under the impression that she was simply denying that she had tried to speak directly with Judge Brennan. This is belied by the fact that respondent did not just say, \u201cI didn\u2019t call your chambers directly,\u201d but also repeatedly said, \u201cI did not call your staff directly,\u201d and then, after Judge Brennan asked her, \u201cAre you telling me that you did not have a conversation with anybody from my staff, from my office yesterday,\u201d respondent said, \u201cI did not call anyone,\u201d \u201cI did not have any conversation,\u201d and, finally, when Judge Brennan told respondent, \u201cdo not call my chambers[;] [d]on\u2019t call members of the staff, don\u2019t speak with clerks, don\u2019t speak with legal secretaries, don\u2019t speak with research attorneys, anybody who\u2019s a member of the staff; it\u2019s not appropriate,\u201d respondent replied, \u201cthe only time I\u2019ve called your chambers was when I was unrepresented.\u201d At this point in the colloquy it was perfectly clear that Judge Brennan was asking respondent if she had called and talked to any of her staff and respondent clearly denied that she had ever done so while represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">After this occurred, Judge Brennan had her secretary, Kirsten Turner, brought into the courtroom and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>placed under oath, and when Ms. Turner testified that respondent had called the day before, respondent replied, \u201cThat is not correct.\u201d Again, at this point, respondent had to have known that she was being asked whether she had called and spoken to Judge Brennan\u2019s secretary, not just whether she had tried to call Judge Brennan herself, and yet respondent still refused to admit that she had called and spoken to Judge Brennan\u2019s secretary. Respondent also testified falsely about whether her clerk had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers. Respondent first said that her clerk had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers to see if the hearing could be rescheduled, but then about one minute later denied ever having said that. On the basis of this evidence, we agree with and adopt the JTC\u2019s finding that respondent made false statements under oath in Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">2. COUNT TWO: FORGERY</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The JTC found that respondent signed her former attorney\u2019s (Ms. Dudley\u2019s) name on legal documents (motion, brief, praecipe, and notice of hearing) without her permission and filed these documents with the court, also without her permission. We agree. While respondent admits that she signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on the documents and filed them with the court, she asserts that she believed that she did have Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to do so. Ms. Dudley testified that she did not sign the documents and she did not give respondent permission to sign or file the documents on her behalf. Indeed, she testified that she had never given respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>dent permission to sign her name on any documents. She also testified that respondent did not send her a copy of the legal documents. Finally, Ms. Dudley testified that when she became aware that the documents had been signed and filed without her permission by way of a telephone call from respondent\u2019s now ex-husband\u2019s attorney, she emailed respondent, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">I did not receive any contact from you this week and hopefully you did not file any pleadings with my name without me first reviewing them and without my permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s contention that she believed that she had Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to sign Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on the legal documents and file them with the court is not credible. To begin with, Ms. Dudley was not even representing respondent when respondent signed and filed the documents under Ms. Dudley\u2019s name. The judgment of divorce expressly released Ms. Dudley from any further representation of respondent, and respondent was well-aware that Ms. Dudley was no longer representing her as evidenced by her May 5, 2011 email stating, \u201cIn the unlikely event the issue is not resolved tomorrow, I will retain an appellate person to handle the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In addition, after respondent signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on the legal documents and filed them, respondent sent Ms. Dudley an email stating, \u201cI tried contacting you earlier this week to obtain permission to file a quick pleading on my behalf under your name.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Respondent would not have tried to contact Ms. Dudley to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>obtain her permission to sign and file the documents under Ms. Dudley\u2019s name if she already had Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to do so. Respondent also did not indicate in any manner, on any of the documents, that she was signing Ms. Dudley\u2019s name with her permission. Finally, as discussed above, Ms. Dudley testified that she had never given respondent permission to sign her name or file documents on her behalf.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the basis of this evidence, we agree with the JTC that respondent signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on legal documents absent Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission and filed these documents with the court, also without Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">3. COUNT THREE: MISREPRESENTATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Both the master and the JTC found that respondent made factual misrepresentations to the JTC. We agree. Specifically, both the master and the JTC found that respondent lied to the JTC about: (a) having contacted Judge Brennan\u2019s court on only four occasions; (b) having never been told by Judge Brennan\u2019s staff that it was improper for her to make calls to them while she was represented by counsel; and (c) having Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to affix her signature to the motion filed on May 5, 2011. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Judge Brennan\u2019s secretary, Kirsten Turner, testified that there were between five to fifteen occasions on which respondent called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers and she (Kirsten Turner) answered the telephone. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>addition, Judge Brennan\u2019s clerk, Ryan Matthews, testified that there were between six to eight occasions on which respondent called Judge Brennan\u2019s chamber and he (Ryan Turner) answered the telephone. Both Ms. Turner and Mr. Matthews also testified that when respondent called while she was represented, they told her that she had to call her attorney and have her attorney call the office. On the basis of this evidence, we agree with and adopt the master\u2019s and JTC\u2019s findings that respondent lied to the JTC about having contacted Judge Brennan\u2019s court on only four occasions and having never been told by Judge Brennan\u2019s staff that it was improper for her to call them while she was represented by counsel. And, for the reasons already discussed with regard to count two, we agree with and adopt the master\u2019s and JTC\u2019s finding that respondent lied to the JTC about having Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to affix her signature to the motion filed on May 5, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The JTC also found that respondent lied to the JTC about: (a) having Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to file pleadings on her behalf; (b) having supplied a copy of the motion to Ms. Dudley; and (c) having supplied a copy of the notice of the hearing to Ms. Dudley. We agree. As already discussed above with regard to count two, Ms. Dudley testified that she never gave respondent permission to file pleadings on her behalf and respondent never supplied her with a copy of the motion or the notice of the hearing. Respondent\u2019s former attorney, Ms. Burns, testified that respondent had done the same thing to her- signed her name on a motion without her permission, filed the motion without her permission, and never provided her with a copy of the motion. After respondent signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on the legal documents and filed them, respondent sent Ms. Dudley an email stating, \u201cI tried contacting you earlier this week to obtain permission to file a quick pleading on my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>behalf under your name.\u201d This email demonstrates that respondent was aware that she did not have Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to file the pleading under her name at the time that she filed it. Ms. Dudley testified that she did not know that respondent had filed pleadings under her name until respondent\u2019s now ex-husband\u2019s attorney, William Brukoff, called her to discuss the pleadings. At this point, Ms. Dudley asked Mr. Brukoff to send her copies of the pleadings, and he did. According to Ms. Dudley, the only copies of the pleadings that she received were the ones sent to her by Mr. Brukoff. On the basis of this evidence, we agree with and adopt the JTC\u2019s findings that respondent lied to the JTC about: (a) having Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to file pleadings on her behalf; (b) having supplied a copy of the motion to Ms. Dudley; and (c) having supplied a copy of the notice of the hearing to Ms. Dudley.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In addition to the factual misrepresentations identified by the JTC, we find that respondent also testified falsely about several other matters of varying significance. In one instance, respondent testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have control over scheduling\u201d the March 16th hearing, and that she did not find out about this hearing until late on March 15th. However, Mr. Matthews testified that both parties were required to consent to the hearing date, and Ms. Dudley testified that she had told respondent about the March 16th hearing as early as March 11th, but no later than March 14th. Respondent also testified that she had never referred to herself as \u201cJudge Adams\u201d when she called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers. Yet Mr. Matthews testified that \u201cthe majority of time[s]\u201d that respondent called, she had referred to herself in this manner. Finally, respondent testified that she sent the May 5th email to Ms. Dudley about how she had tried to contact Ms. Dudley to obtain her permission to file a pleading under Ms. Dudley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>name because she was \u201ctrying to give [Ms. Dudley] another opportunity to file the motion\u201d and respondent \u201cwas busy and.. . needed [Ms. Dudley] to do it.\u201d However, given that the motion had already been filed by respondent at the time this email was sent, it is clear that respondent did not send the email for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The JTC concluded that respondent violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1), MCR 9.104(A), MCR 9.208(B), and Canons 1 and 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. After reviewing the record and hearing oral arguments, we agree with and adopt the JTC\u2019s conclusions of law. Respondent violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by testifying falsely under oath in Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom and also by lying under oath during the JTC proceedings. She violated MCR 9.104(A)(l)-(5) by engaging in \u201cconduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice;\u201d \u201cconduct that exposes the legal profession or the court to obloquy, contempt, censure, or reproach;\u201d \u201cconduct that is contrary to justice, ethics, honesty, or good morals;\u201d \u201cconduct that violates the standards or rules of professional responsibility adopted by the Supreme Court;\u201d and \u201cconduct that violates a criminal law of a state or of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Respondent also violated MCR 9.104(A)(6) by making a \u201cknowing misrepresentation of any facts or circumstances surrounding a request for investigation or complaint,\u201d and she violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>MCR 9.208 by lying to the JTC.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Respondent violated Canon 1 by failing to maintain \u201chigh standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, respondent violated Canon 2 by failing to \u201cavoid impropriety and appearance of impropriety\u201d and by failing to \u201crespect and observe the law.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">C. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The purpose of judicial disciplinary proceedings is to \u201cprotect the people from corruption and abuse on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>part of those who wield judicial power.\u201d <em>In re Leon Jenkins, </em>437 Mich 15, 28; 465 NW2d 317 (1991). \u201cIn determining appropriate sanctions, we seek to \u2018restore and maintain the dignity and impartiality of the judiciary and to protect the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re James, </em>492 Mich at 569, quoting <em>In re Ferrara, </em>458 Mich 350, 372; 582 NW2d 817 (1998). We agree with the JTC\u2019s assessment of the <em>Brown </em>factors- the considerations that this Court set forth to guide the formation of judicial-discipline recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The first <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that is part of a pattern or practice is more serious than an isolated instance of misconduct.\u201d <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1292. As the JTC explained, \u201cRespondent\u2019s acts of calling Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers while represented, after Respondent had been warned not to do so, and her repeated unauthorized signing of her attorneys\u2019 names, Ms. Burns and Ms. Dudley, to various documents during the course of Respondent\u2019s divorce constituted a pattern and practice of misconduct during that period.\u201d In addition, respondent engaged in a pattern or practice of testifying falsely. To begin with, respondent repeatedly testified falsely under oath in Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom. Respondent did not just <em>mistakenly </em>state that she had not called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers on March 15, 2011. Instead, she repeatedly and quite vehemently denied ever calling Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers while she was represented by counsel. Further, she lied to the JTC about a variety of different matters, such as the number of times she had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers, whether anybody in Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers had told her that it was improper for her to call there while she was represented by counsel, whether she had Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to sign her name and file pleadings on her behalf, whether she had provided a copy of the motion and notice of hearing to Ms. Dudley, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>when she was notified about the March 16th hearing, whether she referred to herself as \u201cJudge Adams\u201d when she called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers, and why she had sent the May 5th email to Ms. Dudley. And now, respondent continues to lie to this Court about the very same matters. She continues to shirk any responsibility for her wrongdoings or express any indication of remorse. Although she now admits that she did call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers, she claims that she did not intentionally testify falsely under oath when she vehemently and repeatedly denied calling Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers because she simply misunderstood Judge Brennan\u2019s questions. We believe this is disingenuous. As both the master and the JTC, and now this Court, have each concluded, this excuse is wholly unbelievable given the reality of the exchange that took place between Judge Brennan and respondent. Respondent lied to Judge Brennan, lied to the JTC, lied to the master, and lied to this Court. Therefore, respondent did not just engage in an \u201cisolated instance of misconduct.\u201d As Justice YOUNG offered in <em>In re Noecker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">Where a respondent judge readily acknowledges his [or her] shortcomings and is completely honest and forthcoming during the course of the Judicial Tenure Commission investigation,... the sanction correspondingly can be less severe. However, where a respondent is not repentant, but engages in deceitful behavior during the course of a Judicial Tenure Commission disciplinary investigation, the sanction must be measurably greater. <em>[In re Noecker, </em>472 Mich 1, 18; 691 NW2d 440 (2005) (YOUNG, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The second <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct on the bench is usually more serious than the same misconduct off the bench.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, we agree with the JTC that although there is no evidence that respondent committed misconduct on the bench, she did \u201cattempt[] to leverage her position as a [Wayne County Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Court] judge in order to obtain special treatment not available to other non-judicial litigants.\u201d Despite being told by her attorney that Judge Brennan\u2019s staff stated that the March 16, 2011 hearing could not be rescheduled, respondent took it upon herself to personally call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers in an attempt to reschedule the hearing. In addition, although respondent\u2019s misconduct did not occur while she herself was on the bench, she did repeatedly testify falsely under oath in a courtroom, with all the gravity that such a venue should communicate, especially to a judge, in response to questions asked of her by a judge on the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The third <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that is prejudicial to the actual administration of justice is more serious than misconduct that is prejudicial only to the appearance of propriety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293. We agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s misconduct was prejudicial to the actual administration of justice. Indeed, there is not much, if anything, that is more prejudicial to the actual administration of justice than testifying falsely under oath. Similarly, the fourth <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that does not implicate the actual administration of justice, or its appearance of impropriety, is less serious than misconduct that does.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, we agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s misconduct implicated the actual administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The fifth <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that occurs spontaneously is less serious than misconduct that is premeditated or deliberated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While respondent\u2019s lying under oath in Judge Brennan\u2019s courtroom may not have been premeditated, her continuingly disingenuous protestations before both the JTC and this Court of not having done this intentionally were most certainly premeditated, as were her other false statements before the JTC and this Court. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>although respondent\u2019s initial false testimony about never having called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers while she was represented may have been \u201cspontaneous,\u201d all of her lies thereafter were made after she had time to reflect upon these matters, i.e., after periods of \u201cdeliberations.\u201d Respondent deliberately lied about: (a) misunderstanding Judge Brennan\u2019s questions; (b) how many times she had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers; (c) whether anybody in Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers had told her that it was improper for her to call Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers while she was represented by counsel; (d) whether she had Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission to sign her name and file pleadings on her behalf; (e) whether she had provided a copy of the motion and notice of hearing to Ms. Dudley; (f) when she was notified about the March 16th hearing; (g) whether she referred to herself as \u201cJudge Adams\u201d when she called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers; and (h) why she had sent the May 5th email to Ms. Dudley. Respondent\u2019s signing of Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on legal documents and filing them with the court without Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission was also premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The sixth <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy, or to reach the most just result in such a case, is more serious than misconduct that merely delays such discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Testifying falsely under oath- conduct in which respondent repeatedly engaged- is certainly \u201cmisconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finally, the seventh <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>background, gender, or religion are more serious than breaches of justice that do not disparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no evidence that respondent did anything to \u201cdisparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Despite finding that at least five of the <em>Brown </em>factors weigh in favor of more severe sanctions, and despite recognizing that testifying falsely under oath is the \u201cantithesis of judicial integrity,\u201d <em>In re </em>James, 492 Mich at 582 (Markman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), the JTC concluded that a suspension for 180 days without pay would constitute a sufficient sanction. We respectfully disagree. We do not believe that such a sanction would sufficiently address the harm done to the integrity of the judiciary.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, just last term this Court held that testifying falsely under oath \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>entirely incompatible with judicial office and warrants removal.\u201d <em>In re Justin, </em>490 Mich 394, 419; 809 NW2d 126 (2012).

An oath is a significant act, establishing that the oath taker promises to be truthful. As the \u201cfocal point of the administration of justice,\u201d a judge is entrusted by the public and has the responsibility to seek truth and justice by evaluating the testimony given under oath. When a judge lies under oath, he or she has failed to internalize one of the central standards of justice and becomes unfit to sit in judgment of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">Certainly, Judicial Tenure Commission proceedings are intended to be remedial, not penal. The vast majority of misconduct found by the Judicial Tenure Commission is not fatal; rather, it reflects oversight or poor judgment on the part of a fallible human being who is a judge. However, some misconduct, such as lying under oath, goes to the very core of judicial duty and demonstrates the lack of character of such a person to be entrusted with judicial privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">... Lying under oath, as the respondent has been adjudged to have done, makes him unfit for judicial office.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 424, quoting <em>In re Noecker, </em>472 Mich at 17-18 (Young, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201cJudges occupying the watchtower of our system of justice, should preserve, if not uplift, the standard of truth, not trample it underfoot or hide in its shady recesses.\u201d <em>In re Ferrara, </em>458 Mich at 372. \u201cThe effectiveness of our judicial system is dependent upon the public\u2019s trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a judge lies under oath, the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the judiciary is seriously eroded. <em>In re Noecker, </em>472 Mich at 13; <em>In re Ferrara, </em>458 at 364 (\u201cWhen a judge\u2019s character and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>morals come into question not only do the people lose respect for him as a person, but worse, respect for the Court over which he presides is lost as well.\u201d).

That is, the master could have found that respondent signed Ms. Dudley\u2019s name on the motion and filed it without Ms. Dudley\u2019s permission without having to also find that respondent did this with an \u201cintent to injure or defraud.\u201d We agree. We do not have to find that respondent violated a criminal statute to conclude that respondent engaged in judicial misconduct worthy of a sanction. See <em>In re Halloran, </em>466 Mich 1219, 1220; 647 NW2d 505 (2002) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has found a judge\u2019s conduct to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct without regard to whether criminal charges were filed, or even in cases in which a judge has been acquitted in criminal proceedings.\u201d). Similarly, respondent\u2019s contention that the JTC violated Michigan\u2019s \u2018separation of powers\u2019 doctrine, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, by charging respondent with felony violations is meritless. Although the JTC clearly does not possess the authority to bring criminal charges against a judge, it just as clearly <em>does </em>possess the authority to investigate and adjudicate the conduct of judges, including conduct that may also involve violations of criminal laws. See Canon 2(B) of the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct (\u201cA judge should respect and observe the law.\u201d); <em>In re Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517, 528; 243 NW2d 86 (1976) (\u201cThe proceedings of the [JTC] are investigatory and advisory and are not binding upon the Supreme Court. No determination of criminal guilt is made, but merely a determination of the [JTC\u2019s] view of the conformity of the subject of investigation to the state constitutional standards for judicial office. Similarly, the resulting Order of the Supreme Court does not operate as a sanction for criminal guilt but as a judgment on judicial fitness.\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> The JTC did not address the allegation that respondent lied to the JTC about having been walking away from counsel\u2019s table on her way out of the courtroom when Judge Brennan asked respondent about calling her chambers the day before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\"> MCR 9.205(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">In addition to any other sanction imposed, a judge maybe ordered to pay the costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the commission in prosecuting the complaint only if the judge engaged in conduct involving fraud, deceit, or intentional misrepresentation, or if the judge made misleading statements to the commission, the commission\u2019s investigators, the master, or the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b268-12\"> \u201c[I]t is the JTC\u2019s, not the master\u2019s conclusions and recommendations that are ultimately subject to review by this Court.\u201d <em>In re Chrzanowski, </em>465 Mich 468, 481; 636 NW2d 758 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\"> Respondent argues that she was not under oath when she was asked about the telephone call.

Respondent remained at counsel\u2019s table during the entire proceeding, she did not leave the courtroom, and she was not at any point told that she was no longer under oath. Indeed, when respondent indicated that she had not spoken to anyone in Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers the day before, Judge Brennan had her secretary, Kirsten Turner, brought into the courtroom and made it a point to place Ms. Turner under oath before asking Ms. Turner whether someone had called Judge Brennan\u2019s chambers the day before and identified herself as Judge Adams.

During the JTC proceedings, the examiner urged the JTC to recommend removal as the appropriate sanction, but the nine commissioners of the JTC unanimously determined that the sanction of a 180-day suspension without pay was adequate to address respondent\u2019s misconduct in this case. The JTC reasonably concluded that only five out of the seven <em>Brown </em>factors indicated that respondent\u2019s misconduct was more serious. I think it is also significant that the JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s actions were not part of a pattern or practice throughout her judicial career. Respondent\u2019s misconduct was not isolated to a single incident, but it was isolated in the sense that all of respondent\u2019s misconduct arose out of her personal divorce proceedings. It is clear from the record that those proceedings were contentious and emotionally difficult. Further, and not least of all, there is no allegation that respondent\u2019s misconduct carried over to the performance of her duties as a judicial officer. These facts do not justify or excuse respondent\u2019s misconduct in any way, but they do indicate that it is unlikely respondent will engage in similar misconduct in the future, or that her misconduct will infect the performance of her judicial duties, especially after enduring a 180-day suspension and the public proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>For all these reasons, and considering the entire factual context of this case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I am not persuaded that the JTC\u2019s unanimous recommendation that respondent be suspended for 180 days without pay is inadequate to serve the purposes of judicial discipline.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, I would accord the JTC\u2019s recommendation considerable deference,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and adopt its recommended sanction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with McCormack, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> <em>In re </em>Brown, 461 Mich 1291, 1292-1293; 625 NW2d 744 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> While I dissent from section III(C), I share the majority\u2019s concern about the propriety of the JTC examiner\u2019s conduct before this Court, as expressed in footnote 19 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> See <em>In re Kapcia, </em>389 Mich 306, 311; 205 NW2d 436 (1973) (noting that Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30 contemplates that the JTC and this Court will make individualized determinations on the entire factual context).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> <em>See In re Chrzanowski, </em>465 Mich 468, 487-488; 636 NW2d 758 (2001), citing <em>In re Hocking, </em>451 Mich 1, 24; 546 NW2d 234 (1996); <em>Matter of Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517, 527; 243 NW2d 86 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> See <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1293; <em>Chrzanowski, </em>465 Mich at 488. I agree with the majority that this Court is not hound by the JTC\u2019s recommendations but it is not clear to me in this case why we should replace the JTC\u2019s recommendation of 180 days with removal. If a lengthier suspension would be more appropriate, there is a lot of ground between 180 days and removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
