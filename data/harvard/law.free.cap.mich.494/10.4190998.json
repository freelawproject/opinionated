We conclude that defendant is only required to pay for the modifications because only the modifications are allowable expenses \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a). Because the base price of the van is an ordinary transportation expense \u2014 an expense that is as necessary for the uninjured as the injured \u2014 and is easily separated from the modifications, defendant is not required to pay for it under the no-fault insurance act. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to the extent it held otherwise. Furthermore, at the trial court, plaintiff, Kenneth Admire, never argued that defendant had contractually agreed to reimburse him for the base price of the van, thereby waiving that issue. Thus, we need not determine whether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the parties\u2019 agreement was ambiguous, and we vacate that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. Plaintiffs application for leave to appeal as cross-appellant is denied, and the case is remanded to the trial court for entry of summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In 1987, plaintiff suffered catastrophic injuries when the motorcycle he was riding collided with a car being operated by an insured of defendant. Plaintiffs injuries left him unable to speak or walk and rendered his entire right side virtually useless. A family member tends to all of plaintiffs personal and financial affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Plaintiff requires wheelchair-accessible transportation to go to work five days a week, visit his family, attend medical appointments, and get around the community. On three prior occasions, defendant agreed to pay the full cost of purchasing a van large enough for plaintiff to get in and out while remaining in his wheelchair. Defendant also agreed to pay the cost of modifying the vehicle to make it wheelchair-accessible. In 1988, 1994, and 2000, plaintiff and defendant entered into contracts under which defendant purchased a van and paid for the necessary modifications with the expectation that the van would last for seven years. At the end of the van\u2019s life, plaintiff would give defendant notice of his intent to purchase a new van, and the parties would enter a new agreement. The most recent \u201cTransportation Purchase Agreement\u201d was executed on April 26,2000. It specified that plaintiff was to notify defendant 60 days before purchasing a new van and that the old van\u2019s value would be applied to the purchase price of the new van.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In December 2006, plaintiff, through his guardian, notified defendant that it was time to purchase a new van. In January 2007, defendant informed plaintiff by letter that it had determined that it was not obligated to pay the base purchase price of a new van under the transportation purchase agreement or the no-fault insurance act. Defendant acknowledged that, pursuant to the transportation purchase agreement, the \u201ccurrent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>van should be traded in toward the price of a new van\u201d should plaintiff choose to purchase a new van himself. Defendant further stated that it would \u201cpay for the necessary medical modifications needed on any vehicle purchased... as well as . . . any medical mileage incurred in relation to Mr. Admire\u2019s motor vehicle accident . . . .\u201d Plaintiffs guardian purchased the van for him, and after the modifications were reimbursed and the trade-in value was applied, plaintiff was left with out-of-pocket expenses of $18,388.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Plaintiff sued defendant for reimbursement of the $18,388.50, claiming that it was an allowable expense under Michigan\u2019s no-fault insurance act. Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffith v State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance </em>Co<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required it to pay for medically necessary modifications, but not the base price of the van. Plaintiff argued that conflicting precedent interpreted the no-fault insurance act to require reimbursement for the entire modified van. The Ingham Circuit Court denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition and instead granted summary disposition in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Defendant appealed by right in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in an unpublished decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In dicta, the Court of Appeals panel concluded that the transportation purchase agreement was ambiguous regarding who had the responsibility to pay the base price of a new van:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">On its face, the contract does not provide that defendant is required to buy a new van. It says that the van shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>traded in on a replacement van but it does not say that defendant will pay for the replacement. However, the contract also does not say that plaintiff is responsible for buying the new van.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Accordingly, the panel held that \u201cthe trial court erred in evidently concluding that the transportation purchase agreement mandated that it grant summary disposition to plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The Court of Appeals panel then proceeded to address whether Michigan\u2019s no-fault insurance act required reimbursement for both the purchase price of a van and the modifications to accommodate the insured\u2019s disability. Defendant again relied primarily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffith, </em>which held that the no-fault insurance act did not require the insurer to reimburse the insured for food costs absent evidence that the food was somehow different than what was required before the plaintiffs accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So, reasoned defendant, the base price of the van was not compensable because plaintiff required transportation before and after the accident; the modifications were, however, compensable because they were not required before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The panel disagreed with defendant\u2019s characterization of <em>Griffith, </em>instead relying on its own decision in <em>Begin v Michigan Bell Telephone Co.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As in this case, <em>Begin </em>involved an insurer that had refused to compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>sate a claimant for a modified van. The panel in this case agreed with the reasoning in <em>Begin </em>that a van and its modifications are \u201cso blended . . . that the whole cost is an allowable expense if it satisfies the statutory criteria for being sufficiently related to injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, like the <em>Begin </em>Court, the panel reasoned that a modified van was more like food provided at a care facility (which <em>Griffith </em>acknowledged was covered by the no-fault insurance act) than ordinary food eaten at home by an injured person (which <em>Griffith </em>determined was not covered). The panel concluded that because plaintiff could not drive an unmodified vehicle, unlike the <em>Griffith </em>plaintiff who could still eat ordinary food, the modified vehicle must be covered in its entirety.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Defendant sought leave to appeal. After hearing oral arguments on the application,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we granted leave to appeal to determine whether the no-fault insurance act requires reimbursement for the entire cost of the modified vehicle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Whether MCL 500.3107(l)(a) requires an insurer to reimburse an insured claimant for the full cost of a vehicle and modifications necessary to accommodate the insured claimant\u2019s disability is a question of statutory interpretation that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">A. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">MCL 500.3107(l)(a) permits an injured person to recover personal injury protection (PIP) benefits from an insurer for \u201c[allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d This Court has often been called on to determine the reach of this provision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This case particularly implicates our 2005 decision in <em>Griffith, </em>in which we interpreted the clause \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s husband in <em>Griffith, </em>Douglas Griffith, suffered from severe brain damage stemming from a motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For the duration of Griffith\u2019s hospitalization and his stay at a 24-hour nursing facility, his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, covered ordinary expenses, including Griffith\u2019s food.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On his return home he still required assistance with basic tasks like eating and bathing. State Farm refused to reimburse the plaintiff for Griffith\u2019s food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>because it determined that the food costs were not an \u201callowable expense\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In determining whether the particular expense was for \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation,\u2019 \u201d this Court defined the terms \u201ccare,\u201d \u201crecovery,\u201d and \u201crehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This Court gave \u201crecoveiy\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d their dictionary definitions, defining \u201crecovery\u201d as \u201c \u2018restoration or return to any former and better condition, [especially] to health from sickness, injury, addiction, etc.,\u2019 \u201d and \u201crehabilitate\u201d as \u201c \u2018to restore or bring to a condition of good health, ability to work, or productive activity.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Defining \u201ccare\u201d required this Court to consider the term\u2019s meaning in light of the statutory terms \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">Generally, \u201ccare\u201d means \u201cprotection; charge,\u201d and \u201cto make provision.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). Thus, taken in isolation, the word \u201ccare\u201d can be broadly construed to encompass <em>anything </em>that is reasonably necessary to the provision of a person\u2019s protection or charge. But we have consistently held that \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002). Therefore, we must neither read \u201ccare\u201d so broadly as to render nugatory \u201crecoveiy and rehabilitation\u201d nor construe \u201ccare\u201d so narrowly that the term is mere surplusage. \u201cCare\u201d must have a meaning that is related to, but distinct from, \u201crecovery and rehabilitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>As an initial matter, it is important to note that the statute does not require compensation for any item that is reasonably necessary to a person\u2019s care in general. Instead, the statute specifically limits compensation to charges for products or services that are reasonably necessary \u201cfor an <em>injured person\u2019s </em>care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This context suggests that \u201ccare\u201d must be related to the insured\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cCare\u201d must have a meaning that is broader than \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d but is not so broad as to render those terms nugatory. As noted above, both \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d refer to an underlying injury; likewise, the statute as a whole applies only to an \u201cinjured person.\u201d It follows that the Legislature intended to limit the scope of the term \u201ccare\u201d to expenses for those products, services, or accommodations whose provision is necessitated by the injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident. \u201cCare\u201d is broader than \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d because it may encompass expenses for products, services, and accommodations that are necessary because of the accident but that may not restore a person to his preinjury state.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Having determined at the outset that Griffith\u2019s food could not be for recovery or rehabilitation because it lacked curative properties, this Court proceeded to explain that ordinary food also could not be for Grif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fith\u2019s care. This Court determined that Griffith\u2019s food costs failed to satisfy the requirements of MCL 500.3107(l)(a) because the food was Griffith\u2019s \u201cordinary means of sustenance\u201d and \u201cif Griffith had never sustained, or were to fully recover from, his injuries, his dietary needs would be no different than they are now.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, this Court concluded, the food costs were not an allowable expense under the statute.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">This Court drew an important distinction between ordinary food eaten by an injured person at home and ordinary food provided by a hospital during the injured person\u2019s stay, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">it is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for an insured to consume hospital food during in-patient treatment given the limited dining options available. Although an injured person would need to consume food regardless of his injuries, he would not need to eat <em>that particular food </em>or bear the cost associated with it. Thus, hospital food is analogous to a type of special diet or select diet necessary for an injured person\u2019s recovery. Because an insured in an institutional setting is required to eat \u201chospital food,\u201d such food costs are necessary for an insured\u2019s \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d while in such a setting. Once an injured person leaves the institutional setting, however, he may resume eating a normal diet just as he would have had he not suffered any injury and is no longer required to bear the costs of hospital food, which are part of the unqualified unit cost of hospital treatment.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">This Court specifically noted that MCL 500.3107(l)(a) requires insurers to cover hospital food as an allowable expense for the care of an injured person because the person is required to eat hospital food precisely because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>his or her need for care in the hospital.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, this Court concluded that requiring an insurer to reimburse the insured for ordinary, everyday expenses merely because of a remote relationship to the insured\u2019s care undermines the no-fault insurance act\u2019s goal of cost containment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Several Court of Appeals decisions have attempted to interpret MCL 500.3107(1)(a) in light of <em>Griffith, </em>yet they have taken inconsistent approaches in <em>Griffith\u2019s </em>application. For instance, the Court of Appeals applied <em>Griffith </em>to housing expenses in <em>Ward v Titan Insurance </em>Co.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The majority adopted an incremental approach to allowable expenses and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">Under the <em>Griffith </em>analysis, plaintiffs housing costs are only compensable to the extent that those costs became greater as a result of the accident. Plaintiff must show that his housing expenses are different from those of an uninjured person, for example, by showing that the rental cost for handicapped accessible housing is higher than the rental cost of ordinary housing. In the absence of that kind of factual record, the trial court erred by concluding that plaintiff was entitled to housing costs compensation merely on the basis of the amount plaintiff was currently paying in rent, for a residence that the record does not even demonstrate was handicapped accessible.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">As a result, the court reversed the trial court\u2019s award of the entire amount of the insured\u2019s postinjury housing, instead holding that an insurer is only liable for the increase in housing costs attributable to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Similarly, in <em>Hoover v Michigan Mutual Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals applied <em>Griffith </em>to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>household expenses, including real estate tax bills, utility bills, homeowner\u2019s insurance, home maintenance, telephone bills, and security system costs. The <em>Hoover </em>Court understood <em>Griffith </em>as requiring \u201cbut for\u201d causation between the claimed expense and the injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">At its core, the holding in <em>Griffith </em>requires a court to determine whether expenses would not have been incurred <em>but for </em>the accident and resulting injuries. Stated otherwise, the question is whether the expenses would have been incurred in the course of an ordinary life unmarred by an accident. And if they would have been incurred, like the ordinary food costs at issue in <em>Griffith, </em>a causal connection between the expenses and the accidental bodily injury would be lacking and it could not be said that the act of providing products, services, and accommodations was necessitated by the accidental bodily injury.[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The <em>Hoover </em>Court understood <em>Griffith </em>as requiring a comparison of the injured person\u2019s preinjury expenses to the injured person\u2019s postinjury expenses, with the insurer covering the difference.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">But the Court of Appeals adopted a different approach in <em>Begin, </em>which presented a similar factual situation to the instant case: a dispute over whether an insurer was responsible for the base price of a van for the insured plaintiff.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The <em>Begin </em>Court disavowed any interpretation of <em>Griffith </em>that required a comparison to the injured person\u2019s preinjury expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">[T]he <em>Griffith </em>Court, when discussing the cost of food provided to an injured person in an institutional setting, did not suggest that only the marginal increase in the cost of such food served in an institutional setting would be an allowable expense. Nor did the Court suggest that only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>marginal cost of modifying regular shoes would be a recoverable \u201callowable expense\u201d under MCL 500.3107(1)(a). Rather, in each example, the product, service, or accommodation used by the injured person before the accident is so blended with another product, service, or accommodation that the whole cost is an allowable expense if it satisfies the statutory criteria of being sufficiently related to injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident and if it is a reasonable charge and reasonably necessary for the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation under MCL 500.3107(1)(a).[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Thus, <em>Begin </em>held, if a particular product, service, or accommodation satisfies the requirements of MCL 500.3107(1)(a), then the insurer must also cover as \u201callowable expenses\u201d all associated expenses that are \u201cblended\u201d with the qualifying expense.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This view directly conflicts with the \u201csetoff\u201d analysis promulgated in <em>Ward </em>and <em>Hoover. </em>Because the statutory language plainly cannot support these divergent interpretations, we now seek to clarify the reach of MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">B. INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">As stated, MCL 500.3107(1)(a) permits an injured person to recover PIP benefits from an insurer for, \u201c[allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d Under <em>Griffith, </em>this provision requires that \u201can \u2018allowable expense\u2019 must be \u2018for\u2019 one of the following: (1) an injured person\u2019s care, (2) his recovery, or (3) his rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>This case requires us to clarify when a particular product, service, or accommodation is actually \u201cfor\u201d the injured person\u2019s \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d In this context, the word \u201cfor\u201d as a preposition \u201cimplies a causal connection\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and is defined as \u201c \u2018with the object or purpose of. . ..\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Accordingly, a claimant can recover as an allowable expense the charge for a product, service, or accommodation that has the object or purpose of effectuating the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. The causal connection is further implied in the statutoxy language making compensable only those products, services, or accommodations that are \u201cfor an <em>injured person\u2019s </em>care, recovery, and rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This language suggests that any product, service, or accommodation consumed by an <em>uninjured person </em>over the course of his or her everyday life cannot qualify because it lacks the requisite causal connection with effectuating the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. An ordinary, everyday expense simply cannot have the object or purpose of effectuating an <em>injured person\u2019s care, </em>recovery, or rehabilitation because it is incurred by <em>everyone </em>whether injured or not. For instance, <em>Griffith </em>explained that \u201cthe food that Griffith consumes is simply an ordinary means of sustenance rather than a treatment for his \u2018care, recovery, or rehabilitation,\u2019 \u201d because \u201cif Griffith had never sustained, or were to fully recover from, his injuries, his dietary needs would be no different than they are now.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In sum, an ordinary, everyday product, service, or accommodation is not compensable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>MCL 500.3107(1)(a) because that expense cannot <em>he for </em>the claimant\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Further, nothing in the statutory language of MCL 500.3107(1)(a) supports the notion that postinjury allowable expenses should be reduced by the margin of the injured person\u2019s preinjury expenses of the same character. Complying with MCL 500.3107(1)(a) and determining what products, services, and accommodations are actually <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation requires a careful examination of the injured person\u2019s postaccident expenses. A mere change in the injured person\u2019s postaccident expenses is insufficient to satisfy MCL 500.3107(1)(a); the new expense must be of a wholly different essential character than expenses borne by the person before the accident to show that it is <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. But if an expense is new in its essential character, and thus actually <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation, MCL 500.3107(1)(a) requires that it be covered in full regardless of whether the expense represents an increase or decrease in the injured person\u2019s preaccident costs.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Indeed, the provision states that allowable expenses consist of <em>\u201call </em>reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>products, services and accommodations . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thus, if a product, service, or accommodation satisfies the statutory criteria, it is <em>fully </em>compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Special accommodations or modifications to an ordinary item present a particular challenge. A \u201ccombined\u201d product or accommodation results from an ordinary expense, unchanged as a result of the injury, being joined with an accommodation or product that is actually <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. An \u201cintegrated\u201d product or accommodation involves the blending of an ordinary expense with one that is for the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation in a way that the resulting product or accommodation cannot be separated easily into unit costs. Unlike an integrated product or accommodation, a combined product or accommodation can be separated easily, both conceptually and physically, so that the fact-finder can identify which costs are of a new character and are thus <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation and which costs are ordinary, everyday expenses that are unchanged after the accident. As this Court suggested in <em>Griffith, </em>MCL 500.3107(1)(a) requires the insurer to cover a truly integrated product or accommodation in full because the entire expense, including the portions that might otherwise be considered ordinary, is necessary for the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> But because a combined product or accommodation can be easily separated into components related to the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation and components unrelated to that care, recovery, or rehabilitation, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>related expenses are actually compensable.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> MCL 500.3107(1)(a) mandates this result because, when the product or accommodation can be easily separated into an ordinary expense and an expense <em>for </em>care, recovery, or rehabilitation, requiring the insurer to pay for the ordinary expenses would destroy the cost-containment aspect of the no-fault insurance act, something of which this Court has long been mindful.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">This analysis is consistent with this Court\u2019s application of MCL 500.3107(1)(a) in <em>Griffith. </em>In its discussion of insurance coverage for hospital food during the insured\u2019s hospital stay, the <em>Griffith </em>Court stated that compensation was required because the insured was required to eat <em>\u201cthat particular </em>food.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This is an example of an integrated accommodation. The food, clothing, shelter, and any other ordinary products that are provided by the hospital as part and parcel of the hospital stay are not easily separated from the products, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>services, and accommodations provided by the hospital for the injured person\u2019s care. Thus, the statute requires the insurer to pay the entire cost. The same could be said for the custom medical shoes briefly discussed in <em>Griffith.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When a medical products company produces a custom shoe, the shoe is an integrated product because the medical nature of the shoe, which is for the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation, cannot be separated from the ordinary need for shoes by an uninjured person. Thus, the entire cost of the shoe is an allowable expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In sum, MCL 500.3107(1)(a) only requires an insurer to pay for products, services, and accommodations that are reasonably necessary to the object or purpose of \u201can injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d Post-accident expenses of a wholly new essential character satisfy the statutorily required causal connection that expenses be <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. Ordinary expenses that are the same for an injured and an uninjured person are not recoverable at all because the claimant cannot show that the expense is <em>for </em>his or her care, recovery, or rehabilitation. However, if an expense satisfies the statute, then it is recoverable in full; there is no setoff based on the injured person\u2019s preinjury expenses of the same character. Some products, services, or accommodations might otherwise be ordinary but are so integrated with a product, service, or accommodation that is actually <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation that the entire product, service, or accommodation must be included as an allowable expense under MCL 500.3107(l)(a). But if the ordinary expense is merely combined with a product, service, or accommodation for the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>a way that is physically and conceptually separable, the ordinary expense fails to satisfy the statute and is not compensable.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Applying this standard here, we conclude that the base price of the van is not an allowable expense under MCL 500.3107(1)(a). The statute only entitles plaintiff to reimbursement for products, services, and accommodations that are actually for his care, recovery, or rehabilitation, and only the van\u2019s modifications rise to that standard. The base price of the van is an ordinary transportation expense of the same essential character as plaintiff would have incurred regardless of whether he was injured in an accident. While plaintiffs choice of transportation before his injury might not have been a van, the essential character of plaintiffs preinjury need for transportation has not changed. Like Griffith\u2019s need for sustenance, had plaintiff never sustained his injury, or were he to fully recover, his need for ordinary transportation would be unchanged. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>statute does not require that defendant reimburse plaintiff for the base price of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Certain transportation expenses may be recoverable under MCL 500.3107(1)(a) because they are part of plaintiffs care, recovery, or rehabilitation. For instance, plaintiff requires some form of transportation to and from his medical appointments. Medically necessary transportation needs represent a change in character from plaintiffs preinjury requirements because the trips would not have been necessary in a life unmarred by injury. But by paying for the van\u2019s modifications and so-called medical mileage, defendant has met its statutory obligations. Indeed, defendant has made it possible \u2014 through mileage and modifications \u2014 for plaintiff to use his otherwise ordinary transportation to reach medical appointments. But plaintiff cannot show that the van itself, an ordinary form of transportation, is actually for his care, recovery, or rehabilitation. Thus, MCL 500.3107(1)(a) does not require defendant to compensate plaintiff for the base price of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffith </em>leads inexorably to this result. The van itself is akin to the food that Griffith was eating at home. The character of plaintiffs general need for transportation \u2014 like Griffith\u2019s food requirements \u2014 did not change as a result of the accident. And unlike the hospital food in <em>Griffith, </em>the van does not constitute an integrated product because the modified van, as a whole, was not actually for plaintiffs care, recovery, or rehabilitation. Hospital food is com-pensable because the injured person is required to eat <em>that particular food </em>during the hospital stay for his or her care and recovery.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Court likened hospital food to a special diet.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> But plaintiff only requires <em>some form </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of transportation for his care, not any <em>particular form, </em>so his transportation needs are not akin to a special diet. Indeed, if defendant provided plaintiff with a taxi service that accounted for his disability, defendant would only be required to provide that service for those trips that had the object or purpose of plaintiffs care, recovery, or rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The parties agreed that plaintiff should have a vehicle with modifications as the means for transporting plaintiff on his medically necessary trips. But because the van and the modifications are easily separable, we must determine which expenses are actually for plaintiffs care, recovery, and rehabilitation and which are not.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The modifications indisputably have the object or purpose of effectuating plaintiffs care, recovery, or rehabilitation because without the modifications plaintiff could not make use of his ordinary transportation for medically necessary trips. Thus, defendant was required to and did compensate plaintiff for the cost of the modifications pursuant to MCL 500.3107(1)(a). But the van is just a van; and while a van may not have been plaintiffs transportation preference, it remains an ordinary means of transportation used by the injured and uninjured alike.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Because the character of plaintiffs ordinary transportation needs remains unchanged, he is free to meet those needs in the way that best suits him. If plaintiff had already owned a van, defendant could have modified that van. If plaintiff wanted a Mercedes van, he could pay for the added luxury, and defendant could modify the van as required by statute. However, only the modifications and medical mileage \u2014 separable elements that actually represent a change in character from plaintiffs general preinjury transportation requirements \u2014 must be compensated pursuant to MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Our decision in <em>Griffith </em>was sound, and we reaffirm that decision here. To the extent that the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinions in <em>Ward, Hoover, </em>or <em>Begin </em>are inconsistent with this opinion, they are overruled. In concluding that the base price of the van was compensable, the Court of Appeals in this case misapplied our holding in <em>Griffith. </em>We therefore reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals erred by unnecessarily concluding that the parties\u2019 transportation purchase agreement was ambiguous regarding whether defendant was contractually obligated to reimburse plaintiff for the base price of the van regardless of the no-fault insurance act\u2019s requirements. In fact, plaintiff waived the contractual argument by failing to raise it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>his complaint or argue it to the trial court at any point.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment regarding the parties\u2019 contract. Plaintiffs application for leave to appeal as cross-appellant is denied, and the case is remanded to the trial court for entry of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-4\">YOUNG, C.J., and Markman and KELLY, JJ., concurred with ZAHRA, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\"> MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> <em>Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>472 Mich 521; 697 NW2d 895 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\"> <em>Admire v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 15, 2011 (Docket No. 289080).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\"> <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals erred by considering the implications of the transportation purchase agreement because plaintiff never raised that issue in his complaint or argued it at the trial court.

Specifically, MCL 500.3105(1) establishes that an insured is eligible for certain benefits as long as the insured is injured in a motor vehicle accident.

Thus, it was the <em>Griffith </em>majority, not the Legislature, that created the additional restriction that personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>protection (PIP) benefits are not recoverable for expenses that were necessary before the injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Applying the <em>Griffith </em>dissent\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions to this case, plaintiff clearly satisfied MCL 500.3105(1) given the catastrophic injuries plaintiff suffered in the motor vehicle accident. Next, it is necessary to determine whether the cost of the van is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for plaintiffs \u201ccare.\u201d As Justice MARILYN KELLY explained, in order to ensure that the word \u201ccare\u201d in MCL 500.3107(1)(a) has a meaning independent of the words \u201crehabilitation\u201d and \u201crecovery,\u201d the word \u201ccare\u201d should be defined as \u201cthe provision of what is necessary for the welfare and protection of someone.\u201d Griffith, 472 Mich at 547 (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although a van is not as obviously necessary for a person\u2019s \u201cwelfare and protection\u201d as the food at issue in <em>Griffith, </em>I think that the facts presented in this case adequately indicate that the van is reasonably necessary for plaintiffs care because a van is the only mode of personal transportation available that will accommodate plaintiffs severe injuries resulting from the motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The simplicity of applying the <em>Griffith </em>dissent\u2019s interpretation of the plain language of MCL 500.3105 and MCL 500.3107(1)(a) is consistent with the long-held principle that the Legislature intended that the no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>act be construed liberally \u201cin favor of the persons intended to benefit from it.\u201d <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 28; 528 NW2d 681 (1995). Likewise, the <em>Griffith </em>dissent\u2019s approach addresses this Court\u2019s oft-repeated concern regarding cost containment, because the dissent\u2019s approach would eliminate much of the costly litigation spawned by the <em>Griffith </em>majority\u2019s erroneous analysis, which will only be perpetuated by the majority opinion\u2019s modifications to the <em>Griffith </em>majority\u2019s analysis in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because plaintiff is entitled to PIP benefits under MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">II. THE MAJORITY\u2019S ERRONEOUS ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The straightforward application of the statutes\u2019 plain language under the <em>Griffith </em>dissent stands in stark contrast to the majority\u2019s effort to apply the <em>Griffith </em>majority\u2019s confusing analysis to this case because, in attempting to clarify <em>Griffith, </em>the majority takes an approach that is divorced from the statutory language. Specifically, I agree with the majority that \u201cnothing in the statutory language of MCL 500.3107(1)(a) supports the notion that postinjury allowable expenses should be reduced by the margin of the injured person\u2019s preinjury expenses of the same character.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 27. However, the majority is forced to inject a variety of terms and phrases not found in the statutory language in an effort to \u201cclarify\u201d <em>Griffith </em>in its purported attempt to avoid an incremental approach to allowable expenses. The result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>is an overly narrow construction of the statute that is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent regarding MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">For example, the majority states that an \u201cordinary, everyday expense\u201d cannot qualify as an allowable expense under MCL 500.3107(1)(a). However, the phrase \u201cordinary, everyday expense\u201d is amorphous and, more importantly, absent from the statutory language. Rather, the statute simply provides that allowable expenses are <em>\u201call reasonable charges </em>incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d MCL 500.3107(1)(a) (emphasis added). In my view, \u201call reasonable charges\u201d could encompass a so-called \u201cordinary, everyday expense\u201d and thus satisfy MCL 500.3107(1)(a) if that expense is reasonable and reasonably necessary for the injured person\u2019s welfare and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The majority also proclaims that \u201cthe new expense must be of a <em>wholly different essential character </em>than expenses borne by the person before the accident. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 27 (emphasis added). Again, this undefined statement of what an insured must now show to be eligible for benefits finds no support in the statutes or caselaw. Moreover, the majority\u2019s explanation of expenses that satisfy MCL 500.3107(1)(a) will not add clarity to this area of the law because the majority\u2019s examples are not truly \u201cof a wholly different essential character.\u201d For instance, the majority states that a \u201ccustom shoe\u201d would qualify as an allowable expense. However, no matter how much a shoe is customized or modified, it retains its \u201cessential character\u201d as a shoe, i.e., it protects a person\u2019s foot while walking. I question how the bench and bar are to apply the majority\u2019s opinion consistently and fairly when the majority itself struggles to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Next, the majority attempts to draw a distinction between a \u201ccombined\u201d product, which it deems insufficient to satisfy MCL 500.3107(1)(a), and an \u201cintegrated\u201d product, which, according to the majority, does satisfy MCL 500.3107(1)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Again, that distinction does not appear in the statutory language, and the majority is unable to cite any support for its judicially created distinction. Moreover, the majority\u2019s explanation of the difference between a \u201ccombined\u201d product and an \u201cintegrated\u201d product evidences that the majority\u2019s approach is entirely standardless.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Specifically, the majority defines a \u201ccombined\u201d product as one that \u201ccan be separated easily, both conceptually and physically, so that the fact-finder can identify which costs are of a new character and are thus <em>for </em>the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation and which costs are ordinary, everyday expenses that are unchanged after the accident.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 28. Given the unique nature of modified products, however, this explanation provides little assistance to the bench and bar. Indeed, the majority concludes that \u201c [w]hen a medical products company produces a custom shoe, the shoe is an integrated product because the medical nature of the shoe . . . cannot be separated from the ordinary need for shoes by an uninjured person.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 30. Presumably, the majority considers a \u201ccustom shoe\u201d integrated because it cannot be separated \u201cconceptually or physically.\u201d Yet, the majority reaches a different conclusion in this case despite the fact that, as explained later in this opinion, the same is true of plaintiffs modified, or \u201ccustom,\u201d van. In short, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>though the majority claims to reject the \u201cincremental\u201d approach used in <em>Ward v Titan Ins Co, </em>287 Mich App 552; 791 NW2d 488 (2010), and <em>Hoover v Mich Mut Ins Co, </em>281 Mich App 617; 761 NW2d 801 (2008), the majority implicitly adopts that very rule by defining the preinjury need too broadly while simultaneously defining an \u201cintegrated product\u201d too narrowly. The majority\u2019s further deviation from the clear statutory language will only perpetuate the confusion that began with the <em>Griffith </em>majority\u2019s erroneous analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">III. APPLYING THE MAJORITY\u2019S NEW RULE \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Although I would apply the <em>Griffith </em>dissent, I believe that plaintiff is entitled to benefits even under the majority\u2019s faulty statutory interpretation. As the majority acknowledges, what might otherwise be considered an \u201cordinary, everyday expense\u201d could constitute, under certain circumstances, an \u201cintegrated\u201d product. Specifically, under the <em>Griffith </em>majority, food provided in an institutional setting is an \u201cintegrated\u201d product, despite the fact that the exact same food is merely an \u201cordinary, everyday expense\u201d when provided in a non-institutional setting. Likewise, although plaintiffs van is at its core \u201ctransportation,\u201d it is nevertheless an \u201cintegrated\u201d product because plaintiff is required to use <em>\u201cthat particular\u201d </em>form of transportation, given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>plaintiff is ventilator dependent and wheelchair bound as a result of the motor vehicle accident. <em>Griffith, </em>472 Mich at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The majority apparently believes that plaintiff is not limited to a particular form of transportation, but that is simply not true, as even defendant conceded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs need for transportation cannot be easily separated from <em>a van </em>on conceptual grounds because no other type of vehicle can accommodate plaintiffs wheelchair. Stated differently, contrary to the majority\u2019s unsupported conclusion that \u201cthe character of plaintiffs ordinary transportation needs remains unchanged,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 34, because of his injuries the only personal vehicle that plaintiff can travel in is a van. Thus, plaintiff s postaccident transportation needs are significantly different from his preaccident transportation needs. In fact, it bears repeating that the van itself is <em>for </em>plaintiffs care because a van is the only type of vehicle that can accommodate plaintiffs postaccident condition. Before the accident, plaintiff did not require the modifications that the majority concedes are covered by MCL 500.3107(1)(a) because the modifications are <em>for </em>plaintiffs care. Likewise, before the accident, plaintiff did not require a van. After the accident, however, plaintiff cannot operate a personal vehicle unless it is modified <em>and it is a van. </em>Thus, there is no meaningful difference between the modifications and the van itself for purposes of the majority\u2019s analysis. Plaintiff required neither before the accident, but, because of his motor-vehicle-related injuries, plaintiff now requires both <em>for </em>his care.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The majority implicitly acknowledges that plaintiffs condition limits him to transportation in a van when it states that \u201c[i]f plaintiff had already owned <em>a van, </em>defendant could have modified <em>that van. </em>If plaintiff wanted <em>a Mercedes van, </em>he could pay for the added luxury . . <em>.Ante </em>at 34 (emphasis added). Fear that an insurer could be automatically required to pay for the full cost of <em>any </em>van an insured selects is misplaced because, as the plain language of MCL 500.3107(1) establishes, the cost of the van must be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \u201cthe question whether expenses are reasonable . .. is generally one of fact for the jury . ...\u201d <em>Nasser v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>435 Mich 33, 55; 457 NW2d 637 (1990). Thus, if an insured selects \u201ca Mercedes van,\u201d the insurer would be free to argue to the jury that the insured\u2019s choice is not reasonable under MCL 500.3107(1)(a). Likewise, an insurer would be free to argue that any type of personal van is not reasonable because wheelchair-accessible public transportation is reasonable under the specific circumstances. See <em>Wilcox, </em>488 Mich at 932 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ever, as the majority admits, the parties in this case agreed that plaintiff should have a personal vehicle for transportation. Thus, because a van is the only mode of personal transportation available to plaintiff given the injuries he sustained in the motor vehicle accident, plaintiffs need for transportation cannot be easily separated from <em>a van </em>on conceptual grounds. Thus, the van itself is <em>for </em>plaintiffs care, and plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement for the full cost of the van even under the majority opinion because the modified van is an \u201cintegrated\u201d product.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">IV PLAINTIFF DID NOT WAIVE THE CONTRACT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff waived the argument that defendant had contractually agreed to reimburse plaintiff for the base price of the van. As the Court of Appeals noted, the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition and instead grant plaintiff summary disposition was not a model of clarity. However, in my view, the transcript of the hearing on the motion for summary disposition reveals that the trial court based its decision on its conclusion that the \u201cTransportation Purchase Agreement\u201d (TPA) required defendant to pay for the reasonable purchase price of a van.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court of Appeals opinion clearly considered the issue and ultimately determined that the TPA is ambiguous. See <em>Admire v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 15,2011 (Docket No. 289080), pp 2-3. Accordingly, both the trial court and Court of Appeals addressed the issue of whether the TPA contractually requires defendant to pay for the purchase price of the van. Thus, although I do not think that it is necessary to reach the issue because, in my view, plaintiff is entitled to the purchase price of the van under the no-fault act, even accepting the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion on the no-fault issue, I would remand to the trial court for further consideration of the contractual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to expand the erroneous majority opinion in <em>Griffith. </em>Moreover, even under the majority\u2019s faulty statutory interpretation, I believe plaintiff is entitled to benefits because the van in this case is no different from the \u201cintegrated\u201d products that the majority offers as examples of allowable expenses under MCL 500.3107(1)(a). Finally, because both lower courts considered the argument that defendant contractually agreed to reimburse plaintiff for the base price of the van, I would not hold that the issue was waived. Accordingly, I dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, or, at a minimum, remand to the trial court for further consideration of the contractual issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-6\">McCormack and Viviano, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> MCL 500.3105(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Under personal protection insurance an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, subject to the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> MCL 500.3107(1) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">[Pjersonal protection insurance benefits are payable for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">(a) Allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> The majority repeats the <em>Griffith </em>majority\u2019s unfounded claim that this definition of \u201ccare\u201d engulfs \u201crehabilitation\u201d and \u201crecovery.\u201d <em>Griffith, 472 </em>Mich at 534 n 10.

However, could plaintiff in this case return home after recovering in the hospital and use the exact same mode of transportation he had before his injury? Clearly, the answer is no, because the character of plaintiffs transportation needs changed as a result of the accident, contrary to the majority\u2019s claim that a van is no different than the motorcycle plaintiff used for transportation before his accident. In fact, plaintiff could no longer ride a motorcycle or even operate a passenger car because plaintiff requires a van that is suitable for modification. Yet, by erroneously focusing on a person\u2019s general transportation needs before an accident and defining that need too broadly, the majority\u2019s interpretation will regrettably leave some injured parties without postaccident transportation, given the likely increased expense of purchasing a modifiable van, which many accident victims will not be able to afford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\"> The parties executed the first TPA in 1988, shortly after plaintiffs 1987 motor vehicle accident.
