At the time of his injury, plaintiff was also employed by another employer. Thornapple Township paid plaintiff the maximum weekly wage loss benefits under the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and plaintiff additionally received ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>efits pursuant to a disability insurance policy provided by the township. Thornapple Township did not reduce its workers\u2019 compensation liability by coordinating plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits with his disability benefits under MCL 418.354(l)(b). Subsequently, Thornapple Township sought reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the dual employment provisions, MCL 418.372, based on the uncoordinated amount of wage loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The issue to be determined in this case is the amount that the fund is required to reimburse an employer for its portion of an injured employee\u2019s weekly benefits when the employer fails to coordinate benefits. We hold that the coordination of benefits is mandatory, except in very narrow employment circumstances that are inapplicable in this case. Coordination of benefits serves to reduce the amount of weekly benefits an employer is legally obligated to pay an employee under the WDCA. Any additional sum of weekly benefits volitionally provided by the employer does not alter the employer\u2019s <em>statutory obligation </em>to the injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">If an injured worker was engaged in more than one employment at the time of injury, the WDCA apportions liability between the employment that caused the injury and the Second Injury Fund. When the employment that caused the injury provided less than 80 percent of the employee\u2019s wages, the fund is required to reimburse its \u201cportion of the benefits due the employee. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the fund\u2019s liability is \u201cdependent\u201d upon the employer\u2019s liability, and coordination of the employer\u2019s benefits is compulsory, the fund is required to reimburse its portion of the benefits due on the basis of the coordinated amount of benefits. We reverse the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the magistrate for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The parties submitted this case under stipulated facts. Plaintiff, Robert Smitter, was employed both as a part-time firefighter for Thornapple Township and as an employee of General Motors Corporation. Smitter earned approximately 11 percent of his total wages with Thornapple Township and 89 percent of his wages with General Motors. On May 3, 2005, Smitter sustained a work-related injury while fighting a fire. He was disabled from both employments for approximately 26 weeks. Given his average weekly wage, Smitter was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation wage loss benefits at the maximum rate of $689 a week. Smitter also received $800 a week in \u201cSickness &amp; Accident\u201d benefits pursuant to a disability insurance policy fully funded by Thornapple Township. The township did not coordinate the benefits paid from the disability insurance policy against its workers\u2019 compensation obligation. Rather, the township voluntarily paid the state maximum rate of wage loss benefits to plaintiff, in addition to the benefits plaintiff received pursuant to the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Initially, Thornapple Township sought reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund in the amount of $17,897.87 for the entirety of plaintiffs wage loss benefits. The fund agreed to pay $2,077.99 \u2014 the amount of its liability if the township had coordinated plaintiffs benefits. On February 2, 2007, Thornapple Township filed an application for a hearing, seeking reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund for \u201cwage loss benefits attributable to earnings from General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Motors Corporation\u201d for plaintiffs period of disability. Relying on <em>Rahman v Detroit Board of </em>Education,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the magistrate ordered that the fund reimburse Thor-napple Township in the amount of $15,966.75, representing 89 percent of the uncoordinated wage loss benefits paid to Smitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> affirmed the decision of the magistrate. The majority commiserated with the fund\u2019s being required to \u201csupport the Township\u2019s public policy of treating its firefighters to benefits beyond the statutory requirements,\u201d agreeing with the fund that it was \u201cunfair to allow an employer to forfeit coordination and force another party to fund that choice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, because <em>Rahman </em>controlled the facts of the case, the fund could \u201cnot take advantage of the injury employer\u2019s[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] entitlement to coordination unless the employer coordinates benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Court of Appeals initially denied the fund\u2019s application for leave to appeal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the WCAC.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The panel noted that it was bound to follow <em>Rahman </em>pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>MCR 7.215(J)(1), that the holding in <em>Rahman </em>was consistent with the statutory language, and that there was no principled reason for distinguishing <em>Rahman </em>from the present case. This Court granted the Second Injury Fund\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">II. STANDARD of review</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">While this Court\u2019s review of a decision by the WCAC is limited, we review de novo questions of law in a workers\u2019 compensation case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Likewise, questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In interpreting a statute, our obligation is to discern the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words actually used in the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cA fundamental principle of statutory construction is that \u2018a clear and unambiguous statute leaves no room for judicial construction or interpretation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When the statutory language is unambiguous, the proper role of the judiciary is simply to apply the terms of the statute to the facts of the particular case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, words used by the Legislature must be construed and understood in accordance with their common, ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">A. RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In order to analyze properly the issues presented in this case, we must examine the interplay between several provisions of the WDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">There is no question that plaintiff received an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment with Thornapple Township.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because plaintiff was completely disabled for approximately 26 weeks, MCL 418.351(1) describes the township\u2019s liability for weekly wage loss benefits. It provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">While the incapacity for work resulting from a personal injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid as provided in this section, to the injured employee, a weekly compensation of 80% of the employee\u2019s after-tax average weekly wage, but not more than the maximum weekly rate of compensation, as determined under [MCL 418.355]. Compensation shall be paid for the duration of the disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">MCL 418.354 provides for the coordination of benefits, reducing an employer\u2019s obligation to pay weekly wage benefits under the WBCA when an employee simultaneously receives payments in accordance with specified benefit programs. At the time of plaintiffs injury,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> MCL 418.354 provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">(1) This section is applicable when either weekly or lump sum payments are made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to [MCL 418.351, MCL 418.361, or MCL 418.835] with respect to the same time period for which old-age insurance benefit payments under the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 301 to 1397f; payments under a self-insurance plan, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>wage continuation plan, <em>or a disability insurance policy provided by the employer-, </em>or pension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the employer, are also received or being received by the employee. Except as otherwise provided in this section, <em>the employer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits other than specific loss benefits under [MCL </em>418.361(2)] <em>and (3) shall be reduced by these amounts:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">(b) <em>The after-tax amount of the payments received or being received </em>under a self-insurance plan, a wage continuation plan, or <em>under a disability insurance policy provided by the same employer from whom benefits under [MCL 418.351, MCL 418.361, or MCL 418.835] are received if the employee did not contribute directly to the plan or to the payment of premiums regarding the disability insurance policy....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">(2) To satisfy any <em>remaining obligations </em>under [MCL 418.351, MCL 418.361, or MCL 418.835], the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the employee <em>the balance due in either weekly or lump sum payments after the application of subsection (1).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(15) With respect to volunteer fire fighters, volunteer safety patrol officers, volunteer civil defense workers, and volunteer ambulance drivers and attendants who are considered employees for purposes of this act pursuant to [MCL 418.161(1)(a)], <em>the reduction of weekly benefits provided for disability insurance payments under subsection (1)(b) and (c) and subsection (11) may be waived by the employer. </em>An employer that is not a self-insurer may make the waiver provided for under this subsection only at the time a worker\u2019s compensation insurance policy is entered into or renewed.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>MCL 418.372, known as the dual employment provision, apportions liability for an injured employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the employee was engaged in more than one employment at the time of injury. At the time of plaintiffs injury, the statute provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(1) If an employee was engaged in more than 1 employment at the time of a personal injury or a personal injury resulting in death, the employer in whose employment the injury or injury resulting in death occurred is liable for all the injured employee\u2019s medical, rehabilitation, and burial benefits. Weekly benefits shall be apportioned as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(a) If the employment which caused the personal injury or death provided more than 80% of the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wages at the time of the personal injury or death, the insurer or self-insurer is liable for all of the weekly benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(b) If the employment which caused the personal injury or death provided 80% or less of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of the personal injury or death, the insurer or self-insurer is liable for that portion of the employee\u2019s weekly benefits as bears the same ratio to his or her total weekly benefits as the average weekly wage from the employment which caused the personal injury or death bears to his or her total weekly wages. <em>The second injury fund is separately but dependently liable for the remainder of the weekly benefits. The insurer or self-insurer has the obligation to pay the employee or the employee\u2019s dependents at the full rate of compensation. The second injury fund shall reimburse the insurer or self-insurer quarterly for the second injury fund\u2019s portion of the benefits due the employee or the employee\u2019s dependents.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(3) This section does not apply to volunteer public employees entitled to benefits under [MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>418.161(1)(a)].[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Reading these statutory provisions together, it is clear that, as a starting point, Thornapple Township is obligated by MCL 418.351 to pay Smitter weekly wage loss benefits in the amount of 80 percent of his after-tax average weekly wage, subject to the maximum weekly cap imposed by MCL 418.355, for the duration of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Because Smitter received benefits pursuant to a disability insurance policy provided by Thornapple Township \u201cwith respect to the same time period\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as the township\u2019s obligation to pay weekly wage loss benefits pursuant to MCL 418.351, the coordination of benefits provisions are implicated. As Thornapple Township fully funded the disability policy, its \u201cobligation to pay\u201d weekly wage loss benefits <em>\u201cshall he re</em>duced\u201d by the after-tax amount of benefits Smitter received under the policy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The township\u2019s \u201cremaining obligations\u201d regarding Smitter\u2019s wage loss benefits under MCL 418.351 are thus reduced to \u201cthe balance due\u201d after coordination.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Lastly, because Smitter was engaged in more than one employment at the time of his injury, the dual employment provisions of MCL 418.372 are applicable. While Thornapple Township remains liable for all of Smitter\u2019s medical and rehabilitation benefits, Smitter\u2019s weekly wage loss benefits are apportioned between the township and the Second Injury Fund because \u201cthe employment which caused the personal injury\u201d provided less than 80 percent of Smitter\u2019s wages at the time of his injury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The township is liable for the same percentage of Smitter\u2019s weekly benefits as his average weekly wage from the township bore to his total wages. In other words, because Smitter earned 11 percent of his weekly wages with the township, it is liable for 11 percent of Smitter\u2019s weekly benefits. The fund is \u201cseparately but dependently liable\u201d for the remaining 89 percent of Smitter\u2019s weekly benefits, representing the percentage of weekly benefits attributable to Smitter\u2019s employment with General Motors.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While the township must provide weekly benefits to Smitter \u201cat the full rate of compensation,\u201d the fund is required to reimburse the township for its \u201cportion of the benefits due the employee . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">B. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Relying on <em>Rahman v Detroit Board of Education, </em>Thornapple Township argues that the fund is liable for reimbursement of its portion of the uncoordinated amount of benefits and cannot reduce its liability by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>claiming entitlement to the coordinated amount, particularly given that the township has \u201cexercised its right\u201d not to coordinate benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In <em>Rahman, </em>the plaintiff suffered a back injury during the course of his employment with the Detroit Board of Education. At the time of injury, Rahman was also employed with the city of Detroit, earning 46 percent of his wages from the board of education and the remaining 54 percent of his wages from the city of Detroit. The magistrate ordered an open award of benefits and further held that the fund had reimbursement liability under the dual employment provisions because the board provided less than 80 percent of Rahman\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Rahman also received a pension from the board of education, although the facts do not indicate whether the Board coordinated Rahman\u2019s weekly wage loss benefits. The fund argued that the amount it was required to reimburse the board should be based on the coordinated amount of benefits. The Court of Appeals rejected the fund\u2019s claim, providing the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">[T]he coordination of benefits provision ... applies if an employee receives worker\u2019s compensation benefits at the same time he receives pension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program maintained or established by an employer. [MCL 418.354(1)] provides that \u201cthe employer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits other than specific loss benefits ... shall be reduced by [specified] amounts ....\u201d A plain reading of the subsection indicates that the employer\u2019s obligation to pay the employee benefits <em>may be reduced </em>by the amount of pension the employer pays to the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">We reject the [Second Injury Fund\u2019s] argument that the total amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits <em>payable to plaintiff </em>should be reduced by the amount of the pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>benefits plaintiff receives from the board. Again, we consider the clear and unambiguous language of the statute. [MCL 418.354] provides for a reduction in an employer\u2019s obligation to pay benefits if that employer provides the employee a pension. This reduction is clearly premised on the fact that the employer is providing another wage benefit to the employee; the statute <em>allows the employer </em>to coordinate that benefit with its obligation to pay worker\u2019s compensation wage-loss benefits to the employee. It is apparent from the language of the statute that the Legislature intended that the employer whose employment caused an injury alone may <em>take advantage </em>of the coordination provisions. There is no suggestion that the [Second Injury Fund], in a dual employment situation, may take advantage of the injury-employer\u2019s <em>entitlement </em>to coordination. Therefore, the [Second Injury Fund\u2019s] argument is <em>rejected.[</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">While <em>Rahman </em>claimed to follow the unambiguous language of the statute, it failed to do so. Contrary to <em>Rahman\u2019s </em>holding that an employer\u2019s obligation to pay weekly benefits <em>\u201cmay </em>be reduced,\u201d MCL 418.354(1) provides that the employer\u2019s obligation <em>\u201cshall </em>be reduced\u201d by the requisite amounts listed in the statute. The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d generally indicates a mandatory directive, not a discretionary act.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Furthermore, <em>Rahman </em>failed to recognize or address the significance of MCL 418.354(15).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>explicitly delineates the narrow group of employers that the Legislature has permitted to waive the \u201creduction of weekly benefits\u201d that is otherwise compelled by the coordination provisions: those employing \u201cvolunteer fire fighters, volunteer safety patrol officers, volunteer civil defense workers, and volunteer ambulance drivers and attendants who are considered employees for purposes of this act pursuant to [MCL 418.161(1)(a)] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Moreover, the scope of allowable waiver encompasses only \u201cdisability insurance payments under subsection (1)(b) and (c) and subsection (11). . . .\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> By specifically outlining the parameters under which an employer may permissibly waive coordination of benefits, the Legislature by implication prohibited <em>all other employers </em>who do not meet the specifications from waiving coordination of benefits.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Such a conclusion is incompatible with <em>Rah-man\u2019s </em>holding that the coordination of benefits is a discretionary \u201centitlement\u201d that may be claimed or relinquished at the pleasure of <em>any </em>employer.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> While <em>Rahman </em>decried the notion that \u201cthe total amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits payable to plaintiff should be reduced by the amount of the pension benefits plaintiff receives,\u201d that is <em>precisely </em>what MCL 418.354(1) requires. Because the holding in <em>Rahman </em>contravenes the plain language of the statute, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Thus, with the exception of those employments falling within the limits described in MCL 418.354(15), an employer\u2019s obligation to pay weekly benefits under the WDCA \u201cshall be reduced\u201d by the corresponding amounts listed in MCL 418.354(1). The coordination of benefits is mandatory, not discretionary, and reduces an employer\u2019s obligation to pay weekly wage loss benefits as a matter of law. As a practical consideration, an injured worker is unlikely to protest if an employer consciously chooses to pay the employee in excess of what the law requires. However, any additional sum of weekly wage loss benefits volitionally provided by the employer \u201c[flor its own policy reasons\u201d has no effect on the employer\u2019s obligation to pay weekly benefits under the law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">C. THE SECOND INJURY FUND\u2019S LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">MCL 418.372(1)(b) apportions liability between the fund and the injury employer when the employee was engaged in more than one employment at the time of his injury <em>and </em>the injury employer provided 80 percent or less of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>does not require reimbursement of any additional amount that the employer voluntarily elects to provide to an injured employee \u2014 it only provides that the fund is liable for its \u201cportion of the benefits <em>due </em>the employee . .. Consistent with the common understanding of the word \u201cdue,\u201d the benefits due the employee are those that are <em>owed </em>to the employee.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In determining the amount \u201cdue\u201d the employee, we note that under the explicit language of the statute, the fund has dependent or contingent liability<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> for the remainder of the weekly benefits for which the injury employer would ordinarily be liable<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> but for the apportionment of liability provided in MCL 418.372.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thus, the fund\u2019s reimbursement liability is expressly conditioned on the injury employer\u2019s statutory liability. As discussed above, the application of MCL 418.354 to reduce an employer\u2019s liability under the WDCA is compulsory and may not be avoided except in very narrow circumstances.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Therefore, the amount \u201cdue the employee\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> is the fund\u2019s portion of the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\u201cremaining obligationD\u201d under the act, which is described as \u201cthe balance due in either weekly or lump sum payments <em>after the application of\u2019 </em>the coordination provisions.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, the fund is obligated to reimburse the employer for its \u201cportion of the benefits due the employee\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> after the application of MCL 418.354.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The fund is not required to reimburse the employer for any additional amounts of benefits that do not reflect the employer\u2019s Lability under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Thornapple Township argues that \u201cstrong public policy\u201d considerations support its position and that providing an injured firefighter with full workers\u2019 compensation benefits as well as disability benefits provides an \u201cincentive\u201d for its employees to engage in firefighting services. However, the public policy of Michigan is not to be determined by what a majority of this Court deems desirable or appropriate at a given time. Rather, the public policy of Michigan must be \u201cclearly rooted in the law\u201d as \u201creflected in our state and federal constitutions, our statutes, and the common law.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, this Court may not substitute its policy preferences for those policy decisions that have been clearly provided by statute.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In this instant case, it is clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>mandate contained in MCL 418.354(1) that the public policy of Michigan, as articulated <em>by the Legislature, </em>is to prevent duplicative wage loss payments while maintaining \u201csuitable wage-loss benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Additionally, the Legislature has unequivocally indicated that the public policy of Michigan prohibits the employees of fire departments and police departments from receiving \u201clike benefits\u201d from both a municipality and the WDCA.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> MCL 418.161(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">Police officers, fire fighters, or employees of the police or fire departments, or their dependents, in municipalities or villages of this state providing like benefits, may waive the provisions of this act and accept like benefits that are provided by the municipality or village but are not entitled to like benefits from both the municipality or village and this act.

I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because I believe that Robert Smitter was a \u201cvolunteer fire fighter[]\u201d for purposes of applying MCL 418.354(15) of the Michigan Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, thus, Thor-napple Township was permitted to provide Smitter with uncoordinated benefits. While I do not necessarily disagree with Justice McCormack\u2019s conclusion that the WDCA may allow <em>all </em>employers to decide whether to coordinate workers\u2019 compensation benefits and disability insurance benefits, I do not believe that it is necessary to decide that issue in this case. Rather, because the majority recognizes that MCL 418.354(15) permits the employer of a volunteer firefighter to provide its employees with uncoordinated benefits, I believe that the majority\u2019s conclusion that benefits coordination is mandatory except in the employment circumstances listed in MCL 418.354(15) is unnecessary dictum. Likewise, I believe that the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Rahman v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>245 Mich App 103; 627 NW2d 41 (2001), is also dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Although both parties stated at oral argument that Smitter was not a volunteer firefighter for purposes of applying MCL 418.354(15) because he was paid, this Court is not bound by the parties\u2019 concessions regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ing the law. See, e.g., <em>Union Guardian Trust Co v Zack, </em>274 Mich 108, 113; 264 NW 309 (1936).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, I believe that the majority errs by relying solely on the parties\u2019 concessions without considering more closely whether those concessions comport with the applicable statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">In order to determine whether Smitter was a volunteer firefighter for purposes of MCL 418.354(15), we must look more closely at the language of that subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">With respect to volunteer fire fighters, volunteer safety-patrol officers, volunteer civil defense workers, and volunteer ambulance drivers and attendants who are considered employees for purposes of [the WDCA] pursuant to section 161(l)(a),[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] the reduction of weekly benefits provided for disability insurance payments under subsection (l)(b) and (c) and subsection (11) may be waived by the employer. An employer that is not a self-insurer may make the waiver provided for under this subsection only at the time a worker\u2019s compensation insurance policy is entered into or renewed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Importantly, MCL 418.354(15) provides that it applies to \u201cvolunteer fire fighters . . . who <em>are considered employees for purposes of [the WDCA] pursuant to section </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>161(1)(a) </em>....\" (Emphasis added.) MCL 418.161(1)(a), in turn, defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201c[a] person in the service of the state, a county, city, township, village, or school district, under any appointment, <em>or contract of hire, </em>express or implied, oral or written.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, although MCL 418.354(15) refers to \u201cvolunteer fire fighters,\u201d in my view, subsection (15) applies to volunteer firefighters who are \u201cunder any . . . contract of hire,\u201d which may include <em>paid </em>firefighters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">This Court addressed the \u201ccontract of hire\u201d language in MCL 418.161(1) at length in <em>Hoste v Shanty Creek Mgt, Inc, </em>459 Mich 561; 592 NW2d 360 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Hoste </em>majority first stated that the phrase \u201ccontract of hire\u201d \u201cconnote[s] payment of some kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574-575. The majority supported that conclusion by noting that the Legislature \u201cdesigned worker\u2019s compensation to be a safety net to provide <em>\u2018income maintenance </em>for persons who have met misfortune or whose <em>regular income source </em>has been cut off.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, quoting <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 654; 375 NW2d 715 (1985). <em>Hoste </em>explained that the \u201cof hire\u201d portion of the phrase distinguishes between gratuity or accommodation and a payment. Specifically, the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ity stated that gratuity does not satisfy the \u201cof hire\u201d requirement because \u201cworker\u2019s compensation provides benefits to those who have lost a source of income; it does not provide benefits to those who can no longer take advantage of a gratuity or privilege that serves merely as an accommodation.\u201d Hoste, 459 Mich at 575. Finally, <em>Hoste </em>summarized by stating that in order to satisfy the \u201cof hire\u201d requirement in MCL 418.161(1), \u201ccompensation must be payment intended as wages,\u201d which the majority defined as \u201creal, palpable and substantial consideration as would be expected to induce a reasonable person to give up the valuable right of a possible claim against the employer in a tort action and as would be expected to be understood as such by the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Applying the statutory language as written, in my view, Smitter satisfied the \u201ccontract of hire\u201d requirement under the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as interpreted by the <em>Hoste </em>majority. Both parties agree that Smitter received wages as compensation for the time he spent working as a firefighter. Thus, I think that Smitter was a \u201cvolunteer fire fighter[] . . . who [is] considered [an] employee[] . .. pursuant to section 161(1)(a) . . . .\u201d MCL 418.354(15). Accordingly, I think that the next provision of MCL 418.354(15) applies: \u201cthe reduction of weekly benefits provided for disability insurance payments under [MCL 418.354(1)(b)] . . . may be waived by the employer.\u201d Therefore, I think that Thornapple may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>forgo the coordination provision in MCL 418.354(l)(b) in this case and instead provide Smitter with uncoordinated workers\u2019 compensation and disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Accepting that MCL 418.354(15) applies in this case and allows Thornapple to provide Smitter with uncoordinated benefits, the next question is how that conclusion affects the Second Injury Fund\u2019s (SIF) liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. That question is answered by reviewing the apportionment statute, MCL 418.372. Specifically, at the time of Smitter\u2019s injury, MCL 418.372(3) expressly stated that the allocation provisions in MCL 418.372 do \u201cnot apply to volunteer public employees entitled to benefits under section 161(l)(a).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In my view, because Smitter was a \u201cvolunteer fire fighter\u201d who was \u201cconsidered [an] employeef] for purposes of [the WDCA] pursuant to section 161(1)(a)\u201d under MCL 418.354(15), he was a \u201cvolunteer public employee[] entitled to benefits under section 161(1)(a)\u201d for purposes of MCL 418.372(3). Thus, I think that MCL 418.372(3) applies and the apportionment provisions are inapplicable in this case. Indeed, the majority opinion acknowledges that this is the proper interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. See <em>ante </em>at 139 n 42 (\u201c[T]he <em>very same </em>employments permitted to waive the coordination of benefits under MCL 418.354(15) are specifically <em>excluded </em>from the apportionment of liability under the dual employment provisions pursuant to MCL 418.372(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Because MCL 418.372 does not apply, this case returns to a simple application of MCL 418.351(1), which provides that \u201cthe employer shall pay, or cause to be paid as provided in this section, to the injured employee, a weekly compensation of 80% of the employee\u2019s after-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tax average weekly wage . In short, Thornapple is liable for <em>all </em>of Smitter\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and the SIF has no liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Again, the majority agrees with this result. See <em>ante </em>at 139 n 42 (stating that when MCL 418.354(15) and MCL 418.372(3) apply, the SIF has \u201cno reimbursement liability in a dual employment situation\u201d). Thus, because the majority, in my view, erroneously relies exclusively on the parties\u2019 concessions that Smitter was not a \u201cvolunteer fire fighter\u201d for purposes of MCL 418.354(15) while otherwise agreeing that the employer of a \u201cvolunteer fire fighter\u201d may elect to forgo coordination of benefits, I believe that the majority opinion reaches issues that need not be addressed in this case. Specifically, I do not think that it is necessary to decide whether benefits coordination is mandatory in employment circumstances not listed in MCL 418.354(15). Moreover, because <em>Rahman, </em>245 Mich App 103, did not address an employment listed in MCL 418.354(15), I think that opinion is distinguishable and, thus, I believe the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Rahman </em>is dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Finally, as mentioned previously in footnote 6 of this opinion, I recognize that the current version of MCL 418.161(1) differs from the version of MCL 418.161(1) in place at the time the plaintiff in <em>Hoste </em>was injured in 1990. Specifically, former MCL 418.161(1)(a), as amended by 1985 PA 103, explicitly addressed volunteer public employees, including \u201c[m] embers of a volunteer fire department:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">As used in this act, \u201cemployee\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>(a) A person in the service of the state, a county, city, township, village, or school district, under any appointment, or contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The current version of MCL 418.161(1)(a) no longer includes a specific reference to \u201cvolunteer\u201d public employees; rather, the statute\u2019s discussion of those employments, including the reference to \u201c[m] embers of a volunteer fire department,\u201d was removed from MCL 418.161(1)(a). However, several new subdivisions were added to the statute that seem to address \u201cvolunteer\u201d public employees including \u201c[o]n-call members of a fire department:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">As used in this act, \u201cemployee\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">(a) A person in the service of the state, a county, city, township, village, or school district, under any appointment, or contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.

Before the 2012 amendment, MCL 418.372(3) used language similar to MCL 418.354(15). Former MCL 418.372(3) stated, \u201cThis section does not apply to <em>volunteer public employees </em>entitled to benefits <em>under section 161(1)(a).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) However, as amended by 2012 PA 83, MCL 418.372(3) refers to the new subdivisions of MCL 418.161(1) that expressly address the various employments of \u201cvolunteer\u201d public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>employees, including on-call members of a fire department. Specifically, MCL 418.372(3), as amended by 2012 PA 83, states, \u201cThis section does not apply to individuals entitled to benefits <em>under section 161(1)(d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), and (o).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, it appears that MCL 418.354(15) should be similarly revised to refer to \u201cindividuals entitled to benefits under MCL 418.161(l)(d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), and (o)\u201d rather than the current reference to \u201cvolunteer fire fighters . . . who are considered employees for purposes of this act pursuant to section 161(l)(a) . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Although evidence exists to support the conclusion that the reference in MCL 418.354(15) to MCL 418.161(1)(a) appears to be a legislative oversight in light of subsequent amendments to MCL 418.161(1), this Court must nevertheless attempt to apply the statutes as currently written. See <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 210; 501 NW2d 76 (1993) (\u201cCourts cannot assume that the Legislature inadvertently omitted from one statute the language that it placed in another statute, and then, on the basis of that assumption, apply what is not there.\u201d). See, also, <em>Flint &amp; Fentonville Plank-Rd Co v Woodhull, </em>25 Mich 99, 108 (1872) (\u201cIt is not consistent with legislative independence and dignity, that the courts should assert a right to sit in judgment upon legislative action, or to attribute to the legislature erroneous or oppressive conduct in the exercise of any of its proper and legitimate functions.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, while resorting to <em>Hoste\u2019s </em>inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>pretation of \u201ccontract of hire\u201d in order to determine how best to classify Smitter\u2019s employment with Thor-napple for purposes of applying MCL 418.354(15) is the quintessential attempt to fit a square peg into a round hole, it is nevertheless my best effort at determining the most reasonable analysis of the current statutory language. And, because I believe that <em>Hoste </em>leads to the conclusion that Smitter was a \u201cvolunteer fire fighter\u201d for purposes of MCL 418.354(15), I dissent from the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion and from its decision to overrule <em>Rahman, </em>245 Mich App 103.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> I recognize that the parties submitted this case under stipulated facts, including the fact that Smitter was a \u201cpaid part-time firefighter....\u201d However, as my subsequent analysis explains, a paid employee may nevertheless be a \u201cvolunteer\u201d <em>as that word is used in MCL 418.354(15). </em>Thus, my analysis engages in statutory interpretation to determine the meaning of \u201cvolunteer\u201d as used in MCL 418.354(15).

The majority holds that, in a dual-employment context, the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mandates an employer\u2019s coordination of benefits, such that the Second Injury Fund<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is required to reimburse an employer only for a pro rata share of the coordinated amount of weekly benefits. As a consequence, the majority prohibits employers and employees from freely entering into employment contracts under terms as they see fit. While I agree with the majority that this Court\u2019s role is to apply the terms of an unambiguous statute to the facts of a particular case, here the applicable sections of the WDCA defy an unambiguous reading. In fact, the relevant statutory provisions at issue do not even refer to one another, much less unambiguously require the majority\u2019s interpretation. Because I am generally reluctant to interpret ambiguous statutory terms to impede freedom of contract, and moreover because the majority\u2019s reading anomalously applies only to the minority of employers who hire part-time workers, while still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>allowing the great majority of employers to enter into the employment contracts they deem appropriate, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">When an employee working two jobs is eligible for WDCA wage-loss benefits, the employer in whose service the employee worked at the time of the injury (the injury employer) is responsible for paying the full amount of those benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the injury employer provided 80 percent or less of the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wage, however, the injury employer is ultimately responsible only for that portion of the wage-loss benefits that corresponds to the portion of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage that the injury employer provided.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In this case, because Thornapple Township provided only 10.87 percent of Robert Smitter\u2019s average weekly wage, Thornapple was ultimately responsible for 10.87 percent of his wage-loss benefits: after paying the full amount of the workers\u2019 compensation wage-loss benefits up front, Thornapple claimed entitlement to reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund for 89.13 percent of the amount paid. Had Thornapple paid no other benefits to Smitter, there is no question, and there would have been no dispute, that Thornapple was entitled to recover from the Second Injury Fund 89.13 percent of the wage-loss benefits it paid Smitter. Case closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">As it happens, however, Thornapple offered Smitter both workers\u2019 compensation wage-loss benefits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>sickness and accident benefits, which he accepted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wage-loss benefits, of course, compensate an employee for wages lost as a result of an injury. Sickness and accident benefits, in contrast, cover out-of-pocket expenses associated with lifestyle changes necessitated by an injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The WDCA allows an injury employer to \u201ccoordinate\u201d benefits when that employer also provides alternative benefits, such that an injury employer\u2019s initial obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation wage-loss benefits can be reduced by the amount of other benefits the injury employer provides.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute explicitly states that disability benefits, such as those provided by Thornapple to its part-time firefighters, are among the benefits that can be coordinated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The crucial question is whether they must be.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>II. PLAIN LANGUAGE OP THE WDCA</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The majority holds that MCL 418.354(1) <em>mandates </em>that employers coordinate benefits. I am not convinced. In relevant part, \u00a7 354(1) states that \u201cthe employer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits other than specific loss benefits under [MCL 418.361(2) and (3)] shall be reduced by these amounts!.] \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I agree with the majority that the sickness and accident policy Thornapple provided to Smitter is covered by \u00a7 354(1). The question is whether Thornapple was required to coordinate that coverage with the wage-loss benefits it also paid, or whether it could elect to do so. The majority believes that the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">I agree with the majority that \u201cshall\u201d generally implies a mandatory directive. But context can occasionally undercut the general principle that the ordinary usage applies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case, the majority\u2019s conclusion is undercut by the text of the WDCA for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">First, MCL 418.354(1) specifically states that an <em>employer\u2019s </em>obligation may be reduced by coordination, not the Second Injury Fund\u2019s obligation or the employee\u2019s bottom-line benefits. This plain language must mean that the decision to coordinate rests with the employer and that the Second Injury Fund\u2019s liability is not implicated. If the Legislature intended mandatory benefit coordination it could have more clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>accomplished that in any number of ways. Most simply, it could have omitted the phrase \u201cthe employer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid\u201d from the final sentence of MCL 418.354(1). The sentence would then read: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, . . . weekly benefits other than specific loss benefits under [MCL 418.361(2) and (3)] shall be reduced by these amounts!.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This language would better support the majority\u2019s reading because it would be obvious that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to ensure that the employee\u2019s wage-loss benefits were reduced when the employee also received additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Second, MCL 418.372(1)(b) unambiguously sets forth the formula by which the Second Injury Fund\u2019s liability is determined. In that subsection, which provides that the Second Injury Fund \u201cis separately but dependently liable for the remainder of the weekly benefits,\u201d and \u201cshall reimburse the insurer or self-insurer quarterly for the second injury fluid\u2019s portion of the benefits due the employee or the employee\u2019s dependents,\u201d no reference is made to the possibility of benefit coordination or to MCL 418.354 more specifically.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no language whatsoever to suggest that the phrase \u201cdue the employee\u201d in MCL 418.372(1)(b) should be read to incorporate the ability or obligation to coordinate in MCL 418.354. The converse is also true; while the Legislature refers explicitly to the \u201csecond injury fund\u201d and its liabilities in the text of MCL 418.372(1)(b), the absence of any reference to the Second Injury Fund in MCL 418.354 is meaningful. The Legislature could have connected the two sections, but chose not to do so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Third, the majority argues that MCL 418.354(15), the subsection governing volunteer firefighters, supports its position that benefits coordination is mandatory. The statute states that for volunteer firefighters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">[T]he reduction of weekly benefits provided for disability insurance payments under subsection (1)(b)... may be waived by the employer. An employer that is not a self-insurer may make the waiver provided for under this subsection only at the time a worker\u2019s compensation insurance policy is entered into or <em>renewed.[</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">As does MCL 418.354(1), this provision refers explicitly to the employer and decisions made by the employer, not the liability of the Second Injury Fund or the employee\u2019s bottom-line benefits. The majority believes that MCL 418.354(15) delineates the only exception to mandatory coordination. But this reading neglects the great majority of cases in which there is no second employer, as well as those in which the injury employer provides more than 80 percent of the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wage. Nothing will prevent those employers from choosing to provide uncoordinated benefits to their injured employees, even if the injured employees are not volunteer firefighters or other first responders. Instead, those employers are free to contract as they see fit with respect to benefits in accordance with their employment needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">This point warrants emphasis: under the majority\u2019s analysis MCL 418.354(15) is implicated only in a dual-employment context in which the injury employer pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>vides 80 percent or less of the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wage and can, therefore, request reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund. But MCL 418.354 on its face plainly applies to <em>all </em>cases, not just those in which the Second Injury Fund is dependently liable. If an employer may <em>only </em>waive benefit coordination under the volunteer firefighter provision of MCL 418.354(15), what import would MCL 418.354 have if Thornapple had been Smitter\u2019s only employer, or if General Motors had been the injury employer? In either case, the injury employer surely could have chosen to pay its employees whatever benefits it deemed appropriate <em>without </em>regard to MCL 418.354(1) or (15).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">To read MCL 418.354(1) as imposing a <em>requirement </em>on a subset of injury employers in dual-employment cases renders that supposedly mandatory language meaningless in a majority of situations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s analysis requires us to assume away the textual clues that undercut application of the common understanding of the verb \u201cshall\u201d and to overlook the fact that, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the language of MCL 418.354(1) is inapplicable to most cases. The plain language of the WDCA does not make that analysis easy. If the touchstone of our analysis remains the plain language of the statute, I would refrain from reading such particular intent into MCL 418.354(1) and (15) because there is no clear indication that this is what the Legislature intended.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>III. THE PUBLIC POLICY ARTICULATED BY THE LEGISLATURE</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The majority\u2019s view that the statute requires coordination of benefits by injury employers who provide less than 80 percent of an employee\u2019s wage in dual-employment contexts (the minority injury employer) is undermined by the many contexts in which that rule is not enforceable. As previously noted, single employers and injury employers who are responsible for more than 80 percent of an employee\u2019s weekly wage will never seek reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund and are thus free to contract with their employees to provide insurance as they deem appropriate. In addition, the non-injury employer in a dual-employment situation may provide the injured employee with an insurance benefit without triggering any obligation to coordinate before seeking reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund because the statute only addresses the coordination of benefits provided by the \u201csame employer.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is hard to imagine that the Legislature intended to prevent benefits beyond wage-loss benefits in those cases where there is a minority injury employer in a dual-employment situation. It makes far more sense that the Legislature intended to give an employer providing both wage-loss and accident benefits the possibility of reducing its wage-loss obligation, if that employer deemed it appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">To reiterate, MCL 418.354(1)(b) only directs the \u201csame employer\u201d to coordinate benefits. The fact that coordination is not required when an injured employee receives an additional benefit from a different employer is evidence that that the Legislature did not intend this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>section to limit the amount of benefits an employee received,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If Smitter had received accident insurance from General Motors, there would have been no dispute that Thornapple would have been responsible for paying full wage-loss benefits and also been entitled to a full reimbursement by the Second Injury Fund. This limitation of the coordination provision to the benefits provided by the injury employer is yet further evidence that coordination is not mandated before reimbursement is sought. The Legislature\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to require coordination of benefits among employers implies that the Legislature <em>did </em>anticipate that some employees would recover benefits apart from the weekly wage-loss benefits and did not see any need to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Furthermore, permitting a minority injury employer to coordinate instead of mandating coordination does not result in greater costs being passed on to the Second Injury Fund. Any minority injury employer in a dual-employment situation that might request reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund has these choices: (1) the employer could choose not to offer additional insurance benefits at all, (2) the employer could choose to offer additional benefits, and then coordinate those benefits so that it would have a lower wage-loss liability, or (3) the employer could choose to offer additional benefits and elect not to coordinate those benefits, paying the full wage-loss benefit in addition to the additional benefit. Notably, the minority injury employer\u2019s and the Second Injury Fund\u2019s liabilities are the same in the first and last scenarios, and both are lower in the second. The minority injury employer does not stand to gain financially from the Second Injury Fund under any option.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>According to the majority, a minority injury employer loses the right to full reimbursement by providing an additional insurance benefit. If the majority is correct, the Legislature must have intended to discourage employers who are hiring part-time employees from providing incentives for those employees. Surely that narrow policy goal could have been accomplished without requiring the tenuous reading of the statutory language the majority proposes. But more fundamentally, there is no reason to suppose the Legislature sought to interfere with the prerogative of this subset of employers to enter into employment contracts and offer their employees whatever insurance benefits the employer and employee jointly elected. Respecting employment contracts seems especially important for employers trying to attract first responders in tough economic times. In the absence of any reason to worry that either the injury employer or the employee would be taken advantage of in their free market transaction, or that both would collude to take advantage of the Second Injury Fund\u2014 and such worries seem hard to imagine here \u2014 we should presume, barring legislative indication to the contrary, that the Legislature did not seek to regulate employment contract terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In my view, the more natural reading of the statutory provisions at issue is one that holds that the decision to coordinate benefits rests solely with the injury employer and does not affect the reimbursement an injury employer may request from the Second Injury Fund in dual-employment cases. This understanding gives meaning to the statutory language limiting coordination to benefits paid by a single employer, avoids reading out the phrase \u201cthe employer\u2019s obligation\u201d in MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>418.354(1), avoids rendering the supposed mandate of the verb \u201cshall\u201d nugatory in a majority of employment situations, and would not punish or impede an employer seeking to recruit employees with employment terms that employers and employees deem desirable, especially for dangerous but important jobs like fighting fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-5\">Viviano, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-5\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\"> See MCL 418.501(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> MCL 418.351(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\"> MCL 418.372(1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b251-4\"> Smitter received $800 a week in sickness and accident benefits pursuant to the policy purchased by Thornapple. The benefit policy covered part-time firefighters. Thornapple Township hoped to incentivize this job to better recruit qualified candidates and therefore offered its employees disability benefits <em>along with </em>workers\u2019 compensation wage-loss benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b251-5\"> Sickness and accident benefits are essentially disability benefits, and the parties do not dispute that these benefits are provided under a disability insurance policy as described in MCL 418.354(1)(b). MCL 500.3400(1) defines \u201cpolicy of disability insurance\u201d to \u201cincluded any policy or contract of insurance against loss resulting from sickness or from bodily injury or death by accident, or both, including also the granting of specific hospital benefits and medical, surgical and sick-care benefits to any person, family or group . . . .\u201d Depending on how the relevant insurance policy defines them, disability benefits may be used for in-home assistance, special transportation needs, uncompensated medical needs, or other consequences of an injury apart from lost income. Disability benefits are especially relevant in dangerous occupations like firefighting, in which employment risks are not limited to the lost <em>wages, </em>and the injured are likely to require compensation greater than that provided by wage replacement. More generally, there is a robust market for disability insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> MCL 418.354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"> MCL 418.354(1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> MCL 418.354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> \u201cThough \u2018shall\u2019 generally means \u2018must,\u2019 legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, \u2018shall\u2019 to mean \u2018should,\u2019 \u2018will,\u2019 or even \u2018may.\u2019 See D.
