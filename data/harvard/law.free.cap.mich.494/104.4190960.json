It did so on the grounds that the circuit court erred by admitting hearsay testimony on the theory that defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to forfeiture by wrongdoing under the Michigan Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that the circuit court erred by admitting the challenged statements, because the prosecution failed to demonstrate that defendant had the specific intent to, and in fact did, cause the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>On August 18, 2010, a bible school teacher (Gonzales) filed a police report concerning disclosures made to her the day before by a four-year-old girl (CB). The disclosures suggested that CB had been sexually abused by defendant, her father. Defendant promptly moved out of the home he shared with CB and her mother. Defendant was arrested on September 2, 2010, and he had no further contact with CB.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">After the initial disclosure to Gonzales, CB was interviewed twice, first by a forensic interviewer on September 1, 2010, and later by a sexual-assault nurse examiner. In both interviews CB indicated that defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with her. A medical examination did not find evidence of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">CB did not testify at the preliminary examination. Nevertheless, defendant was bound over to circuit court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At trial, the court permitted Gonzales to testify to CB\u2019s out-of-court statements concerning the suspected abuse <em>before </em>CB testified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gonzales testified that CB had told her that \u201cDave Junior\u201d hurt her by licking and digitally penetrating her \u201cbutt.\u201d After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Gonzales testified, the prosecutor attempted to elicit testimony from CB four times.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All four attempts were unsuccessful. CB left the witness chair, hid under the podium, refused to answer questions asked by the prosecutor, indicated that she would <em>not </em>tell the truth, stated that she was fearful of the jury, and expressed a desire to leave the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The trial court then held a hearing to determine whether there was a separate basis for admitting Gonzales\u2019s conditionally admitted testimony, because MRE 803A required CB to testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor argued, and the court agreed, that defendant had rendered CB unavailable to testify through his own wrongdoing, and the court admitted Gonzales\u2019s testimony under MRE 804(b)(6). The trial court based its ruling on a video recording of CB\u2019s interview with the forensic interviewer: When asked if defendant had said anything during the alleged abuse, CB stated that defendant told her \u201cnot to tell,\u201d and that \u201c[defendant] didn\u2019t want me to tell nobody\u201d or else she would \u201cget in trouble.\u201d The trial court determined that defendant\u2019s instructions, as recounted by CB, were sufficient to find forfeiture by wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The trial court also determined that CB was unavailable to testify, a condition for admissibility under MRE 804(b)(6), \u201cbecause, among other things, of her infirmity, her youth, to be able to testify here in court and the fear, frankly, that she has of testifying here in court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Having found Gonzales\u2019s testimony admissible under MRE 804(b)(6), the trial court also concluded that defendant had forfeited his confrontation right.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court admitted the testimony of the sexual-assault nurse examiner and the transcript and video recording of CB\u2019s forensic interview with the forensic interviewer. CB never testified. There was no other evidence of the abuse apart from the hearsay testimony. Defendant testified that he did not abuse CB.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The jury convicted defendant of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b. The Court of Appeals reversed in an unpublished opinion per cu-riam,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concluding that the circuit court erred in its application of the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing analysis. The Court of Appeals concluded that the prosecutor had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant had both the specific intent to cause CB\u2019s unavailability, and that the wrongdoing did, in fact, cause CB\u2019s unavailability. We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">A trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Preliminary questions of law, including whether a rule of evidence precludes the admission of evidence, are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Likewise, interpretation of a court rule is a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A preserved error in the admission of evidence does not warrant reversal unless \u201c \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear\u2019 that it is more probable than not that the error was outcome determinative.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">III. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">A defendant can forfeit his right to exclude hearsay by his own wrongdoing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> MRE 804(b)(6) provides that a statement is <em>not </em>excluded by the general rule against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable, and the \u201cstatement [is] offered against a party that has engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This rule, commonly known as the forfeiture-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>by-wrongdoing rule, was adopted in 2001 and is substantially similar to its federal counterpart, FRE 804(b)(6).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Giles, </em>forfeiture by wrongdoing has its roots in the common law, and is based on the maxim that \u201cno one should be permitted to take advantage of his wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The forfeiture doctrine not only provides a basis for an exception to the rule against hearsay; it is also an exception to a defendant\u2019s constitutional confrontation right. Insofar as it applies to the Sixth Amendment, however, the forfeiture doctrine requires that the defendant must have specifically intended that his wrongdoing would render the witness unavailable to testify.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Giles, </em>the defendant was convicted of murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend. He testified that he had killed her in self-defense. The prosecution introduced statements the victim had made to police officers several weeks before the homicide, in which she described a death threat the defendant made to her. The California Supreme Court determined that the statements were testimonial, but that defendant had forfeited his right to confront the victim because he had committed the murder for which he was on trial, and because his intentional criminal act had caused the victim to be unavailable to testify.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Court reversed, holding that for a defendant to forfeit his confrontation right by his or her wrongdoing, the defendant must have had \u201cin mind the particular purpose of making the witness unavailable.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Since its adoption in 2001, only two published Michigan appellate cases have discussed the application of Michigan\u2019s forfeiture rule, MRE 804(b)(6). Both preceded <em>Giles. </em>In <em>People v Bauder, </em>the Court of Appeals discussed MRE 804(b)(6) but did not address its proper application.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There, the defendant argued that his confrontation right had been violated when the trial court admitted hearsay testimony.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals ultimately determined that the challenged statements were nontestimonial and properly admitted as statements of a then-existing mental condition under MRE 803(3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Yet in discussing the forfeiture issue, the <em>Bauder </em>Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that forfeiture by wrongdoing for purposes of the Confrontation Clause required a showing of intent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That approach was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Giles.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The Court of Appeals has specifically addressed forfeiture by wrongdoing more recently in <em>People v Jones.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>There, the Court of Appeals held that to admit hearsay under the forfeiture doctrine, the prosecution was required to prove: \u201c(1) that the defendant engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing; (2) that the wrongdoing was intended to procure the declarant\u2019s unavailability; and (3) that the wrongdoing did procure the unavailability.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The <em>Jones </em>Court further held that the preponderance of the evidence standard applied, consistent with a majority of the federal circuit courts.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While <em>Jones </em>preceded <em>Giles, </em>its application of forfeiture by wrongdoing as incorporating a specific intent element is consistent with <em>Giles.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree with the <em>Jones </em>Court that MRE 804(b)(6) incorporates a specific intent requirement. For the rule to apply, a defendant must have \u201cengaged in or encouraged wrongdoing that was <em>intended to, and did, procure </em>the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We note that the Court of Appeals explicitly avoided defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim in this case in recognition of our constitutional avoidance doctrine.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It is nonetheless readily apparent that evidence offered under the forfeiture exception will very regularly be testimonial and subject to Sixth Amendment scrutiny. As forfeiture by wrongdoing is the only recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>exception to the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the constitutional question will often go hand-in-hand with the evidentiary question, as it did in the trial court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Because the forfeiture doctrine can provide both an exception to the general rule against hearsay and an exception to the confrontation right, the United States Constitution does not prevent the states from crafting a forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception for <em>nontestimonial </em>hearsay that does not require any proof of a defendant\u2019s specific intent.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> But the plain language of our court rule in fact incorporates the specific intent requirement at issue in <em>Giles.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">To admit evidence under MRE 804(b)(6), the prosecution must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the defendant engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing; (2) the wrongdoing was intended to procure the declarant\u2019s unavailability; and (3) the wrongdoing did procure the unavailability.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For purposes of our inquiry, we assume that the trial court correctly found that defendant did, in fact, engage in wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Turning to the second element, it is also alleged that during the alleged abuse defendant instructed CB \u201cnot to tell\u201d anyone and warned her that if she told, she would \u201cget in trouble.\u201d The question is whether these threats, made contemporaneously with the abuse but before any report or investigation, require a finding that defendant \u201cintended to ... procure the unavailability of [CB] as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The prosecution concedes that, the trial court did not make a specific finding with regard to defendant\u2019s intent. Rather, it asks this Court to hold that the necessary finding was implicit in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, and is compelled by the record. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Even if the record were to support an express finding that the trial court never made, the record does not <em>compel </em>that finding. Defendant immediately left the family home after Gonzales reported the suspected abuse. He had no contact with CB whatsoever once the conduct was reported, and nobody else attempted on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>behalf to influence CB not to testify. There is no evidence or allegation that defendant attempted to influence CB directly or indirectly apart from the contemporaneous statements at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">The timing of defendant\u2019s alleged wrongdoing is also relevant to our conclusion that the record does not compel a finding that defendant had the specific intent to procure CB\u2019s unavailability. Defendant\u2019s instruction to CB not to report the abuse was made before there was any indication that the abuse had been reported or discovered. While the timing of the wrongdoing is by itself not determinative, it can inform the inquiry: a defendant\u2019s wrongdoing <em>after </em>the underlying criminal activity has been reported or discovered is inherently more suspect, and can give rise to a strong inference of intent to cause a declarant\u2019s unavailability.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Without the guidance of an explicit trial court finding to shed light on the record, defendant\u2019s contemporaneous statements to CB are as consistent with the inference that defendant\u2019s intention was that the alleged abuse go undiscovered as they are with an inference that defendant specifically intended to prevent CB from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>testifying.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Further, assuming defendant knew that CB would not disclose the abuse because of his directive, that knowledge is not necessarily the equivalent of the specific intent to cause CB\u2019s unavailability to testify as required by MRE 804(b)(6). Attempting to equate the two in every circumstance improperly assumes that a defendant\u2019s knowledge is always the same as a defendant\u2019s purpose. In other words, whether a person in defendant\u2019s position would reasonably foresee that the wrongdoing might cause CB\u2019s unavailability is separate and distinct from whether defendant intended to procure the declarant\u2019s unavailability to testify at trial. We interpret the specific intent requirement of MRE 804(b)(6) \u2014 to procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness \u2014 as requiring the prosecution to show that defendant acted with, at least in part, the particular purpose to cause CB\u2019s unavailability, rather than mere knowledge that the wrongdoing may cause the witness\u2019s unavailability. Without the aid of a specific factual finding from the trial court in this case, we are unable to determine from the record whether defendant had the requisite specific intent.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We are mindful that prosecuting child sexual abuse cases with young victims presents acute complications. But we are not persuaded by the prosecution\u2019s argument that public policy and the nature of the alleged crime demand that we infer intent under the facts of this case. The <em>Giles </em>Court expressly rejected a similar argument in the context of domestic violence, and refused to create a presumption of intent.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> At the same time, we recognize that the intent analysis must ultimately be made on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> For these reasons, we are not persuaded that the facts of this case require us to conclude that the MRE 804(b)(6)-required specific intent can necessarily be inferred from the trial court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We also conclude that the trial court\u2019s application of the third element required to satisfy MRE 804(b)(6)\u2014 that defendant\u2019s conduct in fact <em>caused </em>CB\u2019s <em>unavailability </em>\u2014 undermines its conclusion that the hearsay testimony was admissible pursuant to MRE 804(b)(6). As the trial court recognized in declaring CB unavailable, her inability to testify was based on her \u201cinfirmity, her youth,\u201d and her fear of testifying in open court. The trial court did not include defendant\u2019s wrongdoing among the reasons for CB\u2019s inability to testify. In fact, the objective evidence about defendant\u2019s alleged wrongdoing would tend to support the conclusion that defendant\u2019s wrongdoing <em>did not </em>cause CB\u2019s inability to testify. Defendant allegedly directed CB to \u201cnot tell,\u201d yet she did not follow that direction. Instead, she told the bible school teacher, the forensic interviewer, and the sexual-assault nurse examiner. Moreover, at one point during an interview, CB stated that defendant had told her \u201cnot to tell\u201d anybody because she would \u201cget in trouble,\u201d but then immediately acknowledged that she \u201cwon\u2019t get in trouble\u201d for telling. Because the trial court\u2019s findings about the reasons for CB\u2019s unavailability did not include defendant\u2019s wrongdoing and are not clearly erroneous, we conclude that the prosecutor has not satisfied the causation element of MRE 804(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Finally, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the admission of testimony regarding CB\u2019s statements was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>outcome determinative. Aside from the improperly admitted hearsay testimony, the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s alleged criminal sexual conduct. Given the lack of any physical evidence, third-party eyewitnesses, or testimony from CB, we conclude that it is more probable than not that the erroneous admission of the hearsay testimony was outcome determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We hold that the prosecutor failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct both was intended to, and did, cause CB\u2019s unavailability. Thus, admission of CB\u2019s hearsay statements pursuant to MRE 804(b)(6) was an abuse of discretion, and the error was outcome determinative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-7\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Kelly, Zahra, and VIVIANO, JJ., concurred with MCCORMACK, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\"> MRE 804(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"> The district court based its decision in support of the bindover on the testimony of the sexual-assault nurse examiner.

Unsurprisingly, there are many forfeiture cases discussing intent relating to already-charged conduct. See, <em>e.g., United States v Stewart, </em>485 F3d 666, 671-672 (CA 2, 2007) (holding that circumstantial evidence can establish that while the defendant faced drug charges, he procured the murder of a witness who was scheduled to testify against him to prevent that testimony); <em>People v Banos, </em>178 Cal App 4th 483, 502; 100 Cal Rptr 3d 476 (2009) (finding <em>Giles </em>was satisfied by the testimonial statements of the defendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, for whose murder he was being tried, because the evidence showed that the defendant had killed her both out of jealousy <em>and </em>to prevent her from testifying in pending cases and from cooperating with authorities). We note that there are important differences between these cases and the case before us. In addition to the timing of the misconduct, homicide cases present different inferences than the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\"> In general, questions of intent are factual determinations for the trier of fact to make. See <em>People v Kieronski, </em>214 Mich App 222, 232; 542 NW2d 339 (1995) (\u201cIntent is a question of fact to be inferred from the circumstances by the trier of fact.\u201d). The trial court acts as the fact finder in determining questions of fact preliminary to the admissibility of evidence. MRE 104(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\"> A comparison to <em>Giles </em>is illustrative. There, the wrongdoing was an intentional homicide. Thus, the declarant\u2019s unavailability was not just reasonably foreseeable, it was certain. But, as the <em>Giles </em>Court recognized, forfeiture by wrongdoing requires a purposed-based inquiry: \u201cthe dissent\u2019s claim that knowledge is sufficient to show intent is emphatically <em>not </em>the modern view.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>554 US at 368, citing 1 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law, \u00a7 5.2, p 340 (2d ed 2003). While the alleged wrongdoing in the instant case is fundamentally different than the murder in <em>Giles, </em>the requisite specific intent required \u2014 to cause a declarant\u2019s unavailability to testify \u2014 remains the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em> Giles, 554 US </em>at 376-377.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\"> The Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[a]lthough it appears that the purpose of any such statements \u2018not to tell\u2019 may have been to prevent the victim from disclosing the criminal acts, <em>it is doubtful that they can be construed as threats intended to prevent the victim from testifying at trial.\" Bums, </em>unpub op at 2 (emphasis added). Although the record in this case does not support such a construction because it is devoid of both an explicit trial court finding of specific intent or evidence to compel such a conclusion, we emphasize that such statements <em>must </em>be evaluated in light of the circumstances in which they were made, on a case-by-case basis. Although not required by our court rules, we strongly encourage trial courts to make findings of fact on the record for each of the three elements required by MRE 804(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> We recognize that the <em>Giles </em>holding has been criticized for its policy implications, especially in cases of domestic violence culminating in murder. See, <em>e.g., </em>Lininger, <em>The Sound of Silence: Holding Batterers Accountable for Silencing Their Victims, </em>87 Tex L Rev 857 (2009); Davies, <em>Selective Originalism: Sorting Out Which Aspect of Giles\u2019s Forfeiture Exception to Confrontation Were or Were Not \u201cEstablished at the Time of the Founding,\u201d </em>13 Lewis &amp; Clark L Rev 605 (2009). Commentators have also advocated for different standards to be applied in cases of child witnesses in a variety of forfeiture and Confrontation clause contexts. See, <em>e.g., </em>Lyon and Dente, <em>Child Witnesses and the Confrontation Clause, </em>102 J Crim L &amp; Criminology 1181 (2012) (proposing a \u201cforfeiture by exploitation\u201d approach in cases of child abuse); Dripps, <em>Controlling the Damage Done by Crawford v Washington: Three Constructive Proposals, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>7 Ohio St J Crim L 521 (2010) (suggesting a rebuttable presumption that an otherwise unexplained unavailability of a witness previously injured or threatened by the accused is the result of improper pressure brought by the defendant). Yet, the courts\u2019 respect for the Sixth Amendment and the rules of evidence may be all that separates an accusation from a wrongful conviction. In any event, our role is not to enter such policy debates but rather to apply the United States Supreme Court\u2019s precedent and our own rules faithfully.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
