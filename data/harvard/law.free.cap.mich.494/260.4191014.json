Following defendant\u2019s second jury trial, he was convicted of assault with intent to murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, concluding <em>inter alia </em>that defendant had been improperly impeached with his silence when the prosecutor made repeated references to his failure to testify at his first trial. We granted leave requesting that the parties address: (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment of defendant\u2019s testimony using defendant\u2019s failure to testify at his earlier trial violated defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and (2) whether prior consistent statements by the complainant were admissible under MRE 801(d)(1)(B). <em>People v Clary, </em>491 Mich 933 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Because we believe that the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment of defendant\u2019s testimony with his failure to testify at his earlier trial was not improper, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals to that extent. The Court of Appeals also addressed whether the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post-<em>Miranda </em>silence were improper and held that reversal was not required because the record was unclear regarding whether the post-arrest silence also constituted <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. However, our review of the transcript of defendant\u2019s arraignment indicates that defendant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at his arraignment, and thus we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post<em>-Miranda </em>silence at trial plainly violated <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 618-619; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976). Accordingly, we do not disturb the ultimate disposition reached by the Court of Appeals, i.e., the reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions. We otherwise vacate this Court\u2019s June 6, 2012 order granting leave to appeal and deny the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal because we are not persuaded that this Court should review the remaining question presented. Finally, we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. If defendant chooses to testify at a third trial, the prosecutor may again refer to defendant\u2019s failure to testify at his first trial without violating defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">At defendant\u2019s first trial, the complainant testified that defendant shot him. Defendant did not testify. The trial was eventually declared a mistrial because of a hung jury. At defendant\u2019s second trial, the complainant again testified that defendant shot him, but this time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>defendant testified that he did not shoot the complainant. The prosecutor impeached defendant\u2019s testimony by asking him why he had not provided that testimony at the first trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor also commented on defendant\u2019s silence at his first trial during closing arguments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following defendant\u2019s second jury trial, defendant was convicted of assault with intent to murder, MCL 750.83, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, concluding, among other things, that defendant was improperly impeached with his silence when the prosecutor made several references to defendant\u2019s failure to testify at his first trial. <em>People v Clary, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 16, 2012 (Docket No. 301906). We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>Clary, </em>491 Mich 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Whether defendant was improperly impeached with his silence is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>People v Borgne, </em>483 Mich 178, 184; 768 NW2d 290 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">A. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall... be compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . US Const, Am V See also Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. The Fifth Amendment has been made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Malloy v Hogan, </em>378 US 1, 3; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964). Pursuant to <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 444; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), in order to protect the privilege against compelled self-incrimination during custodial police interrogations, the suspect \u201cmust be warned that he has a right to remain silent [and] that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him . . . .\u201d The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment, in its direct application to the Federal Government, and in its bearing on the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence [at trial] or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Griffin v California, </em>380 US 609, 615; 85 S Ct 1229; 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965). That is, the Fifth Amendment prohibits using a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>Id. </em>The Court has also held that \u201c \u2018[w]hen a person under arrest is informed, as <em>Miranda </em>requires, that he may remain silent, [and] that anything he says may be used against him,\u2019 \u201d \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence [at the time of his arrest] to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 US at 618-619 (citation omitted); see also <em>Borgne, </em>483 Mich at 186-188; <em>People v Shafier, </em>483 Mich 205, 212-214; 768 NW2d 305 (2009).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>However, the United States Supreme Court has also held that \u201cthe use of prearrest silence to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility violates [n]either the Fifth [n]or the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231, 232, 238, 240; 100 S Ct 2124; 65 L Ed 2d 86 (1980); see also <em>People v Cetlinski (After Remand), </em>435 Mich 742, 757; 460 NW2d 534 (1990) (\u201c[N] either the Fifth Amendment nor the Michigan Constitution preclude^] the use of prearrest silence for impeachment purposes.\u201d). Moreover, it has also held that \u201c[i]n the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we do not believe that it violates due process of law for a State to permit cross-examination as to postarrest silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.\u201d <em>Fletcher v Weir, </em>455 US 603, 607; 102 S Ct 1309; 71 L Ed 2d 490 (1982). Finally, it has held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment is not violated when a defendant who testifies in his own defense is impeached with his prior silence\u201d at his first trial. <em>Jenkins, </em>447 US at 235, citing <em>Raffel v United States, </em>271 US 494; 46 S Ct 566; 70 L Ed 1054 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">B. <em>RAFFEL </em>AND <em>STEWART</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In <em>Raffel, </em>271 US at 496, 499, the United States Supreme Court held that it was not \u201cerror to require the defendant, Raffel, offering himself as a witness upon the second trial, to disclose that he had not testified as a witness in his own behalf upon the first trial.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The immunity from giving testimony is one which the defendant may waive by offering himself as a witness. When he takes the stand in his own behalf, he does so as any other witness, and within the limits of the appropriate rules he may be cross-examined as to the facts in issue. He may be examined for the purpose of impeaching his credibility. His failure to deny or explain evidence of incriminating circumstances of which he may have knowledge, may be the basis of adverse inference, and the jury may be so instructed.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] His waiver is not partial; having once cast aside the cloak of immunity, he may not resume it at will, whenever cross-examination may be inconvenient or embarrassing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">If, therefore, the questions asked of the defendant were logically relevant, and competent within the scope of the rules of cross-examination, they were proper questions .... <em>[Id. </em>at 496-497 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The Court then held that asking the defendant about his silence at his first trial was logically relevant and competent within the scope of the general rules of cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">[W]e do not think the questions asked of him were irrelevant or incompetent. For if the cross-examination had revealed that the real reason for the defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>contradict the government\u2019s testimony on the first trial was a lack of faith in the truth or probability of his own story, his answers would have a bearing on his credibility and on the truth of his own testimony in chief.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">It is elementary that a witness who upon direct examination denies making statements relevant to the issue, may be cross-examined with respect to conduct on his part inconsistent with this denial. The value of such testimony, as is always the case with cross-examination, must depend upon the nature of the answers elicited; and their weight is for the jury. But we cannot say that such questions are improper cross-examination, although the trial judge might appropriately instruct the jury that the failure of the defendant to take the stand in his own behalf is not in itself to be taken as an admission of the truth of the testimony which he did not deny. <em>[Id. </em>at 497-498.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In summary, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">The safeguards against self-incrimination are for the benefit of those who do not wish to become witnesses in their own behalf and not for those who do. There is a sound policy in requiring the accused who offers himself as a witness to do so without reservation, as does any other witness. We can discern nothing in the policy of the law against self-incrimination which would require the extension of immunity to any trial or to any tribunal other than that in which the defendant preserves it by refusing to testify. <em>[Id. </em>at 499.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We are not persuaded by the Court of Appeals\u2019 attempt to distinguish <em>Raffel. </em>The Court of Appeals stated, \u201cUnlike the defendant in <em>Raffel, </em>defendant in this case did not contradict the testimony of a witness offered at both his first and second trial.\u201d <em>Clary, </em>unpub op at 8. We respectfully disagree. In both <em>Raffel </em>and the instant case, the defendant contradicted the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of a witness offered at both the first and second trials. In <em>Raffel, </em>the defendant contradicted the testimony of a government agent who testified that the defendant had made admissions of guilt, and in the instant case, defendant contradicted the testimony of the complainant who testified that defendant shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We are equally unpersuaded by the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the instant case is more like <em>Stewart v United States, </em>366 US 1; 81 S Ct 941; 6 L Ed 2d 84 (1961). Unlike in <em>Raffel </em>and the instant case, in <em>Stewart </em>the defendant did not contradict the testimony of a witness offered at both his first and second trials. As <em>Stewart, </em>366 US at 5-6, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">The <em>Raffel </em>case . .. involved a situation in which Raffel had sat silent at his first trial in the face of testimony by a government agent that Raffel had previously made admissions pointing to his guilt. On a second trial, Raffel took the stand and denied the truth of this same testimony offered by the same witness. Under these circumstances, this Court held that Raffel\u2019s silence at the first trial could be shown in order to discredit his testimony at the second trial on the theory that the silence itself constituted an admission as to the truth of the agent\u2019s testimony. The result was that Raffel\u2019s silence at the first trial was held properly admitted to impeach the specific testimony he offered at the second trial. Here, on the other hand, the defendant\u2019s entire \u201ctestimony\u201d comprised nothing more than \u201cgibberish without meaning\u201d with the result that there was no specific testimony to impeach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">This \u201cgibberish\u201d was apparently offered to demonstrate that the defendant was insane, which was the defendant\u2019s chief defense at all three of his trials, and not to contradict the testimony of any witness. The United States Supreme Court held that because the defendant\u2019s silence was not used for impeachment purposes, it was not admissible under <em>Raffel. </em>In this case, however, defendant\u2019s silence was clearly used for impeach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ment purposes and, thus, it is admissible under <em>Raffel.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We therefore hold that defendant was not improperly impeached with his silence when the prosecutor made repeated references to his failure to testify at his first trial. Accordingly, if defendant chooses to testify at a third trial, the prosecutor may again refer to defendant\u2019s failure to testify at his first trial without violating defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">C. <em>DOYLE </em>AND <em>JENKINS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">However, the prosecutor may not again refer to defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence with the police because to do so would clearly violate <em>Doyle, </em>426 US at 618-619, which prohibits the admission of post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence with the police. At defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>dant\u2019s second trial, the prosecutor impeached defendant by asking him why, after he was arrested and arraigned, he had not told the police that he did not shoot the complainant. The prosecutor also referred to this silence during her closing argument. The Court of Appeals held that there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation because \u201c[a]fter reviewing the record, it is unclear whether the post-arrest silence referenced by the prosecutor was also post <em>-Miranda </em>silence.\u201d <em>Clary, </em>unpub op at 5. This Court subsequently granted defendant\u2019s motion to consider the transcript of defendant\u2019s arraignment, which shows that defendant had been informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at his arraignment. <em>Clary, </em>821 NW2d 314 (Mich, 2012). Given this new information, it seems clear that the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence with the police violated <em>Doyle. </em>Accordingly, we hold that if there is a third trial, defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence with the police is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Defendant argues that there is a tension between <em>Raffel </em>and <em>Doyle </em>because while <em>Doyle </em>holds that post-<em>Miranda </em>silence is admissible, <em>Raffel </em>holds that silence at an earlier trial is admissible to impeach a defendant who testifies at a subsequent trial, even though this silence is also post <em>-Miranda </em>silence. Although we recognize this tension, we also recognize that <em>Raffel </em>has not been overruled by <em>Doyle </em>or by any other United States Supreme Court decision. Indeed, <em>Doyle </em>expressly held that it was \u201cunnecessary\u201d to address in that case the constitutionality of a prosecutor\u2019s inquiry into silence after the time of arrest because that later silence \u201cpresent[s] different considerations . . . .\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 US at 616 n 6. Specifically, <em>Doyle </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">In addition, error of constitutional dimension is asserted because each petitioner was cross-examined as to post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>arrest, preliminary hearing, and general pretrial silence when he testified as a defense witness at the other petitioner\u2019s trial. These averments of error present different considerations from those implicated by cross-examining petitioners as defendants as to their silence after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the time of arrest.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] In view of our disposition of this case we find it unnecessary to reach these additional issues. <em>[Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Therefore, it appears that <em>Doyle\u2019s </em>rule prohibiting the admission of post <em>-Miranda </em>silence applies to silence at the time of arrest, while Raffel\u2019s rule permitting the admission of <em>post-Miranda </em>silence applies to silence at an earlier trial when the defendant takes the stand at a subsequent. trial. This conclusion is further underscored by the fact that after <em>Doyle </em>was decided, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Jenkins </em>recognized the continued vitality of Raffel\u2019s rule that a defendant\u2019s silence at his first trial can be used to impeach the defendant at a subsequent trial if the defendant decides to take the stand. <em>Jenkins, </em>447 US at 235-238. Not only did <em>Jenkins </em>favorably discuss <em>Raffel </em>at length, but it also expressly rejected the suggestion \u201cthat the constitutional rule of <em>Raffel </em>was limited by later decisions of the Court,\u201d explaining that \u201cno Court opinion decided since <em>Raffel </em>has challenged its holding that the Fifth Amendment is not violated when a defendant is impeached on the basis of his prior silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237 n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>D. \u201cCHILLING\u201d FIFTH AMENDMENT EIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Defendant suggests that a person facing a trial will be less likely to rely on his right to remain silent if he knows that his reliance on that right can be subsequently used against him, that is to say, exercise of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination will be \u201cchilled.\u201d However, as <em>Jenkins, </em>447 US at 236-237, explained, \u201cThe <em>Raffel </em>Court explicitly rejected the contention that the possibility of impeachment by prior silence is an impermissible burden upon the exercise of Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d In other words, <em>Raffel </em>specifically considered the argument that \u201cthe adoption of the rule contended for by the Government might operate to bring pressure on the accused to take the stand on the first trial, for fear of the consequences of his silence in the event of a second trial; and might influence the defendant to continue his silence on the second trial because his first silence may there be made to count against him,\u201d and held that this argument was \u201cwithout substance.\u201d <em>Raffel, </em>271 US at 498-499.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">We need <em>not </em>close our eyes to the <em>fact that every person </em>accused of crime is under some pressure to testify, lest the jury, despite carefully framed instructions, draw an unfavorable inference from his silence.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] When he does take the stand, he is under the same pressure: to testify fully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>rather than avail himself of a partial immunity. And the accused at the second trial may well doubt whether the advantage lies with partial silence or with complete silence. Even if, on his first trial, he were to weigh the consequences of his failure to testify then, in the light of what might occur on a second trial, it would require delicate balances to enable him to say that the rule of partial immunity would make his burden less onerous than the rule that he may remain silent, or at his option, testify fully, explaining his previous silence. We are unable to see that the rule that if he testifies, he must testify fully, adds in any substantial manner to the inescapable embarrassment which the accused must experience in determining whether he shall testify or not. <em>[Id. </em>at 499 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It is well established that \u201cthe Constitution does not forbid \u2018every government-imposed choice in the criminal process that has the effect of discouraging the exercise of constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>447 US at 236, quoting <em>Chaffin v Stynchcombe, </em>412 US 17, 30; 93 S Ct 1977; 36 L Ed 2d 714 (1973). More specifically, \u201c[i]t is well settled that the government need not make the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege cost free.\u201d <em>McKune v Lile, </em>536 US 24, 41; 122 S Ct 2017; 153 L Ed 2d 47 (2002) (opinion by Kennedy, J.). For example, in <em>Crampton v Ohio, </em>decided with <em>McGautha v California, </em>402 US 183, 185, 211; 91 S Ct 1454; 28 L Ed 2d 711 (1971),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Court held that Ohio\u2019s single-trial procedure, which allowed a defendant to \u201cremain silent on the issue of guilt only at the cost of surrendering any chance to plead his case on the issue of punishment,\u201d was \u201cconstitutionally permissible.\u201d As the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring \u201cthe making of difficult judgments\u201d as to which course to follow. Although a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">... It does no violence to the privilege that a person\u2019s choice to testify in his own behalf may open the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence which is damaging to his case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">It has long been held that a defendant who takes the stand in his own behalf cannot then claim the privilege against cross-examination on matters reasonably related to the subject matter of his direct examination. It is not thought overly harsh in such situations to require that the determination whether to waive the privilege take into account the matters which may be brought out on cross-examination. It is also generally recognized that a defendant who takes the stand in his own behalf may be impeached by proof of prior convictions or the like.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] Again, it is not thought inconsistent with the enlightened administration of criminal justice to require the defendant to weigh such pros and cons in deciding whether to testify. <em>[Id. </em>at 213-215 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Similarly, in Chaffin, 412 US at 18, 29, the Court held that \u201cin those States that entrust the sentencing responsibility to the jury, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [does not] bar[] the jury from rendering higher sentences on retrials following rever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sals of prior convictions,\u201d even though the potential of \u201charsher sentences on retrial.. . [may] have a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on the convicted defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to challenge his first conviction either by direct appeal or collateral attack.\u201d \u201cThe choice occasioned by the possibility of a harsher sentence, even in the case in which the choice may in fact be \u2018difficult,\u2019 does not place an impermissible burden on the right of a criminal defendant to appeal or attack collaterally his conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35.

I join all but part III(D) and footnote 9 of the majority opinion. I write separately for two reasons: first, to elaborate on the majority\u2019s discussion of the tension between the holdings in <em>Raffel v United States</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Doyle v </em>Ohio<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and second, to note that the law remains unclear concerning the evidentiary value of a defendant\u2019s silence even if its admission is not barred by the United States Constitution. Accordingly, while there are significant points on which I agree with part III(D) of the majority opinion, I believe it is also important to highlight countervailing concerns regarding the use of silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">As the majority opinion correctly observes, <em>Raffel </em>has not been overruled, and the United States Supreme Court has recognized its continued vitality. I further agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals\u2019 attempts to distinguish <em>Raffel </em>are not persuasive. For these reasons, I agree that under controlling precedent the Constitution does not bar the admission of evidence concerning defendant\u2019s silence at his first tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>I am doubtful, however, that much <em>of Raffel\u2019s </em>reasoning remains sustainable in light of the subsequent <em>Doyle </em>decision. In particular, <em>Raffel</em>'s holding that any Fifth Amendment protection is waived when a defendant elects to testify at his or her second trial and the prosecution questions the defendant about his or her failure to testify at the first trial seems incompatible with <em>Doyle\u2019s </em>reasoning. <em>Doyle </em>explained that \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, questioning a defendant about why he or she did not testify at an earlier trial casts the defendant\u2019s prior silence in a negative fight when the defendant might have previously relied on a constitutional protection \u2014 something expressly forbidden by <em>Doyle.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And as the majority observes, silence at trial is also <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. Moreover, the compulsion to speak at a first trial is similar to the compulsion to speak during a custodial interrogation by police. In both scenarios, the suspect/defendant is being accused of committing a crime and presented with the evidence supporting his or her guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Thus, while I recognize that \u201cno Court opinion decided since <em>Raffel </em>has challenged its holding that the Fifth Amendment is not violated when a defendant is impeached on the basis of his prior silence,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the <em>significance </em>of that statement is highly questionable in light of the due process rationale of <em>Doyle.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because <em>Jenkins </em>involved the question of whether it was permissible to comment on a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence, which might very well not involve reliance on a constitutional protection because the suspect might be unaware of his or her right to remain silent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court in <em>Jenkins </em>was not forced to directly confront the tension between <em>Raffel </em>and <em>Doyle.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In this case, that tension is both present and particularly concerning because it is readily apparent from the record that defendant relied on his Fifth Amendment right in choosing to remain silent after receiving <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>warnings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the precise unfairness about which the <em>Doyle </em>Court was concerned \u2014 allowing impeachment using silence premised on the assertion of a constitutional right \u2014 is present in this case. While the majority correctly holds that \u201cdefendant\u2019s post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence with the police is inadmissible,\u201d the competing rationales set forth in <em>Raffel </em>and <em>Doyle </em>are not easily reconcilable with regard to the period following a post<em>-Miranda </em>police interrogation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor are they any more consistent when the silence occurred at a prior criminal proceeding. In other words, that a defendant waives his or her Fifth Amendment right when he or she chooses to take the stand, yet due process and fundamental fairness prohibit impeachment of a testifying defendant with post <em>-Miranda </em>silence because the defendant relied on that right, presents an analytical Gordian knot.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Despite this unresolved conflict in the law, I concur with the majority opinion because <em>Raffel </em>is directly controlling here and has not been overruled, whereas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>Doyle </em>has not been extended to this context. Thus, it must be the correct result unless or until the United States Supreme Court reconciles the adverse rationales underlying its holdings in <em>Raffel </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>I look forward to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">My second and related point involves the use of a defendant\u2019s silence as an evidentiary matter. While part III(D) of the majority opinion articulates the arguments for why the use of silence is not barred under the Fifth Amendment, I believe it is important to identify some factors militating against a broad rule in favor of admissibility as an evidentiary matter. To begin with, it is telling that in the same case in which the United States Supreme Court recognized the continued vitality of <em>Raffel, </em>it nevertheless noted that state courts \u201cremain[] free to formulate evidentiary rules defining the situations in which silence is viewed as more probative than prejudicial.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court has done so on several occasions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court and many commentators recognize that \u201cevery post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As one court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">The right of an accused not to testify is absolute; he may not even be called as a witness unless he so chooses. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>view his decision not to testify as being inconsistent with a later exculpatory statement would be to presume that the exercise of a right that is inextricably linked to the presumption of innocence constitutes conduct that can be viewed as inconsistent with innocence. Although such cross-examination might not be unconstitutional, the constitutional context in which the privilege is initially asserted strips it of the evidentiary value it might otherwise be thought to have.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Thus, while part III(D) of the majority opinion thoroughly discusses the policy rationales for why the Fifth Amendment does not bar impeachment with prior silence when a defendant chooses to testify, it is important to note that equally compelling countervailing policies have led many courts to exclude such impeachment evidence given its potential to be highly prejudicial. The majority correctly leaves it for the trial court to decide in the first instance whether testimony concerning defendant\u2019s silence at the first trial is admissible as an evidentiary matter, including an inquiry into whether its admission would be substantially more prejudicial than probative under MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">With these observations, I do not join part III(D) or footnote 9, but otherwise concur with the Court\u2019s excellent opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> <em>Raffel v United States, </em>271 US 494; 46 S Ct 566; 70 L Ed 1054 (1926).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Poulin, <em>Evidentiary use of silence and the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, </em>52 Geo Wash L R 191, 215 (1984) (\u201cThorough analysis reveals that impeachment use of privileged silence impairs the policies underlying the fifth amendment privilege.

Indeed, although the United States Supreme Court has indicated that states are \u201cfree to formulate evidentiary rules defining the situations in which silence is viewed as more probative than prejudicial,\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>447 US at 240,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has also reiterated that <em>\u201cin no case </em>has [it] intimated that there is such a basic inconsistency between silence at one trial and taking the stand at a subsequent trial that the fact of prior silence can be used to impeach <em>any </em>testimony which a defendant elects to give at a later trial,\u201d <em>Stewart v United States, </em>366 US 1, 5; 81 S Ct 941; 6 L Ed 2d 84 (1961) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>impeaching a defendant with his or her silence at a prior trial might be constitutional does <em>not </em>mean that, as an evidentiary matter, a defendant\u2019s prior silence is automatically admissible in a later trial when a defendant elects to waive his constitutional and statutory rights in favor of testifying.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>People v Cetlinski (After Remand), </em>435 Mich 742, 773; 460 NW2d 534 (1990) (Levin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>Jenkins, </em>447 US at 240-241.

In cases such as this, the issue thus includes whether a defendant\u2019s invocation of a constitutional privilege involves such inconsistency with a defendant\u2019s later trial testimony that impeachment by reference to a defendant\u2019s prior silence is probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Notably, in other contexts, a majority of this Court has explained that impeachment with a defendant\u2019s silence \u201cshould be approached with caution.\u201d <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23, 34; 393 NW2d 346 (1986) (citation and quotation marks omitted). I agree because, in my view, \u201cwhether or not the . . .
