Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the trial court must determine whether the complainant\u2019s preliminary examination testimony satisfies the requirements of MRE 804(b)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, if so, whether admission of that testimony would violate defendants\u2019 rights under the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Defendant Stanley Duncan was charged in the Ma-comb Circuit Court with five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-I)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and four counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-II).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stanley\u2019s wife, defendant Vita Duncan, was charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>two counts of CSC-I, two counts of CSC-II, and with the misdemeanor offense of operating a daycare facility without a license.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The alleged victim in this case, RS, is the sole complainant against Vita and one of three complainants against Stanley.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Separate preliminary examinations were held for each defendant. At Stanley Duncan\u2019s preliminary examination on October 17, 2011, then three year old RS correctly answered the trial court\u2019s questions about her age, her birthday, and her dog\u2019s name, among others. The judge then asked RS if she knew the difference between telling the truth and not telling the truth, to which she responded, \u201cYes.\u201d She also affirmed that she would honestly answer the questions of the attorneys. The court therefore qualified RS as competent to testify, determining that she had sufficient mental intelligence to communicate and had a sense of obligation to testify honestly.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">RS testified that on at least three occasions, Stanley Duncan touched her \u201cprivate,\u201d indicating her vaginal area, and \u201cblew raspberries\u201d on her vaginal area while her pants and underwear were off. The raspberries hurt \u201ca little bit,\u201d and his touching \u201creally hurted.\u201d She testified that the acts occurred in the bathroom of defendants\u2019 home, where RS attended daycare.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On December 2, 2011, at the preliminary examination concerning the charges against Vita Duncan, RS was qualified as competent after she correctly answered questions about her birthday, her dog\u2019s name, and the name of her schoolteacher. RS affirmed her understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ing of what telling the truth means, and promised to do so. RS repeated substantially the same answers that she previously gave regarding Stanley Duncan, and also stated that she told Vita more than once that Stanley had touched her. RS also testified that, on at least one occasion while Stanley was touching her, Vita was just outside the bathroom, and that RS could see Vita.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Both defendants were bound over on the charges against them, and a joint trial before a single jury began on September 28, 2012. RS was called to the stand and was first questioned by the court. When asked whether she knew the difference between the truth and a lie, RS responded, \u201cNo,\u201d and was unable to explain what a promise means. After RS struggled to answer questions similar to those answered at the preliminary examinations, the trial court excused the jury, and met with counsel, RS, and RS\u2019s parents in chambers. Afterward, RS was again put on the stand, and again answered, \u201cNo\u201d to the questions regarding whether she knew what the truth is, what a lie is, and what a promise is. RS was clearly agitated. Throughout the court\u2019s questioning, RS had tears in her eyes and was wringing her hands. RS began crying in earnest just before the court excused her. The court ruled that she was not competent to testify pursuant to MRE 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The prosecution immediately asked the court to declare RS unavailable, arguing that RS lacked memory of the events giving rise to the charges,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and moved to admit her preliminary examination testimony pursuant to MRE 804(b)(1), a hearsay exception for unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>witnesses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court considered each of the five situations of unavailability enumerated in MRE 804(a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but held that none of them applied to RS.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">After the trial court granted a stay of the trial proceedings, the prosecution sought emergency leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals and moved for immediate consideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling that RS was not unavailable. The Court of Appeals granted the prosecution\u2019s motion for immediate consideration, held the applications for leave to appeal in abeyance, and remanded the cases to the trial court with instructions to issue an opinion explaining its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In its opinion on remand, the trial court reiterated its holding that RS was not unavailable because her failure to take the equivalent of the oath did not trigger any of the scenarios enumerated in MRE 804(a). Without much discussion, the court ruled that MRE 804(a)(4), which renders a declarant unavailable if she is dead or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>has a physical or mental infirmity or illness, did not apply because RS\u2019s situation did not include any of these circumstances. The court stressed that RS was even younger at the preliminary examination than at trial and suggested that this fact lent support to its ruling that she was not unavailable at the later trial date.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The Court of Appeals denied the prosecution\u2019s applications for leave to appeal. This Court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion for immediate consideration, stayed the proceedings, and remanded both cases to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In its opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that RS was not unavailable within the meaning of MRE 804(a) generally and that RS did not meet the specific circumstance of having a \u201cthen existing physical or mental illness or infirmity\u201d within the meaning of MRE 804(a)(4).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Distinguishing this case from past cases in which witnesses were held both incompetent and unavailable,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals reasoned that the fact that some witnesses are both incompetent and unavailable does not mean that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>incompetent witnesses are unavailable. Under MRE 601, a witness is not competent to testify if she \u201cdoes not have sufficient physical or mental capacity... to testify truthfully ....\u201d By comparison, MRE 804(a)(4) renders a declarant unavailable as a witness if she \u201cis unable ... to testify... because of... then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity[.]\u201d Because the use of distinct language in the two provisions suggests distinct requirements to meet each rule, the Court concluded that RS was not mentally ill or infirm even though she may have lacked the mental capacity to qualify as competent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We granted the prosecution\u2019s motion for immediate consideration and application for leave to appeal, limited \u201cto the issue whether the witness was \u2018unavailable\u2019 for the purposes of MRE 804(a).\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The decision whether to admit evidence falls within a trial court\u2019s discretion and will be reversed only when there is an abuse of that discretion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>abuses its discretion when its decision falls outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Decisions concerning the admission of evidence often involve preliminary questions of law that are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These preliminary questions of law include questions involving the interpretation of rules of evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A trial court necessarily abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">When construing court rules, including evidentiary rules, this Court applies the same principles applicable to the construction of statutes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we begin with the rule\u2019s plain language.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When the language of the rule is unambiguous, we enforce the plain meaning without further judicial construction.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court may refer to dictionaries to aid in discerning the plain meaning of a rule.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cHearsay is generally prohibited and may only be admitted at trial if provided for in an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> MRE 804(b) enumerates several exceptions to the rule prohibiting hearsay evidence that apply when a declarant is deemed \u201cunavailable as a witness\u201d pursuant to MRE 804(a). Consequently, if a witness is determined to be unavailable, certain evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible may be admitted at trial so long as it meets the requirements of MRE 804(b) and is not otherwise excluded by another rule of evidence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">With regard to hearsay, a witness\u2019s unavailability to testify is governed by MRE 804(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\"><em>Definition of unavailability. </em>\u201cUnavailability as a witness\u201d includes situations in which the declarant-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement despite an order of the court to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>(3) has a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\">(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means, and in a criminal case, due diligence is shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We focus on MRE 804(a)(4), which defines \u201cunavailability\u201d to include a declarant who lacks the physical or mental capability to testify. MRE 804(a)(4) provides that unavailability as a witness includes situations in which the declarant \u201cis unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity[.]\u201d We focus solely on the phrase \u201cthen existing. . . mental.. . infirmity,\u201d which provides the basis for our decision. First, we address the term \u201cinfirmity.\u201d \u201cInfirmity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe quality or state of being infirm; lack of strength.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In turn, \u201cinfirm\u201d is defined as \u201cfeeble or weak in body or health, [especially] because of age.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Of note, age is specifically designated as a factor that may give rise to an infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">MRE 804(a)(4) contemplates both physical and mental infirmities, though we focus only on whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>mental infirmity existed in this case.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The term \u201cmental\u201d modifies \u201cinfirmity\u201d and is defined as \u201c1. of or pertaining to the mind. 2. of, pertaining to, or affected by a disorder of the mind[.]\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus, read together, the phrase \u201cmental infirmity\u201d as used in MRE 804(a)(4) encompasses weakness or feebleness of the mind \u2014 one cause of which may be an individual\u2019s age.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Furthermore, the language of the rule establishes that the mental infirmity need not be permanent, or even longstanding. The phrase \u201cthen existing\u201d specifically limits the temporal scope within which a witness\u2019s availability under MRE 804(a)(4) may be assessed; the only relevant reference point is the point at which the witness takes the stand. As a result, the declarant need not suffer from a permanent illness or infirmity. Thus, the fact that RS was competent and available to testify at two preliminary examinations does not affect the determination whether she was mentally capable or infirm for purposes of MRE 804(a)(4) at the time her testimony was sought at trial. Rather, the only relevant inquiry is her condition at the time she was called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In holding that a child may be mentally infirm in the type of extraordinarily stressful trial situation like the one that existed here, we recognize the obvious truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>that children lack the same level of mental maturity as that exhibited by and expected of most adults. Legal and psychological research confirms this uncontroversial proposition.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As a result of these limitations, young children are less mentally equipped to cope with severe emotional distress.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Testifying in open court can be a harrowing experience for anyone, and young children are much more susceptible to emotional breakdowns than adults.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Indeed, testifying in open court \u201ccan make some children tearful, ill, or inarticulate in the courtroom. .. . Under the stress of testifying, some children may regress to a more immature level of behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> When these emotional terrors are severe and a child has not developed the mental capacity to overcome this distress, an emotional breakdown may eliminate any possibility of securing testimony from the young child.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">RS was four years old at the time she was called to testify at trial. She demonstrated an inability to overcome her distress when she was unable to answer the trial court\u2019s questions. When asked whether she knew the difference between the truth and a lie, RS responded, \u201cNo,\u201d and was unable to explain what a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>promise means. Furthermore, she answered, \u201cNo\u201d to whether she knew what the truth is, what a lie is, and what a promise is. Importantly, throughout her examination RS had tears in her eyes, was wringing her hands, and ultimately began to cry, rendering her unable to answer counsels\u2019 questions. While an older youth or an adult may have been able to suppress the unease of testifying in open court, RS, as a young child, was susceptible to particular challenges that must be taken into consideration when determining whether a witness is mentally infirm under MRE 804(a)(4). As could be expected from a young child, especially in the context of alleged criminal sexual conduct, RS simply did not have the mental maturity to overcome her debilitating emotions while on the stand.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Under the plain language of the rule, and with our recognition of the unique mental and emotional limitations of youth, we hold that RS had a then existing mental infirmity in this case because the facts show that she was unable to sufficiently cope with her significant emotional distress and give testimony at trial, a result of her particularly young age. Therefore, she was unavailable within the plain meaning of MRE 804(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">We recognize the case-specific nature of the inquiry into whether a witness suffers from a \u201cthen existing mental infirmity.\u201d In this case, the severity of RS\u2019s emotional distress made it impossible for her to testify. This is highlighted by the fact that she had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>been able to give testimony about the alleged sexual contacts at issue in this case. Before trial courts hold that a child has a then existing mental infirmity, we urge them to use, when appropriate, the tools in our court rules and statutes to accommodate young witnesses. For example, MCL 600.2163a enables the use of dolls or mannequins to aid children in their testimony. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the statute allows for witness accompaniment by a \u201csupport person,\u201d use of videorecorded statements, and testimony via closed-circuit television.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that RS did not demonstrate a mental infirmity, characterizing her conduct merely as an inability to provide the trial court with assurances that she was able and willing to testify truthfully. While the Court of Appeals may be correct that she was unable to testify truthfully at the time of trial, this fact does not foreclose the possibility that RS\u2019s mental infirmity caused this inability, which ultimately rendered her unavailable. In fact, as discussed, RS clearly demonstrated that, at the time of her trial testimony, she was emotionally overwhelmed and was mentally incapable of overcoming this distress and was therefore unable to affirm that she could testify truthfully. Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred when it failed to examine the reason for RS\u2019s inability to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that RS was not unavailable. As discussed, by using the word \u201cinfirmity,\u201d MRE 804(a)(4) plainly contemplates that a declarant is unavailable for hearsay purposes when she is unable to overcome severe emotional trouble resulting from the limitations of her young age. Though this is an issue of first impression, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the trial court committed a legal error in its interpretation of the rule when it held that RS was not infirm when she was unable to give testimony. The trial court\u2019s decision not to admit RS\u2019s preliminary examination testimony on the basis of its erroneous legal interpretation necessarily constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The language of MRE 804(a)(4) includes within its list of individuals who are unavailable those witnesses who are mentally infirm at the time they are called to give testimony. In this case, RS was unable to testify because she could not overcome her significant emotional distress, a result of the unique limitations of her youth and, therefore, she was mentally infirm at the time of her trial testimony. Thus, the lower courts erred by concluding that RS was not unavailable under MRE 804(a)(4).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the trial court must determine whether RS\u2019s preliminary examination testimony satisfied the requirements of MRE 804(b)(1) and, if so, whether admission of that testimony would violate defendants\u2019 rights under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<judges id=\"b828-6\">Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Young, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\"> MRE 802.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\"> MRE 804(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> MRE 804(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\"> We express no opinion regarding the admissibility of this preliminary examination testimony pursuant to MRE 804(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\"> US Const, Am VI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\"> MCL 750.520b(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b815-13\"> MCL 750.520c(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\"> MCL 722.125(1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> See MRE 601 (\u201cUnless the court finds after questioning a person that the person does not have sufficient physical or mental capacity or sense of obligation to testify truthfully and understandably, every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> The prosecution initially argued that RS was unavailable pursuant to MRE 804(a)(3) (stating that unavailability as a witness includes situations in which the declarant \u201chas a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement\u201d).

This first definition of \u201cinfirmity\u201d matches up, unsurprisingly, with <em>Random House Webster\u2019s </em>first definition of \u201cinfirm\u201d: \u201cfeeble or weak in body or health, especially] because of age.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority seizes on this last phrase, \u201cespecially because of age,\u201d pointing out that one \u201ccause\u201d of \u201cweakness or feebleness of the mind\u201d \u201cmay be an individual\u2019s age.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 726. The majority then ultimately holds that \u201cMRE 804(a)(4) plainly contemplates that a declarant is unavailable for hearsay purposes when she is unable to overcome severe emotional trouble resulting from the limitations of her <em>young age.\u201d Ante </em>at 729 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This analysis is far too strained, in my judgment. The dictionary references to \u201cespecially because of age\u201d and \u201cthe infirmities of age\u201d plainly refer not to <em>youth </em>but to <em>old age. </em>When one speaks of a person who suffers from weakness or a state of feebleness because of that person\u2019s age, or when we lament the \u201cinfirmities of age,\u201d I believe that the reasonable reader or listener understands such references to be to <em>advanced </em>age. I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>not believe that a reasonable person would characterize a perfectly healthy and developmentally sound four-year-old child as mentally infirm, or as suffering from the infirmities of age. This interpretation is also borne out by other dictionary definitions of \u201cinfirm.\u201d The <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>(2d College ed), for instance, defines \u201cinfirm\u201d as \u201c[w]eak in body,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] especially] from <em>old </em>age; feeble.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1966) defines the term as \u201cnot strong or sound physically[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] : of poor or <em>deteriorated vitality, </em>especially] <em>as a result of age </em>: FEEBLE[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) An especially young individual cannot be said to have experienced \u201cdeteriorated vitality\u201d as a result of age, as deterioration assumes a previous, more robust state. Thus, \u201cdeterioration] . .. as a result of age\u201d must reasonably refer to old age. Accord <em>People v Murry, </em>106 Mich App 257, 260; 307 NW2d 464 (1981) <em>(84-year-old </em>witness found to be \u201cphysically or mentally infirm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Though, for these reasons, I cannot join in the majority\u2019s conclusion that RS was unavailable under MRE 804(a)(4) because of a \u201cmental infirmity,\u201d I do conclude that she was in fact unavailable under the general principle of unavailability set forth in MRE 804(a). The rule begins, \u201c \u2018Unavailability as a witness\u2019 <em>includes </em>[the five situations listed in MRE 804(a)(1) through (5)].\u201d MRE 804(a) (emphasis added). Use of the word \u201cincludes,\u201d of course, indicates that the list of five situations is not exhaustive or all-encompassing. See <em>Random House Webster\u2019s </em>(\u201cinclude\u201d means \u201cto contain or encompass as <em>part of </em>a whole\u201d) (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>This rather obvious proposition is bolstered by our caselaw. In <em>People v Meredith, </em>459 Mich 62, 65; 586 NW2d 538 (1998), we held that a would-be witness who intended to assert her Fifth Amendment right and not testify at trial was \u201cunavailable\u201d as a witness for purposes of MRE 804(a), even though the situation was \u201cnot expressly treated in MRE 804(a) . . . .\u201d We stated that invocation of the Fifth Amendment right \u201cis of the same character as the other situations outlined in the subrule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65-66. The Court of Appeals has reached a similar conclusion in a case in which the would-be witness appeared at court the day of trial but abruptly left the courthouse before testifying. \u201c[WJhile [the would-be witness\u2019s] eleventh-hour decision to leave the courthouse rather than testify at trial is not expressly addressed under MRE 804(a),\u201d the Court said, \u201cit is also of the same character as other situations outlined in that rule of evidence.\u201d <em>People v Adams, </em>233 Mich App 652, 658; 592 NW2d 794 (1999), citing <em>Meredith, </em>459 Mich at 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">\u201c[WJhile \u2018unavailability\u2019 is a term of art under MRE 804(a), it also bears a close nexus to the ordinary meaning of the word.\u201d <em>Meredith, </em>459 Mich at 66. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cavailable\u201d first as \u201csuitable or ready for use; at hand\u201d and second as \u201creadily obtainable; accessible[.J\u201d <em>American Heritage </em>likewise defines the term first to mean \u201c[ajccessible for use; at hand.\u201d Examination of MRE 804(a)(1) through (5) suggests that, in addition to not being \u201csuitable or ready for use; at hand,\u201d in order for a would-be witness to be deemed \u201cunavailable\u201d under MRE 804(a), it must also be the case that efforts to render the would-be witness \u201csuitable or ready for use; at hand\u201d or \u201caccessible for use\u201d: (1) are impermissible (as in the case of MRE 804(a)(1)); (2) have failed to yield availability (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>in the cases of MRE 804(a)(2) and (5)); or (3) would be futile (as in the cases of MRE 804(a)(3) and (4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">In this case the trial court separately ruled that, under MRE 601, RS was not competent to testify. That rule provides that a person is competent to testify unless she \u201cdoes not have sufficient physical or mental capacity or sense of obligation to testify truthfully and understandably . . . .\u201d Thus, in order to be found incompetent to testify, an individual must either: (1) lack sufficient mental or physical capacity or (2) lack a sense of obligation to testify truthfully and understandably. In this case, there was no indication of physical incapacity on RS\u2019s part, and the trial court found that RS was not lacking in mental capacity. Further, the trial court found that RS was \u201cable to testify if she [could have taken] the equivalent of the oath.\u201d These facts, taken together, clearly demonstrate that the trial court found RS incompetent not because of a lack of \u201csufficient physical or mental capacity,\u201d but because RS lacked a \u201csense of obligation to testify truthfully and understandably.\u201d Indeed, when the trial court attempted to qualify her as a witness, RS indicated that she did not know the difference between the truth and a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Further, as the facts set forth by the majority indicate, two good-faith efforts to qualify RS as a witness were made and failed. When RS was called as a witness at trial, the judge asked RS a lengthy and specially tailored set of questions designed to determine whether RS was able to distinguish between the truth and a lie, and she did not respond satisfactorily. After this effort failed, the judge had RS return to her parents for several minutes, presumably to calm her down. Counsel, RS\u2019s parents, and a police officer then met together in the judge\u2019s chambers during a 40-minute recess. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Following this recess, a second effort to qualify RS was made, with the judge again carefully questioning RS in a manner sensitive to her youth. This effort also failed. When the prospect of having the parties\u2019 attorneys ask RS questions regarding her ability to testify was raised, Stanley Duncan\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cI have [no questions],\u201d and Vita Duncan\u2019s counsel said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In summary, the trial court found that RS lacked a sense of obligation to tell the truth. She therefore was not \u201csuitable or ready for use; at hand\u201d as a witness. Repeated good-faith attempts to qualify RS (and thus render her <em>available) </em>were unsuccessful. Because the trial court found that RS lacked a sense of obligation to tell the truth, and because good-faith efforts to qualify her as a witness were made yet failed, RS was genuinely \u201cunavailable\u201d under the general principle of unavailability found in MRE 804(a), and I would hold accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-5\"> Or, given the modifier \u201cmental\u201d in MRE 804(a)(4), read \u201cmind\u201d rather than \u201cbody.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> Again, because we are dealing with \u201cmental infirmity,\u201d \u201cmentally\u201d should be substituted for \u201cphysically\u201d here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b834-7\">McCormack, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2p\">(concurring). I concur in the majority opinion and write separately because I believe that there is a doctrinal foundation supporting the proposition that the criminal law should recognize that children are qualitatively different from adults, which is relevant to our decision in this case. Over the course of the past decade, the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged that, as in many other areas of the law, the criminal law must recognize that the unique characteristics of children render them inherently different from adults.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that in certain circumstances, children are <em>constitutionally </em>different from adults.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although this caselaw has in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>volved young offenders and not young witnesses, I believe that the underlying rationale is relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">In <em>Roper v Simmons,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punishment for crimes committed while a defendant was under the age of 18. In <em>Graham v </em>Florida,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court held that juvenile offenders cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide offenses. In so finding, the Court stated that \u201cdevelopments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most recently, in <em>Miller v </em>Alabama,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional when applied to minors. <em>Miller </em>noted that children are constitutionally different from adults when it comes to sentencing and stated that the social science and cognitive science studies supporting the Court\u2019s decisions recognizing children as different from adults in <em>Roper </em>and <em>Graham </em>have only become more robust in the intervening years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Admittedly, this caselaw is limited to sentencing theory and juvenile culpability, concerns that are not implicated here. In <em>JDB v North Carolina,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>however, the Supreme Court extended its consideration of minors in the criminal justice system outside the context of sentencing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court addressed the differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>between children and adults more generally, noting that \u201c[a] child\u2019s age is far more than a chronological fact. It is a fact that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception. Such conclusions apply broadly to children as a class. And, they are self-evident to anyone who was a child once himself. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court further acknowledged that \u201cchildren characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them,\u201d and that the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class \u201cexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The majority correctly holds that a child declarant may be declared unavailable as a witness if, as a result of his or her youth, the declarant\u2019s mental distress rises to the level of a then existing mental infirmity. I agree with the majority opinion that the legal literature supports the conclusion that children are not merely \u201cminiature adults.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Four-year-old RS simply was not able to cope with the emotional trauma of testifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>way an adult could, and it therefore makes sense that a trial court might find that RS had a then existing mental infirmity under MRE 804(a)(4), even if a similarly situated adult declarant might not be found unavailable under the same subrule. In my view, the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgement that the criminal law must recognize that children are different from adults underscores the majority\u2019s holding in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\"> See, e.g., <em>JDB v North Carolina, </em>564 US _, _; 131 S Ct 2394, 2404 n 6; 180 L Ed 2d 310 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\"> <em>Miller v Alabama, </em>567 US _, _; 132 S Ct 2455, 2464; 183 L Ed 2d 407 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\"> <em>Roper v Simmons, </em>543 US 551; 125 S Ct 1183; 161 L Ed 2d 1 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> <em>Graham v Florida, </em>560 US 48; 130 S Ct 2011; 176 L Ed 2d 825 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at _; 130 S Ct at 2026.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\"> <em>Miller, </em>567 US _; 132 S Ct 2455.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at _; 132 S Ct 2464 n 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"axy-dedup-0\"> <em>JDB, </em>564 US _; 131 S Ct 2394.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b835-12\"> See also <em>Haley v Ohio, </em>332 US 596, 599; 68 S Ct 302; 92 L Ed 224 (1948) (opinion by Douglas, J.)
