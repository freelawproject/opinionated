Specifically, we consider whether a village chief of police, the highest appointive executive official of a level of government, acted within the scope of his \u201cexecutive authority\u201d when he performed the duties of an ordinary police officer and is, therefore, entitled to absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5) of the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq. </em>We hold that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cexecutive authority,\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(5), encompasses <em>all </em>authority vested in the highest executive official by virtue of his or her role in the executive branch, including the authority to engage in tasks that might also be performed by lower-level employees. Consistent with the plain meaning of \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d the highest executive official is entitled to absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5) even when performing acts that might otherwise be performed by a lower-level employee if those actions fall within the authority vested in the official by virtue of his or her role as an executive official. Because no factual dispute exists in this case with regard to whether the village chief of police had the authority to conduct an arrest in his official capacity as chief of police, we hold that the chief of police is absolutely immune from tort liability arising from his arrest of the citizen in this case. The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the circuit court for entry of summary disposition in favor of village of Port Sanilac Chief of Police Rodney Jaskowski with regard to the claims against him and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On July 19, 2008, the village of Port Sanilac held its annual \u201cBark Shanty Festival,\u201d an outdoor summer fundraising event involving a beer tent and several musical acts. The band HI8US was among the acts scheduled to perform. Before HI8US\u2019s scheduled performance, volunteers working at the beer tent received numerous complaints about the allegedly offensive music. Ron Smith, the Brown City Police Chief, reported to the park after volunteers at the beer tent relayed to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the complaints about the offensive music. The organizer of the musical portion of the event also returned to the park after receiving a call informing her that festival patrons were displeased with the music.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">When Smith arrived at the park, he heard individuals in the beer tent heckling the band then onstage. He also saw attendees, including families, leaving the festival, some of whom voiced their displeasure with the musical performances as they left. Several individuals also complained to Smith that they found the bands\u2019 music \u201coffensive, disturbing, and not appropriate for the crowd.\u201d The Village of Port Sanilac Fire Chief, who was involved with beer tent operations, indicated he would close the beer tent if the bands\u2019 music continued to drive patrons away. He also warned Smith that he anticipated trouble arising between the bands\u2019 supporters and other festival attendees. Concerned about the festival\u2019s atmosphere, Smith contacted Jaskowski to report the potential trouble. After speaking with Smith, Jaskowski went to the park and agreed with the decision to stop the bands\u2019 performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Thomas Petipren, a drummer for HI8US, claims that he did not know that organizers decided to cancel the remaining musical performances and was onstage playing his normal warm-up routine when Jaskowski approached him. Petipren noticed Jaskowski appeared angry, so he stopped playing and held his drumsticks in his lap. He claimed he said nothing and simply waited to find out what Jaskowski wanted. Jaskowski then allegedly knocked over Petipren\u2019s equipment, grabbed and threw Petipren\u2019s drumsticks to the ground, and assaulted him, grabbing Petipren by the collar and pushing him off his seat and into a pole. Petipren claims he put his arms up and asked, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Jaskowski then allegedly pushed him off the stage and down onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the grass, yelling at Petipren to stop resisting. Once Petipren was face down, Jaskowski handcuffed him. When a bystander asked why Petipren was being arrested, Jaskowski had him arrested as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In contrast to Petipren\u2019s version of events, Jas-kowski insists that he told Petipren to stop playing, to which Petipren responded by swearing at him and punching him in the jaw. Jaskowski then arrested Petipren. Jaskowski maintains that Petipren continued to resist while he was placed in handcuffs. Jaskowski arrested Petipren for resisting and obstructing a police officer, assaulting a police officer, and disorderly conduct, but the prosecutor ultimately declined to press any charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Following the incident, Petipren filed suit against the village of Port Sanilac<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Jaskowski, individually and in his capacity as the chief of police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petipren alleged assault and battery and false arrest. Several months later, Jaskowski filed a separate suit against Petipren, claiming assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petipren, in turn, counterclaimed against Jaskowski, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Jaskowski moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7) in Petipren\u2019s original suit, and, at a later date, under MCR 2.116(C)(7), (8), and (10) in regard to Petipren\u2019s counterclaims. In both cases, Jas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>kowski asserted that he was absolutely immune under MCL 691.1407(5) of the GTLA because, in executing the arrest, he acted within his executive authority as the highest appointed executive official of a level of government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To establish his claim, Jaskowski provided the circuit court with the job description for the village of Port Sanilac chief of police and an affidavit in which he attested to his occupational duties. The job description includes a list of \u201cESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\u201d and identifies the \u201cFUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES\u201d of the police department, the latter of which include \u201c[mjaintenance of law and order in the Village of Port Sanilac\u201d and \u201c[t]he enforcement of all laws of the United States, the State of Michigan, and all ordinance of such law, and ordinances of the Village of Port Sanilac.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The functional responsibilities identified in the job description also included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">[p]atrol[ing] the streets of the Village of Port Sanilac,... and in doing so observing] and investigating] persons, situations or things which require attention and which affect enforcement of laws or prevention of crime. Preserving] the peace and protecting] life and property, controlling] public gatherings and performing] miscellaneous services relative to public health and safety including property checks.... Receiving] and processing] com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>plaints by citizens, arresting] offenders, preparing] reports and testifying] in court.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Petipren opposed the motions for summary disposition, arguing that Jaskowski was <em>not </em>the highest executive of a level of government and that Jaskowski had acted with an improper motive, arresting Petipren because Jaskowski was prejudiced against Petipren and his fans. The circuit court denied Jaskowski\u2019s motion for summary disposition in Petipren\u2019s original suit, concluding that because Jaskowski had acted with a biased motive, he had not acted within his executive authority as chief of police. On the record, the circuit court explained, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s acting in a Governmental function, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s within the scope of authority of a Police Chief. I think it\u2019s a personal vendetta, someone who thinks there\u2019s a Music Fair apparently and therefore immunity is not available to Rodney Jaskowski. That motion is denied.\u201d The circuit court also denied Jas-kowski\u2019s claim of absolute immunity in regard to Peti-pren\u2019s counterclaims in the second lawsuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Jaskowski appealed each case as of right, disputing the circuit court\u2019s application of governmental immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>nity. The Court of Appeals consolidated the appeals and, in a split, published opinion, affirmed, holding that \u201c[w]hen a police chief acts as an ordinary police officer \u2014 that is, when the nature of the act is outside the scope of his or her <em>executive duties </em>\u2014 the chief is not entitled to absolute immunity simply because he or she is also the police chief.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After noting that no binding Michigan case had considered whether a police chief is entitled to absolute immunity when he or she undertakes actions performed by ordinary police officers, the Court of Appeals construed the words \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(5), to mean only those \u201c \u2018tasks particular to [the official\u2019s] position as the \u201chighest appointive official.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the Court of Appeals, this interpretation, which it adopted from a federal district court decision, \u201cbest reflects the legislative intent expressed in the words of [the statute].\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">Although a police chief may occasionally perform the duties of an ordinary police officer, the police chief is not acting within the scope of his or her <em>executive </em>authority as the highest executive official in the police department when doing so. Rather, the nature of the act is that of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ordinary police officer. As an ordinary police officer, he would be entitled to the immunity provided to governmental employees under MCL 691.1407(2) if all the statutory requirements were satisfied. Indeed, it would lead to an illogical result to limit a plaintiffs intentional-tort claims arising from the conduct of a police officer in those cases in which the police officer was also the police chief who was acting as an ordinary police officer at the time he or she allegedly committed the tortious act.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Given its understanding of the term \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d the Court of Appeals applied the factors relevant to determining the scope of the actor\u2019s executive authority, articulated by this Court in <em>American Transmissions, Inc v Attorney General,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>by considering only that evidence related to Jaskowski\u2019s high-level duties, as outlined in the essential-duties section of the police chiefs job description.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because those duties \u201cgenerally involve policy, procedure, administration, and personnel matters,\u201d the Court of Appeals concluded that Jas-kowski was not acting within his executive authority when he arrested Petipren and that Jaskowski was, therefore, not entitled to absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>We granted leave to appeal, \u201climited to the issue whether Chief of Police Jaskowski is entitled to absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5).\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This Court reviews de novo a circuit court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When a claim is barred by governmental immunity, summary disposition is appropriate under MCR 2.116(C)(7).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under MCR 2.116(C)(7), the moving party has the option of supporting its motion with affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence provided that the \u201csubstance or content\u201d of the supporting proofs is admissible as evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In reviewing a motion under MCR 2.116(C)(7), we accept the factual contents of the complaint as true unless contradicted by the movant\u2019s documentation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> When the material facts are not in dispute, this Court may decide whether a plaintiffs claim is barred by immunity as a matter of law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">This case requires us to interpret MCL 691.1407(5), raising an issue of statutory interpretation that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> When construing a statute, this Court\u2019s obligation is to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the statute\u2019s plain language.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be enforced as written without judicial construction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Before the Michigan Legislature\u2019s enactment of the GTLA, this Court\u2019s jurisprudence recognized the existence of governmental immunity for all levels of government, including townships, cities, school districts, villages, and counties when those subdivisions were engaged in a governmental function.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Our common law has also long recognized that certain individuals may enjoy immunity from tort liability, historically granting immunity to governmental \u201cofficers, employees, and agents . .. engaged in discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts which were within the scope of their authority.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Over time, however, our caselaw muddled the parameters of individual immunity by defining it with references to ultra vires acts and whether an individual was engaged in the exercise of a governmental function.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We thus endeavored to clarify the common law of individual immunity in <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>in which we distinguished between the immunity available to lower-level employees and high-ranking officials. We modified the ultra vires approach for lower-level employees and required them to show that they were not only (1) acting during the course of their employment and acting or reasonably believed they were acting, within the scope of their authority; but also that they were (2) acting in good faith; and (3) performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial acts.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In comparison, we identified certain high-ranking officials entitled to a broader grant of immunity, holding that \u201cjudges, legislators, and the highest executive officials of all levels of government are absolutely immune from all tort liability whenever they are acting within their judicial, legislative, or executive authority.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We thus retained an approach similar to the ultra vires approach for high-ranking officials, providing absolute immunity whenever high-ranking officials acted within the scope of their respective authority.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Then, two years after <em>Ross, </em>the Legislature amended the GTLA, as it relates to the present dispute, by codifying <em>Ross\u2019s </em>grant of absolute immunity at MCL 691.1407(5).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>With this historical context in mind, we turn to the language of MCL 691.1407(5), which provides certain high-ranking officials with absolute immunity from tort liability, to determine whether Jaskowski is entitled to absolute immunity. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">A judge, a legislator, and the elective or highest appointive executive official of all levels of government are immune from tort liability for injuries to persons or damages to property if he or she is acting within the scope of his or her judicial, legislative, or executive authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">To qualify for absolute immunity from tort liability an individual governmental employee must prove his or her entitlement to immunity by establishing, consistently with the statute\u2019s plain language, (1) that he or she is a judge, legislator, or the elective or highest appointive executive official of a level of government and (2) that he or she acted within the scope of his or her judicial, legislative, or executive authority.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In the circuit court, Petipren argued that Jaskowski was not the highest appointive executive official of a level of government.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> On appeal, Petipren abandoned this ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>gument, leaving the sole issue before this Court as whether Jaskowski acted within the scope of his executive authority when he arrested Petipren. To determine whether Jaskowski qualifies for absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5) when performing the duties of an ordinary police officer while serving as the highest appointive executive official of the village, we examine the meaning of \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as interpreted in this state\u2019s jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">A. EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Petipren, like the Court of Appeals, asserts that Jaskowski engaged in activities outside the scope of his executive authority when he arrested Petipren and is therefore not entitled to absolute immunity. As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, no decision of this Court has specifically considered whether the scope of a police chiefs executive authority under MCL 691.1407(5) may include those activities also performed by ordinary officers.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Further, the GTLA does not define what it means to \u201cact[] within the scope of his or her ... executive authority,\u201d nor has this Court expressly defined the parameters of the phrase. However, we have previously identified several factors as relevant to the determination whether an action is within the scope of an executive official\u2019s authority. Specifically, we recognized in <em>American Transmissions </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201c[t]he determination whether particular acts are within their [executive] authority depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the specific acts alleged, the position held by the official alleged to have performed the acts, the charter, ordinances, or other local law defining the official\u2019s authority, and the structure and allocation of powers in the particular level of government.\"[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">This list of factors, while not exhaustive, demonstrates the type of objective inquiry into the factual context that is necessary to determine the scope of the actor\u2019s executive authority.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This objective inquiry does not include analysis of the actor\u2019s subjective state of mind.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> An official\u2019s motive or intent has no bearing on the scope of his or her executive authority.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">While the factors outlined in <em>American Transmissions </em>remain relevant to the determination whether certain acts are within the scope of an executive\u2019s authority, they do not resolve the definitional issue regarding whether the Legislature intended \u201cexecutive authority\u201d to include activities also performed by lower-level officials or, as the Court of Appeals held, to include only duties exclusive to the elective or highest appointive executive official\u2019s position. To resolve this issue, we turn to the statute\u2019s plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Again, MCL 691.1407(5) provides that, to claim absolute immunity, the highest appointive executive official must \u201cact[] within the scope of his or her. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>executive authority.\u201d We begin our analysis of the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d by examining the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cAuthority\u201d is defined as \u201ca power or right delegated or given,\u201d and \u201cscope\u201d is defined as the \u201cextent or range of view, outlook, application, operation, effectiveness . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Taken together, the words indicate that a highest appointive executive official\u2019s scope of authority consists of the extent or range of his or her delegated executive power.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In determining what the Legislature intended by the use of the term \u201cexecutive,\u201d we are mindful of the principle that statutory words are to be \u201cgiven meaning by [their] context or setting.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In context, the words \u201cexecutive authority\u201d appear as the counterpart to the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cjudicial\u201d and \u201clegislative\u201d authority. Specifically, the statute grants immunity to certain high-level officials when they act within the scope of their <em>\u201cjudicial, legislative, or executive </em>authority.\u201d Because the words are grouped together in a list, we assume those words were intended to have a related meaning.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> By using the term \u201cexecutive\u201d in conjunction with the terms \u201cjudicial\u201d and \u201clegislative,\u201d the Legislature plainly referred to the axiomatic power division among the three branches of government\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>legislative, executive, and judicial.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This reference to the three branches of government parallels the statute\u2019s earlier description of who may claim absolute immunity, namely: \u201c[a] judge, a legislator, and the elective or highest appointive <em>executive </em>official of all levels of government. ...\u201d In both instances, the term \u201cexecutive\u201d appears in MCL 691.1407(5) as a reference to the executive branch of government, thereby referring to the authority exercised by individuals in that branch of government. In a similar fashion, the statute envisions a legislator\u2019s exercise of legislative authority and a judge\u2019s exercise of judicial authority. Nowhere does the statute contain any indication that the \u201cexecutive authority\u201d exercised must be exclusive to the elective or highest appointive official in order for that official to claim absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We therefore hold that \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(5) means all authority vested in the highest executive official by virtue of his or her position in the executive branch. In so concluding, we reject other possible interpretations of the term \u201cexecutive,\u201d including the notion proposed by the Court of Appeals, Petipren, and the dissent that it should be read as referring to high-level administrative or supervisory functions particular to an executive\u2019s office. That interpretation ignores the context in which the term \u201cexecutive\u201d is used. In context, the term \u201cexecutive authority\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>does not contemplate whether the highest appointive executive official performed high-level duties exclusive to his or her position, but simply whether the official exercised authority vested in the official by virtue of his or her role in the executive branch.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals failed to undertake any explication of the statute\u2019s plain language and relied instead on a federal district court decision, <em>Scozzari v City of </em>Clare.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In that case, a city police chief sought absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5) from numerous tort claims resulting from a shooting death that had occurred when the chief attempted to arrest the decedent. The federal court rejected the police chiefs claim of absolute immunity, reasoning that \u201c[t]he Chief does not address the fact that he appears to have been acting in his capacity as an officer on patrol, rather than performing any tasks particular to his position as the \u2018highest appointive official.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In our view, <em>Scozzari </em>is devoid of any persuasive value: the court engaged in no statutory analysis and simply dismissed the police chiefs assertion of absolute immunity in light of his failure to address the implications of the fact that he had acted as an ordinary officer.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Further, the implicit holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Scozzari, </em>that absolute immunity is only available when an official performs acts unique to his or her position as the highest executive official, is detached from the plain language of the statute, as we have previously explained. In any case, <em>Scozzari </em>is a decision of a lower federal court, and we are not bound to follow it.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Court of Appeals also erroneously justified its holding on the basis of what it perceived as an \u201cillogical result.\u201d According to the Court of Appeals, it would be illogical to confer absolute immunity on a police chief who was acting as an ordinary officer because an ordinary officer engaged in the same conduct would be entitled only to the qualified immunity offered by MCL 691.1407(2) or, in the case of an intentional tort, the common-law immunity described in <em>Ross.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet this outcome is exactly what the Legislature intended when it distinguished between the absolute immunity avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>able to those actors at the highest levels of government and the lesser immunity available to those actors who are lower-level employees.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> While it is true that lower-level actors and high-ranking officials may possess some overlapping authority and, at times, engage in the same governmental conduct, MCL 691.1407(5) includes no indication that the absolute immunity granted to high-ranking officials is not absolute when their authority encompasses conduct that might also be performed by a lower-level employee. To adopt the Court of Appeals\u2019 understanding of executive authority would eviscerate the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to completely insulate individuals at the highest levels of government from tort liability when they are acting within the scope of their official authority. While the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>viewed this result as illogical, the propriety of the Legislature\u2019s decision to treat individuals differently on the basis of their official positions is a question of policy for the Legislature, not this Court.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred when it interpreted \u201cexecutive authority\u201d to include only those high-level tasks exclusive to the official\u2019s position. Rather, we hold, consistent with the plain meaning of \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d that the highest appointive executive official is entitled to absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5) even when performing the acts of a lower-level employee if those actions are within the authority vested in the official by virtue of his or her role as an executive official.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Our analysis does not end with our determination that the term \u201cexecutive authority\u201d in MCL 691.1407(5) refers to all those powers vested in the highest executive official by virtue of his or her role as an executive official, which may also include those functions performed by lower-level employees. Because the specific acts alleged involve Jaskowski\u2019s arrest of Petipren, we consider whether Jaskowski\u2019s executive authority actually included the ability to conduct an arrest. This inquiry requires consideration of the factors articulated in <em>American Transmissions, </em>including \u201c \u2018the nature of the specific acts alleged, the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>held by the official alleged to have performed the acts, the charter, ordinances, or other local law defining the official\u2019s authority, and the structure and allocation of powers in the particular level of government.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In this case, there is no factual dispute regarding the duties Jaskowski\u2019s position required him to perform or that, by virtue of his position as chief of police, Jas-kowski was also a police officer, meaning that he possessed the power of any ordinary officer to conduct an arrest.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> By statute, village police officers are vested \u201cwith authority necessary for the preservation of quiet and good order in the village.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> As officers charged with the preservation of public peace, village police officers possess statutory authority to conduct an arrest.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As chief of police, Jaskowski was also charged with the duty to \u201csee that all the ordinances and regulations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the council, made for the preservation of quiet, and good order, and the protection of persons and property, are promptly enforced.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In addition to this statutory authority to conduct an arrest, Jaskowski presented to the circuit court his job description, as provided to him by the Port Sanilac Village Council, detailing his duties and responsibilities. Of particular relevance are the sections of the job description describing the functional responsibilities of the police department, which include \u201c[mjaintenance of law and order in the Village of Port Sanilac\u201d and \u201c[t]he enforcement of all laws of the United States, the State of Michigan, and all ordinance of such law, and ordinances of the Village of Port Sanilac.\u201d Most significantly, these responsibilities also include a duty to \u201c[pjreserve the peace . . ., control public gatherings,\u201d \u201c[rjeceive and process complaints by citizens,\u201d and <em>\u201carrest offenders . .. </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Similarly, in an undisputed affidavit, Jaskowski quotes the job description and avers that his duties included patrolling the streets of the village and doing the following in the course of his patrolling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201c[olbserve and investigate persons, situations or things which require attention and which affect enforcement of laws or prevention of crime. Preserve the peace and protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>life and property, control public gatherings and perform miscellaneous services relative to public health and safety including property checks.... Receive and process complaints by citizens, <em>arrest offenders, </em>prepare reports and testify in court.\u201d[<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Taking this evidence as a whole, there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Jaskowski possessed the authority to conduct an arrest and act for the preservation of peace in his official capacity as chief of police. Where, as here, the highest appointive executive official acts within the authority vested in the official by virtue of his or her executive position and there are no questions of material fact, that official is entitled to absolute immunity as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The Court of Appeals erroneously affirmed the circuit court\u2019s denial of summary disposition when it incorrectly construed the term \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as including only high-level tasks exclusive to an executive\u2019s position. The Court of Appeals thereby disregarded all the evidence relevant to this inquiry, except for the essential duties listed in the job description for the position of chief of police. However, for reasons we have explained, there is no basis in the language of MCL 691.1407(5) for concluding that the highest executive official acts outside the scope of his or her executive authority when undertaking a task performed by lower-level employees, which is also undisputedly a task he or she is authorized to perform. That those activities might also be undertaken by lower-level employees does not alter the analysis for determining the scope of an official\u2019s executive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The circuit court\u2019s reason for denying summary disposition \u2014 that Jaskowski acted with personal animus \u2014 is also erroneous. Petipren implicitly resur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>rects this argument on appeal by offering extensive discussion of the circumstances surrounding his arrest, but as we have made clear, an actor\u2019s intent and motivation have no bearing on the scope of his or her executive authority under MCL 691.1407(5).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In sum, because the power to arrest unquestionably falls within the scope of Jaskowski\u2019s executive authority under MCL 691.1407(5), as a matter of law, Jaskowski is absolutely immune from tort liability stemming from Petipren\u2019s arrest, and the lower courts erred by denying Jaskowski\u2019s motions for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">IV RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The dissent\u2019s main concern with our holding is that it \u201cremov[es]\u201d the statutory language from its context and returns Michigan\u2019s approach to individual absolute immunity to an \u201cultra vires\u201d test that grants immunity based on the official\u2019s high-level status. However, in formulating its preferred holding, that the absolute immunity provided for under MCL 691.1407(5) is limited to \u201ca specific subset of authority,\u201d the dissent reads \u201cexecutive authority\u201d in a manner isolated from the context in which it is used. By focusing only on the terms that directly modify the word \u201cauthority,\u201d the dissent ignores the necessary parallel between the official\u2019s position and his or her judicial, legislative, or executive authority and thereby fails to afford meaning to every word in the statute. Further, by overlooking the term \u201cexecutive\u201d as a clear reference to the authority exercised by those in the executive branch of government and instead defining it as a specific subset of high-level duties related to \u201cadministrative or managerial responsibilities],\u201d the dissent reads additional requirements into the statute that do not exist. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>therefore the dissent that has \u201ctransform[ed]\u201d the grant of absolute immunity to something other than the official\u2019s \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as intended by the Legislature.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Similarly unpersuasive is the dissent\u2019s complaint that our holding grants absolute immunity to high-level officials simply because they are \u201ccloaked with the title of a high-level executive.\u201d This accusation plainly oversimplifies our holding; any high-level executive official acting outside his or her executive authority, as we have defined it, is not entitled to absolute immunity. The dissent also protests that we have returned Michigan\u2019s approach to individual absolute immunity to an \u201cultra vires\u201d test, which according to the dissent \u201cwas rejected by <em>Ross . . . </em>and, subsequently, the Legislature ... .\u201d However, a closer reading of <em>Ross </em>reveals that this Court merely criticized that approach and rejected it as to lower-level employees, not high-level judicial officers, legislators, and executive officials.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> To the extent it can be said that the Legislature codified the absolute indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>vidual immunity articulated in <em>Ross, </em>it did not reject the ultra vires test. Indeed, given the plain language of MCL 691.1407(5), the Legislature\u2019s codification of absolute immunity with regard to high-level officials is consistent with the ultra vires approach and is precisely necessary to protect high-level officers\u2019 unfettered decision-making.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In short, there is no support in the law for the dissent\u2019s characterization of our holding as adopting a rule of individual absolute immunity that radically departs from the statutory language and that has supposedly been rejected by the Legislature. Rather, it is the dissent\u2019s view that would depart from the statutory language and it is the dissent\u2019s view that would adopt a test not recognized anywhere in Michigan law. Indeed, our review of the caselaw reveals no authority, aside from the Court of Appeals decision in this case, confining individual absolute immunity to a subset of high-level authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The term \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(5), encompasses all authority vested in the highest appointive executive official of a level of govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ment by virtue of his or her role in the executive branch, including the authority vested in the official to engage in tasks that might also be performed by lower-level employees. Under the statute\u2019s plain terms, when the highest appointive executive official of a level of government acts within the scope of his or her executive authority, the official is entitled to absolute immunity. Because there is no genuine issue of material fact that Jaskowski\u2019s executive authority encompassed the authority to preserve the peace and conduct an arrest, Jaskowski is absolutely immune under MCL 691.1407(5) from tort liability arising from Petipren\u2019s arrest. For this reason, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion to the contrary and remand this matter to the circuit court for entry of judgment in favor of Jaskowski in Sanilac Circuit Court Docket No. 09-032990-NO, for entry of judgment in favor of Jas-kowski on Petipren\u2019s counterclaims in Sanilac Circuit Court Docket No. 10-033374-NO, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-4\">Young, C.J., and Zahra, J., concurred with Kelly J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> The circuit court dismissed the claims against the village after determining that the village was immune from liability under MCL 691.1407(1), which provides immunity to governmental agencies engaged in governmental functions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> Sanilac Circuit Court Docket No. 09-032990-NO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\"> Sanilac Circuit Court Docket No. 10-033374-NO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-5\"> In regard to Petipren\u2019s negligence-based counterclaims, Jaskowski also asserted that he was entitled to the governmental immunity available to all officers and employees of governmental agencies under MCL 691.1407(2) because Petipren failed to allege gross negligence. See <em>Odom v Wayne Co, </em>482 Mich 459, 479-480; 760 NW2d 217 (2008). Relying on <em>Odom., </em>Jaskowski also maintained that Petipren\u2019s intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress counterclaim must be dismissed because Jaskowski had acted in good faith, he acted or reasonably believed he was acting within the scope of his authority, and the arrest was discretionary in nature, thereby entitling him to the immunity available to lower-level employees under MCL 691.1407(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> Emphasis omitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> The job description\u2019s essential duties and responsibilities involve employment decisions, administrative tasks, policy and procedural decisions, and the general authority to \u201c[m]ake[] decisions and take[] necessary actions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\"> The circuit court likewise declined to dismiss Petipren\u2019s intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress counterclaim under MCR 2.116(0(10), finding an issue of fact remained concerning whether Jaskowski\u2019s conduct could be characterized as \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d and whether he acted in good faith as required by <em>Odom. </em>The circuit court dismissed Petipren\u2019s negligence and negligent-infliction-of-emotional-distress counterclaims under MCR 2.116(C)(8), but it allowed Petipren to amend his countercomplaint to state a claim of gross negligence, which he did. As a result, the remaining claims to be resolved include Petipren\u2019s claims of assault and battery and false arrest and his counterclaims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and gross negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b297-5\"> <em>Petipren v Jaskowski, </em>294 Mich App 419, 432; 812 NW2d 17 (2011) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> <em>Id. </em>at 431, quoting <em>Scozzari v City of Clare, </em>723 F Supp 2d 945, 967 (ED Mich, 2010).

However, it is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that the Legislature speaks through the language used, <em>Driver, </em>490 Mich at 246-247, and, as explained, the statutory language at issue does not protect only a subset of executive authority. Indeed, it is not our role to speculate whether the Legislature adopted the reasoning of the authorities that the <em>Ross </em>Court cited in support of its holding. Given the plain language of MCL 691.1407(5), it is thus irrelevant whether the members of the <em>Ross </em>Court intended that absolute immunity extend only to a subset of high-level decision-making authority.

In this case, this Court must decide what the Legislature determined to be the appropriate balance between the public interest in ensuring that certain governmental actions are performed with independence and without fear of liability on one hand, and, on the other hand, ensuring that victims of tortious actions are compensated when certain governmental employees commit a tort. Specifically, this Court is asked to decide whether a chief of police, Rodney Jaskowski, who allegedly engaged in tortious conduct against Thomas Petipren while performing the duties of an ordinary police officer is nevertheless entitled to absolute immunity from tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>liability under MCL 691.1407(5), simply by virtue of his status as the highest appointive executive official of a level of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">I believe that the majority errs by concluding that the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d refers to <em>all </em>authority vested in the elective or highest appointive executive official by virtue of his or her position in the executive branch.

Contrary to the majority position, I would hold that the word \u201cexecutive\u201d within the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d refers to a specific subset of authority that a high-level executive must be acting within the scope of to obtain the benefit of absolute immunity from tort liability.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Suits for monetary damages generally serve dual purposes: to compensate victims of wrongful actions and to discourage conduct that might result in liability. <em>Forrester v White, </em>484 US 219, 223; 108 S Ct 538; 98 L Ed 2d 555 (1988). Difficulty arises, however, when public employees are exposed to tort liability. <em>Id. </em>This is because government officials are expected to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>decisions that must be \u201cinformed by considerations other than the personal interests of the decisionmaker,\u201d yet such decisions will often have adverse effects on others. <em>Id. </em>As a result, although the threat of monetary damages might encourage public officials to lawfully perform their duties in an appropriate manner, the threat of liability might also <em>\u201cinhibit </em>officials in the proper performance of their duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recognition of these issues has led jurisdictions, including Michigan, to adopt various forms of governmental immunity from tort liability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Michigan\u2019s approach to individual immunity for governmental employees has its historical roots in the common law. <em>Robinson v City of Lansing, </em>486 Mich 1, 5; 782 NW2d 171 (2010). After this Court partially abolished common-law governmental immunity in 1961, the Legislature responded by enacting the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq., </em>to \u201crestor[e] immunity for municipalities and pre-serv[e] . . . protection for the state and its agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 605; 363 NW2d 641 (1984). The GTLA, however, was silent regarding under what circumstances, and to what extent, officers, agents, and employees could be held responsible for their tortious acts. <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 596, 628. Given the divided, confusing, and often irreconcilable caselaw on the subject, <em>id. </em>at 596, <em>Ross </em>undertook the almost impossible task of attempting to clarify more than a century\u2019s worth of judicial and legislative commentary on governmental immunity, including clarifying the judicial debate regarding liability with respect to individual governmental employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">With respect to individual liability, <em>Ross </em>explained that previous opinions of this Court had \u201cobfuscated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the precise parameters of individual immunity,\u201d noting that in divided decisions the Court had set forth differing approaches to the issue. <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 629-630. In one case, the end result was that employees were immune from tort liability \u201cunless they had been engaged in <em>ultra vires </em>activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, <em>citing Bush v Oscoda Area Sch, </em>405 Mich 716; 275 NW2d 268 (1979). In another case, members of the Court defined the \u201cparameters of individual immunity with reference to whether the tortfeasor was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 631. See, also, <em>id. </em>at 629-630, citing <em>Lockaby v Wayne Co, </em>406 Mich 65; 276 NW2d 1 (1979). Rejecting the formulations of both approaches, this Court explained that the governmental-function approach blurred the distinction between individual and governmental immunity, <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 629-630, while the ultra vires component of individual immunity, which examined whether the acts were \u201cunauthorized and outside the scope of employment,\u201d also had its \u201cdrawbacks,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 631. See, also, <em>Richardson v Jackson Co, </em>432 Mich 377, 387; 443 NW2d 105 (1989) (defining \u201cultra vires\u201d activity as an \u201cactivity that the governmental agency lacks legal authority to perform in any manner\u201d). This was because the formulation of the ultra vires approach at the time of <em>Ross </em>broadly extended immunity to \u201cevery public official, employee, and agent whenever they engage[d] in [any] authorized act[],\u201d which was \u201cnot justified by either prior case law or present-day realities.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Persuaded that Michigan\u2019s then existing framework regarding individual immunity was inept and in need of clarification, <em>Ross </em>adopted the approach to individual immunity that it believed best reflected the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 596, 625-626, 635. The adopted approach was similar to that of other jurisdictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>which provided different levels of immunity depending on the function of the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 632-634. Under this framework, \u201cjudges, legislators, and the highest executive officials of all levels of government are absolutely immune from all tort liability,\u201d as long as they are acting within their respective \u201cjudicial, legislative, or executive authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. In contrast, \u201c[l]ower level officials, employees, and agents are immune from tort liability\u201d only if (1) the act was taken during the course of the official\u2019s, employee\u2019s, or agent\u2019s employment and the official, employee, or agent was acting, or reasonably believed he or she was acting, within the scope of his or her authority, (2) the act was done in good faith, and (3) the act was discretionary rather than ministerial in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 633-634. The justification for treating employees differently on the basis of their official functions was explained by <em>Ross </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">It is assumed through the broad grant of immunity to certain public employees that these officials and, therefore, their governmental agencies, will not be intimidated nor timid in the discharge of their public duties. Although absolute immunity may be necessary for unfettered governmental decision-making, courts have been reluctant, understandably, to extend its protection beyond select public employees who are delegated policy-making powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">* * * The policy which only provides a limited immunity to lower level executive officials, unlike the justifications for absolute immunity, reflects a recognition that official immunity should not shield malicious or intentionally unlawful behavior when the actor is not engaged in broad, essential governmental decision-making. Holding these public servants liable does not hamper or intimidate them in the faithful discharge of their duties since they are responding to established administrative guidelines, regulations and informal policy. It is assumed, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>an unreasonable burden does not fall on an administrative system when courts hold lower level executive employees liable for their acts performed in bad faith. <em>[Id. </em>at 632-633, quoting Littlejohn &amp; DeMars, <em>Governmental Immunity After Parker and Perry: The King Can Do Some Wrong, </em>1982 Det C L Rev, 1, 27-28 (quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Although <em>Ross </em>retained the traditional view that no individual immunity existed for ultra vires acts, <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 631, 634, <em>Ross </em>also made clear that, under its approach, individual immunity was \u201cobvious[ly] . . . <em>far less </em>than that afforded [to] governmental agencies,\u201d which were broadly granted immunity from tort liability whenever the agency engaged in a mandated or authorized activity \u2014 i.e., an activity that was not \u201cultra vires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635 (emphasis added). See, also, <em>id. </em>at 620; MCL 691.1407(1); MCL 691.1401(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Shortly after <em>Ross </em>was decided, the Legislature responded by enacting 1986 PA 175, which, among other things, addressed individual immunity for governmental employees. With slight modifications, the Legislature codified Ross\u2019s standard with respect to judges, legislators, and specific executive officials, thus rendering those officials \u201cimmune from tort liability\u201d when acting within the scope of their respective authority. MCL 691.1407(5); <em>American Transmissions, Inc v Attorney General, </em>454 Mich 135, 139-140; 560 NW2d 50 (1997). However, the Legislature altered Ross\u2019s articulation of qualified immunity as it related to the negligent acts of what <em>Ross </em>referred to as \u201clower level\u201d officials, employees, and agents.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Specifically, in ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>dressing individual immunity from tort liability for public employees, the Legislature enacted the following framework:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, and without regard to the discretionary or ministerial nature of the conduct in question, <em>each officer and employee of a governmental agency, </em>each volunteer acting on behalf of a governmental agency, and each member of a board, council, commission, or statutorily created task force of a governmental agency <em>is immune from tort liability </em>for an injury to a person or damage to property caused by the officer, employee, or member while in the course of employment or service or caused by the volunteer while acting on behalf of a governmental agency <em>if all of the following are met:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">(a) <em>The officer, employee, member, or volunteer is acting </em>or reasonably believes he or she is acting <em>within the scope of his or her authority.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Ob) The governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">(c) The officer\u2019s, employee\u2019s, member\u2019s, or volunteer\u2019s conduct does not amount to gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury or damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">(3) Subsection (2) does not alter the law of intentional torts as it existed before July 7, 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">(5) A judge, a legislator, and <em>the elective or highest appointive executive official </em>of all levels of government <em>are immune from tort liability </em>for injuries to persons or damages to property <em>if he or she is acting within the scope of his </em>or her judicial, legislative, or <em>executive </em>authority. [MCL 691.1407 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Accordingly, in both MCL 691.1407(2) and (5), the Legislature indicated that certain governmental offic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ers and employees are \u201cimmune from tort liability\u201d if specific conditions are met. Under MCL 691.1407(2), an officer or employee must act within the \u201cscope of his or her authority\u201d and meet other conditions, whereas, under MCL 691.1407(5), a judge, legislator, or specific high-level executive official is only entitled immunity from tort liability if the person is \u201cacting within the scope of his or her <em>judicial, legislative, </em>or <em>executive </em>authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the statute does not define the latter phrase, and no opinion from this Court has expressly considered this issue, this Court must determine the meaning of the phrase that best effectuates the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> <em>Jennings v Southwood, </em>446 Mich 125, 136; 521 NW2d 230 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">II.

THE MAJORITY\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF MCL 691.1407(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">As previously noted, I cannot join the majority\u2019s analysis, which, in my opinion, fails to give effect to every word in the statute, and broadens the scope of absolute immunity beyond the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Under MCL 691.1407(5), a \u201cjudge, a legislator, and the elective or highest appointive executive official of all levels of government are immune from tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>liability for injuries to persons or damages to property <em>if he or she is acting within the scope of his or her judicial, legislative, </em>or <em>executive </em>authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, certain high-level executive officials are entitled to immunity from tort liability if the executive official acts within the scope of his or her <em>executive </em>authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis, however, begins by removing the phrase \u201cscope of his or her ... authority\u201d from its context. Specifically, rather than considering whether the statutory references to \u201cjudicial,\u201d \u201clegislative,\u201d and \u201cexecutive\u201d modify the phrase \u201cauthority\u201d \u2014 in order to describe a specific and limited subset of each public official\u2019s authority that the official must act \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d to be entitled to immunity \u2014 the majority focuses on the phrases \u201cjudicial,\u201d \u201clegislative,\u201d and \u201cexecutive\u201d to read them as a mere reference to the axiomatic power divide among the three branches of government. However, the language chosen by the Legislature did not expressly grant immunity from tort liability for actions taken by the highest executive official by virtue of his or her position in the executive <em>branch. </em>Instead, the Legislature granted immunity from tort liability for those actions that fall \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d an executive official\u2019s \u201cexecutive authority.\u201d As a result, the majority\u2019s interpretation transforms the statutory reference to \u201cexecutive authority\u201d into a reference to the \u201cexecutive branch of government.\u201d In my opinion, this is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In reading the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as coextensive with the phrase \u201cexecutive branch\u201d as it is used in the Constitution, the majority\u2019s analysis results in a reading of the statute that is contrary to the well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>established maxim that this Court presumes that <em>every word </em>in a statute should be given meaning. <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 414; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).

Specifically, by holding that the reference to \u201clegislative,\u201d \u201cjudicial,\u201d and \u201cexecutive\u201d merely parallels the statute\u2019s earlier reference to <em>who </em>is entitled to assert immunity, the majority interprets the statute as granting an official immunity from tort liability for all actions \u201cwithin his or her authority.\u201d Thus, the majority\u2019s interpretation renders the statutory references to \u201cjudicial,\u201d legislative,\u201d and \u201cexecutive\u201d within the phrase <em>\u201cjudicial, legislative, or executive </em>authority\u201d mere reiterations, which, \u201cby definition, creates surplus language.\u201d <em>Odom v Wayne Co, </em>482 Mich 459, 471; 760 NW2d 217 (2008).<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> See, also, <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich at 414 (\u201c[A] court should avoid a construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d). Had the Legislature actually intended to grant judges, legislators, and specified high-level executives absolute immunity from tort liability for all actions \u201cwithin the scope of his or her authority\u201d generally, the Legislature could have easily and clearly stated that, as it did in other provisions of the GTLA. See, e.g., MCL 691.1407(2) (providing that officers and employees are immune from tort liability if, among other things, the officer or employee is \u201cacting within the scope of his or her authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Although this Court has not previously defined the phrase \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d and thus has not expressly determined whether the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d is limited to a subset of a high-level official\u2019s authority or encompasses all authority vested in the official, this Court <em>has </em>explained that executive officials are <em>not </em>absolutely immune from tort liability for those acts that <em>do not </em>fall within the scope of the elective or highest appointive executive official\u2019s \u201cexecutive authority.\u201d <em>American Transmissions, </em>454 Mich at 140-141, citing <em>Marrocco v Raudlett, </em>431 Mich 700, 710-711; 433 NW2d 68 (1988). This Court has also provided lower courts with a nonexhaustive list of objective factors to consider in determining whether an act falls within the scope of the executive official\u2019s executive authority. <em>American Transmissions, </em>454 Mich at 141, 143 n 10, citing <em>Marrocco, </em>431 Mich at 711.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s broad interpretation of the phrase \u201cexecutive authority,\u201d however, effectively discards the nonexhaus-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tive list of factors in favor of one inquiry: whether the official was authorized to perform the act \u2014 whether by statute or otherwise, including \u201cauthorization\u201d under a job description or an affidavit provided by the executive. By granting immunity for <em>any </em>authorized act, the majority\u2019s analysis returns Michigan\u2019s approach to immunity, at least as it pertains to high-level executives, to a formulation akin to the ultra vires approach that was rejected by <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 631, 633, and, subsequently, by the Legislature when it adopted statutory language that limits absolute immunity to <em>only </em>those actions that fall within the scope of a high-level executive official\u2019s <em>executive </em>authority and, thus, refused to extend absolute immunity to such officials whenever they engage in <em>any </em>authorized act. See <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich at 415 (\u201cWhere the Legislature has considered certain language and rejected it in favor of other language, the resulting statutory language should not be held to explicitly authorize what the Legislature explicitly rejected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">B. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO MCL 691.1407(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In my opinion, the statutory language supports the notion that the Legislature did not, as the majority opines, intend to afford absolute immunity for <em>all </em>actions within a judge, legislator, or high-level executive\u2019s authority, generally. Instead, by modifying the word \u201cauthority\u201d with the words \u201cjudicial, legislative, or executive\u201d the Legislature only intended to grant absolute immunity from tort liability for harm resulting from activities that are truly executive, judicial, or legislative in nature. See <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition </em>(1999) (defining \u201cjudicial,\u201d in part, as \u201cof or relating to a judgment, the function of judging, the administration of justice, or the judiciary\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>defining \u201clegislative,\u201d in part, as \u201chaving the power or performing the function of legislating\u201d; and defining \u201cexecutive,\u201d in part, as \u201chaving administrative or managerial responsibility\u201d); <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 632-633 (explaining that the justification for affording absolute immunity to certain officials is to protect unfettered decision-making by those \u201cengaged in broad, essential governmental decision-making\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Thus, in accordance with the notion that this Court presumes that every word within a statute has some meaning, <em>People v McGraw, </em>484 Mich 120, 126; 771 NW2d 655 (2009), I believe that the Legislature, in codifying <em>Ross </em>\u2019 s grant of absolute immunity for those officials acting within their respective <em>judicial, legislative, </em>and <em>executive </em>authorities, intended to describe a specific and limited subset of a judge\u2019s, legislator\u2019s, or high-level executive\u2019s authority that those officials must be \u201cacting within the scope of\u201d to obtain the benefit of immunity from tort liability. See <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 632, citing Littlejohn &amp; DeMars, 1982 Det C L Rev at 25-27.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In my view, broadly interpreting the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as encompassing <em>all authority </em>vested in a high-level executive extends abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>lute immunity beyond its purpose \u2014 to protect unfettered governmental decision-making afforded to those with policy-making powers. <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 632-633, quoting Littlejohn &amp; DeMars, 1982 Det C L Rev at 27-28. See, also, <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998) (explaining that the primary goal of this Court is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent through reasonable construction of the statutory language \u201cin consideration of the purpose of the statute and the object sought to be accomplished\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Additionally, reading the statutory provision as a whole supports a narrower interpretation of the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d than that adopted by the majority. See <em>Robinson, </em>486 Mich at 15 (explaining that it is well established that statutes must be read together and, thus, no single section should be viewed in isolation).<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> When MCL 691.1407(5) is read in conjunction with MCL 691.1407(2), it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to insulate high-level executive officials from tort liability whenever they act within the scope of <em>any </em>aspect of their authority simply because they are cloaked with the title of \u201cexecutive.\u201d Instead, when the highest appointive executive official commits a tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>while <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his or her <em>\u201cexecutive </em>authority\u201d under MCL 691.1407(5), the language of the respective statutes and the statutory scheme supports the notion that the official is not entitled to <em>absolute </em>immunity but might nevertheless be entitled to <em>qualified </em>immunity under MCL 691.1407(2) or, alternatively, the requirements delineated in <em>Ross </em>concerning intentional torts.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Specifically, MCL 691.1407(2) provides that, except as otherwise provided in MCL 691.1407, each \u201cofficer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d of a governmental agency<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> is immune from tort liability for injury to person or property caused by the officer or employee while in the course of employment if the officer or employee was, among other things, \u201cacting within the scope of <em>his or her </em>authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, unlike MCL 691.1407(5), which qualifies the type of authority that the high-level executive must be acting within the scope of to be entitled to absolute immunity, MCL 691.1407(2) does not limit its application to a specific subset of an employee or officer\u2019s authority but, instead, refers to the general authority of governmental officers and employees. Further, MCL 691.1407(2) broadly refers to \u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cemployees\u201d in discussing the qualified immunity available under that subsection. It does not, in contrast to the <em>Ross </em>test, refer to \u201clower level\u201d officers and employees only. Thus, the subsection was likely devised to apply not only to lower-level officers and employees, but to high-level officials in certain circumstances as well. And, although MCL 691.1407(2) does not expressly refer to \u201cexecutive officials,\u201d an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\u201cexecutive official\u201d is nevertheless an \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cofficer\u201d of a governmental agency. See <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition </em>(1999) (defining \u201cofficer\u201d as an \u201cAGENT\u201d or \u201cone who holds an office of trust, authority, or command,\u201d and defining \u201cofficial\u201d as \u201cone who holds or is invested with an office : OFFICER\u201d). Accordingly, the plain language of the statute as well as the statutory scheme supports the notion that an executive\u2019s title should not act to elevate <em>any </em>authorized act that is performed by a high-level executive into an act that is within the scope of his or her \u201cexecutive authority\u201d for purposes of absolute immunity. Instead, when a high-level executive is <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his or her <em>executive </em>authority, that executive should not be entitled to the \u201cstrong medicine\u201d that is absolute immunity. <em>Forrester, </em>484 US at 230 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Rather, as an employee or officer of a governmental agency, the high-level executive acting <em>outside </em>the scope of his or her executive authority is still entitled to seek the protections afforded by qualified immunity under MCL 691.1407(2) or <em>Ross </em>and, consequently, there is no unreasonable burden on the administration of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">As applied to this case, I disagree with the majority that Jaskowski was entitled to absolute immunity under MCL 691.1407(5). Specifically, when a chief of police engages in conduct performed by an ordinary police officer, such as conducting an arrest, I would hold that the chief of police is not entitled to absolute immunity simply because, as a police officer, the chief also has the authority to arrest. In carrying out the decision to arrest, Jaskowski was simply not acting within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>scope of his executive authority as a highest appointive executive official.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Instead, he was acting within his authority as an ordinary police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Applying the factors articulated by a majority of this Court to assist courts in determining whether an act falls within the scope of a high-level executive\u2019s executive authority, see <em>American Transmissions, </em>454 Mich at 141, it is clear that Jaskowski, as the chief of police and, consequently, a police officer, indisputably had the authority to conduct an arrest. Nevertheless, Jaskows-ki\u2019s conduct in this case involved the quintessential conduct of an ordinary police officer, rather than the \u201cexecutive authority\u201d of the highest-ranking official of a level of government, especially when considering the structure and allocation of powers within the police department itself as demonstrated by the essential duties and responsibilities of defendant as the chief of police. See <em>Petipren v Jaskowski, </em>294 Mich App 419, 427-429, 432 n 5; 812 NW2d 17 (2011).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Accordingly, Jaskowski should only be entitled to seek qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>immunity as provided to officers and employees under MCL 691.1407(2) and <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Because I believe that the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(5) does not \u201cencompassD <em>all authority </em>vested in the highest appointive executive official of a level of government by virtue of his or her role in the executive branch,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 28 (emphasis added), but, instead, refers to a subset of authority within which the highest appointive executive official must act \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d to be entitled to absolute immunity, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-6\">Markman J., concurred with Cavanagh.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b334-7\">McCormack and Viviano, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> See <em>Odom v Wayne Co, </em>482 Mich 459, 471; 760 NW2d 217 (2008), wherein a majority of this Court held that the Legislature retained Ross\u2019s standard with respect to intentional torts, but, in enacting MCL 691.1407(2) and (3), modified Ross\u2019s standard with respect to negligent acts. Thus, under the majority opinion in <em>Odom, </em>Ross\u2019s standard applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to alleged intentional torts, whereas the standard articulated in MCL 691.1407(2) applies to alleged negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> The majority asserts that this dissent adopts a view that is not recognized in Michigan law and implicitly accuses this dissent of citing no caselaw in support of its position. The majority\u2019s assertions, however, are rather curious, given that even the majority acknowledges that no decision of this Court has specifically addressed the issue presented in this case. Indeed, I question whether this Court would have granted leave to appeal if binding, on-point authority existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> Although this Court has yet to expressly address whether a chief of police is an \u201celective or highest appointive executive official of all levels of government\u201d for purposes of immunity from tort liability under MCL 691.1407(5), as noted by the majority, Petipren has effectively abandoned his previous argument that Jaskowski does not fall under this category. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>See <em>People v Bean, </em>457 Mich 677, 685 n 13; 580 NW2d 390 (1998). As a result, I will assume that this standard was met for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b326-4\"> Indeed, had the Legislature intended the majority\u2019s interpretation\u2014 i.e., that the Legislature was merely referring to the axiomatic power divide between the three branches of government and, thus, the phrase \u201cexecutive authority\u201d encompasses <em>all </em>authority vested in the executive by virtue of his or her position within the executive branch \u2014 there would have been no need for the statute to refer to a public official\u2019s \u201cjudicial, legislative, or executive authority\u201d because, as the majority notes, the Constitution expressly provides that \u201c[n]o person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch\u201d of government. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b327-4\"> Those factors include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">the nature of the specific acts alleged, the position held by the official alleged to have performed the acts, the charter, ordinances, or other local law defining the official\u2019s authority, and the structure and allocation of powers in the particular level of government. <em>[American Transmissions, </em>454 Mich at 141 (citation and quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Although <em>American Transmissions, </em>454 Mich at 141 n 8, noted that a majority of this Court had previously opined that the inquiry into whether actions are within a public official\u2019s executive authority is <em>analogous </em>to the question whether lower-level officials or governmental agencies are engaged in governmental functions, as previously noted, <em>Ross </em>asserted that the immunity granted to individuals is \u201cfar less\u201d than that afforded to governmental agencies, <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 635. Further, <em>Ross </em>rejected \u201cdefining] the parameters of individual immunity with reference to whether the tortfeasor was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function\u201d because that approach \u201cblurr[ed] two separate inquires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630-631.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b329-4\"> Although I would only consider the scope of the immunity as applied to the facts of the present case, see <em>Marrocco, </em>431 Mich at 712 (Boyle, J., concurring), notably, the Littlejohn <em>&amp; </em>DeMars article cited in <em>Ross </em>explained that, at the common law, \u201cjudges were always protected by absolute immunily for their judicial acts,\u201d even when maliciously performed, and, likewise, legislators were shielded from tort liabilily when they acted \u201cin the sphere of <em>legitimate legislative </em>activily\u201d Littlejohn &amp; DeMars, 1982 Det C L Rev at 26 (citation and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Given Ross\u2019s reliance on that authority, I question the majority\u2019s holding that the statutoiy reference to judicial, legislative, and executive authority was simply a legislative intent to inquire whether judges, legislators, and high-level executive officials exercised <em>any </em>authority vested in them by virtue of their positions within their respective branches of government, rather than defining a specific subset of each official\u2019s respective authority that is entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\"> The majority faults my dissent for reading the statutory provisions as a whole, and accuses me of adding requirements into the statutory language and somehow failing to give effect to each word within the statute. My response is simple: the majority\u2019s claims, as with the bulk of the majority\u2019s responses to this dissent, hinge entirely on accepting the majority\u2019s premise that the word \u201cexecutive\u201d as used within the phrase <em>\u201cexecutive </em>authority\u201d is a mere reiteration that simply parallels the statute\u2019s earlier reference to <em>who </em>is entitled to assert immunity. And, respectfully, a faithful reading of this dissent illustrates that it does not add words to the statutory language as the majority claims, but simply gives effect and meaning to <em>each </em>word within the statute \u2014 including the word \u201cexecutive\u201d within the phrase \u201cexecutive authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b331-5\"> See note 1 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> See MCL 691.1401(a), (e), and (g) (defining \u201cgovernmental agency\u201d to include the \u201cstate and its agencies, departments, commissions, courts, hoards, councils, and statutorily created task forces\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b333-5\"> It is notable that had a lower-ranked police officer committed the same acts as Jaskowski, that officer would be entitled to seek, at most, the more limited, qualified immunity available under MCL 691.1407(2) or <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich at 633-634. Thus, the majority effectively grants him absolute immunity simply because he is cloaked with the title of a high-level executive.

However, as this example illustrates, this comment is a fair response in light of the consequences of the majority\u2019s holding, which include, under the facts of this case, granting immunity to Jaskowski because he simply happens to have been the chief of police, rather than an ordinary patrol officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> Jaskowski\u2019s job description, discussed by the majority, is divided into separate sections, including one titled \u201cFUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES <em>OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,\u201d </em>and one titled \u201cESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\u201d of the <em>\u201cChief of Police.\u201d </em>(Emphasis altered.)
