Until 2004, Michigan\u2019s robbery statute contained this phrase as well, so we also consider whether the 2004 amendment that removed this phrase from the robbery statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> altered the meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d in the larceny-from-the-person statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">We hold that Michigan law requires a defendant to take property from the physical person or immediate presence of a victim to commit a larceny from the person. In rare cases, a taking outside of a victim\u2019s immediate presence may satisfy the from-the-person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>element only if a defendant or the defendant\u2019s accomplices use force or threats to create distance between a victim and the victim\u2019s property. Because defendant in this case did not take property from the person or immediate presence of the victim, or use force or threats to separate a victim from the victim\u2019s property, we conclude that she did not commit a larceny from the person. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which reversed her conviction of larceny from the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">On May 31, 2010, Khai Krumbhaar was working as a plain clothes loss-prevention officer at a Macy\u2019s in Southfield, Michigan. Through one of Macy\u2019s closed-circuit television monitors, Krumbhaar observed defendant carrying two bags, which she held \u201cvery, very closely.\u201d According to Krumbhaar, defendant \u201cappeared extremely nervous\u201d and was \u201cdarting her eyes\u201d in the direction of sales associates and customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">After watching defendant select a perfume set off a display case, Krumbhaar went to the sales floor to monitor her. Krumbhaar stayed far enough away to appear as if she were just another shopper, but stayed \u201cfairly close\u201d to defendant, at least close enough to observe her behavior. At times, she was within earshot of defendant. As Krumbhaar followed, she saw defendant \u201cpush[] the . . . [perfume] box down into her shopping bag.\u201d After this, Krumbhaar \u201cstayed back giving [defendant] some space,\u201d until she saw defendant \u201cwalking very quickly\u201d out of the store into the main mall area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Outside the Macy\u2019s store, Krumbhaar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>confronted defendant, identified herself as a Macy\u2019s loss-prevention officer, and asked defendant about the perfume set. Defendant began shouting and ran from Krumbhaar; Krumbhaar gave chase and captured defendant, who allegedly scratched and bit Krumbhaar as she tried to restrain defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The prosecution charged defendant with unarmed robbery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> second-degree retail fraud,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the first day of trial, the prosecution dismissed the latter two charges, although defendant objected to the dismissal of the second-degree retail-fraud charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecution\u2019s only witness was Krumbhaar, who testified to the above facts. After closing argument, and upon defendant\u2019s request, the circuit court instructed the jury on the elements of larceny from the person.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court explained that to find defendant guilty of larceny from the person, the jury would have to find that \u201cproperty was taken from Khai Krumbhaar\u2019s <em>person </em>or from Khai Krumbhaar\u2019s <em>immediate area of control or immediate </em>presence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After deliberating, the jury acquitted defendant of unarmed robbery, but found her guilty of larceny from the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">On review, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction in a split published opinion. The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>concluded that the prosecution presented no evidence that defendant had committed the larceny within Krumbhaar\u2019s \u201carea of immediate presence or control.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court noted that Krumbhaar \u201cnever testified that she was even within arm\u2019s length of defendant\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or that \u201cKrumbhaar was even close enough to defendant to have touched her or to have snatched the box from defendant\u2019s hands.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court held that the prosecution had failed to prove a larceny \u201cfrom the person\u201d of Krumbhaar because \u201c[p]roof of \u2018stealing from the person of another\u2019 requires more than vague proximity between the victim and the perpetrator.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">Writing in dissent, Judge WHITBECK disagreed. He believed that Krumbhaar\u2019s testimony that she was close enough to defendant to see her and hear her as she moved throughout the store was sufficient proof, as a matter of law, to establish that the taking occurred within her \u201cimmediate area of control or immediate presence.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal, directing the parties to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">(1) whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime of larceny from a person, MCL 750.357, was committed within the \u201cimmediate area of control or immediate presence\u201d of the loss prevention officer who witnessed the theft; (2) whether the 2004 amendment of the robbery statute, 2004 PA 128 (amending MCL 750.530), altered the definition of \u201cpresence\u201d with respect to the larceny-from-the-person statute; and, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>(3) whether the common-law definition of the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d remains consistent with the common-law definition of \u201cpresence. \u201d[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our goal in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and \u201cgive effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We enforce the clear and unambiguous language of the statute as written.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To determine whether the prosecutor has presented sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor and determine \u201cwhether a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">A. INTERPRETING \u201cFROM THE PERSON\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Under MCL 750.357, a person who commits a larceny by stealing from \u201cthe person of another\u201d is guilty of larceny from the person.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To determine whether there was sufficient evidence to establish this element, we must first determine the meaning of the statutory phrase \u201cfrom the person.\u201d The Legislature has instructed that any \u201ctechnical words and phrases\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201chave acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And in the criminal-law context, common-law doctrine informs the meaning of a statute when the Legislature uses common-law terms.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d has an extensive history at common law, we now turn to that history to determine if the phrase has acquired a \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Common-law courts interpreted the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d differently in robbery cases and larceny-from-the-person cases. The first statute to separately criminalize larceny from the person was enacted in England in 1565.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The purpose of this law was to punish pickpockets, so courts construed it narrowly, requiring that a thief steal an object attached to or physically possessed by the victim to satisfy the \u201cfrom the person\u201d element of larceny from the person.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At the same time, jurists interpreted the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d more broadly in robbery cases. In those cases, courts interpreted \u201cfrom the person\u201d differently to account for circumstances in which robbers used force or threats of force in the commission of a theft. As Professor Rollin Perkins has explained, \u201cOne of the illustrations of robbery, given by the early writers, is the wrongful driving off of another\u2019s horse or sheep while he, although present, is by violence or intimidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>prevented from interfering.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, in robbery cases, common-law courts and scholars interpreted \u201cfrom the person\u201d to include takings from a victim\u2019s presence to account for the violence and intimidation that distinguishes robbery from larceny. In the words of Sir Edward Coke, writing about the crime of robbery in the 1700s, \u201cthat which is taken in [someone\u2019s] presence, is in law taken from his person.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Hence, at common law, the meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d depended on whether the crime at issue was robbery or larceny from the person.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">There is a split of authority in American jurisdictions with regard to whether larceny from a person requires a taking directly from the body of the victim or merely from the victim\u2019s immediate presence. Some states followed the common-law approach to the offense of larceny from the person and required physical contact between the stolen object and the victim.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But this position is now a minority view. Courts in the majority of states that criminalize this offense have adopted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>view that \u201cfrom the person\u201d includes the area within a victim\u2019s immediate presence.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Explaining the rationale for the evolution of the law in this area, the Supreme Court of Minnesota stated that the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d included the \u201cimmediate presence\u201d of a victim because, in any taking from this area, \u201cthe rights of the person to inviolability would be encroached upon, and his personal security endangered, quite as much as if his watch or purse had been taken from his pocket.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Prior to 1970, Michigan appears to have taken the minority view, requiring an actual taking from the physical person of the victim.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> For example, in <em>People v Gadson, </em>this Court reviewed the sufficiency of the evidence for the from-the-person element in a larceny-from-the-person case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> At trial, there was evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>presented that the defendant had taken the victim\u2019s wallet, but it was unclear whether the defendant had taken the wallet directly out of the victim\u2019s pocket or after it had fallen out of his pocket during a scuffle. This Court held that there was insufficient evidence on the from-the-person element because there was reasonable doubt regarding whether the defendant took the wallet from the victim\u2019s pocket. We emphasized that \u201c[u]nder [MCL 750.357], an essential element of the larceny charged in the instant case ... is that it was accomplished by \u2018stealing from the person of another.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although not stated explicitly, the facts of the case make it clear that \u201cphysical possession\u201d was the governing standard in Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Two subsequent Court of Appeals cases took the same approach as <em>Gadson </em>and applied the physical-possession standard to the crime of larceny from the person. In <em>People v Stevens, </em>the defendant and his accomplice were convicted of robbery after they took money from a safe and from under a desk while they held a storeowner at gunpoint.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claimed that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the lesser-included offense of larceny from the person, but the Court of Appeals disagreed. The court stated that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d for that offense because the \u201ctaking was from the safe and from the under the desk; there was no taking <em>from the person of the </em>victim.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>People v Johnson, </em>the Court of Appeals reviewed a case in which the defendant stole property from a room in the victim\u2019s home while the victim was in the bathroom.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>stated that this crime could not constitute a larceny from the person and openly rejected the immediate presence approach stating, \u201cWhat is required is that the property in question actually be taken from the person of another; a taking of property from the immediate presence of the owner is insufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Hence, before 1970, Michigan courts had consistently identified Michigan as a physical-possession state.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">However, in the 1970 case of <em>People v </em>Gould,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> this Court adopted the immediate presence approach, holding that \u201cthe taking of property in the possession and immediate presence of the [victims] . . . was sufficient to sustain a verdict against defendant Gould of larceny from the person.\u201d Notably, this Court did not distinguish or overturn the physical-possession cases, nor did we address the text of Michigan\u2019s larceny-from-the-person statute. But <em>Gould\u2019s </em>holding represented a decided shift to the majority, immediate presence view of larceny from the person. Since <em>Gould, </em>this Court has interpreted the phrase \u201cfrom the person of another\u201d to include takings from the possession and immediate presence of the victim.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Despite this Court\u2019s consistent application of the immediate presence test since <em>Gould, </em>the Court of Appeals has expanded the definition of \u201cfrom the person.\u201d For example, in <em>People v Perkins, </em>the court stated that the from-the-person element could be satisfied by a taking \u201cfrom the person <em>or </em>from the person\u2019s immediate area of control <em>or </em>immediate presence.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, the addition of \u201cimmediate area of control\u201d as a independent category is an incorrect statement of the law and appears to stem solely from the model criminal jury instructions.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals\u2019 formulation erroneously suggests that the element can be satisfied by a taking from the victim\u2019s immediate area of control, regardless of whether the taking was from the victim\u2019s immediate presence. This is an expansion of the law because we have always interpreted Michigan\u2019s larceny-from-the-person statute to require the actual presence of the victim at the time of the taking, absent circumstances in which defendants use force to create distance between victims and their property. Because this expansion is not grounded in statute or the decisions of this Court, we repudiate it. In keeping with this Court\u2019s precedent, we adhere to a more restrictive definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cfrom the person\u201d that requires the victim to be immediately present when the property is taken.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">In addition to declaring that Michigan is an immediate presence jurisdiction, <em>Gould </em>also applied a doctrine that had developed in robbery cases. In this and many other states, courts have had to address the recurring problem of robbers who claim that their convictions should he reversed due to a lack of proof on the from-the-person element, even though the robbers\u2019 own use of force or threats was what created distance between victims and their property. In such circumstances, courts in nearly every American jurisdiction have invoked the rule that robbery defendants cannot negate the from-the-person element of their crimes by using force or threats to remove victims or keep them away from their property.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>courts treat victims as constructively present with the property, presuming that a victim would have retained possession of their property \u201cif no[t] overcome by violence or prevented by fear, [from] retaining] his possession of it.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> For ease of reference, we will refer to this latter concept as \u201cconstructive presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In <em>Gould, </em>this Court applied the constructive-presence exception in a larceny-from-the-person case for the first time in Michigan.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But a careful reading of the opinion shows that the court was applying this exception within its traditional limits, not expanding the meaning of \u201cpresence\u201d for all larceny-from-the-person cases. The prosecutor had charged all the defendants in <em>Gould </em>with robbery, and no one disputed that the defendants had used force and threats of force (one co-defendant brandished a gun) to move the victims away from the cash register. The defendants forced a waitress to lie face-down on the floor in another room, making it impossible for her to be near the cash for which she was responsible. Thus, even though this Court affirmed defendant Gould\u2019s conviction of larceny from the person, <em>Gould </em>is consistent with other precedent that prevented defendants from negating the from-the-person element of their crimes through the use of force.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>In summary, <em>Gould </em>established two principles of law within the larceny-from-the-person context. First, it established Michigan as an immediate presence jurisdiction. Second, it established that the constructive-presence exception from robbery cases could apply in larceny-from-the-person cases, provided there was evidence that the defendant or an accomplice had used force or threats of force to keep a victim away from his or her property.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">B. THE EFFECT OF THE 2004 ROBBERY-STATUTE AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">We next consider whether the 2004 amendments to Michigan\u2019s robbery statute had any effect on the meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d in the larceny-from-the-person context. We conclude that they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Before 2004, the unarmed-robbery statute prohibited using force or violence to \u201csteal and take <em>from the person of another, </em>or in his presence!.] \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The 2004 amendments removed the phrase \u201cfrom the person of another\u201d from the robbery statute. As amended, the statute now prohibits anyone who is \u201cin the course of committing a larceny of any money or other property\u201d from using \u201cforce or violence against <em>any person who is </em>present\u00ed.]\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">These changes were prompted by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Randolph, </em>in which we considered whether Michigan\u2019s robbery statute permitted a transactional theory of robbery.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This approach allows a robbery conviction even where a defendant uses force for the first time after completing a taking, and we concluded that the robbery statute then in force did not permit this.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In response to our decision, however, the Legislature amended the robbery statute and codified the transactional theory.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">At issue in <em>Randolph </em>and the subsequent statutory changes was at what point in the commission of the crime force had to be used for a theft to constitute a robbery. The meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d in either robbery or larceny-from-the-person cases was not at issue in the exchange between the Legislature and this Court. Consequently, there is nothing to suggest that the Legislature intended to change the meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d in the larceny-from-the-person statute by removing this phrase from the robbery statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that \u201cfrom the person\u201d in the larceny-from-the-person statute has the same meaning now as it did before the 2004 amendments.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The immediate presence test is still the governing standard in this area, and it is to the meaning of \u201cimmediate presence\u201d that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">C. THE MEANING OF \u201cIMMEDIATE PRESENCE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Perhaps because Michigan was not an immediate presence jurisdiction until <em>Gould, </em>there is scant caselaw explaining the scope of the immediate presence standard. However, this standard has been the subject of legal commentary, and courts in many other states have applied the same standard in deciding their own larceny-from-the-person cases. Courts and commentators alike have emphasized that this standard requires <em>immediate </em>proximity between the object and the victim. As Professor Perkins has explained, \u201c[I]f a man carrying a heavy suitcase sets it down for a moment to rest, and <em>remains right there </em>to guard it, the suitcase remains under the protection of his person.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Even objects that are relatively close to a person are not considered to be in the person\u2019s immediate presence unless they are <em>immediately </em>next to the person. Hence, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>no larceny from the person where a thief stole a bank bag from a kiosk while the bank teller was 25 to 35 feet away.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Likewise, the Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that a person could not be convicted of larceny from the person after taking a purse out of a shopping cart because the victim was not actually holding or pushing the cart at the time of the taking.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In contrast, a defendant was properly convicted of larceny from the person in Virginia when he stood two feet away from a store employee but reached within inches of the victim to take cash out of a register.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Courts have also affirmed larceny-from-the-person convictions where a thief stole a pocketbook from trousers that the victim was using as a pillow,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and where a car driver\u2019s billfold was taken off the seat immediately next to her.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> From these cases a clear rule emerges: the immediate presence test can only be satisfied if the property was in immediate proximity to the victim at the time of the taking. In other words, the common-law meaning of \u201cimmediate presence\u201d in the larceny-from-the-person context is consistent with the plain meaning of the word \u201cimmediate,\u201d which means \u201chaving no object or space intervening, nearest or next.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecutor, the facts of this case do not satisfy the immediate presence standard, which includes actual possession, or the constructive-presence exception. In this case, the loss-prevention officer was not in possession of the property at the time that it was taken. The record established only that she was \u201cfairly close\u201d to defendant in Macy\u2019s. At the moment defendant actually completed the taking by putting the perfume set into her bag, the loss-prevention officer was following defendant through the store while pretending to be another shopper.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Even though the loss-prevention officer remained close enough to observe defendant\u2019s behavior and was also at times within earshot of her, there was ample \u201cintervening space\u201d between the alleged victim and the property that defendant took, such that defendant did not take the perfume set from the <em>immediate </em>presence of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Notwithstanding the intervening space between the alleged victim and the stolen property, the jury still convicted defendant of larceny from the person. This conviction was arguably reasonable under the current jury instruction, CJI2d 23.3, which contains the phrase \u201cimmediate area of control.\u201d The jury may have interpreted this phrase to mean that a larceny from the person could occur in an area that the victim was responsible for, even if the taking was not from the victim\u2019s immediate presence. However, as mentioned above, a finding that the taking occurred within the victim\u2019s \u201cimmediate area of control\u201d does not satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the from-the-person element absent a finding that the taking was from the victim\u2019s person or immediate presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">While the Court of Appeals described the immediate presence standard using the colloquial phrase \u201cpersonal space,\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> it correctly applied the immediate presence standard. Thus, the Court of Appeals rightly concluded that because defendant did not take any property from the loss-prevention officer\u2019s immediate presence, she did not commit a larceny from the person. And although the prosecutor alleged that defendant used force to retain possession of the perfume set after she had stolen it, there was no evidence that defendant used force or threats to separate the victim from the perfume set before it was taken. Consequently, the constructive-presence doctrine does not apply in this case. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which reversed defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Finally, there is a related common-law doctrine that provides additional support for our conclusion. At common law, courts treated the taking of merchandise off a shelf or rack as a larceny from a building, not larceny from a person.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Such takings were considered larcenies from a person only if an employee had been exercising direct control over the specific property at the time of the taking. As Professor Perkins explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">Goods on open shelves, goods standing on the floor, goods arranged on tables or counters are normally treated as within the protection of the building. One distinction, however, is to be noted. If a jewel or other valuable thing, normally kept out of open reach of customers, is placed on the counter under the eye of the storekeeper or clerk while it is being examined by a customer, this is regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>under the personal protection of the storekeeper or clerk at the moment, rather than under the protection of the building; whereas articles placed on the counter with the expectation that they will remain there all day, unless purchased, are under the protection of the building][<footnotemark>64</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Here, the dissent asserts that the loss-prevention officer had \u201cpersonal protection and rightful control\u201d over the gift box because she was \u201c[a]n employee of Macy\u2019s responsible for preventing thefts of Macy\u2019s store items.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> While we agree that a loss-prevention officer has a specific duty to prevent theft, that duty, standing alone, does not bring the gift box within the loss-prevention officer\u2019s immediate presence. For the perfume set to be under her personal protection for the purposes of a larceny from her person, she would have had to have taken possession of the merchandise at issue before defendant pilfered it.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Without this act of dominion, the perfume set remained only under the \u201cprotection\u201d of the store. As a result, defendant did not take any property from the person of the loss-prevention officer. This provides additional support for our conclusion that the Court of Appeals properly reversed defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">V THE DISSENT\u2019S RISK-OF-ALTERCATION TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In explaining its interpretation of the law, the dissent describes its test for whether a taking occurs in the immediate presence of a victim as whether \u201ca taking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>such property triggers a substantial risk that a violent altercation will occur.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The most significant problem with this new test is that it expands the prohibited taking zone well beyond a person\u2019s immediate presence and into a large and undefined area.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The limits of this new prohibited taking zone are difficult to discern and likely arbitrary. A victim could plausibly observe a thief from 100 feet away and yet still have a chance of catching up to and confronting the thief if the victim chose to do so. Hence, even a taking at this distance could trigger \u201ca substantial risk that a violent altercation will occur.\u201d Because the typical store theft occurs well within this range, it would seem that, under the dissent\u2019s proposed standard, most routine shoplifting incidents could be charged as larcenies from the person. That result conflicts with the established limits of the immediate presence standard.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Michigan law requires a taking from the person or immediate presence of a victim to satisfy the from-the-person element for the crime of larceny from the person. This standard is satisfied when the defendant takes property that is in the physical possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>victim or property that is in immediate proximity to a victim when the taking occurs. Only in the rare larceny-from-the-person case in which the constructive-presence exception applies may a taking outside of a victim\u2019s immediate presence satisfy the from-the-person element. The 2004 amendments to Michigan\u2019s robbery statute did not change these established requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">In this case, there was no evidence that defendant took property that was in the physical possession of or immediate proximity to the loss-prevention officer, and there was no evidence that defendant used force or threats to distance the loss-prevention officer from the property at the time of the taking. As a result, there was insufficient evidence that defendant took property \u201cfrom the person\u201d of the loss-prevention officer. The Court of Appeals properly reversed defendant\u2019s conviction, so we affirm the judgment of Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b791-6\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh and McCormack, JJ., concurred with Viviano, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> See MCL 750.530, as amended by 2004 PA 128.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> At trial, Krumbhaar explained that Macy\u2019s policy prohibits its loss-prevention officers from confronting suspected shoplifters until after they have left the store.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> MCL 750.530.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> MCL 750.356d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\"> MCL 333.7403(2)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\"> Defendant argued that the retail-fraud charge was \u201cmore indicative of what happened on the date in question[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\"> The circuit court instructed the jury on the elements of larceny from the person on the theory that this offense was a lesser included offense of robbery.

As Sir William Blackstone recorded in 1771, the English common law distinguished between two types of larceny from the person: those accomplished by \u201cprivately stealing,\u201d like pickpockets, and those accomplished \u201cby open and violent assault,\u201d the former of which constitutes larceny from the person and the latter of which is robbery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These crimes at common law, then, shared <em>identical </em>elements, both requiring that the taking be \u201cfrom the person,\u201d except that robbery involved the additional element of fear and violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Contrary to the majority\u2019s view then, the meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d in the English common law, did not \u201cdepend\u00fc on whether the crime at issue was robbery or larceny from the person.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, in regard to the \u201cfrom the person\u201d element, both crimes required that the property taken be taken from the person or in his presence; as such, it was not necessary that the property be attached to the person, only that it be under his personal protection and control.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, as Sir Edward Coke noted with respect to the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d \u2014 which Sir Coke expressly recognized was applicable to both robbery and larceny from the person\u2014 \u201cthat which is taken in his <em>presence, </em>is in law taken from his person.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Michigan\u2019s first larceny-from-the-person statute was enacted in 1838, one year after Michigan became a state, and incorporated the common-law phrase \u201cfrom the person.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the same tradition as the English common law, the Michigan Legislature has adopted statutes in which offenders are punished more harshly for larceny from the person than simple larceny, based on the recognition that stealing from a person\u2019s presence \u201cinvolves a substantial risk of physical force . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1931, the larceny-from-the-person statute was recodified as part of the Penal Code, and since then, continues to incorporate the common-law phrase \u201cfrom the person.\u201d That the Legislature has never altered the language \u201cfrom the person\u201d in the larceny-from-the-person statute, indicates that we should interpret that phrase consistent with the common-law rule at the time of enactment in 1838. Mainly, that \u201cfrom the person,\u201d as understood in the context of both larceny from the person and robbery, must be interpreted as property that is taken from the person\u2019s \u201cimmediate presence,\u201d which is property that was taken while under the person\u2019s personal protection and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>In recognition that \u201cfrom the person\u201d is a common-law phrase, our jurisprudence has long-adhered to the phrase\u2019s common-law meaning. Over nine decades ago, in <em>People v </em>Covelesky,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this Court acknowledged that the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d must be interpreted as having the same meaning that those terms acquired at common law at the time that the statute was enacted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This Court construed the meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d consistent with the common law to mean property that is \u201ctaken \u2018in the owner\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court then expounded on the meaning of \u201cpresence,\u201d explaining that \u201cpresence\u201d does not necessarily contemplate that the property be \u201c \u2018in actual contact with the person of the one from whom it is taken,\u2019 \u201d but that the element is satisfied if the property taken is property that is under the person\u2019s \u201c \u2018personal protection and control.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court explained that \u201cpersonal protection,\u201d in turn, extends to \u201ccover all one\u2019s effects within a not easily defined distance over which his presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>may be deemed to have sway . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As examples, the Court indicated a taking \u201cfrom the person\u201d may occur when the defendant, by causing fear or through violence, separates a person from the immediate presence of their property, and then takes the property from another room or even from another building.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Covelesky, </em>this Court affirmed the common-law meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d nearly ten years later in <em>People v Cabassa.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, the defendant robbed a gas station of which the victim was the attendant. The Court explained that the defendant took property \u201cfrom the person\u201d because the attendant, although not the actual owner of the property stolen, was in actual possession and control of the money taken.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court again endorsed the view that \u201cif [an object, due to the defendant\u2019s acts of violence or putting in fear,] be away from the owner, yet under his control, in another room of the house... it is nevertheless in his personal possession; and, if he is deprived thereof, it may well be said it is taken <em>from his person.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>This Court quoted this same language more recently in <em>People v Gould, </em>where we upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction for larceny from the person where he took money from a restaurant\u2019s cash register and cigar box after \u201cforc[ing] the waitress and her sole customer to lie face down on the floor of another room....\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We held that the money was \u201cin the possession and immediate presence of the waitress and customer....\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court rejected the argument that a defendant must take the property from its actual owner, explaining that it is sufficient for larceny from the person that \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe property be taken from the presence of the victim .. . [that is,] within his area of control.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Five years after <em>Gould, </em>in <em>People v Chamblis, </em>this Court reaffirmed its commitment to \u201cthe view that the crime of larceny from the person embraces the taking of the property in the possession and immediate presence of the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And, nearly fifteen years after <em>Chamblis, </em>in <em>People v Beach, </em>the Court again reaffirmed that \u201cthe crime of larceny from the person embraces the taking of property in the possession and immediate presence of the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, in an unbroken chain of caselaw dating back nearly a hundred years, this Court has continually interpreted the phrase \u201cfrom the person\u201d to mean from a person\u2019s \u201cimmediate presence\u201d and, consistent with this common-law meaning, has defined the scope of \u201cimmedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ate presence\u201d to extend beyond a person\u2019s physical reach. Given these precedents, \u201cimmediate presence,\u201d as that phrase has been consistently interpreted in our jurisprudence, plainly includes property that is taken while under the person\u2019s personal protection and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">I would therefore reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that \u201cfrom the person\u201d means that property must be taken from the victim\u2019s \u201cpersonal space.\u201d The Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation, which essentially ignores the common-law meaning of \u201cfrom the person,\u201d appears motivated by a concern that the threat of violence inherent in the crime of larceny from the person is absent if the taking does not occur within the victim\u2019s \u201cpersonal space.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This policy concern is unfounded: The common-law meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d accounts for the reality that property taken from a person\u2019s immediate presence may pose as great (or greater) a threat to the victim\u2019s personal safety, as the threat created by a taking that occurs within arm\u2019s reach. As this Court explained in <em>People v Perkins, </em>because \u201c[i]n order to commit a larceny from the person, the defendant must steal something from a person in that person\u2019s presence,\u201d and, thus, \u201c[ujnless the victim submits to the theft or does not notice the theft, physical force will almost certainly be used in response,\u201d \u201clarceny from the person is a crime that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>it follows that the focus of whether property is taken from a person\u2019s immediate presence and is under his personal protection and control is on whether, at the time the taking occurs, the proximity between the defendant and the victim triggers a substantial risk that a violent altercation will occur.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>1 would therefore hold that \u201cfrom the person\u201d for purposes of the larceny-from-the-person statute means property taken in the person\u2019s immediate presence, which includes property that is under the person\u2019s personal protection and control such that a taking of such property triggers a substantial risk that a violent altercation will occur.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">B. THE MAJORITY\u2019S NEW \"IMMEDIATE PRESENCE\u201d STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Notwithstanding this Court\u2019s long-standing adherence to the common-law meaning of \u201cfrom the person,\u201d the majority narrowly defines this phrase to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that the taking occur within the victim\u2019s \u201cimmediate proximity,\u201d meaning that there can be no \u201cintervening space\u201d between the victim and the property taken.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In fact, according to the majority, only in the rare instance that property is taken by \u201cuse of force or threats of force to create distance between a victim and the victim\u2019s property\u201d might property that is otherwise not affixed to the victim constitute a taking \u201cfrom the person.\u201d This interpretation, however, inexplicably departs from this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, which holds that \u201cimmediate presence\u201d \u201ccoverts] all one\u2019s effects within a not easily defined distance over which his presence may be deemed to have sway.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>held that an object must be, as the majority holds, \u201cimmediately next to the person\u201d or effectively in the victim\u2019s actual physical possession in order for the taking to be in the person\u2019s \u201cimmediate presence.\u201d Thus, by adopting an interpretation that is incompatible with the well-established meaning of \u201cimmediate presence\u201d as recognized in this state for nearly a century, the majority has created a \u201cnew test\u201d that represents a sea change in Michigan\u2019s common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Despite adopting an immediate-presence standard that represents a vast departure from Michigan jurisprudence, the majority avoids overruling even a single case of this Court. Yet, the majority does not explain how it is able to do so where its holding conflicts with (1) all of our cases that have held that the Legislature codified the common-law understanding of the language \u201cfrom the person\u201d when it incorporated this language into the robbery and larceny-from-the-person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>statutes;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (2) all of our robbery cases that have held that \u201cfrom the person\u201d includes from the person\u2019s \u201cimmediate presence;\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (3) all of our larceny-from-the-person cases that have held that \u201cfrom the person\u201d includes from the person\u2019s \u201cimmediate presence;\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and (4) all of our cases that have held that larceny from a person was a necessarily included lesser offense of robbery (at least before 2004).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Indeed, the majority reforms this state\u2019s common-law history, as well as English common law as previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ously explained in this dissent. In particular, the majority ignores the significance of the historical relationship between larceny from the person and robbery and the fact that our jurisprudence has consistently recognized that larceny from the person constitutes a necessarily included lesser offense of robbery.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It follows, then, that all of the elements of robbery and larceny from the person are exactly the same, including \u201cfrom the person,\u201d except for the additional element of force or violence inherent <em>only </em>in the crime of robbery. The majority, however, has interpreted \u201cfrom the person\u201d to mean something entirely different from how this phrase was understood in the context of robbery before the 2004 amendments to the robbery statute, thereby retroactively transforming larceny from the person into a cognate offense, rather than a lesser included one.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Next, the majority invents a tension in the evolution of the meaning of \u201cimmediate presence,\u201d indicating that Michigan law once required actual physical possession, not merely immediate presence, to establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>from-the-person element for larceny from the person.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The majority uses this supposed conflict in our caselaw to justify its departure from the unabated meaning of \u201cimmediate presence.\u201d However, the conflict referenced by the majority simply does not exist. For example, the majority infers from the facts in <em>People v </em>Godson,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that our jurisprudence once interpreted \u201cimmediate presence\u201d to require that the property be physically attached to the person. <em>Gadson, </em>however, provides no analysis regarding the meaning of \u201cfrom the person,\u201d but simply held that larceny from the person was not established where the evidence was insufficient to prove that a theft occurred in the first instance. There is no other case from this Court that adopts a standard other than the common-law one articulated in part A of this dissent.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In a similar manner, the majority recharacterizes <em>People v Gould </em>as creating a previously unrecognized \u201cconstructive presence\u201d exception to its immediate-presence standard. Under this alleged exception, property that is not attached to the victim at the time of the taking will be deemed to have been taken \u201cfrom the person,\u201d if the victim could have retained possession of the property but for the defendant\u2019s use of force or intimidation to separate the victim from his property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The majority premises the creation of this exception, in part, on the idea that a defendant may not negate the from-the-person element for purposes of establishing robbery by using force or intimidation to prevent the victim from retaining possession of his property. Although such a principle itself is not objectionable, a fair reading of <em>Gould </em>indicates that it in no way stands for that principle nor did it articulate, let alone adopt, the majority\u2019s new \u201cconstructive presence\u201d exception. Rather, as previously explained, <em>Gould </em>held that the taking of property in the victims\u2019 immediate presence and within their area of protection and control was sufficient to sustain a conviction of larceny from the person, notwithstanding that the victims were not in actual physical possession of the property at the time of the taking.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Perhaps even more concerning is the result of the majority\u2019s new \u201cimmediate presence\u201d standard, in the context of takings from a retail establishment. By holding that there can be no \u201cintervening space\u201d between the victim and the property taken unless its \u201cconstructive presence\u201d exception applies, the majority essentially eviscerates the offense of larceny from the person in all instances not involving a taking where the property is physically attached to the victim. That is, if, in the absence of actual physical possession, larceny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>from the person can only be established when the \u201cconstructive presence\u201d exception applies, then the actual offense committed would be robbery because the offense would necessarily involve force or intimidation. Comparatively, if, in the absence of force or intimidation, larceny from the person can only be established when property is attached to the victim at the time of the taking, then the absence of property physically attached to the victim places the crime within the definition of retail fraud.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s standard, then, the prosecutor\u2019s discretion to pursue a charge of larceny from the person in the context of a taking from a retail establishment is limited to those very rare instances in which the defendant is actually a pickpocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In summary, the majority\u2019s new immediate-presence standard overrules nearly one hundred years of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, without any mention of stare decisis, recasts the historical understanding of \u201cfrom the person\u201d in both Michigan\u2019s and England\u2019s common law, and unduly narrows the crime of larceny from the person such that, effectively, it is conflated with either shoplifting or robbery. I would instead adhere to this Court\u2019s long-standing recognition of that phrase which, consistent with its meaning at common law, includes the taking of objects that are within a person\u2019s immediate presence and under that person\u2019s personal protection and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Application of the unabated meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d to the facts of this case, leads to the conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction. Macy\u2019s loss-prevention officer Krumbhaar testified that defendant, after trying on a pair of shoes, completed the larceny by pushing the gift box into her grocery bag. At that time, Krumbhaar observed the taking from a distance close enough to hear defendant interact with a sales associate. As an employee of Macy\u2019s responsible for preventing thefts of Macy\u2019s store items, Krumbhaar had personal protection and rightful control over the gift box at the time of taking.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Taking these facts in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant unlawfully took the gift box from Krumbhaar\u2019s immediate presence. Krumbhaar\u2019s testimony that defendant was within her \u201cvisual range\u201d and was \u201cfairly close,\u201d is sufficient to satisfy the meaning of \u201cfrom the person,\u201d contrary to defendant\u2019s argument. Rather, as previously explained, \u201cfrom the person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>includes the taking of objects that are within a person\u2019s immediate presence and under that person\u2019s personal protection and control such that a risk of a physical altercation exists, as in the instant case. I would therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the gift box was taken \u201cfrom the person of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">To reach this conclusion, and affirm this Court\u2019s adherence to the common-law meaning of \u201cfrom the person,\u201d is not to say that all shopliftings constitute larceny from the person. Indeed, there are multiple scenarios where a defendant who is caught shoplifting is guilty of only retail fraud or simple larceny rather than larceny from the person. \u00c1 few non-exhaustive examples of such instances include (1) a defendant who completes the larceny without being seen; (2) a defendant who completes the larceny while a security guard observes via closed-circuit monitor; (3) a defendant who is stopped by a security guard because of a suspicious bulge in the defendant\u2019s clothing or other suspicious behavior following the completed larceny; or (4) the defendant triggers the store\u2019s security alarm after the completed larceny and is stopped by a security guard.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> While defendant suggests that she could, at most, be guilty of third-degree retail fraud, it is clear that none of these scenarios existed and the evidence, in my view, supports a jury finding that defendant took the gift box from Krumbhaar\u2019s person.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The majority\u2019s new rule deviates from the historical meaning of \u201cfrom the person\u201d as it has been understood in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence. By defining \u201cimmediate presence\u201d to require that there be no \u201cintervening space\u201d between the person and object taken, the majority has effectively ruled that the property must be attached to the person.

Applying the legally correct understanding of the larceny-from-the-person statute, and considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence was clearly sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction.
