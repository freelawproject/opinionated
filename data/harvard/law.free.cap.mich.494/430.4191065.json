We conclude that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense\u201d encompasses both defendant Hardy\u2019s act of racking a shotgun during a carjacking and defendant Glenn\u2019s violent behavior during an armed robbery. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s scoring decision in <em>Hardy. </em>In <em>Glenn, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for reinstatement of defendant Glenn\u2019s July 22, 2010 judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"A-E\">A. <em>PEOPLE v HARDY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In July 2010, defendant Hardy and an accomplice approached a man, who had just exited his car. Hardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>pointed a shotgun at the man, racked it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and demanded that the man give him everything he had. The man grabbed the barrel of the shotgun and tried to wrench it out of Hardy\u2019s grasp, but Hardy overpowered him, and Hardy and his accomplice drove off in the man\u2019s vehicle. Police arrested both men a few hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Hardy pleaded guilty to one count of carjacking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At sentencing, the prosecutor argued that the circuit court should assess 50 points for OV 7 because Hardy had not only displayed a shotgun, but had also pointed it at the victim and racked it. The prosecutor claimed that the act of racking a shotgun was \u201cconduct designed only to threaten the victim with immediate violent death.\u201d Defense counsel agreed to the scoring, stating, \u201cI cannot argue with that, your Honor.\u201d Accordingly, the circuit court assessed 50 points for OV 7 and sentenced Hardy to 12 to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Hardy filed a motion for resentencing, challenging the OV 7 scoring and claiming that defense counsel had been constitutionally ineffective for consenting to it. The circuit court denied the motion, concluding that the 50-point score under OV 7 was proper and that defense counsel was not constitutionally ineffective. After Hardy filed a delayed application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, a majority of the panel denied leave for lack of merit in the grounds presented.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the dissenting judge would have remanded for resentencing on the ground that the circuit court incorrectly scored OV 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>We granted leave to consider whether the circuit court erroneously assessed 50 points for OV 7 because Hardy racked the shotgun during the carjacking and whether defense counsel was ineffective for waiving this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">B<em>PEOPLE v GLENN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In August 2009, defendant Glenn and an accomplice entered a gas station convenience store. He carried what two store employees later described as a \u201csawed-off shotgun.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Glenn ordered one of the employees to approach the front counter. As the employee did so, Glenn struck him in the back of the head with the butt of the weapon. The blow was so forceful that it knocked him to the ground. Glenn then forced both employees behind the counter and demanded money, which Glenn grabbed out of the cash register and safe. He hit the second employee in the side of the head with the butt of his weapon before fleeing with his accomplice in a waiting getaway car. Soon afterward, police stopped the getaway car and arrested Glenn. Neither employee suffered any injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Glenn pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and one count of assault with a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At sentencing, the prosecutor argued that striking the employees with the weapon was designed to \u201cget them to move faster, to be afraid,\u201d and that this was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to assess 50 points for OV 7 because it involved \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d The circuit court agreed with the prosecutor and assessed 50 points for OV 7 over defense counsel\u2019s objection. The circuit court then sentenced defendant to 15 to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for the armed robbery and 18 to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment for the felonious assault.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals vacated defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court acknowledged that Glenn, by striking the employees, used more violence than was \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d to complete an armed robbery.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But the Court of Appeals concluded that the circuit court erred because OV 7 was only \u201cmeant to be scored in particularly egregious cases involving torture, brutality, or similar conduct designed to <em>substantially </em>increase the victim\u2019s fear, not in every case in which some fear-producing action beyond the bare minimum necessary to commit the crime was undertaken.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We granted leave to appeal to consider whether the circuit court erroneously assessed 50 points for OV 7 because Glenn committed \u201cassaultive acts beyond those necessary to commit the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We take this opportunity to clarify the applicable standards of review for a sentencing guidelines scoring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>issue. In <em>Glenn, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that an appellate court \u201creviews a trial court\u2019s scoring of the sentencing guidelines to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion and whether the record evidence adequately supports a particular score.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is an imprecise statement of applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">As we have explained before, the abuse of discretion standard formerly predominated, in sentencing review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But when the Legislature enacted the sentencing guidelines in 1998, it prescribed detailed instructions for imposing sentences, thereby reducing the circumstances under which a judge could exercise discretion during sentencing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under the sentencing guidelines, the circuit court\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed for clear error and must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether the facts, as found, are adequate to satisfy the scoring conditions prescribed by statute, i.e., the application of the facts to the law, is a question of statutory interpretation, which an appellate court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In these cases, we review for clear error the factual findings that the defendants\u2019 conduct was designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety of their victims. We review de novo whether, these acts were sufficient to assess 50 points for OV 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">A. INTERPRETING MCL 777.37 (OV 7)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">As we have stated before, our goal in interpreting a statute \u201cis to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. The touchstone of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s language. If the statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we assume that the Legislature intended its plain meaning and we enforce the statute as written.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">MCL 777.37 governs OV 7. MCL 777.37(1) provides, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">(1) Offense variable 7 is aggravated physical abuse. Score offense variable 7 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">(a) A victim was treated with sadism, torture, or excessive brutality or conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense .......................................................................50 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">(b) No victim was treated with sadism, torture, or excessive brutality or conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense......................................................................0 points</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">A trial court can properly assess 50 points under OV 7 if it finds that a defendant\u2019s conduct falls under one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the four categories of conduct listed in subsection (1)(a). No party contends that any of the first three categories (sadism, torture, or excessive brutality) applies in these cases. Thus, our focus is on the fourth category\u2014 whether defendants engaged in \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Other than \u201csadism,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the statute does not define the individual terms used in the listed categories, so we presume that the Legislature intended for the words to have their ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, we turn to the dictionary for guidance in interpreting the terms used in the phrase: \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The phrase begins with the words \u201cconduct designed.\u201d \u201cDesigned\u201d means \u201cto intend for a definite purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, the word \u201cdesigned\u201d requires courts to evaluate the intent motivating the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Next, we come to the words \u201csubstantially increase.\u201d \u201cSubstantial\u201d means \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> To \u201cincrease\u201d means \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>make greater, as in number, size, strength, or quality; augment.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Applying these definitions to the relevant text, we conclude that it is proper to assess points under OV 7 for conduct that was intended to make a victim\u2019s fear or anxiety greater by a considerable amount.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In <em>Glenn, </em>the Court of Appeals erred by ignoring the Legislature\u2019s second use of the word \u201cor\u201d in the provision at issue. MCL 777.37(1)(a), reads: \u201c[a] victim was treated with sadism, torture, <em>or </em>excessive brutality <em>or </em>conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered[.]\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cOr\u201d is a word \u201cused to indicate a disunion, a separation, an alternative.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> While the first \u201cor\u201d may be interpreted as linking the first three categories in a common series, the second \u201cor\u201d separates the last OV 7 category from the series that precedes it. Thus, the use of \u201cor\u201d before the phrase \u201cconduct designed\u201d shows that this phrase is an independent clause that has an independent meaning. The Court of Appeals in <em>Glenn </em>therefore erred by interpreting the statute in a manner inconsistent with its plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Court of Appeals also erred in <em>Glenn </em>to the extent it concluded that \u201ccircumstances inherently present in the crime must be discounted for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>scoring an OV\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> To the contrary, absent an express prohibition, courts may consider conduct inherent in a crime when scoring offense variables. The sentencing guidelines explicitly direct courts to disregard certain conduct inherent in a crime when scoring OVs 1, 3, 8, 11, and 13.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In all other cases, \u201cthe Sentencing Guidelines allow a factor that is an element of the crime charged to also be considered when computing an offense variable score.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It was error for the Court of Appeals to state or imply otherwise in <em>Glenn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">However, we agree with the Court of Appeals that \u201c [a]ll. . . crimes against a person involve the infliction of a certain amount of fear and anxiety.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Since the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category only applies when a defendant\u2019s conduct was designed to substantially <em>increase </em>fear, to assess points for OV 7 under this category, a court must first determine a baseline for the amount of fear and anxiety experienced by a victim of the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>crime or crimes at issue. To make this determination, a court should consider the severity of the crime,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the elements of the offense, and the different ways in which those elements can be satisfied. Then the court should determine, to the extent practicable, the fear or anxiety associated with the minimum conduct necessary to commit the offense.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Finally, the court should closely examine the pertinent record evidence, including how the crime was actually committed by the defendant. As noted above, evidence which satisfies an element of an offense need not be disregarded solely for that reason. Instead, all relevant evidence should be closely examined to determine whether the defendant engaged in conduct beyond the minimum necessary to commit the crime, and whether it is more probable than not that such conduct was intended to make the victim\u2019s fear or anxiety increase by a considerable amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In summary, we conclude that a defendant\u2019s conduct does not have to be \u201csimilarly egregious\u201d to \u201csadism, torture, or excessive brutality\u201d for OV 7 to be scored at 50 points, and that, absent an express statutory prohibition, courts may consider circumstances inherently present in the crime when scoring OV 7. The relevant inquiries are (1) whether the defendant engaged in conduct beyond the minimum required to commit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>offense; and, if so, (2) whether the conduct was intended to make a victim\u2019s fear or anxiety greater by a considerable amount.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">B. APPLICATION TO <em>HARDY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Evidence in the record, including Hardy\u2019s own plea colloquy, established that he pointed a shotgun at the victim and then racked it. The purpose of racking a shotgun is to pull a new round of ammunition from the magazine tube and slide it into the firing chamber.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Racking the weapon makes it ready to fire.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">We first consider whether racking the shotgun went beyond the minimum conduct necessary to commit a carjacking. A carjacking occurs \u201cin the course of committing a larceny of a motor vehicle[.]\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> While doing so, a defendant must use (1) \u201cforce or violence,\u201d (2) \u201cthe threat of force or violence,\u201d or (3) put \u201cin fear any operator, passenger, or person in lawful possession of the motor vehicle, or any person lawfully attempting to recover the motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Hardy threatened his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>victim with violence by pointing the shotgun at him and racking it, even though merely displaying the weapon or pointing it at the victim would have been enough to issue a threat. Because Hardy took the extra step of racking the shotgun, the circuit court correctly assessed 50 points for OV 7 as long as this conduct was designed to substantially increase the victim\u2019s fear beyond the usual level that accompanies a carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Hardy argues that he racked the shotgun solely for the purpose of getting his victim to comply, not to substantially increase his victim\u2019s fear. But racking a shotgun under these circumstances only urges compliance if doing so makes the victim fear imminent, violent death if he or she does not comply. Hence, even if Hardy\u2019s ultimate goal was to provoke compliant behavior, a preponderance of the evidence shows that his conduct was designed to substantially increase the fear of his victim beyond the usual level that accompanies a carjacking, to the point where the victim feared imminent death.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Because Hardy took the extra step of racking the shotgun, and because he did so to make his victim fear that a violent death was imminent, not just possible, the circuit court properly assessed 50 points for OV 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u201cIneffective assistance of counsel cannot be predicated on the failure to make a frivolous or meritless motion.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Because the circuit court properly scored OV 7, any objection to the court\u2019s assessment of points would have been meritless. As a result, Hardy\u2019s counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to object to the scoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">C. APPLICATION TO <em>GLENN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Turning to Glenn\u2019s case, we begin again by consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ering whether he went beyond the minimum conduct necessary to commit an armed robbery.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> To commit this crime, a defendant must engage \u201cin conduct proscribed under [MCL 750.530,]\u201d Michigan\u2019s robbery statute, which criminalizes using \u201cforce or violence against any person who is present\u201d at a larceny or assaulting or putting \u201cthe person in fear[,]\u201d \u201cin the course of committing a larceny.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> To commit an armed robbery, the defendant must also either (1) possess \u201c a dangerous weapon or an article used or fashioned in a manner to lead any person present to reasonably believe the article is a dangerous weapon,\u201d or (2) represent \u201corally or otherwise that he or she is in possession of a dangerous weapon[.]\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> To rob the convenience store, Glenn could have simply put the victims in fear by orally representing that he had a weapon. Instead, he chose to threaten the victims with what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun, and then used it to strike two different victims in the head. Hence, Glenn\u2019s conduct went beyond that necessary to commit an armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We next consider whether this conduct was designed to increase the fear or anxiety of the victims by a considerable amount. By striking the employees in the head, knocking one to the ground, and forcing both of them behind the store counter, Glenn demonstrated to his victims that he was willing to follow through on his threat to harm them, and he placed them in a place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>increased vulnerability, where escape was almost impossible. It is more probable than not that Glenn, like Hardy, engaged in this conduct to frighten his victims into compliance. We can infer this from the fact that Glenn assaulted the employees while making monetary demands. His conduct was designed to elevate his victims\u2019 fear from the concern that accompanies an unrealized threat (the fear that a criminal will become violent), to the concern that accompanies actualized violence (the fear that an attacker\u2019s blows will cause injury or death). This constitutes a considerable amount of additional fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Because Glenn\u2019s conduct went beyond that necessary to effectuate an armed robbery, and because he intended for his conduct to increase the fear of his victims by a considerable amount, the Court of Appeals erred by holding that the circuit court incorrectly assessed 50 points for OV 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We hold that because a preponderance of the evidence established that Hardy racked a shotgun to increase the fear of his victim by a considerable amount, the circuit court properly assessed 50 points for OV 7 by finding that Hardy\u2019s conduct of racking a shotgun while pointing it at the victim constituted \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s assessment of 50 points for OV 7 in <em>Hardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">We further hold that because a preponderance of the evidence established that Glenn struck two victims with the butt of what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun, knocked one victim to the ground, and forced both victims behind a store counter to make them fear imminent, serious injury or death, the circuit court appropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>assessed 50 points for OV 7. In <em>Glenn, </em>we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for reinstatement of the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-4\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Kelly, Zahra, and McCormack, JJ., concurred with Viviano, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> MCL 777.37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-11\"> MCL 777.37(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> To \u201crack\u201d a shotgun is to pull the slide of the weapon along the forestock, then push it back to its original position.

I write separately to encourage the Legislature to amend MCL 777.37, offense variable (OV) 7, to define, or more clearly articulate its intent in including, the language \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Legislature adopted the sentencing guidelines to promote uniformity in sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, in my view, the potential for subjectivity inherent in the \u201cconduct designed\u201d language is likely to cause disparate outcomes for criminal defendants in this state even with the guiding principles today\u2019s decision provides. Such a result is troubling. Given that scoring OV 7 is an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 zero points versus 50 points \u2014 and that a 50-point increase in a defendant\u2019s OV score is likely to result in a significant increase in a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence, the need for clarity and consistency in its scoring is paramount if courts are to administer justice.

In reaching its conclusion, the majority ignores the history of OV 7 and fails to consider not only the entirety of MCL 777.37, but also the statutory scheme of all offense variables, MCL 777.31 <em>et seq. </em>Contrary to the majority position, I would hold that the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category of OV 7 should be interpreted in light of the other three categories within the statute, and thus must be of the same class as sadism, torture, and excessive brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">I. SENTENCING GUIDELINES GENERALLY</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The current sentencing guidelines, MCL 777.1 <em>et seq., </em>were enacted in 1998. The purpose of the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ing guidelines is to facilitate proportionate sentencing. <em>People v Smith, </em>482 Mich 292, 305; 754 NW2d 284 (2008). The sentencing guidelines take into account the severity of a criminal offense along with the offender\u2019s criminal history and thereby determine an appropriate proportionate sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>The minimum sentence is scored on grids categorized by the offense class as found in MCL 777.11 <em>et seq. </em>See MCL 777.21. Each grid is comprised of OV score ranges and prior record variable (PRV) level ranges. See MCL 777.61 <em>et seq. </em>The OV score is calculated by adding all the scores of all the applicable OVs. MCL 777.21(a). The upper-most range on each of the several charts is \u201c100+ points,\u201d and, therefore, any OV score of 100 points or above results in the same sentencing guidelines range. Stated differently, once an offender reaches 100 OV points, additional OV points have no direct effect on the length of the offender\u2019s sentence under the statutorily set guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II. HISTORY OF OV 7</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">As originally enacted in 1998, MCL 777.37 (OV 7) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">(1) Offense variable 7 is aggravated physical abuse. Score offense variable 7 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">(a) A victim was treated with <em>terrorism, </em>sadism, torture, or excessive brutality............................................50 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">(b) No victim was treated with terrorism, sadism, torture, or excessive brutality.....................................0 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">(2) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\n<em>(a) \u2018Terrorism\u2019 means conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffers during the offense.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(b) \u2018Sadism\u2019 means conduct that subjects a victim to extreme or prolonged pain or humiliation and is inflicted to produce suffering or for the offender\u2019s gratification. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In April 2002, MCL 777.37 was amended to its current version to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">(1) Offense variable 7 is aggravated physical abuse. Score offense variable 7 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">(a) A victim was treated with sadism, torture, or excessive brutality <em>or conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense </em>......50 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">(b) No victim was treated with sadism, torture, or excessive brutality or conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense......................................................................0 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">(2) Count each person who was placed in danger of injury or loss of life as a victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">(3) As used in this section, \u201csadism\u201d means conduct that subjects a victim to extreme or prolonged pain or humiliation and is inflicted to produce suffering or for the offender\u2019s gratification. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Notably, before the 2002 amendment, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d was defined as \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffers during the offense\u201d \u2014 the exact language of the current \u201cconduct designed\u201d category in the amended version of OV 7. Concurrent with the 2002 amendment to OV 7, a new offense variable was created, OV 20, MCL 777.49a, which directs scoring for an act of terrorism. It is important to recognize that OV 20 incorporates a different definition for \u201cact of terrorism\u201d than that which existed for \u201cterrorism\u201d in the preamendment version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>OV 7. Under OV 20, an \u201cact of terrorism\u201d is defined by referring to the definition set forth in the Michigan Anti-Terrorism Act, MCL 750.543b, which was also enacted in 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The enactment of MCL 750.543b, the amendment of OV 7, and the enactment of OV 20 were part of comprehensive changes made by the Legislature in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. 2002 PA 113, 137; see also, Woodside &amp; Gershel, <em>The USA Patriot Act and Michigan\u2019s Anti-Terrorism Laws: New Anti-Terrorism Laws Make Sweeping Changes, </em>82 Mich B J 20 (2003) (describing the key components of both Michigan and Federal legislation passed in response to 9/11); 2B Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law &amp; Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 38A:1, pp 521-528 (summarizing the antiterrorist legislation passed by Michigan in response to 9/11). The changes also reflect a conceptual shift in the meaning of \u201cterrorism.\u201d Young, <em>Defining Terrorism: The Evolution of Terrorism as a Legal Concept in International Law and its Influence on Definitions in Domestic Legislation, </em>29 BC Int\u2019l <em>&amp; </em>Comp L Rev 23, 30 (2006) (explaining that \u201cterrorism,\u201d traditionally a term of political stigmatization, is evolving into a complex legal term); see also Hardy &amp; Williams, <em>What is \u201cTerrorism\u201d?: Assessing Domestic Legal Definitions, </em>16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>UCLA J Int\u2019l L &amp; Foreign Aff 77, 155 (2011) (explaining that various international bodies have developed their respective definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">III. STATUTORY ANALYSIS OF OV 7</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">To begin with, I agree with the majority that the phrase \u201cconduct designed\u201d in OV 7 \u201crequires courts to evaluate the intent motivating the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 440. Indeed, the fact that the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category focuses on a defendant\u2019s intent, whereas sadism, torture, and excessive brutality concern the <em>nature </em>of a defendant\u2019s conduct, is what gives the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category meaning independent of the other three categories in OV 7. Thus, my primary disagreement with the majority lies with its interpretation of the phrase \u201csubstantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">While it is true that our rules of statutory construction dictate that the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category be interpreted as an \u201cindependent clause that has an independent meaning,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 441, that rule is not violated by allowing the sadism, torture, and excessive brutality categories to educate our understanding of the conduct designed category. As explained previously, the fact that the conduct designed categories focus on the defendant\u2019s <em>intent </em>ensures that it has meaning independent of the other three categories, which consider the <em>nature </em>of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Moreover, we have long recognized that \u201c[although a phrase or a statement may mean one thing when read in isolation, it may mean something substantially different when read in context,\u201d and we have accordingly held that \u201c[i]n seeking meaning, words and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which follow.\u201d <em>G C Timmis &amp; Cov Guardian Alarm Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>468 Mich 416, 421; 662 NW2d 710 (2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The importance of this rule in these cases cannot be overstated. If the \u201cconduct designed\u201d language is considered without reference to the other conduct listed in OV 7, the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category could be interpreted to include conduct that differs substantially from sadism, torture, and excessive brutality and thereby permit scoring points under OV 7 on the basis of widely divergent conduct. In my view, this cannot be the proper interpretation of OV 7 because that approach would result in disproportionate sentencing, contrary to one of the principal motivating factors behind the enactment of the legislative sentencing guidelines \u2014 where sadism, torture, and excessive brutality all speak of very egregious conduct, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category does not require nearly as egregious conduct by a defendant. Therefore, in order for all four categories to have independent meaning while also ensuring that OV 7 does not result in disproportionate sentences, the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category must be interpreted to be of the same class as sadism, torture, and excessive brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The majority argues that this is not the proper interpretation of OV 7 because of the presence of a second \u201cor\u201d in MCL 777.37(1)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the majority explains that \u201cor\u201d is a word \u201cused to indicate a disunion, a separation, an alternative\u201d and thus interprets the second \u201cor\u201d in MCL 777.37(1)(a) to evidence the Legislature\u2019s intent to \u201cseparate\u00fc the last OV 7 category from the series that precedes it.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 441. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Yet when considering the historical development of OV 7 already discussed in part II, the majority\u2019s heavy reliance on the second \u201cor\u201d in OV 7 to entirely divorce the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category from the other three categories of conduct listed in OV 7 is even more questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Although I agree with the majority that it is the Legislature\u2019s role to determine \u201cwhat types of conduct warrant similar scoring under MCL 777.37,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 444 n 38, in my view, the history of OV 7 evidences the Legislature\u2019s intent in crafting the current version of MCL 777.37. As previously explained, the addition of OV 20 was part of Michigan\u2019s antiterrorism efforts. Adding an offense variable dedicated to addressing terrorist activity necessitated the removal of the word \u201cterrorism\u201d in OV 7, which addresses conduct of a wholly different character than OV 20. The Legislature, responding to the shifting legal definition of terrorism, simply replaced the word \u201cterrorism\u201d with what had been the definition of terrorism under the preamendment version of OV 7. The amendment, therefore, was necessary to accommodate changes in the law outside of OV 7 and manifests the Legislature\u2019s intent to maintain OV 7\u2019s preamendment meaning in light of the changing definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d and the addition of OV 20. Accordingly, in my view, the Legislature did not intend to change the meaning of OV 7 and, thus, the prea-mendment version of OV 7 is highly instructive in determining the proper interpretation of the current version of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Notably, the preamendment version of OV 7 provided a comma-delineated list separated by a single \u201cor,\u201d which even the majority admits should be interpreted to link the categories in a common series. See <em>G C Timmis, </em>468 Mich at 421-422, (noting that \u201cwords grouped in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>list should be given related meaning\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted), citing <em>Beecham v United States, </em>511 US 368, 371; 114 S Ct 1669; 128 L Ed 2d 383 (1994) (\u201cThat several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.\u201d). Terrorism, which was statutorily given the same meaning as the current \u201cconduct designed\u201d category, was included in the aforementioned list with the other three categories, and, thus, it was intended to be given a related meaning. Accordingly, because sadism, torture, and excessive brutality all speak of egregious conduct, I believe that the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category also speaks of similarly egregious conduct. Although I recognize that when amending OV 7 the Legislature inserted an additional \u201cor,\u201d I believe that the addition of the second \u201cor\u201d should be given little weight in this situation. Cf. <em>People v Harrison, </em>194 Mich 363, 370; 160 NW 623 (1916).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category should be given related meaning to the other three categories in the current version of OV 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Additionally, the majority fails to interpret OV 7 in light of the legislative scheme of the sentencing guidelines as a whole. MCL 777.1 <em>et seq. </em>First, conspicuously absent from the majority\u2019s analysis is any consideration of the fact that OV 7 requires the scoring of 50 points on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>an all-or-nothing basis. Second, I believe that it is relevant that the only other offense variables that have a point value as high as 50 points require either a killing or multiple sexual penetrations during the commission of a crime. See OV 3, MCL 777.33; OV 6, MCL 777.36; OV 9, MCL 777.39; OV 11, MCL 777.41; OV 13, MCL 777.43. Third, none of the other four offense variables that score on an all-or-nothing basis (as opposed to a scale depending on the severity of a defendant\u2019s conduct) are scored similarly to the 50 points assessed for OV 7. In fact, the potential for 50 points under OV 7 is three times higher than any other all-or-nothing offense variable. See, e.g., OV 4, MCL 777.34; OV 5, MCL 777.35; OV 8, MCL 777.38; and OV 14, MCL 777.44. In my view, these aspects of the sentencing guidelines bolster the conclusion that the majority errs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">As previously explained, offense variables are scored in ranges that extend from 0 to 100 points; thus, scoring 50 points under OV 7 alone places a defendant halfway to the maximum possible point total under the offense variables. Accordingly, to maintain the principle of proportionality upon which the sentencing guidelines are based, only particularly heinous conduct should justify scoring points under OV 7, which is evidenced by the fact that the only other conduct that commands such a score is homicide and multiple sexual penetrations. There can be little doubt that sadism, torture, and extreme brutality are heinous acts that the Legislature determined warrant the heavy toll of an all-or-nothing score of 50 points under OV 7. The fact that the first three OV 7 categories require a defendant\u2019s conduct to be extreme, intense, or ruthless<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> comports with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the high point value and inflexible nature of OV 7. Therefore, by applying the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category so liberally that it is not of a similar class as sadism, torture, and excessive brutality, the majority\u2019s analysis ignores the statutory language and history of OV 7, and raises grave concerns regarding the proportionality of sentencing, as Justice MCCORMACK notes in her concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">On the other hand, the majority reasonably argues that the bar for scoring the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category cannot be so high that the category loses all meaning in comparison to the other categories. Accordingly, the majority\u2019s conclusion that OV 7 requires \u201cconduct that was intended to make a victim\u2019s fear or anxiety greater by a considerable amount,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 441, appears facially reasonable, given that the phrase \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d is derived from a dictionary definition of the word \u201csubstantially.\u201d However, given the majority\u2019s refusal to consider how the other categories of conduct in OV 7 influence the meaning of the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category, the phrase \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d is of little assistance because it is rather vague in concept and too broad in application.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Instead, I would hold that the amendatory history of OV 7 evidences a legislative intent that the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category include only conduct that is of the same class as the other three categories of conduct listed in OV 7. Working from that premise, I would further hold that a defendant should only be assessed points under the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category of OV 7 if a preponderance of the evidence shows that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>dant <em>intended </em>to substantially increase the victim\u2019s fear and anxiety. Finally, I would hold that only conduct that is intended to generate extreme or intense fear and anxiety beyond the fear and anxiety that is necessary to commit the crime at issue satisfies the \u201csubstantially increase\u201d language in OV 7 because only extreme or intense fear and anxiety falls within the same class as sadism, torture, and extreme brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AYp\">A. APPLICATION TO <em>HARDY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In <em>Hardy, </em>defendant first pointed a shotgun at the victim while committing a carjacking. When the victim failed to immediately comply with defendant\u2019s orders, defendant racked the shotgun. Thus, the question is whether racking the shotgun was intended to subject the victim to extreme or intense fear and anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">As the majority explains, to commit a carjacking, a defendant must use (1) \u201cforce or violence,\u201d (2) \u201cthe threat of force or violence,\u201d or (3) put the victim \u201cin fear.\u201d MCL 750.529a(l). Thus, the crime of carjacking itself entails the use of force, a threat of force, or the installation of fear in the victim. Defendant accomplished this by threatening the victim with violence by pointing the shotgun at the victim and then racking the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Although it is true that \u201cmerely displaying the weapon or pointing it at the victim would have been enough to issue a threat,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 445, the question is whether the singular act of racking the shotgun was sufficient to instill <em>extreme </em>or <em>intense </em>fear <em>beyond the fear and anxiety that is necessary to commit the carjacking. </em>Admittedly, racking a shotgun is intended to increase the victim\u2019s fear, given that the act gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>impression that the gun is ready to fire. However, I cannot reasonably conclude that a person who is staring down the barrel of a shotgun feels any more comfort than a person who is staring down the barrel of a shotgun that was racked in their presence. Such a view of these situations assumes that the shotgun in the first situation was not racked at some time before the defendant pointed it at the victim. This is not a logical assumption because any person who finds himself or herself on the wrong end of a shotgun is likely to assume that the gun is ready to fire and therefore \u201cfear imminent, violent death,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 445, regardless of whether he or she observed the defendant rack the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Accordingly, although racking a shotgun while in the victim\u2019s presence is certainly deplorable conduct, I believe that in the context of a carjacking racking a shotgun is only minimally more fear-inducing than pointing a shotgun at a victim at close range. Therefore, defendant\u2019s conduct was not intended to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d the victim\u2019s fear because it was not sufficient to instill <em>extreme </em>or <em>intense </em>fear <em>beyond the fear and anxiety that is necessary to commit the carjacking.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, I would hold that the trial court clearly erred by assessing 50 points under OV 7 in <em>Hardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">B. APPLICATION TO <em>GLENN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In <em>Glenn, </em>defendant struck both employees on the head with what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the course of committing an armed robbery. When defendant struck the second employee on the head, defendant had already obtained the money and both employees were wholly compliant. Striking the second employee once defendant had already effectuated the crime evidenced that defendant was not merely threatening physical harm, but was in fact willing to physically harm the employees despite their compliance. This additional use of force during the robbery was entirely unnecessary for the crime\u2019s successful commission and was thus intended to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d the victims\u2019 fear and anxiety by subjecting them to intense or extreme fear and anxiety beyond what was necessary to commit the offense. Therefore, I agree with the majority that the trial court did not clearly err when assessing 50 points under OV 7 in <em>Glenn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><em>V. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">I disagree with the majority because it errs by holding that the phrase \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety of the victim\u201d must be interpreted independently and without reference to the other three categories under which OV 7 can be scored. In doing so, the majority fails to consider the \u201cconduct designed\u201d category in light of the entirety of the OV 7 statute, the sentencing guidelines statutory scheme, and the history of the OV 7 statute. Instead, I would hold that to be properly scored under OV 7, \u201cconduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety of the victim\u201d must rise to the same class as sadism, torture and excessive brutality, and that the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been intended to cause a victim intense or extreme fear and anxiety beyond the fear and anxiety that is necessary to commit the crime at issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> An act of terrorism is defined under MCL 750.543b as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(a) \u201cAct of terrorism\u201d means a willful and deliberate act that is all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\"><em>(i) </em>An act that would be a violent felony under the laws of this state, whether or not committed in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\"><em>(ii) </em>An act that the person knows or has reason to know is dangerous to human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\"><em>(Hi) </em>An act that is intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence or affect the conduct of government or a unit of government through intimidation or coercion.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> MCL 777.37(1)(a) states in relevant part: \u201c[a] victim was treated with sadism, torture, or excessive brutality <em>or </em>conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\u201d Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> <em>Harrison, </em>194 Mich at 370, held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201c[e]very change of phraseology... does not indicate a change of substance and intent....
