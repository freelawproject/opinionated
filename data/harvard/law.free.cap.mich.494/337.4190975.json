The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions. We granted leave to appeal to consider whether out-of-court statements made by police investigators during an interrogation of a defendant that vouch for the credibility of another must be redacted from a recording of the interview before it is played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">At this juncture, we find it unnecessary to adopt a bright-line rule requiring the automatic redaction of such statements. Instead, applying our rules of evidence, we hold that if such out-of-court statements are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>statements may be admissible to the extent that the proponent of the evidence establishes that they are relevant for their proffered purpose as defined by MRE 401. Further, even if relevant, the statements may be excluded under MRE 403. Finally, upon request, the statements must be restricted to their proper scope and the jury instructed accordingly. MRE 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Under the facts of this case, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing all the detectives\u2019 statements commenting on credibility to be presented to the jury on the basis that the statements provided \u201ccontext\u201d for defendant\u2019s statements, when most of the detectives\u2019 statements were irrelevant for that purpose. Because the error in this case undermined the reliability of the verdict, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The convictions in this case relate to events occurring in the Spring of 2009 while the complainant and her family were at defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The complainant testified that she, her mother, father, and brother went to defendant\u2019s home to watch a hockey game with defendant and his family. According to the complainant, she became tired and slouched back on one of defendant\u2019s couches, attempting to fall asleep. One of defendant\u2019s children was asleep in the same room on another couch, while the adults and another child were downstairs in defendant\u2019s basement. Two other children were asleep somewhere else in defendant\u2019s home. The complainant testified that while she was feigning sleeping, defendant put his hands on her inner thighs and later touched her breasts while cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ing her with a blanket. The complainant also stated that defendant put his thumb under the waistband of her pants, which was near her underwear line. According to the complainant, after defendant left, she went downstairs and asked her parents if they could leave. The complainant\u2019s mother, Jennifer, testified that everything seemed normal when they left and, although there was testimony that the two families continued to see each other after the incident, Jennifer testified that the complainant was not interested in going to defendant\u2019s home. The complainant did not tell anyone about the incident for nearly a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A friend of the complainant testified that in late April 2010, she and the complainant were talking about secrets when the complainant stated that someone had touched her while at a gathering, but she did not indicate where she had been touched. Although the friend told the complainant that she needed to tell someone, the complainant did not do so until approximately two weeks later after getting into an argument with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Jennifer testified that in May 2010, she had been teasing the complainant over her homework when the complainant ran out of the room, upset. Jennifer followed the complainant to her bedroom to find out what was wrong. When the complainant began to cry and indicated that she did not wish to speak, Jennifer asked her a series of questions, including whether she was fighting with a friend or whether someone in the neighborhood had hurt her. When the complainant answered negatively to Jennifer\u2019s questions, Jennifer asked the complainant if she was having a problem with a grownup, to which the complainant nodded \u201cyes.\u201d Jennifer eventually asked the complainant if the problem was with defendant, who, according to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>plainant\u2019s father, was a good friend with whom his family had spent countless hours. In response, the complainant shook her head \u201cyes\u201d and started to cry, but she would not reveal any of the details. Soon thereafter, the complainant\u2019s parents took the complainant to the Kent County Sheriffs Department (KCSD), which referred them to the Children\u2019s Assessment Center of Grand Rapids \u2014 a center that assesses children following reports of suspected child abuse. On May 11, 2010, the complainant was interviewed by KCSD Detective Edward Kolakowski. During that interview, the complainant revealed the full extent of the incident for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">That same day, Detective Kolakowski and Detective William Heffron interviewed defendant. Defendant was informed by Detective Kolakowski when he arrived at the Sheriffs Department that the complainant had accused him of inappropriate touching while their families were watching a game a year earlier at defendant\u2019s home. Throughout the interview, defendant denied any improper contact with the complainant, but remembered coming upstairs to get a drink while the complainant and her family were watching a hockey game. Defendant, stated that he saw the complainant asleep, hugged her, and gave her a kiss on her cheek or forehead. Defendant acknowledged that he had been drinking that night, that the complainant seemed vulnerable because she appeared to be asleep, and that his hands accidentally touched the skin of the complainant\u2019s back when he put his arms around her. Defendant, however, explained that none of his actions were sexual, and he did not touch the complainant inappropriately or in the places that she claimed that she was touched. Defendant stated that he and the complainant had always been affectionate, and the complainant had often greeted defendant with a hug and a kiss when they saw each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>During the interview, Detective Kolakowski and Detective Heffron made statements regarding the complainant and child-victims generally, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">DETECTIVE KOLAKOWSKI: ... <em>Kids have a hard time lying about this stuff because they don\u2019t even want to talk about it, let alone they don\u2019t even want to talk about it to a mere fucking stranger.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">DETECTIVE HEFFRON: Especially a 12 year old girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">DETECTIVE KOLAKOWSKI: And she tells me what happened? And she tells our counselors what happened? And these are \u2014 and \u2014and with these interviews, too, it\u2019s not just a interview of, \u201ctell me what happened,\u201d ... they\u2019re ... done with ... Michigan adopted, basically, a forensic interview protocol that there\u2019s a special way that kids have to be interviewed. They\u2019re not interviewed like I can interview you, all right? ... [Y]ou know what? If you can\u2019t do it for yourself, do it for your own little girl.... Make sure she knows that men have to answer to the truth. And make sure that [the complainant] knows that, you know what? [Y]eah, someone fucked up ... . She\u2019s having a devastating time. She loves you. She cares about you. She cares about your family. You want to know what her concern was? You want to know why she waited to tell? Do you want me to tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">[DEFENDANT]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">DETECTIVE KOLAKOWSKI: I\u2019ll tell you....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">DETECTIVE HEFFRON: <em>You know there\u2019s a big difference when we interview 4, 5, 6 year olds and when they get up around 10,11,12,13. There\u2019s a big difference. Four, five, six year old kids, they\u2019re easy to manipulate by parents, aunts, uncles </em>\u2014 they\u2019re <em>easy to manipulate. They\u2019re terrible actors. They\u2019re terrible. When kids start getting a little bit older they\u2019re better actors. They\u2019re </em>\u2014 they\u2019re <em>older, they\u2019re seeing more. She\u2019s 12. The big issue here is if she wanted to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>get you in trouble </em>\u2014 she\u2019s <em>smart enough, and she\u2019s </em>only\u2014 <em>and she\u2019s 12 </em>\u2014 if, <em>for whatever reason, she wanted to get you in trouble she would </em>\u2014 she would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">[DEFENDANT]: That she would say that I fucked her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">DETECTIVE HEFFRON: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">[DEFENDANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">DETECTIVE HEFFRON: <em>Absolutely. \u201cHe put his hand down my pants, his finger was in my vagina\u201d all of this \u201chis mouth was on my breast\u201d </em>\u2014 that\u2019s <em>what they would do if they\u2019re gonna lie to get somebody in trouble,.. .an older kid like that. Little kids, they never\u2019ve [sic] been exposed to that stuff. They don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s pretty credible when she tells us, \u201cHey, he touched... me here\u201d and \u201cheput his hand on my breasts\u201d and... \u201chis hand started going down my pants but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s pretty credible; that\u2019s pretty detailed. Again, if there\u2019s no reason for her to make this crap up, why would she say it? This is the last thing... she wanted to do was talk to a total stranger about something like this. Why? Why is she gonna put herself through that if it didn\u2019t happen? We can\u2019t find anything. Kids don\u2019t lie about this stuff. They lie about their homework being done; they lie about, \u201cyep, I did the dishes\u201d when they didn\u2019t... [T]hey lie about \u201cyeah, we were in bed by 10:00.\u201d They don\u2019t lie about this stuff if maybe she\u2019s in trouble for something. This is not the kind of stuff that kids make up to try to get out of some trouble that they\u2019re in. That\u2019s why this is so disturbing.... And again, if she\u2019s talking about \u201chis hand was on my breast, \u201d she\u2019s not gonna make that crap up. She just isn\u2019t. And this is your opportunity for her to eventually see that you made a mistake, you\u2019re human, and you want to get this worked out so she has the least amount of stress/trauma, whatever, but that she gets the... feeling that \u201cI love the man, the family. He made a mistake and someday as I\u2019m older[\u201d] </em>\u2014 because <em>she\u2019s always gonna remember this </em>\u2014 this <em>didn\u2019t happen when she was 2 or 3 years old </em>\u2014 they <em>don\u2019t remember that stuff. She\u2019s always gonna remember this. At some point she will be able to accept, \u201cHey, this is what happened. We all make mistakes. He made a mistake.\u201d But you\u2019re gonna have to start by being </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>upfront. And for you to sit here and say that \u201cwell, yep, she\u2019s telling the truth about this, but she\u2019s lying about that,\u201d . . . she\u2019s gonna have this report. She\u2019s gonna know exactly what you said, and whatever... message you want to send her that\u2019s ... up to you. We can\u2019t force you. But if she\u2019s saying you touched her breasts </em>\u2014 I <em>wasn\u2019t there for the interview [of the complainant] but [Kolakowski, who has] done a lot of interviewing, said, \u201cBill, there\u2019s no question this happened and the stuff that I\u2019m aware of he probably did\u2019\u2019 </em>\u2014 we <em>just need to know why. Was it alcohol </em>? Was <em>it </em>\u2014 I <em>don\u2019t know what your sex life has been at home, but all we want to know is why. Were you ever molested as a </em>child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">[DEFENDANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">DETECTIVE HEFFRON: Help us out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">[DEFENDANT]: You asked a lot of different questions right there. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t know what motivated me. I think I explained it, I was just trying to give her a peck. I don\u2019t know where this touching of the hreast is coming from. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">In addition to other statements in the interview,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant made a pre-trial motion to exclude these emphasized statements. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objections, reasoning that the emphasized statements either gave context to defendant\u2019s statements or were \u201cin the nature of the interrogation of the accused,\u201d and the questions and answers could be favorable to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">At trial, a video recording of defendant\u2019s interview was played for the jury. Before the video was played, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>however, Detective Kolakowski testified regarding his experience with forensic interviews, stating that he had received special training in forensic interviewing techniques; that the technique requires the interviewer to inquire whether the child understands the difference between the truth and a lie and that older children, such as those around 11 years old, understand the difference between the two; that he had done \u201chundreds\u201d of forensic interviews throughout his career; and that he had followed the forensic interview process when interviewing the complainant. The jury was then given a copy of the transcript, with the following oral instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">You\u2019ve been handed .. . what\u2019s going to be marked for appellate purposes as Exhibit 2-A. Again, the transcript is not evidence. It\u2019s the recording that\u2019s going to be played for you that\u2019s the evidence.. .. What you have to make your decision on is based on what... evidence that\u2019s admitted in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">After the video was played, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, stating that he was essentially making a renewed motion to strike Detective Heffron\u2019s comments because, irrespective of Detective Kolakowski\u2019s comments regarding the complainant\u2019s credibility, Detective Heffron\u2019s statements were too prejudicial. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. However, after an hour-long lunch recess, the judge gave the jury the following instruction in light of defendant\u2019s previous motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">[A]s relates to [the DVD], which before the lunch recess was played for you, there Eire msmy statements Eind questions by one or more law enforcement officers. These questions or statements, no matter how short or how long, are not evidence, and you must not consider them as such. Only the answers of [the defendant] are evidence. The questions or statements of the law enforcement officers are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>only provided to you to put into context the answers of [the defendant]. It is only the answers of [the defendant] that are evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In addition to the above testimony, an expert testified for- each party, with the prosecution\u2019s expert stating that it is common for complainants to delay reporting their allegations, and the defense expert stating that delayed reporting can lead to incorrect recollections and that children are susceptible to suggestion by others, including their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Defendant and his wife were the final witnesses. Defendant continued to deny having touched the complainant\u2019s breasts, inner thighs, stomach, or belt-line. Defendant\u2019s wife also testified, asserting that the complainant\u2019s testimony was flawed on the basis of calendars that she maintained to keep track of her family\u2019s schedules. From her records, she believed that the night in question occurred on a night that the complainant had a track meet. As a result, the complainant and her family could not have arrived at defendant\u2019s home until after the hockey play-off games that occurred on that date were over.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of assault and battery, as a lesser-included offense of assault with the intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Defendant appealed, arguing, in relevant part, that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to redact numerous statements by the detectives that vouched for the complainant\u2019s credibility. The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court reasoned that the officers\u2019 statements regarding the complainant\u2019s credibility were properly admitted, explaining that any introductory statements by the detectives provided context for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>questions and defendant\u2019s statements in response.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">A trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence \u201cwill not be disturbed absent an abuse of. . . discretion.\u201d <em>People v McDaniel, </em>469 Mich 409, 412; 670 NW2d 659 (2003). A trial court abuses its discretion when it chooses an outcome that falls outside the range of principled outcomes. <em>People v Smith, </em>482 Mich 292, 300; 754 NW2d 284 (2008). However, if an evidentiary error is a non-constitutional, preserved error, then it \u201cis presumed not to be a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears that, more probably than not, it was outcome determinative.\u201d <em>People v Krueger, </em>466 Mich 50, 54; 643 NW2d 223 (2002). An error is \u201coutcome determinative if it undermined the reliability of the verdict\u201d and, in making this determination, a court should \u201cfocus on the nature of the error in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">III. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">It is \u201c[t]he Anglo-Saxon tradition of criminal justice . . . [that] makes jurors the judges of the credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of testimony offered by witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v Bailey, </em>444 US 394, 414; 100 S Ct 624; 62 L Ed 2d 575 (1980). Because it is the province of the jury to determine whether \u201ca particular witness spoke the truth or fabricated a cock-and-bull story,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 414-415, it is improper for a witness or an expert to comment or provide an opinion on the credibility of another person while testifying at trial. <em>People v Buckey, </em>424 Mich 1, 17; 378 NW2d 432 (1985). See also, <em>People v Peterson, </em>450 Mich 349, 352; 537 NW2d 857 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such comments have no probative value, <em>Buckey, </em>424 Mich at 17, because \u201cthey do nothing to assist the jury in assessing witness credibility in its fact-finding mission and in determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Connecticut v Taft, </em>306 Conn 749, 764; 51 A3d 988 (2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). See also, <em>People v Row, </em>135 Mich 505, 507; 98 NW 13 (1904) (explaining that opinion testimony regarding a complainant\u2019s veracity is not competent evidence). As a result, such statements are considered \u201csuperfluous\u201d and are \u201cinadmissible lay witnessD opinion on the believability of a [witness\u2019s] story\u201d because the jury is \u201cin just as good a position to evaluate the [witness\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>People v Smith, 425 </em>Mich 98, 109, 113; 387 NW2d 814 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(1) whether statements in a recording of a police interview of a criminal defendant that vouch for the credibility of a witness, which would be inadmissible if stated by a trial witness, must be redacted from the recording before the jury views it; or (2) if the jury is allowed to see such a recording without redacting the vouching statements, what circumstances must be present and what, if any, protective measures must be in place. <em>[People v Musser, </em>493 Mich 860 (2012).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>This case, however, involves a twist on the traditional rule. Specifically, at issue is whether the rule barring testimony regarding the credibility of another person excludes out-of-court statements to the same effect that are contained in the recordings or transcripts of an interrogation. In such a case, the contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>recording or transcript are <em>not </em>automatically admissible. Instead, our evidentiary rules are triggered, including the rules regarding hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Under Michigan\u2019s evidentiary rules, \u201chearsay\u201d is an unsworn, out-of-court statement that is \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d MRE 801(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; <em>People v Stamper, </em>480 Mich 1, 3; 742 NW2d 607 (2007). Under MRE 802, hearsay is not admissible unless it \u201cfalls under one of the hearsay exceptions set forth in the Michigan Rules of Evidence.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>480 Mich at 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If, however, the proponent of the evidence offers the statement for a purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted, then the statement, by definition, is not hearsay. MRE 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In this case, only the admissibility of the detectives\u2019 statements is at issue. Specifically, the prosecution asserts that the detectives\u2019 statements were properly admitted because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted in violation of the prohibition on vouching. Instead, the prosecution asserts that the detectives\u2019 statements were offered solely to provide context for defendant\u2019s statements that the prosecution wished to admit as an admission by a party opponent under MRE 801(d)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant, however, asserts that these statements should have been redacted from the interrogation recording before it was presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the jury because the statements, in effect, improperly vouched for the complainant\u2019s credibility. Alternatively, defendant argues that the detectives\u2019 statements were irrelevant because they were unnecessary to provide context for defendant\u2019s statements. Thus, at issue is whether an interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statements that vouch for the credibility of another person must be redacted from the recording of the interrogation before it is presented to the jury when the prosecution purports to offer the interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statements, <em>not </em>for the truth of the matter asserted, but <em>only </em>to place the defendant\u2019s statements in context for the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, this case asks this Court to consider whether the rule precluding a witness from commenting on another person\u2019s credibility at trial is triggered by an interrogator\u2019s statements that are offered to provide context to a defendant\u2019s statements, rather than offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, or whether the interrogator\u2019s statements that actually provide context to a defendant\u2019s statements have some probative value, unlike statements commenting on the credibility of another person that are offered for their truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Although this Court has yet to expressly opine on this issue, other jurisdictions have come to divergent conclusions. Specifically, some jurisdictions have held that there is \u201cno meaningful difference\u201d between allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ing an officer to comment on another person\u2019s credibility while testifying at tried and allowing the officer to make the same comments on a tape recording in the context of an interrogation interview. See, e.g., <em>Washington v Jones, </em>117 Wash App 89, 92; 68 P3d 1153 (2003). The logic behind this approach is that, in either case, the jury hears the police officer\u2019s opinion and \u201cclothing the opinion in the garb of an interviewing technique does not help.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also, <em>Washington v Demery, </em>144 Wash 2d 753, 765; 30 P3d 1278 (2001) (Alexander, C.J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 767 (Sanders, J., dissenting); <em>Kansas v Elnicki, </em>279 Kan 47, 57; 105 P3d 1222 (2005) (\u201cA jury is clearly prohibited from hearing such statements from the witness stand. .. and likewise should be prohibited from hearing them in a videotape, even if the statements are recommended and effective police interrogation tactics.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v Kitchen, </em>730 A2d 513, 521 (Pa Super, 1999) (explaining that accusing a defendant of lying during an interrogation is \u201cakin to a prosecutor offering his or her opinion on the truth or falsity of the evidence presented by a criminal defendant\u201d or his or her opinion regarding the guilt of the defendant, neither of which is admissible at trial). Accordingly, under this rationale, such statements must be redacted from a recording before it is submitted to a jury. <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Other jurisdictions, however, have held that \u201c \u2018there is a difference between an investigating officer giving an opinion as testimony before a jury, and an investigating officer giving an opinion during the interrogation of a suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>North Carolina v Castaneda, </em>_ NC App _; 715 SE2d 290, 294 (2011), quoting <em>Odeh v State, </em>36 Fla L Weekly D 1510; 82 So 3d 915, 920 (2011). Specifically, some courts hold that because the comments are an interrogation technique and are \u201cnot made for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>[the] defendant\u2019s credibility or veracity at trial,\u201d <em>Castaneda, </em>775 SE2d at 295, the statements are admissible but \u201conly... to the extent that they provide context to a relevant answer by the [defendant].\u201d <em>Id., quoting Idaho v Cordova, </em>137 Idaho 635, 641; 51 P3d 449 (2002) (quotation marks omitted). See also, <em>Maine v Mannion, </em>637 A2d 452, 456 (Me, 1994) (explaining that such statements \u201care admissible to prove context if they are relevant... and not excludable on the grounds of prejudice, confusion or waste of time\u201d). But see, <em>Lanham v Commonwealth, </em>171 SW3d 14, 27-29 (Ky, 2005) (without engaging in an exacting relevancy analysis, holding that admitting comments accusing a defendant of lying \u201cis necessary to provide a context\u201d for a defendant\u2019s answers during an interrogation, but limiting the holding to accusations that a defendant is not telling the truth).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Considering the prohibition on vouching and the prevalence of requests to admit recorded interrogations into evidence to present a defendant\u2019s statements to the jury, courts have justifiably struggled with the issue presented in this case. See <em>Cordova, </em>137 Idaho at 640 (noting that courts in other jurisdictions have struggled with this precise issue). Under the facts of this case, however, we find it unnecessary to adopt a bright-line rule for the automatic exclusion of out-of-court statements made in the context of an interrogation that comment on another person\u2019s credibility because the issue can be adequately addressed by our existing rules of evidence. Thus, at this juncture, we hold that where the proponent of the evidence offers an interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statements that comment on a person\u2019s credibility for the purpose of providing context to a defendant\u2019s statements, the interrogator\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>are only admissible to the extent that the proponent of the evidence establishes that the interrogator\u2019s statements are relevant to their proffered purpose. See MRE 401. Even if relevant, the interrogator\u2019s statements may be excluded under MRE 403 and, upon request, must be restricted to their proper scope under MRE 105. Accordingly, to ensure a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, trial courts \u201cmust vigilantly weed out\u201d otherwise inadmissible statements that are not necessary to accomplish their proffered purpose. <em>People v Crawford, </em>458 Mich 376, 388; 582 NW2d 785 (1998). To hold otherwise would allow interrogations laced with otherwise inadmissible content to be presented to the jury disguised as context. See <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">A. OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">This Court has long held that even if an out-of-court statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, the statement is not automatically admissible because the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of admissibility is \u201crelevance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388; <em>People v Wilkins, </em>408 Mich 69, 72-73; 288 NW2d 583 (1980); MRE 402.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, a mechanical recitation by a party that an interrogator\u2019s statements are necessary to provide \u201ccontext\u201d for a defendant\u2019s responses without explaining how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>statements relate to the recited purpose is insufficient to present the interrogator\u2019s statements to the jury; even if an out-of-court statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, the proponent of the evidence must still establish that it is \u201crelevant\u201d under MRE 401.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Wilkins, </em>408 Mich at 72-73; <em>Crawford, </em>458 Mich at 386 n 6, 387. See also, <em>In re Earle, </em>355 Mich 596, 602; 95 NW2d 833 (1959) (explaining that if a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, \u201c[i]t may or may not be received,\u201d depending on whether \u201cit has any relevancy in the case; but if it is not received, this is in no way due to the hearsay rule\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Determining whether a statement is relevant requires a trial court to carefully scrutinize whether the statement is both material \u2014 i.e., \u201coffered to help prove a proposition which is . .. a matter in issue\u201d \u2014 and probative \u2014 i.e., \u201ctends to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable . . . than it would be without the evidence.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>458 Mich at 388, 390 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Under these inquiries, if an interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statement is offered to provide context to a defendant\u2019s statement that is not \u201cin issue,\u201d it follows that both the interrogator\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s statements are immaterial and, thus, not relevant. See <em>id. </em>at 389.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Likewise, the interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statements or questions have no pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>bative value if those statements or questions, when considered in relationship to a defendant\u2019s statements, do not actually provide context to the defendant\u2019s statements. See <em>id. </em>at 389-390. Accordingly, an interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statements must be redacted if that can be done without harming the probative value of a defendant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A finding that an interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statement has some relevance to its proffered purpose does not necessarily mean that the statement may be presented to the jury, however. See, e.g., <em>People v Robinson, </em>417 Mich 661, 664; 340 NW2d 631 (1983) (\u201cDetermination of relevancy . . . does not alone determine admissibility.\u201d); MRE 402 (\u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by . . . [the Michigan Rules of Evidence], or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court.\u201d). Specifically, under MRE 403, a trial court has a \u201chistoric responsibility\u201d to \u201calways determine whether the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence sought to be introduced before admitting such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>evidence.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>417 Mich at 665, 666.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See also, <em>Stachowiak v Subczynski, </em>411 Mich 459, 464-465; 307 NW2d 677 (1981). And \u201c[e]vidence is unfairly prejudicial when there exists a danger that marginally probative evidence will be given undue or preemptive weight by the jury.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>458 Mich at 398. Consistent with these principles, a trial court must therefore evaluate the probative value of the out-of-court statements in providing context to a defendant\u2019s statements and the resulting prejudice to a defendant before the interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statements are presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">In evaluating a statement\u2019s probative value against its prejudicial effect, a trial court should be particularly mindful that when a statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and would otherwise be inadmissible if a witness testified to the same at trial, there is a \u201cdanger that the jury might have difficulty limiting its consideration of the material to [its] proper purpose[].\u201d <em>Stachowiak, </em>411 Mich at 465. See also, <em>People v Jenkins, </em>450 Mich 249, 260; 537 NW2d 828 (1995). Indeed, this Court has recognized that child-sexual-abuse cases present \u201cspecial considerations\u201d given \u201cthe reliability problems created by children\u2019s suggestibility.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 371. Further, although in the context of trial testimony, this Court has condemned opinions related to the truthfulness of alleged child-sexual-abuse complainants even when the opinions are not directed at a specific complainant. This is because in cases hinging on credibility assessments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the risk goes beyond any direct reference to a specific complainant given that the jury is often \u201clooking to \u2018hang its hat\u2019 on the testimony of witnesses it views as impartial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376. Likewise, an out-of-court statement made by an investigating officer \u201cmay be given undue weight by the jury\u201d where the determination of a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence hinges on who the jury determines is more credible \u2014 the complainant or the defendant. <em>People v Prophet, </em>101 Mich App 618, 624; 300 NW2d 652 (1980). Thus, even if an interrogator\u2019s statements are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, courts must be mindful of the problems inherent in presenting the statements to the jury, especially in child-sexual-abuse cases. See <em>Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">Finally, if an interrogator\u2019s out-of-court statement is determined to be admissible for the purpose of providing context for a defendant\u2019s statements, this determination \u201cdoes not mean that the judicial duty in admitting [the interrogator\u2019s statement] is circumscribed by [that] conclusion.\u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>408 Mich at 73. Instead, under MRE 105,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> if evidence is admissible for one purpose, but not admissible for another purpose, the court, upon request, <em>\u201cshall restrict the evidence to its proper scope </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, because an interrogator\u2019s comments regarding a person\u2019s credibility are not admissible for the truth of the matter asserted, a trial court shall restrict the interrogator\u2019s statements to their proper scope \u2014 to actually provide context to a defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Limiting out-of-court statements that are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted to their proper scope is not a new concept in Michigan jurisprudence. Indeed, this Court has previously rejected the notion that a rote recitation that a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted is sufficient to admit an out-of-court statement. For example, in <em>Wilkins, </em>a police officer was allowed to testify to the contents of an informant\u2019s tip on the basis that the testimony was merely providing a basis for the officer\u2019s subsequent action. This Court held that even if the testimony was relevant for a purpose other than the truth of the matter asserted, under MRE 105, the officer\u2019s testimony should have been restricted to simply provide that the police officer was responding to \u201ca tip,\u201d which was sufficient to establish the reason the officer took subsequent action. <em>Wilkins, </em>408 Mich at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Likewise, in the context of police interrogations, requiring the interrogating officer to testify at trial and paraphrase the statements he or she made that provoked a relevant statement by a defendant may be necessary in some instances to protect a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial from the resulting prejudice of allowing the jury to hear the interrogator\u2019s comments verbatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Applying these principles to this case, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting all the detectives\u2019 statements to the jury. As it pertains to Detective Kolakowski\u2019s first statement \u2014 that \u201c[k]ids have a hard time lying about this stuff. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u2014 the statement was irrelevant to providing context'to defendant\u2019s statements because, quite simply, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>statement from defendant for which the detective\u2019s statement provided context. Instead, Detective Kola-kowski\u2019s statements only provided context to the response of Detective Heffron. Accordingly, Detective Kolakowski\u2019s statement had no probative value for its proffered purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Regarding the second set of statements by Detective Heffron, we hold that the majority of the statements were not probative to actually provide context to defendant\u2019s statements because the majority of the detective\u2019s comments could be redacted without harming the probative value of defendant\u2019s responsive statement. Indeed, when viewed in context, only Detective Hef-fron\u2019s final statement to defendant was actually probative of the matter, and, thus, the previous statements should have been redacted as irrelevant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As to Detective Heffron\u2019s remaining statement, the statement\u2019s probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant, given the relatively innocuous nature of the detective\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As to the final exchange, we again hold that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the entirety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Detective Heffron\u2019s statements. With the exception of Detective Heffron\u2019s final questions and comments, the lengthy narrative of Detective Heffron consisted of statements directed at defendant that were unconnected to any question and could have been easily redacted without harming the probative value of defendant\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As to Detective Heffron\u2019s remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>comments and questions,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we again hold that the statements\u2019 probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant, given the nature of the questions asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">Finally, even if there was some probative value to the statements that the trial court erroneously failed to redact, the minimal probative value of those statements would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant under the facts of this case. See MRE 403. This Court has stated that \u201ccourts should be particularly insistent in protecting innocent defendants in child sexual abuse cases\u201d given \u201cthe concerns of suggestibility and the prejudicial effect an expert\u2019s testimony may have on a jury.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 371. As applied to this case, although Detective Kolakowski was not qualified as an expert, Detective Kolakowski\u2019s specialized training and experience with child complainants was presented to the jury immediately before the jury viewed the recording of the interrogation. Thus, not only was the jury aware that Detective Kolakowski had performed \u201chundreds\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>forensic interviews involving alleged child-sexual-assault victims, but Detective Kolakowski also informed the jury that a child of the same age as the complainant understands \u201cthe difference between the truth and a lie.\u201d Accordingly, Detective Kolakowski\u2019s trial testimony regarding his training and experience \u201cgave [Detective Kolakowski] the same aura of superior knowledge that accompanies expert witnesses in other trials.\u201d <em>Cordova, </em>137 Idaho at 641.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Further, the undue weight that jurors may be inclined to place on police officers\u2019 statements heightened the prejudicial effect of the detectives\u2019 frequent out-of-court statements regarding the credibility of child complainants generally and the veracity of the complainant, thus offering the jury the \u201cmuch sought-after hook on which to hang its hat.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 374 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, even if the out-of-court statements that were not redacted had some probative value for their proffered purpose, the probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion does not end the inquiry, however, because noncon-stitutional, preserved evidentiary errors are not grounds for reversal unless they undermined the reliability of the verdict. <em>Krueger, </em>466 Mich at 54. In this case, we conclude that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The evidence offered against defendant was not overwhelming. Although the complainant\u2019s testimony did not need to be corroborated, MCL 750.520h, there were no third-party witnesses in this case. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>prosecution relied on testimonial evidence and defendant\u2019s statements during the interrogation, and a factual dispute existed between the complainant\u2019s testimony and defendant\u2019s version of the events: defendant did not deny touching the complainant, but denied touching the complainant in the manner that was alleged and denied that his conduct was for sexual gratification. Thus, under the facts of this case, assessing witness credibility was the pervasive issue for the jury. As a result, the jury may have looked to the detectives\u2019 repeated out-of-court statements regarding the complainant\u2019s credibility, given the lack of physical evidence against defendant and the aura of expertise surrounding Detective Kolakowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Further, the trial court\u2019s belated limiting instruction did not cure the error. In <em>Jenkins, </em>this Court recognized that \u201c \u2018despite proper instructions to the jury, it is often difficult for them to distinguish between... substantive evidence\u2019 \u201d and evidence that is offered for another purpose. <em>Jenkins, </em>450 Mich at 261-262, quoting <em>United States v Morlang, </em>531 F2d 183, 190 (CA 4, 1975). <em>In Jenkins, </em>the prosecution was allowed to improperly impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement by having an officer who took the statement read the entirety of the written memorandum of the witness\u2019s prior statement to the jury. Portions of the memorandum, however, contained prejudicial statements that were unnecessary for impeachment purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 260-262. Given the improper manner in which the prior statements were presented to the jury and the fact that the officer\u2019s testimony went beyond the proper scope of impeachment, <em>Jenkins </em>held that there was a risk that the jury accepted the contents of the memorandum as substantive evidence, and this risk was heightened by the trial court\u2019s failure to provide a limiting instruction at the time the improperly admitted statement was read to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>In this case, the belated curative instruction likewise does not alter our conclusion that the errors undermined the reliability of the verdict. Indeed, before the recording was presented to the jury, the jury was expressly instructed that \u201cthe recording that\u2019s going to be played for you [is] the evidence\u201d and that the jury would \u201chave to make [its] decision\u201d on the basis of the evidence that was admitted. It was not until after the recording was played and after an hour-long recess that the trial court instructed the jury that the detectives\u2019 statements in the recording could only be considered to provide context for defendant\u2019s statements. Thus, the jury viewed the recording with the unqualified instruction in mind that the recording was evidence only to later be informed that all of the recording\u2019s contents could not be considered as such. Cf. <em>People v Clark, </em>340 Mich 411, 418; 65 NW2d 717 (1954) (stating that when conflicting instructions are given, a court presumes that the jury followed the erroneous instruction). Similar to <em>Jenkins, </em>the risk that the jury accepted the contents of the recording as substantive evidence was heightened by the lack of a limiting instruction before the improperly admitted statements were presented to the jury. Accordingly, although an appropriate limiting instruction may reduce prejudice to a defendant, the lack of a timely limiting instruction in this case reinforces our conclusion that an error requiring reversal occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We hold that under the facts of this case, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to redact the majority of the detectives\u2019 out-of-court statements commenting on credibility from the recording that was played to the jury because they were irrelevant to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>offered purpose of actually providing context to defendant\u2019s statements. Moreover, we hold that the errors undermined the reliability of the verdict. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions under MCL 750.520c(1)(a) and MCL 750.81, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\"> We note that there is a discrepancy between the judgment of sentence and the jury\u2019s actual verdict.

For purposes of this appeal, our analysis focuses only on those portions of the interview that were admitted over defense counsel\u2019s objections and were raised to this Court.

Portions of an interrogator\u2019s statements, when viewed together, <em>might </em>be relevant to provide context to a defendant\u2019s responses, even though, when viewed in isolation, a single statement of the interrogator, in relation to a single corresponding statement of the defendant, could seemingly be redacted without harming the probative value of a defendant\u2019s statement. This may occur in situations where the proponent of the evidence claims that a defendant\u2019s story evolved in response to a specific sequence of interrogation. Nevertheless, such a scenario would still be subject to a MRE 403 analysis and MRE 105. Because this scenario is not implicated under the facts of this case, however, we need not address this issue further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b455-4\"> MRE 403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b456-4\"> MRE 105 provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> Detective Kolakowski stated, \u201cKids have a hard time lying about this stuff because they don\u2019t even want to talk about it, let alone they don\u2019t even want to talk about it to a mere fucking stranger.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> Specifically, only the following italicized portion of Detective Heffron\u2019s statement would have been probative to provide context to defendant\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">DETECTIVE HEFFRON: You know there\u2019s a big-difference when-we-interview 4, 5, 6 year olds-and-wfaen-they get up around 10,11,12, 13.
