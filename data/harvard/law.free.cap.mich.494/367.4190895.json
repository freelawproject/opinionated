We further hold that MCL 600.1721 imposes \u201ctort liability\u201d because it authorizes an award of indemnification, or compensatory, damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to remedy a noncontractual civil wrong. Consequently, MCL 691.1407(1) of the GTLA provides governmental agencies with immunity from civil contempt petitions seeking indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721. Because the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the probate court for entry of an order granting summary disposition in favor of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In the summer of 2004, petitioner, Nancy Mick, became increasingly concerned about the mental health of her brother, Stephen Bradley. She noticed that Bradley had grown \u201cmore agitated and violent,\u201d and he had admitted to her that he was suicidal. Petitioner feared that if Bradley did not receive help \u201che could kill himself and his family.\u201d As a result, in August 2004, she petitioned the Kent County Probate Court for Bradley\u2019s hospitalization, averring that Bradley was a danger to himself and his family. She accompanied her petition with a supplemental petition for examination and hospitalization, requesting a court order directing a peace officer to take Bradley into protective custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The probate court granted the petitions that same day and issued an order requiring that Bradley submit to psychiatric examination and requiring his hospitalization. The order specified that a \u201cpeace officer shall take [Bradley] into protective custody and transport him ... to [Cornerstone Community Mental Health or any community mental health contract facility].\u201d Petitioner immediately submitted the order to respondent, the Kent County Sheriffs Department, for execution and provided additional details to the sergeant on duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>concerning how petitioner expected Bradley to react to being taken into custody and the fact that Bradley possessed several firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Respondent, however, did not timely execute the probate court\u2019s order. In the days that followed, petitioner contacted respondent twice in regard to Bradley\u2019s situation, and each time respondent assured her that the pickup would take place as soon as possible. Ultimately, respondent never attempted to take Bradley into protective custody and, nine days after the probate court entered its order, Bradley committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">After Bradley\u2019s suicide, petitioner wrote to Kent County Sheriff Lawrence A. Stelma, requesting an internal investigation, which ultimately concluded that the failure to execute the order was \u201can obvious case of simple neglect in that this petition was not executed in the manner that mental health petitions normally are handled.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stelma informed petitioner by letter of the investigation\u2019s findings, confirming that the order had not been executed and describing respondent\u2019s failure as \u201can unusual occurrence\u201d that did \u201cnot reflect any policy or procedure on the part of the Sheriffs Department . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">More than two years later, petitioner, acting as personal representative of Bradley\u2019s estate, filed a wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ful death suit against respondent and Stelma, alleging that they were grossly negligent in their failure to execute the probate court order and that their negligence was the proximate cause of Bradley\u2019s death. The circuit court dismissed the case on governmental immunity grounds, opining that respondent was not a legal entity that could be sued and that Stelma was individually immune from suit under the GTLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Petitioner did not appeal the circuit court\u2019s dismissal. Instead, she filed a petition for civil contempt in the probate court against respondent. The petition alleged that respondent\u2019s violation of the probate court\u2019s order constituted contempt of court, entitling her to indemnification damages pursuant to MCL 600.1721. The petition replicated the contents of petitioner\u2019s wrongful death complaint and sought damages \u201cincluding, but not limited to, all of those damages set forth in the Michigan Wrongful Death Statute, MCL 600.2922, et seq.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Respondent moved for summary disposition, arguing that it was immune from liability under MCL 691.1407(1) of the GTLA because petitioner sought to impose tort liability in the guise of a civil contempt petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The probate court denied respondent\u2019s motion reasoning that \u201c[governmental immunity does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>insulate a contemnor from the contemnor\u2019s refusal or negligence to obey a court order.\u201d The probate court acknowledged an \u201coverlap of remedies between a court[\u2019s] power of contempt and a compensation that may be argued under tort,\u201d but concluded that this overlap did not impede a court\u2019s <em>inherent </em>authority to punish contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">- Respondent appealed the probate court\u2019s ruling to the circuit court, which reversed and remanded the case to the probate court for entry of an order granting summary disposition in favor of respondent. Relying on the definition of \u201ctort liability\u201d articulated in <em>Tate v Grand </em>Rapids,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the circuit court concluded that petitioner\u2019s civil contempt petition was based in tort because the petition sought damages under the wrongful death statute. The circuit court, therefore, held that petitioner\u2019s claim was barred by the GTLA. While cognizant of courts\u2019 inherent authority to punish contempt, the circuit court concluded that the scope of that inherent authority is limited to the power to punish by fine or imprisonment. Because petitioner did not invoke the probate court\u2019s inherent power to punish contempt by either fine or imprisonment, but instead sought indemnification damages pursuant to MCL 600.1721, the court did not consider its holding \u2014 that petitioner\u2019s claim is barred by the GTLA \u2014 as infringing on courts\u2019 inherent contempt powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Court of Appeals granted petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal and, in a published opinion per curiam, reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that the GTLA does not immunize governmental agencies from \u201ctort-like\u201d damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>sought pursuant to MCL 600.1721.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Tate</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals opined that whether a \u201ccontempt claim can survive a governmental immunity challenge is controlled not by the nature of the damages sought, but by whether [the] contempt action is a cause of action that is separate and distinct from one that is grounded in tort liability.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">In accord with the <em>Ross </em>Court\u2019s holding that the GTLA will not bar recoveiy simply because the underlying facts could have also established a tort cause of action, we conclude that tort-like damages are recoverable in a contempt action assuming contempt can be proved. Thus, whether the GTLA implicates the viability of Mick\u2019s contempt action rests on whether Mick can successfully plead and establish a contempt cause of action. The nature of the damages being requested has no role in determining whether the action is barred by [the] GTLA. Consequently, the circuit court erred when it dismissed this case merely because the damages sought were similar to tort damages.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We granted respondent\u2019s application for leave to appeal to consider whether \u201cpetitioner\u2019s claim for civil contempt indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721 is barred by the [GTLA].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We review de novo a decision on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under MCR 2.116(C)(7), summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>disposition is appropriate when a claim is barred by governmental immunity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A party filing suit against a governmental agency bears the burden of pleading his or her claim in avoidance of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We also review de novo issues of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When construing a statute, we consider the statute\u2019s plain language and we enforce clear and unambiguous language as written.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While terms must be construed according to their plain and ordinary meaning, words and phrases \u201cas may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, when the Legislature chooses to employ a common- law term without indicating an intent to alter the common law, the term will be interpreted consistent with its common-law meaning.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Since Michigan became a state in 1837, Michigan jurisprudence has recognized the preexisting common-law concept of sovereign immunity, which immunizes the \u201csovereign\u201d state from all suits to which the state has not consented, including suits for tortious acts by the state.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This common-law concept of sovereign immunity has since been replaced in Michigan by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>GTLA and is codified by MCL 691.1407(1), which limits a governmental agency\u2019s exposure to tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Specifically, MCL 691.1407(1), which is at the center of this litigation, broadly provides that \u201ca governmental agency is immune from <em>tort liability </em>if the governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the statute, <em>all </em>suits that seek to impose \u201ctort liability\u201d for an agency\u2019s discharge of a governmental function are barred by the GTLA, subject to several exceptions that the Legislature has expressly provided for in the GTLA and in other statutes authorizing suit against governmental agencies.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While conceding that none of these exceptions applies to the instant case, petitioner asserts that the immunity afforded by the GTLA is inapplicable because a civil contempt petition seeking indemnification damages does not seek to impose tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Whether a contempt order imposing indemnification damages imposes tort liability is not readily apparent; the GTLA does not define the phrase \u201ctort liability\u201d and our caselaw has not offered a definition of the phrase. Moreover, the contempt statutes under which petitioner brings suit include no express reference to the imposition of \u201ctort liability.\u201d The civil contempt petition in the instant case is based on the general contempt statute of MCL 600.1701, a provision of the Revised Judicature Act (RJA), MCL 600.101 <em>et seq., </em>that identifies potentially punishable contemptuous conduct. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>provision, which is a codification of courts\u2019 power at common law to punish contemptuous conduct,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">The supreme court, circuit court, and all other courts of record, have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, or both, persons guilty of any <em>neglect or violation of duty or misconduct </em>in all of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">(c) All attorneys, counselors, clerks, registers, sheriffs, coroners, and all other persons in any manner elected or appointed to perform any judicial or ministerial services, for any misbehavior in their office or trust, or for any willful neglect or violation of duty, for disobedience of any process of the court, or any lawful order of the court, or any lawful order of a judge of the court or of any officer authorized to perform the duties of the judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">(g) Parties to actions, attorneys, counselors, and all other persons for disobeying any lawful order, decree, or process of the court.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">By its plain terms, MCL 600.1701 allows courts to exercise their inherent contempt powers for the purpose of either coercing a contemnor to comply with the court\u2019s order (civil contempt) or punishing a contemnor for contemptuous conduct (criminal contempt) by imposing a \u201cfine or imprisonment, or both . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In addition to the coercive and punitive sanctions permitted for civil and criminal contempt under MCL 600.1701, a court, in a civil contempt proceeding, may also order indemnification of those persons who have sustained losses as a result of contemptuous conduct under MCL 600.1721.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This statute, on which petitioner relies, provides that \u201c[i]f the alleged misconduct has caused an actual loss or injury to any person the court shall order the defendant to pay such person a sufficient sum to indemnify him . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The contemptuous misconduct referred to in these contempt statutes, however, does not clearly constitute tortious action such that petitioner\u2019s civil contempt petition would necessarily impose tort liability for purposes of the GTLA. Whether petitioner\u2019s claim is barred by the GTLA thus requires two related inquires. First, we must determine the meaning of the phrase \u201ctort liability\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(1) of the GTLA; and, second, we must decide whether a civil contempt petition seeking indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721 seeks to impose tort liability, such that the GTLA would prohibit petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">A. TOET LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">As noted, the GTLA does not define the phrase \u201ctort liability,\u201d nor has this Court previously determined the meaning of that phrase. The lower courts applied the definition of \u201ctort liability\u201d articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Tate, </em>a case involving a statute that imposes strict liability on dog owners for injuries resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>dog bites.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Tate, </em>the plaintiff sought to avoid application of the GTLA by arguing that strict-liability actions fell outside the scope of tort liability.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In rejecting the plaintiffs argument, the Court of Appeals explained, \u201cThe GTLA unambiguously grants immunity from <em>all </em>tort liability, i.e., all civil wrongs for which legal responsibility is recognized, regardless of how the legal responsibility is determined, except as otherwise provided in the GTLA.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">We do not necessarily disagree with <em>Tate\u2019s </em>general understanding of the phrase \u201ctort liability.\u201d However, in our judgment, <em>Tate\u2019s </em>definition is incomplete and fails to acknowledge the historical underpinnings of the word \u201ctort\u201d as that word has been used in our common law for more than a hundred years. Mainly, a \u201ctort\u201d is an act that has long been understood as a civil wrong that arises from the breach of a legal duty other than the breach of a contractual duty.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> For example, English common-law courts have for centuries recognized a civil wrong as an infringement on private rights belonging to individuals and divided civil wrongs into two categories: those sounding in contract and those sounding in tort.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The Queen\u2019s Bench has acknowledged this division in a case involving a bailee\u2019s liability for injury to the plaintiffs horse, in which it concluded that the legal basis for the plaintiffs claim was a tort and that damages to compensate for the injury should be allowed. Lord Justice Smith explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">[I]f in order to make out a cause of action it is not necessary for the plaintiff to rely on a contract, the action is one founded on tort; but, on the other hand, if, in order successfully to maintain his action, it is necessary for him to rely upon and prove a contract, the action is one founded upon contract.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The Queen\u2019s Bench, then, recognized only two types of civil wrongs, those involving contractual wrongs and those involving the breach of some other legal duty, the latter of which is a tort and is remedied through an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>award of compensatory damages.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Michigan common law, which has its roots in English common law, has likewise recognized this distinction between torts and contracts as the two types of civil wrongs.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Churchill v Howe,</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court considered whether a debtor\u2019s liability was limited to the parties\u2019 contractual relations. In concluding that the creditor\u2019s allegations of fraud sounded in tort, we acknowledged the general principles that a tort requires a \u201cwrong independent of a contract\u201d and that \u201cthe distinguishing feature of a tort [is] that it consists in the violation of a right given or neglect of a duty imposed by law, and not by contract.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Stated differently, and as this Court has repeatedly recognized in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>nearly one hundred years since <em>Churchill, </em>when a party breaches a duty stemming from a legal obligation, other than a contractual one, the claim sounds in tort.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Our common law likewise incorporates the concept that a tort necessarily involves compensation to an injured party for the wrong committed by a tortfeasor.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Wilson v </em>Bowen,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> a case involving an award of damages for malicious prosecution, \u201cthe purpose of an action of tort is to recover the damages which the plaintiff has sustained from an injury done him by the defendant; that <em>compensation </em>to the plaintiff is the purpose in view . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Given the foregoing, it is clear that our common law has defined \u201ctort\u201d to be a civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of compensatory damages. Accordingly, because the word \u201ctort\u201d has \u201cacquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d in our common law, and because the Legislature is presumed to be aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>common law when enacting legislation, we conclude that the term \u201ctort\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(1) is a noncontractual civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained in the form of compensatory damages.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Our analysis, however, requires more. MCL 691.1407(1) refers not merely to a \u201ctort,\u201d nor to a \u201ctort claim\u201d nor to a \u201ctort action,\u201d but to \u201ctort <em>liability.\u201d </em>The term \u201ctort,\u201d therefore, describes the type of liability from which a governmental agency is immune. As commonly understood, the word \u201cliability,\u201d refers to liableness, i.e., \u201cthe state or quality of being liable.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> To be \u201cliable\u201d means to be \u201clegally responsible[.]\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Construing the term \u201cliability\u201d along with the term \u201ctort,\u201d it becomes apparent that the Legislature intended \u201ctort liability\u201d to encompass legal responsibility arising from a tort. We therefore hold that \u201ctort liability\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(1) means all legal responsibility arising from a noncontractual civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained in the form of compensatory damages.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>In reaching this holding, we are cognizant of our decision in <em>Ross, </em>on which the Court of Appeals relied in concluding that \u201ctort-like damages are recoverable in a contempt action\u201d against a governmental entity.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Our opinion in <em>Ross </em>actually concerned nine cases, including <em>Rocco v Department of Mental Health. </em>In that case, the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was murdered while he was a patient at a hospital administered by two state agencies. The plaintiffs filed a two-count complaint alleging both negligence and breach of an implied contract. We held that the GTLA barred the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim, but that the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim, breach of an implied contract, was not barred. The defendants had argued that the plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim should be dismissed because \u201cmost of the allegations contained in Counts I and II are identical. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In rejecting that argument, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">We recognize that plaintiffs have and will attempt to avoid [MCL 691.1407(1)] of the governmental immunity act by basing their causes of action on theories other than tort. Trial and appellate courts are routinely faced with the task of determining whether the essential elements of a particular cause of action have been properly pleaded and proved. If a plaintiff successfully pleads and establishes <em>a non-tort cause of action, </em>[MCL 691.1407(1)] will not bar recovery simply because the underlying facts could have also established a tort cause of action.[<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Petitioner and the Court of Appeals interpret this passage from <em>Ross </em>to mean that the label of the action controls in determining whether an action imposes tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>liability and that, if the claim is not a traditional tort, then the GTLA is inapplicable and \u201ctort-like\u201d damages are recoverable. <em>Ross, </em>however, made no such pronouncement and did not consider the meaning of \u201ctort liability,\u201d which is the question that is now before this Court. Instead, consistent with our holding in this case, <em>Ross </em>merely recognized that the GTLA does not bar a properly pleaded contract claim.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In addition, our holding clarifies that Ross\u2019s pronouncement, that \u201cnon-tort cause[s] of action\u201d are not barred by the GTLA, should not be interpreted as limiting the GTLA\u2019s application to only traditional tort claims.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s express decision to use the word \u201cliability\u201d in describing the governmental immunity available under MCL 691.1407(1), rather than \u201caction\u201d or \u201cclaim,\u201d indicates that our focus must be on the <em>nature </em>of the liability rather than the type of action pleaded. For this reason, we decline to limit the GTLA\u2019s application to suits expressly pleaded as traditional tort claims, as petitioner would have us hold.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>because the nature of the liability will often be reflected in the remedy available, we disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 statement that \u201c[t]he nature of the damages being requested has no role in determining whether the action is barred by the GTLA.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Instead, because a tort, by definition, encompasses an award of compensatory damages, the nature of the damages is precisely relevant in determining whether the type of liability imposed is tort liability.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Accordingly, regardless of how a claim is labeled, courts must consider the entire claim, including the available damages, to determine the nature of the liability imposed.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In summary, several principles emerge from our explication of the phrase \u201ctort liability\u201d that will guide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>courts charged with the task of determining whether a cause of action imposes tort liability for purposes of the GTLA. Courts considering whether a claim involves tort liability should first focus on the nature of the duty that gives rise to the claim. If the wrong alleged is premised on the breach of a contractual duty, then no tort has occurred, and the GTLA is inapplicable.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> However, if the wrong is not premised on a breach of a contractual duty, but rather is premised on some other civil wrong, i.e., some other breach of a legal duty, then the GTLA might apply to bar the claim. In that instance, the court must further consider the nature of the liability the claim seeks to impose. If the action permits an award of damages to a private party as compensation for an injury caused by the noncontrac-tual civil wrong, then the action, no matter how it is labeled, seeks to impose tort liability and the GTLA is applicable.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>B. CIVIL CONTEMPT INDEMNIFICATION DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The civil contempt petition in this case alleges that respondent\u2019s contemptuous misconduct, prohibited by MCL 600.1701, caused Bradley\u2019s suicide and seeks indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721. Because petitioner\u2019s civil contempt petition seeks indemnification under MCL 600.1721, we must construe the language of that provision to determine whether such petitions impose tort liability. The provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">If the <em>alleged misconduct has caused an actual loss or injury </em>to any person the court shall order the defendant to pay such person a sufficient sum to <em>indemnify him, </em>in addition to the other penalties which are imposed upon the defendant. <em>The payment and acceptance of this sum is an absolute bar to any action by the aggrieved party to recover damages for the loss or </em>injury.[<footnotemark>55</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Although we have not previously considered whether this language imposes \u201ctort liability,\u201d this Court has implicitly recognized that the elements necessary to establish entitlement to relief under this provision are essentially the same elements necessary to establish a tort, i.e., a legal duty, breach of that duty, causation, and injury. In <em>Holland v Weed,</em><footnotemark><em>56</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for example, we explained that the predecessor of MCL 600.1721</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">authorizes this imposition [of indemnification damages] in place of a fine, and it is for the purpose of protecting the civil rights and remedies of the party, and to <em>compensate him for the injury or loss occasioned by the misconduct alleged-, </em>and it is only when an actual loss or injury has been produced to the party by the misconduct alleged, and that is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court, and some sum sufficient to compensate the party or indemnify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>him is adjudged, that the court can impose the costs and expenses to be paid by such party.[<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Stated differently, the plain language of MCL 600.1721 requires a showing of contemptuous misconduct that caused the person seeking indemnification to suffer a loss or injury and, if these elements are established, requires the court to order the contemnor to pay <em>\u201ca </em>sufficient sum to indemnify\u201d the person for the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">A closer examination of the statutory language confirms that it contains all the elements of a tort claim in the guise of a contempt claim. Under the first sentence of the statute, the \u201calleged misconduct,\u201d which is a necessary element of any contempt claim, stems from the \u201cneglect or violation of [a] duty\u201d under MCL 600.1701 or the \u201comission to perform an act or duty\u201d under MCL 600.1715. Thus, the \u201calleged misconduct\u201d is synonymous with the legal duty and breach of that duty recognized in traditional tort law. Clearly, this misconduct, which arises from the relevant contempt statute \u2014 not a contractual relationship between the parties \u2014 is a non-contractual civil wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Because the nature of the duty that gives rise to a civil contempt claim is clearly premised on a noncon-tractual civil wrong, we must further consider the nature of the liability imposed. The first sentence of MCL 600.1721 also requires that this misconduct \u201ccauseD\u201d the petitioner\u2019s \u201cactual loss or injury,\u201d thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>paralleling the other two elements recognized in a traditional tort claim: causation and damages. Because the first sentence of MCL 600.1721 authorizes a court to order a contemnor to \u201cindemnify\u201d the petitioner for the loss caused by the contemptuous misconduct, the statute clearly sanctions legal responsibility, or liability, in the form of compensatory damages.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Plainly, the first sentence of MCL 600.1721 contemplates what is, in essence, a tort suit for money damages.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Additional support for this conclusion is found in the second sentence of MCL 600.1721, which provides that \u201c[t]he payment and acceptance of this sum is an absolute bar to 'any action by the aggrieved party to recover damages for the loss or injury.\u201d That is, the Legislature expressly recognized that a civil contempt claim seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>indemnification damages functions as a substitute for any underlying claim and, thus, bars monetary recovery that could have been achieved in a separate cause of action. As the Legislature acknowledged, the statutory remedy, then, is effectively a proxy for a tort claim.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Given that the statutory language of MCL 600.1721 clearly permits the payment of compensatory damages to a petitioner for a noncontractual civil wrong, we thus hold that a civil contempt petition seeking indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721 seeks to impose \u201ctort liability.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> It follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that a party that elects to pursue the statutory remedy available under MCL 600.1721 will be barred from obtaining relief against governmental agencies because those entities are entitled to immunity from \u201ctort liability\u201d under MCL 691.1407(1) of the GTLA. The logical result of this conclusion is that courts are prohibited from exercising their contempt powers by punishing a governmental agency\u2019s contemptuous conduct through an award of indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Our holding, however, should not be interpreted as constraining courts\u2019 inherent contempt powers. While our holding does constrain a court\u2019s <em>statutory </em>authority to order punishment, in the form of compensation in a civil contempt proceeding against a governmental entity,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> our holding does not infringe on those powers of contempt that are <em>inherent </em>in the judiciary, as recognized in our Constitution and codified by the Legislature.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Inherent in the judicial power is the power to prescribe <em>acts </em>that are punishable as contempt through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>fine or imprisonment, or both.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This inherent judicial power to punish contempt, which is essential to the administration of the law, does not include the power to mete out certain punishments for contemptuous acts beyond those contempt powers inherent in the judiciary.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Clearly, the punishment the Legislature authorized in MCL 600.1721, compensation for contemptuous misconduct, is not encompassed by the judiciary\u2019s inherent power to punish contempt. Because our holding only involves the GTLA\u2019s application to civil contempt petitions that seek indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721, it does not infringe on courts\u2019 inherent power to punish contempt by fine or impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>onment, or both.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Moreover, our definition of \u201ctort liability\u201d does not encompass contempt proceedings that seek to invoke courts\u2019 inherent contempt powers; although those proceedings undoubtedly involve a non-contractual civil wrong, the sanction sought does not impose legal responsibility in the form of compensation for the harm done.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The civil contempt petition at issue here alleges that respondent negligently failed to execute the probate court\u2019s order, constituting contemptuous misconduct under MCL 600.1701. The petition alleges that this misconduct caused Bradley\u2019s suicide and seeks indemnification damages for his death under MCL 600.1721. Notably, the damages petitioner seeks in her contempt petition are exactly the same damages that petitioner sought under the wrongful death statute<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> in her previous lawsuit, which was dismissed on governmental immunity grounds. Indeed, the petition substantively replicated petitioner\u2019s prior complaint and sought dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ages \u201cincluding, but not limited to, all of those damages set forth in the Michigan Wrongful Death Statute.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Through her civil contempt petition, then, petitioner plainly seeks compensatory damages for Bradley\u2019s death. Thus, her civil contempt petition seeks to impose tort liability.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Had petitioner sought to invoke the probate court\u2019s inherent contempt powers, i.e., to fine or imprison a contemnor, or had petitioner otherwise established the applicability of an exception to governmental immunity, then petitioner\u2019s claim might have survived summary disposition. However, petitioner\u2019s civil contempt petition did not invoke the court\u2019s inherent powers of contempt, and she concedes that none of the GTLA\u2019s exceptions are applicable. Consequently, because a civil contempt petition seeking indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721 seeks to impose tort liability, and respondent is immune from tort liability, petitioner\u2019s claim is barred by governmental immunity under MCL 691.1407(1). Respondent is therefore entitled to summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">IV .CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent, our decision clarifies that the phrase \u201ctort liability\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(1) encompasses all legal responsibility arising from noncontractual civil wrongs for which a remedy may be obtained in the form of compensatory damages. We further recognize that the plain language of MCL 600.1721 authorizes an award of indemnification damages to remedy a noncontractual civil wrong and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>falls squarely within the meaning of \u201ctort liability.\u201d Because MCL 691.1407(1) immunizes governmental agencies from tort liability, governmental entities are immune from civil contempt petitions seeking indemnification damages. Petitioner has pleaded such a claim here and because she has not otherwise established the applicability of an exception to the GTLA, respondent is entitled to immunity under MCL 691.1407(1). We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the probate court for entry of an order granting summary disposition in favor of respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-4\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Zahra, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> The investigation revealed that the sergeant who initially received the order could not execute it because she was on duty alone.

Stated otherwise, a civil contempt petition seeking indemnification damages under MCL 600.1721 does not seek to redress the harm a court may have suffered as a result of the contemptuous act; rather, such a petition seeks to compensate the person who suffered injury from that civil wrong, and therefore the petition is squarely within the meaning of \u201ctort liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> Justice McCormack does not analyze the express statutory language of MCL 600.1721 and instead relies on a series of inferences to discern the meaning of the law. Specifically, Justice McCormack reads MCL 600.1701(c) as an express indication that the Legislature intended to waive any claim that government eontemnors are immune from liability for civil contempt indemnification damages. However, the express statutory language of MCL 600.1701 does not include \u201cdefendant,\u201d as that term is used in MCL 600.1721, among the listed state actors, and we would draw no such inference. Compare MCL 600.1721 and MCL 600.1701 with other statutes expressly waiving governmental immunity, including the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2103(g), MCL 37.2201(a), and MCL 37.2202 (defining \u201cemployer\u201d to expressly include state actors who are in turn liable for certain discriminatory conduct); and the Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.1103(g), MCL 37.1201(b), and MCL 37.1202 (same). Nor do we view MCL 691.1407(6), as Justice McCormack does, to inform the meaning of \u201ctort liability\u201d used in MCL 691.1407(1). MCL 691.1407(6), which grants immunity to guardian ad litems from \u201ccivil liability,\u201d is simply not implicated in this case.

Justice McCormack concedes that the Legislature can regulate the courts\u2019 contempt powers. As <em>Nichols </em>and <em>Langdon </em>reflect, this regulation includes the ability to prescribe certain punishments, like that in MCL 600.1721, as long as the regulation does not curtail courts\u2019 inherent power to punish contemptuous acts. As such, injection of separation of powers principles is misplaced.

Thus, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">I. OVERVIEW OF CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty, </em>429 Mich 81, 104-107; 413 NW2d 392 (1987), we considered whether \u201canticipatory contempt\u201d was a proper use of the court\u2019s contempt power, holding that the future intent to violate a court order was not subject to the court\u2019s contempt power. That issue is not present in this case; however, <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty </em>is helpful because it provides an excellent analysis of the sui generis nature of contempt proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91. Specifically, <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty </em>recognized that \u201ccontempts are \u2018neither wholly civil nor altogether criminal....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, quoting <em>Gompers v Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co, </em>221 US 418, 441; 31 S Ct 492; 55 L Ed 797 (1911). Further, we explained that it is often necessary to characterize a contempt proceeding as criminal or civil and that the determining difference is the character and purpose of the punishment imposed on the contemnor. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93, quoting <em>Gompers, </em>221 US at 441 (\u201c \u2018If it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">To aid courts in characterizing civil and criminal contempt proceedings, <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty </em>explained that the process is civil if the contemnor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>refuses to do an act ordered by the court, whereas the process is criminal if the contemnor commits a forbidden act. <em>Id. </em>at 94-96, quoting <em>Gompers, </em>221 US at 443, and <em>People ex rel Attorney General v Yarowsky, </em>236 Mich 169, 171-172; 210 NW 246 (1926). The purpose of criminal contempt is to penalize and \u201coperateG <em>in terrorem </em>... to prevent a repetition of the offense in similar cases,\u201d and the purpose of civil contempt is to coerce the contemnor to comply with the court\u2019s order for the benefit of the opposing party. <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty, </em>429 Mich at 95-96 (quotation marks and citations omitted). <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty </em>acknowledged, however, that \u201cthere are two types of civil contempt sanctions, coercive and compensatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. The purpose <em>of </em>the compensatory fine in a civil contempt proceeding is to compensate the complainant. <em>Id. </em>at 98. The complainant\u2019s \u201c \u2018right, as a civil litigant, to the compensatory fine is dependent upon the outcome of the basic controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 US 258, 303-304; 67 S Ct 677; 91 L Ed 884 (1947). <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty, </em>429 Mich at 98, concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">there are three sanctions which may be available to a court to remedy or redress contemptuous behavior: (1) criminal punishment to vindicate the court\u2019s authority; (2) coercion, to force compliance with the order; and (3) compensatory relief to the complainant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">II. A COMPENSATORY CONTEMPT SANCTION IS NOT \u201cTORT LIABILITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">I agree with the majority that a proper analysis of this case should begin by defining \u201ctort liability\u201d for the purposes of MCL 691.1407(1), and, next, it must be determined whether a compensatory sanction for civil contempt constitutes tort liability. Further, I appreciate the majority\u2019s thoughtful approach to providing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>common-law definition of \u201ctort\u201d as \u201ca civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 384. Most importantly, I agree with the majority that \u201cour focus must be on the <em>nature </em>of the liability rather than the type of action pleaded,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 387, and the first focus should be \u201con the nature of the duty that gives rise to the claim,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Under MCL 600.1721, \u201cany person\u201d who suffers \u201cactual loss or injury\u201d caused by the defendant\u2019s \u201calleged misconduct\u201d may file a petition or motion seeking remedial relief in the form of a compensatory contempt sanction. As the majority acknowledges, the reference in MCL 600.1721 to \u201calleged misconduct\u201d illustrates that such a petition or motion is based on the general contempt statute, MCL 600.1701. Thus, without an act of contempt, there is no basis for liability under MCL 600.1721. At its core, a contemptuous act is an \u201cact of disobedience\u201d to the <em>court\u2019s </em>\u201cordinary exercise of <em>its </em>duties,\u201d and, \u201c[w]ithout authority to act promptly and independently the courts could not administer public justice or enforce the rights of private litigants.\u201d <em>Gompers, </em>221 US at 450, citing <em>Bessette v W B Conkey Co, </em>194 US 324; 24 S Ct 665; 48 L Ed 997 (1904). Despite the fact that a compensatory sanction based on civil contempt is <em>primarily </em>remedial in nature,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> i.e., it \u201cis for the purpose of protecting the civil rights and remedies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the party, and to compensate him for the injury or loss by the misconduct alleged,\u201d <em>Holland v Weed, </em>87 Mich 584, 587-588; 49 NW 877 (1891), the liability imposed nevertheless arises from the party\u2019s disobedience to a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">As a result, I disagree with the majority that the \u201calleged misconduct,\u201d which serves as the basis for liability under MCL 600.1721, is \u201csynonymous\u201d with a traditional tort duty and its breach. <em>Ante </em>at 391. This is because, generally stated, liability arising from tortious conduct stems from a breach of one\u2019s duty to another, not the breach of an obligation owed to the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, as Justice MCCORMACK astutely explains, there may be civil wrongs that are neither a tort nor a contract. See <em>post </em>at 407-408. Indeed, a \u201ccivil wrong\u201d may be defined as \u201c[a] violation of noncriminal law, <em>such as </em>a tort, a breach of contract or trust, a breach of statutory duty, or a defect in performing a public duty; the breach of a legal duty treated as the subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of a civil proceeding.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed), p 1751 (emphasis added). A petition or motion for a compensatory contempt sanction could be classified as a claim based on a civil wrong in that it is based on a breach of a legal duty owed to the court; however, I disagree with the majority that the fact that a noncontractual civil wrong is at issue means that tort liability is imposed. See <em>ante </em>at 391. Rather, I think that the nature of the legal duty is relevant. In other words, I do not think that simply because a civil legal duty <em>exists </em>and is not a contractual duty, that a breach of that duty necessarily imposes tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Because the \u201calleged misconduct\u201d under MCL 600.1721 is distinguishable from tortious conduct, the compensatory quality of tort damages and of a contempt sanction imposed under MCL 600.1721 is the only potentially relevant similarity shared by the two types of liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While I agree with the majority that the purpose of the relief sought may be a relevant inquiry when determining whether a type of liability is tort liability for the purposes of the GTLA, the nature of the remedy sought should not be <em>dispositive </em>when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>analyzing a claim for purposes of MCL 691.1407(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, I do not think that a compensatory contempt sanction imposes tort liability simply because it may serve a similar remedial purpose as tort damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">I also think that, in certain circumstances, characterizing a compensatory contempt sanction as serving a compensatory purpose <em>to the exclusion of any other purpose </em>may oversimplify the nature of the contempt proceeding itself. See <em>Gompers, </em>221 US at 443 (recognizing the \u201cincidental effect[s],\u201d i.e., the overlapping purposes, of civil and criminal contempt). Specifically, I think that when a party subject to a court order has the <em>present </em>obligation and ability to comply, the prospect of a compensatory sanction may work hand-in-hand with coercive monetary sanctions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the purpose of the sanction is to make a party or person comply, the trial court, in exercising its discretion, must \u2018consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>character and magnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy, and the probable effectiveness of any suggested sanction in bringing about the result desired.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Moroun, </em>295 Mich App 312, 337; 814 NW2d 319 (2012), quoting <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty, </em>429 Mich at 98, quoting <em>United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 US at 304 (quotation marks omitted). In my view, the compensatory contempt sanction, which is measured by the actual loss caused by the contemptuous conduct, serves a similar purpose as a coercive contempt sanction; the primary difference is that the former is retrospective, whereas the latter is prospective. A coercive contempt sanction attempts to <em>avoid </em>actual loss altogether by sanctioning present noncompliance, while a compensatory contempt sanction reimburses a petitioner\u2019s actual loss. Practically speaking, the possibility that the contumacious party may still be sanctioned after his or her ability to comply with the order has expired, will encourage the contumacious party to comply with the court order <em>before </em>his or her ability to do so has expired.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>To conclude, I would hold that the contemptuous act itself is an integral part of imposing liability under MCL 600.1721, and the duty one owes to a court is distinguishable from a tort duty. While the common-law definition of \u201ctort\u201d is admittedly broad, holding that a compensatory contempt sanction amounts to \u201ctort liability\u201d unreasonably stretches the traditionally understood concept of a \u201ctort\u201d claim by not appreciating that a tort duty is not simply <em>any </em>noncontractual civil duty imposed by the law. Thus, I would conclude that the Legislature, when granting immunity from tort liability under the GTLA, did not intend that governmental defendants would be immune from compensatory contempt sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> MCL 600.1721 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">If the alleged misconduct has caused an actual loss or injury to any person the court shall order the defendant to pay such person a sufficient sum to indemnify him, in addition to the other penalties which are imposed upon the defendant.

The fact that a compensatory contempt sanction, referred to as a \u201csum\u201d in the statute, bars a subsequent action at law does not mean that the Legislature likened the two forms of liability. Rather, in my view, the Legislature realized that a compensatory contempt sanction has a similar remedial purpose to tort liability and, thus, the Legislature decided to bar actions at law to avoid providing a windfall to a petitioner under MCL 600.1721.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\"> Like the majority, I disagree with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it held that the nature of the damages sought in an action has \u201cno role in determining whether the action is barred by the GTLA.\u201d <em>In re Bradley Estate, </em>296 Mich App 31, 39; 815 NW2d 799 (2012). But I agree with the Court of Appeals to the extent it explained that, when analyzing whether a compensatory contempt sanction falls within the scope of tort liability under MCL 691.1407(1), the inquiry depends on whether the \u201ccontempt action is a cause of action that is <em>separate and distinct </em>from one that is <em>grounded </em>in tort liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Additionally, I do not find relevant the majority\u2019s statement that the GTLA grants immunity from \u201ctort liability,\u201d while not expressly referring to a \u201ctort duty.\u201d It goes without saying that in order for a tort or liability resulting from a tort to exist, a tort <em>duty </em>must exist; thus, in my view, the majority\u2019s analysis appears to rest on the fact that petitioner seeks remedial relief under MCL 600.1721.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\"> See <em>In re Contempt of Dougherty, </em>429 Mich at 99 (stating that \u201ca coercive sanction is proper where the contemnor, at the time of the contempt hearing, is under a present duty to comply with the order and is in <em>present violation </em>of the order\u201d); <em>DeGeorge v Warheit, </em>276 Mich App 587, 592; 741 NW2d 384 (2007) (\u201cCivil contempt proceedings seek compliance through the imposition of sanctions of indefinite duration, terminable upon the contemnor\u2019s compliance or inability to comply.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b503-4\"> As the majority notes, governmental defendants are not typically immune from equitable suits. See <em>ante </em>at 389 n 54. As a result, I question whether it may be an unforeseen consequence of the majority\u2019s holding to immunize governmental defendants from compensatory contempt sanctions when those defendants are <em>not </em>immune from the imposition of an equitable order. Indeed, the losses recovered under MCL 600.1721 typically arise from a violation of such an equitable order, not from a wrong that may be remedied with tort damages. Moreover, I think that the Legislature, through the enactment of MCL 600.1721, has recognized that it would be unjust to preclude the recovery of losses sustained simply because the contemnor is not under a present duty to comply with the court order. The majority asserts that because MCL 600.1721 allows \u201cany person\u201d to petition or move for a compensatory contempt sanction, the purpose of the statute is to compensate a private individual. That may be a purpose of the statute, but, in my view, the majority oversimplifies the context of when a petition or motion under MCL 600.1721 may be brought and ignores that any loss covered by the statute was sustained as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>a result of a violation of a court order. For that reason, I think that a motion or petition brought under MCL 600.1721 is simply too far removed from the common-law understanding of tort liability to conclude that the Legislature, when enacting the GTLA, thought of a compensatory contempt sanction as imposing tort liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b504-4\">McCormack, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALZ\">(dissenting). The majority holds that the governmental tort liability act\u2019s (GTLA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grant of immunity to governmental agencies from \u201ctort liability,\u201d as referred to in MCL 691.1407(1), applies to civil contempt. The majority\u2019s analysis rests entirely on two closely related propositions. First, the GTLA grants immunity from legal responsibility arising from a tort. I agree. Second, all noncontractual civil wrongs, including civil contempt, are torts. I respectfully disagree. Civil contempt does not sound in tort, and contempt sanctions of any kind simply do not impose tort liability. Furthermore, and not surprisingly, the GTLA does not provide any basis for concluding that our Legislature intended to grant immunity for contempt of court. Nor does the contempt statute, MCL 600.1701, provide any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>basis for concluding that governmental actors are not subject to all of its remedies. Because I believe that the majority confuses legal categories, and in light of the plain meaning of both the GTLA and the contempt statute, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">I. CIVIL LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">A. AN ABBREVIATED TAXONOMY OF \u201cCIVIL WRONGS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Very generally speaking, there are two categories of legal wrongs that may result in civil liability. One category encompasses acts that violate a <em>personal </em>right, which includes the common-law subjects of property, tort, contract, trust, and restitution. A second category encompasses acts not against the person, but rather against the <em>sovereign, </em>or acts against interests the sovereign deems worthy of protection. These acts are the subject of environmental law, securities law, and consumer law, to name a few. These examples are hardly exhaustive. But they suffice to show that the legal system imposes liability in a wide variety of contexts, either to address harms committed against citizens or, instead, to enforce rules imposed by the state or its subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The majority begins its analysis by examining case-law and legal dictionaries in search of a definition of the term \u201ctort.\u201d It ultimately articulates this one: \u201ca civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of compensatory damages.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this definition offers little guidance, first because \u201ccivil wrong\u201d is itself a term of art and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>moreover, because, as noted in the previous paragraph, there are many noncontractual civil wrongs that are <em>not </em>torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The English legal tradition recognized courts of \u201claw,\u201d the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and \u201cequity,\u201d the Court of Chancery. Though complementary, the two operated separately and independently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our modern system has abolished these distinctions, but has adopted aspects of and rules from both.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Civil liability sounding in neither contract nor tort is not uncommon. Breach of trust, for example, has its roots in the rules of equity and the Court of Chancery, separate and distinct from both contract and tort.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A trustee relationship imposes fiduciary duties, the breach of which results in liability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Though trust law can well be understood as a half sibling of contract law, it cannot be reduced to contract. A breach of trust stems not from the violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of a bargained-for-exchange, but rather from duties arising out of the special relationship of the parties. That is, it was not considered a tort, and at common law the only available remedy was in equity. Another example is provided by the law of restitution and unjust enrichment. It is based on principles of equity; it sounds in neither contract nor tort, yet it shares characteristics of both. Restitution recognizes the need for compensation in instances when the receipt and retention of a benefit by a person without payment made to the person providing that benefit would result in injustice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consider also easements by prescription. An action to establish a prescriptive easement certainly cannot be recognized as based in contract because permissive use destroys the claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor is it based in tort. Like actions to quiet title, actions for a prescriptive easement are equitable in nature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> State and governmental entities are immune from prescriptive easements not because of the broad language of the GTLA. Rather, that immunity is conferred by an exception to the statute of limitations for actions for recovery or possession of real property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Our legal system imposes liability in many other contexts as well, even apart from the criminal justice system. A familiar example would be civil infractions. A parking ticket results in a legal obligation to pay money. But a parking infraction is not a tort, a breach of contract, or a crime. It is simply a municipal ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>violation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And perhaps the most essential power of any government \u2014 the power to tax \u2014 imposes legal obligations. Yet, again, tax liability does not sound in either tort or contract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A comprehensive discussion of these two subjects is beyond the scope of this dissent. But both civil infractions and tax law impose civil liability in ways different from tort or contract. The obligations they impose serve to vindicate the interests of the sovereign. They do not serve to vindicate personal rights; they are not mechanisms for righting private wrongs or securing compliance to a mutual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">B. THE NATURE OF TORTS</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">William Prosser once observed that \u201ca really satisfactory definition of a tort is yet to be found. The numerous attempts which have been made to define the term have succeeded only in achieving language so broad that it includes other matters than torts, or else so narrow that it leaves out some torts themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Fundamentally, a tort action protects a person\u2019s interest in a range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>of personal interests: physical security and autonomy;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> emotional security and other intangible interests, such as privacy and reputation;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and personal economic security and opportunity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While tort liability may lead to relief in the form of compensatory money damages, this is not the only remedy available for tortious conduct. A tortfeasor may be restrained by an injunction, and may be liable for restitution, punitive, or nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Moreover, compensatory damages are not unique to tort law. Compensatory damages are a common remedy in actions based in contract, for example, as expectation or consequential damages. Or for an example closer to contempt, our Legislature has even provided for compensatory damages for victims of crime in the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In short, tort liability does not hinge on an award of compensatory damages, and the availability of compensatory damages is not unique to tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Rather, the sine qua non of a tort is the breach of a duty owed to a fellow citizen. And, although tort liability has been extended to some extent in recent decades with increased reliance on doctrines like public nui-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sanee, classic tort liability is rooted in the common-law duties all citizens owe to one another.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">C. CONTEMPT OF COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Contempt of court is altogether different. It stems from a violation of an obligation owed not to any person, but to the court itself. Contempt does not serve to protect private rights; it serves to protect the power of the courts. Contempt has been described as a \u201cpower of self-defense,\u201d intended to sanction \u201cthose who interfere with the orderly conduct of [court] business or disobey orders necessary to the conduct of that business ... .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This purpose \u2014 to protect the power of the judiciary \u2014 is evidenced not only by modern cases, but also by contempt\u2019s historical roots. It comes as no surprise that contempt of court is not discussed in <em>any </em>leading tort treatise, nor is it discussed within the comprehensive framework of tort law by the Restatement, two observations which further reveal the majority\u2019s error.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The common law did <em>not </em>consider contempt a tort, and the Queen\u2019s Bench would not have understood it as such. Rather, contempt of court was viewed at common law as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>criminal </em>in nature.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While modern cases distinguish civil .contempt,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and though indemnification damages in a contempt proceeding may resemble tort damages in certain respects, labeling contempt a tort is to ignore fundamental differences between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Implicit in the majority\u2019s analysis is that all legal wrong fits neatly into one of three categories: criminal, contractual, or tortious. The law is not so neat. Modern Michigan cases have recognized contempt proceedings as \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d in nature.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nor is Michigan alone. The United States Supreme Court has described contempt proceedings as <em>\u201csui </em>generis\u2014 neither civil actions nor prosecutions for offenses, within the ordinary meaning of those terms \u2014 and exertions of the power inherent in all courts to enforce obedience, something they must possess in order properly to perform their functions.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> They \u201care neither wholly civil nor altogether criminal.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Rather, an act of contempt \u201cmay partake of the characteristics of both.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>As this discussion demonstrates, courts have often struggled to classify contempt as anything but <em>sui generis. </em>While modern cases label contempt as either \u201ccivil\u201d or \u201ccriminal,\u201d this distinction does not lead to the conclusion that civil contempt is a tort. The distinction between criminal and civil contempt has not always been clear,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but the dividing line has focused on the nature of the punishment or sanction.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> But no matter the label, even \u201cif the case is civil and the punishment is purely remedial, there is also a vindication of the court\u2019s authority.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Though different labels may be applied, at its core a contempt action is fundamental to a court\u2019s power to effectuate its orders.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">D. A TORT BY ANY OTHER NAME?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">A more apt comparison for contempt of court can be found not in tort law, but instead in the various legal sanctions provided by our court rules. Like the contempt power, these sanctions serve to enforce the orderliness of court proceedings. Sometimes, courts may impose the equivalent of compensatory damages for a violation of the court rules, such as when a party who files vexatious pleadings or makes vexatious discovery demands is sanctioned by having to pay the other party\u2019s costs. But these are not tort damages, nor are they unavailable against municipal litigants under the GTLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The majority cites several cases in which courts have drawn analogies between civil contempt and tort in support of its conclusion that civil contempt is a tort.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> These cases do not support the majority\u2019s conclusion; they suggest only that a civil contempt petition is <em>analogous </em>to a tort claim. But the majority offers these cases in support of the separate proposition that civil contempt is a tort.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Analogies are by definition comparable, but not interchangeable. They are related, but they are not equivalent. The majority is correct that one analogous feature of these two distinct civil wrongs is that both can result in compensatory liability. But the similarity ends there. Tort law imposes a duty to avoid harmful conduct deemed tortious. Contempt law imposes a duty to obey the court. These duties are fundamentally different, as are their origins, and the purposes they serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Even assuming, purely for argument\u2019s sake, that a similarity to tort were sufficient to subject civil contempt to the same immunity rules as tort, I believe that the Legislature has foreclosed that immunity here. For while I agree with the majority that contempt sanctions are not among the five statutory exceptions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>GTLA\u2019s grant of immunity, the GTLA does not apply in cases in which a separate statute gives rise to direct evidence that the Legislature intended to waive the state\u2019s immunity to liability.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The contempt statute specifically includes \u201c[a]ll attorneys, counselors, clerks, registers, <em>sheriffs, </em>coroners, and all other persons in any manner elected or appointed to perform any judicial or ministerial services\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> as those subject to the court\u2019s contempt power. By specifically including these governmental actors as among those who may be deemed contemnors, the Legislature has waived any claim that they are immune from contempt liability. Further, the contempt statute does not distinguish among those parties to which its various sanctions, including indemnification damages, apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">II. STATUTORY INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">I believe the majority\u2019s premise that contempt is a tort leads it to gloss over the relevant statutory texts too quickly. The express language of both the GTLA and the contempt statute undermines the majority\u2019s conclusion that the GTLA is intended to grant governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>agencies immunity from compensatory contempt sanctions. The GTLA does not refer to contempt explicitly or implicitly, and, likewise, the contempt statute does not refer to governmental immunity in any way. Given that contempt remedies are not generally understood to be \u201ctort\u201d damages, surely the Legislature would have made its intentions clear if it had sought to include contempt remedies in the immunity statute. As previously noted, certain governmental actors <em>are </em>specifically included as within the scope of the contempt statute,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> establishing that governmental actors <em>can </em>be held in contempt. Further, the compensatory remedy of the contempt statute does not limit against whom indemnification damages apply.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The GTLA itself demonstrates that the Legislature knew how to use different language when it intended to grant immunity beyond tort liability. MCL 691.1407(1), which the majority relies on, states that \u201ca governmental agency is immune from <em>tort </em>liability if the governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In MCL 691.1407(6), however, the GTLA does not use the term \u201ctort liability,\u201d but instead states that \u201c[a] guardian ad litem is immune from <em>civil </em>liability for an injury to a person or damage to property if he or she is acting within the scope of his or her authority as guardian ad litem.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Because \u201cliability for an injury to a person or damage to property\u201d encompasses tort liability, the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201ccivil liability\u201d in \u00a7 1407(6) suggests a broader scope of immunity than that found in \u00a7 1407(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>When the Legislature uses different words in the same statute, they should be assigned different meanings whenever possible.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The codification of the contempt power underscores the same conclusion. The Legislature did not use the word \u201ctort\u201d to describe the conduct it prohibits in the contempt statute. It did not use the word \u201ctort\u201d to describe the available sanctions. And there is more support: The Legislature did not include contempt in chapter 29 of the Revised Judicature Act, \u201cProvisions Concerning Specific Actions,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> a chapter codifying miscellaneous tort actions including malpractice,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> defamation,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and damage or waste to land.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Rather, contempt is given its own chapter, in keeping with its unique nature.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Further, refusing to apply the GTLA here will not negatively impact the functioning of governmental agencies because governmental actors, I believe, generally avoid behavior \u201cdirectly tending to interrupt [court] proceedings,\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> do not habitually engage in \u201cwillful neglect or violation of duty,\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and generally refrain from \u201cdisobeying any lawful order, decree, or process of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Even given the egregious facts of this case, respondent vigorously contests whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>contempt finding was proper. Respondent argues that there was no willful violation of the probate court order and, assuming there was, that indemnification damages were nevertheless improper because there was no causal link between the contempt and Bradley\u2019s suicide.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> These would be issues worthy of consideration on remand if my position prevailed and they provide additional hurdles that might prove fatal to petitioner\u2019s claim for indemnification damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">III. THE INHERENT POWER OF THE JUDICIARY</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Finally, the majority\u2019s analysis concludes that the GTLA\u2019s immunity grant to contemnors is not an infringement on the court\u2019s inherent contempt power because the GTLA only applies to the contempt remedies provided by the Revised Judicature Act,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> but not to the judiciary\u2019s \u201cinherent contempt power,\u201d which the majority concludes is limited to coercive fines and imprisonment. While my analysis does not rest on this distinction, I believe the majority fails to satisfactorily explain why any particular remedy, and indemnification damages in particular, is somehow outside the Court\u2019s inherent contempt power, except, perhaps, because this sanction is codified in the Revised Judicature Act.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> That codification would render the remedy not part of the court\u2019s inherent power is inconsistent with both this Court\u2019s past pronouncement that contempt statutes are \u201cmerely declaratory of what the law was before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>its passage,\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and, as the majority concedes,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> with the fact that indemnification damages have been recognized by Michigan contempt statutes dating back well before adoption of the 1963 Constitution.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> And while it has been recognized that the Legislature can regulate the court\u2019s exercise of the contempt power, that regulation cannot abridge or, crucially, curtail the power.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> An intrusion of that nature into the courts\u2019 inherent powers would violate the separation-of-powers principle.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> But the majority fails to acknowledge this principle, or explain how the removal of an entire class of sanctions is merely regulatory and not instead a curtailment.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> If, counterfactually, the GTLA expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>prohibited indemnification damages as a remedy for contempt of court, that restriction would be, at the least, constitutionally questionable. The very fact that legislative restrictions on judicial powers raise constitutional questions is another reason not to interpret the GTLA as having done so. It is well established that courts should construe acts of the Legislature to avoid constitutional questions whenever possible.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">I agree with the majority\u2019s basic premise that \u201ctort liability\u201d refers to \u201clegal responsibility arising from a tort.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Because I conclude that contempt <em>of court </em>is not a tort, no matter what remedy for contempt is imposed, I would not interpret the GTLA as granting immunity to governmental agencies from contempt sanctions under MCL 600.1721. Whether petitioner here can demonstrate that respondent\u2019s conduct was a legal cause of Stephen Bradley\u2019s death, whether his death constitutes an \u201cactual loss or injury\u201d to petitioner within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>meaning of MCL 600.1721, or, as a threshold matter, whether a finding of contempt here was proper, are issues not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The practical import of this case is probably limited, given that civil contempt is fairly rare and that the facts of a case giving rise to the possibility of indemnification damages for civil contempt are rarer still. But the underlying principles are important. As a matter of good doctrinal bookkeeping, civil contempt is not the same as tort, and civil contempt penalties are not the same as tort liability. Although the majority is correct that, as it happens, petitioner seeks indemnification under the contempt statute after having been denied a claim for wrongful death, the majority\u2019s holding will also apply to future cases in which, unlike here, a governmental actor\u2019s contemptuous conduct has no obvious tort analogue simply because the sanction can be viewed as compensatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">But even beyond getting the basic legal categories here correct, this Court should be hesitant to cede the judiciary\u2019s power to impose exceptional remedies in those exceptional cases in which they may be warranted for failure to heed judicial orders. This Court should, instead, safeguard the power of the judicial branch. No other branch will.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the probate court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"> MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"><em> Ante </em>at 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> The majority\u2019s historical analysis, attempting to illustrate that at common law all civil wrongs were either contract or tort, relies only on <em>in personam </em>actions brought in courts of law and thereby misses the larger point.

They are separate legal theories, serving separate purposes, predicated on different wrongs. That, under the facts of this case, both may lead to a similar remedy does not make them the same.
