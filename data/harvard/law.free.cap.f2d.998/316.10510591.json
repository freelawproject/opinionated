HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">For some maritime cargo, the perils of the shoreward leg of its journey rival those of the sea. When a large printing press was discharged at the Port of Houston, its land transport capsized. Then the cargo was pushed aside to clear the wharf, with more damage. The cargo\u2019s shipper, Rockwell International, sued the carrier, stevedore, and port authority to recover the cost of repairing its press.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">Rockwell contracted for the transport of a large printing press transported from Germany to Texas. Its components were packed into forty-five crates for the voyage from Bremerhaven to Houston aboard the container ship M/V Incotrans Spirit. Intercontinental Transport (ICT) B.V. owns and Incotrans Gulf Europe. Service operates the Incotrans Spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">In February 1989, the district court granted Fairway and Incotrans\u2019 motions for partial summary judgment, limiting their liability to $500 per package pursuant to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1304(5). <em>See Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. M/V Incotrans Spirit, </em>707 F.Supp. 272 (S.D.Tex.1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court later held that the Port Authority\u2019s liability was limited to $100,-000 under the Texas Tort Claims Act. A bench trial was held in September 1992. The district court found that Fairway failed to perform its stevedore services in a workmanlike manner by failing to follow Incotrans\u2019 instructions and failing to discharge all three crates by the break bulk method. The court found that the damage was caused 50% by Fairway\u2019s conduct and 50% by the Port Authority\u2019s conduct. It concluded that Incotrans engaged in no act or omission that caused damage to the cargo. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">Incotrans issued a clean bill of lading for pier to pier shipment with a Himalaya clause extending its defenses and protections to the carrier\u2019s agents and contractors. It was silent regarding the means of loading or unloading the cargo. Rockwell did not declare the value of the cargo on the bill of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-20\">This ease concerns damage to two of three Rockwell crates loaded upon a flatrack container in Bremerhaven. A flatrack is a rectangular bed with headboards at each end but no walls along its length. Two of the crates weighed over 18,000 kilograms and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>placed at either end of the flatrack. The third crate weighed 1810 kilograms and was placed in the middle of the flatrack.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Incotrans prepared written discharge instructions for this flatrack and sent those instructions to its agent in Houston. The instructions noted the flatrack\u2019s weight and directed that one of the heavier crates be removed separate from the flatrack by the break bulk discharge method. Incotrans\u2019 stowage planner faxed these instructions to Fairway Stevedores and discussed them with a Fairway superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">When <em>M/V </em>Incotrans Spirit arrived in Houston, Fairway discharged its cargo. The flatrack was unloaded late in the afternoon of Saturday, June 21, 1986. When discharging the flatrack, Fairway did not follow the Inco-trans\u2019 instruction to remove one of the heavier crates from it. The stevedores removed only the center, lightest crate from the fla-track. Witnesses testified that following In-cotrans\u2019 instructions precisely would have unbalanced the flatrack from end to end. So unbalanced, it would be difficult to lift by crane and might damage the ship or cargo. Fairway removed the flatrack still bearing both of the heavier crates.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">When the flatrack was placed upon a chassis on the wharf and released from the crane, the chassis, flatrack, and both crates fell over. This fall damaged components in the crates.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Fairway and Incotrans left the crates where they fell, intending to move them with additional equipment on Monday, June 23. Before then, 'however, the Port of Houston Authority decided to clear the wharf. Monday morning, the Port Authority used forklifts to push and drag the capsized crates fifty feet. Forklift blades punctured the walls of the crates. The result of all this was a repair bill of $994,995.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">COGSA provides that carriers\u2019 liability for damaged goods shall not exceed $500 per package, unless the shipper declares the value of the goods and it is inserted in the bill of lading. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rockwell seeks to avoid this limitation by asserting that Fairway and Incotrans\u2019 \"conduct constituted a deviation from the terms of the bill of lading. <em>See Spartus Corp. v. S/S Yafo, </em>590 F.2d 1310 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that deviation renders . \u00a7 1304(5) inapplicable). The district court rejected this argument in its published ruling on motions for summary judgment. <em>M/V Incotrans Spirit, supra. </em>After the 1992 trial, the district court once again concluded that no act or omission of Incotrans or Fairway constituted a deviation that would abrogate the statutory limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">We affirm this ruling for essentially the reasons stated by the district court. Rockwell\u2019s attempt to recast negligence as a willful breach of implied contractual terms is to no avail. Incotrans, not Rockwell, gave the instructions Fairway failed to follow. The bill of lading is silent regarding the means of loading or unloading, the cargo. Nothing suggests that Rockwell contemplated any particular means of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">The pier-to-pier term of the bill of lading does not change the result. It extended the time during which the carrier and its stevedore agents were responsible for the cargo\u2019s safety, to the time that the cargo is delivered to the consignee or overland shipper. <em>See B. Elliott (Canada) Ltd. v. John T. Clark &amp; Son, </em>704 F.2d 1305, 1307 (4th Cir.1983). Without this provision, their responsibility would end upon the cargo\u2019s discharge from the ship. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1301(e). We agree that this provision gave Incotrans the authority to place the cargo in containers and load it upon the ship and to direct its discharge. We are not persuaded, however, that-this provision operates to incorporate the carrier\u2019s discharge instructions to its stevedore agent as part of the bill of lading. Nor does the expansion of time alter the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Marine insurance policies have changed with the development of the doctrine of deviation. Held covered clauses now protect shippers under most circumstances. At the same time, Congress has protected carriers under COGSA. The notion of non-geographie deviation may be \u201cof doubtful justice under modern conditions, of questionable status under Cogsa [sic], and of highly penal effect.\u201d Grant Gilmore and Charles L. Black, Jr., <em>The Law of Admiralty </em>\u00a7 3-42, at 183 (2d ed. 1975); <em>see also B.M.A. Industries, Ltd. v. Nigerian Star Line, Ltd., </em>786 F.2d 90, 92 (2d Cir.1986) (quoting Gilmore &amp; Black and refusing to expand doctrine). We decline to expand the doctrine to cover the facts presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Incotrans seeks indemnity of its costs of defense from Fairway and the Port Authority. The district court denied their recovery, but found that Incotrans\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in. defending against Rockwell claims, including this appeal, would total $38,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Incotrans points to the district court\u2019s holdings that Fairway breached its stevedore\u2019s warranty of workmanlike performance and that Incotrans lacked fault. The carrier argues that it is therefore entitled to indemnity by Fairway and the tortfeasor Port Authority for its defense costs pursuant to <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan Atlantic S.S. Co., </em>350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232,100 L.Ed. 133 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">This argument cannot escape <em>Bosnor, S.A. de C.V. v. Tug L.A. Barrios, </em>796 F.2d 776 (5th Cir.1986). In <em>Bosnor, </em>the stevedore improperly loaded steel pipe \u00e1board a barge. En route to Mexico with a time chartered tug, stanchions added by the stevedore to the barge broke and cargo went overboard. The trial court assessed fault to the stevedore, the crew of the tug, and the tug <em>in rem. </em>No' fault was attributed to the owner of the barge or the freight forwarder, to whom the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees under <em>Ryan. Id. </em>796 F.2d at 779-80. We reversed this award, rejecting the application of <em>Ryan </em>indemnification in favor of comparative fault principles. <em>Id. </em>796 F.2d at 784-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">As in <em>Bosnor, </em>the vessel owner in this case is without fault for the cargo casualty. Unable to distinguish <em>Bosnor </em>on its facts, Incotrans asks this court to reconsider that decision. It suggests that this court has improperly narrowed \u2014 if not eliminated \u2014 the stevedore\u2019s implied warranty of workmanlike performance without congressional or Supreme Court direction. Aside from being bound by our prior decision, we find no merit in this argument. The Supreme Court introduced comparative fault to the maritime field in <em>United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., </em>421 U.S. 397, 95 S.Ct. 1708, 44 L.Ed.2d 251 (1975); <em>see also Hardy v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>949 F.2d 826, 833 (5th Cir.1992). Although <em>Reliable Transfer </em>was a collision case, a,s Inco-trans emphasizes, we have read it to displace \u201ca plethora of tort indemnity theories\u201d except \u201c \u2018where proportionate degrees of fault cannot be measured and determined on a rational basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardy, </em>949 F.2d at 833 (quoting <em>Reliable Transfer, </em>421 U.S. at 405, 95 S.Ct. at 1713). We recognize that <em>Ryan </em>indemnification continues to exist, but are reluctant to expand it beyond the personal injury/seaworthiness context from which it arose. <em>Id. </em>at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Under <em>Bosnor, </em>although innocent of fault, Incotrans cannot recover indemnification of its defense costs from Fairway or the Port Authority. Finding the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine inapplicable, we need not address whether the Port Authority falls within its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Finally, Fairway contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that no fault of Incotrans contributed to the damage. The district court attributed 50% of the damage to Fairway\u2019s fault and the remainder to the Port Authority. Fairway maintains that Incotrans\u2019 faulty discharge instructions caused the initial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The district court\u2019s finding shall be not disturbed unless \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). If the district court\u2019s findings are plausible, we may not reverse even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>would have weighed the evidence differently. <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Noting that most of the testimony occurred by deposition, Fairway asserts that the clearly erroneous standard should be relaxed, citing <em>Connolly v. Transcon Lines, </em>583 F.2d 199, 202 (5th Cir.1978) (stating that standard \u201cis somewhat modified-where there is little or no \u2018live\u2019 testimony\u201d). <em>Connolly </em>goes on, however, to state that \u201cif the conclusions of the trial judge may reasonably be inferred from the record, such conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The district court found fault in Fairway\u2019s failure to follow Incotrans\u2019 instructions and failure to discharge the cargo in a break bulk manner. Fairway argues that Incotrans contributed to the overturning of the chassis and flatrack by failing to give proper instructions and misloading the flatrack. Witnesses testified that following Incotrans\u2019 instructions to remove one heavier crate would have threatened the ship and cargo by creating an end-to-end imbalance. Fairway also points to testimony that Incotrans\u2019 loading caused the flatrack to be imbalanced from side-to-side and to have.too high a center of gravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Incotrans replies by noting that its instructions were not followed \u2014 thus any flaws in them did not contribute to the accident. Fairway disregarded those instructions and chose the method that caused the accident by, inter alia, exceeding the weight capacity of the chassis it employed, There w\u00e1s testimony that the safest discharge method would have been to discharge all three crates by break bulk method. Fairway did not do so and the district court specifically found fault in this failure. Moreover, Incotrans points to the testimony of port captain Karl Platinga, repeating the opinion he expressed by letter to Incotrans that \u201cFairway Stevedores is fully responsible for the initial damage caused by tipping over the chassis, flatrack and cargo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Fairway has not demonstrated clear error in the fact findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-13\">. This ruling led to appeal No. 89-2237. Following our decision in another case, <em>Bucher-Guyer AG </em>v. <em>M/V Incotrans Spirit, 868 </em>F.2d 734 (5th Cir.1989), disallowing the interlocutory appeal of such COGSA rulings, No. 89-2237 was stayed pending the final judgment of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">.
