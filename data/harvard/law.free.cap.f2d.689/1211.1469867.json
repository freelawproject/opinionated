The district court denied attorney fees with an order merely stating that an award would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d On appeal, <em>Concerned Democrats of Florida v. Reno, </em>601 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1979), we vacated the denial and remanded for an appropriate award of fees or for a finding of special circumstances that would make an award unjust. On remand the district court has again denied attorney fees. 493 F.Supp. 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED. The plaintiffs are awarded fees in the amount of $3,262.50 for services performed prior to the first appeal, an amount suggested by them based upon time spent at $75.00 per hour, which under the circumstances of this case, bearing in mind the factors set out in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), is the minimum to which plaintiffs are entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">If the parties cannot agree upon attorney fees for the two appeals, plaintiffs may submit a motion for such fees, supported by affidavits, within 20 days from the date of this opinion, and respondents may file counter-affidavits and/or brief within 20 days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
