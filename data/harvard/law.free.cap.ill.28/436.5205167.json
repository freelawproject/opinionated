D. 1857.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-12\" pgmap=\"436\">On the 30th day of June, 1858, judgment by default, against Elston and Rose, impleaded with the other two defendants below, was entered, and the damages assessed by the court, and final judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff below for $10,975 damages, besides the costs, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-13\" pgmap=\"436\">None of the defendants appeared in the court below. The summons was served only upon Rose and Elston.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\" pgmap=\"437\">The plaintiffs in error insist that the judgment was too large by the sum of $13.87.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\" pgmap=\"437\">The judgment had been rendered nearly four years when this writ of \u00e9rror was sued out.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-6\" pgmap=\"437\">Burnham &amp; Martin, for Plaintiffs in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\" pgmap=\"437\">Cited, 3 Gilm. 637, 643; 4 Gilm. 79\u201483; 3 Scam. 195, 350; 24 Ill. 40\u201451; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 100; 4 Metc. 205.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-8\" pgmap=\"437\">\"Williams, Woodbridge &amp; Grant, for Defendant in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-9\" pgmap=\"437\">Cited, Sims v.

Hugsby, Breese (new ed.), 414, wherein this court said: If too large a judgment has been rendered against the appellant in the court below, his remedy is by motion there. The error complained of is rather the mistake of the clerk than the error of the court. In a case like the present, the law has assigned to the clerk the duty of assessing the damages, and if, in the discharge of that duty, he should allow either too much or too little, the court under whose direction it is made, will, upon motion, correct it. To that court, then, and not to this, the application should be made. So also in Smith v. Lusk, 3 Scam. 411. The cases cited by plaintiffs in error are all cases in which the recovery exceeded the damages claimed in the declaration. Here, the damages are within the claim, and the cases do not apply.</p> <p id=\"b437-11\" pgmap=\"437\">The case of Boyle v. Garter, 14 Ill. 49, was a case brought up by appeal, in which no right of the parties could be affected by reversing the judgment for an error in the computation of interest, and entering a judgment here.</p> <p id=\"b438-4\" pgmap=\"438\">As to days of grace previous to the act of Assembly of 1861, it has never been conceded they could be claimed by the maker of a promissory note.</p> <p id=\"b438-5\" pgmap=\"438\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AMq\" pgmap=\"438\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
