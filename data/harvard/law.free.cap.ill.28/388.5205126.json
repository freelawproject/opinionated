Unless they do, the instrument is not a bill of exchange. Lexicographers attach no such meaning to the word \u201c funds,\u201d nor does the law ; nor is there any such common definition of the word \u201c funds,\u201d local or otherwise, as would warrant this court in giving the instrument the same legal effect as if expressly payable in coin. It is true, \u201c funds \u201d may mean legal coin, but it cannot be denied, we think, that it may also mean bank notes; and \u201c funds current to-day \u201d may mean bank notes which may depreciate. If it may mean bank notes, it is not a negotiable instrument. The text books and the whole current of decisions are very decidedly against the position sought to be maintained on the part of the plaintiff, that an instrument drawn in the form of a bill of exchange, but payable in bank notes, is in law a bill of exchange, or even a promissory note.

The legal effect and- the liabilities of parties to a bill of exchange in this State, is governed wholly by the law merchant\u2014which became and is a part of the common law\u2014and under it, we have, as we think, clearly shown by the authorities, a bill of exchange cannot be drawn and made negotiable payable in \u201c currency,\u201d \u201c current funds,\u201d or bank notes. 16 Ill. 269.</p> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b390-9\" pgmap=\"390\">Catom, C.

Such was the undoubted design of this paper. It was made and designed for a medium of exchange, which is one of the most favorite purposes of commercial paper. We are not to go outside of the paper, and by tbe aid of tbe imagination, quickened by tbe remembrance of a particular commercial crisis, imagine a state of things, in view of which we may suspect the paper was drawn, and which, if expressed on its face, would destroy its character as a bill of exchange, in the legal and commercial sense of that term. The bill is payable at sight, and dated within five hours\u2019 ride of the place of payment. It orders the payment of so many dollars \u201c in funds current to-day.\u201d Prima facie, at least, this is payable in money. It is not necessary now to say, whether it would be competent on a special defense, to prove that those peculiar words had any particular meaning, either in Peru or Chicago, or anywhere else. The presumption, at least, is, that the funds here specified wrere the legal coin of the country, or its equivalent paper money which passed in transactions as cash. This does not say the payment shall be made in funds current in Chicago, or Peru, or any other particular place. Eor the purpose of upholding the character of this bill, which was designed and used as a bill of exchange, we may well understand it as funds current everywhere. We think the court below misunderstood the true character of this bill of exchange.</p> <p id=\"b391-5\" pgmap=\"391\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b391-6\" pgmap=\"391\">Judgment reversed/.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
