He should have demanded a deed for -the lot of ground; non constat, but the appellants would have made him a deed for the work he had done. Had they failed to give him work, and refused to give a deed on demand made, the appellee could have rescinded the contract, and recovered for the work done. In Selby v. Hutchinson, 4 Gilm. 333, this court held that \u201c in order to justify an abandonment of a contract, and of the proper remedy growing out of it, the failure of the opposite party must be a total one; the object of the contract must have been defeated, or rendered unattainable by his misconduct or default.\u201d The object of this contract, so far as the appellee was concerned, was a deed for the lot. That object cannot be said to be defeated until a demand is made of a deed, and a refusal to execute it. The object is not shown to have been unattainable, no deed having been demanded.</p> <p id=\"b495-7\" pgmap=\"495\">This view disposes of the case, and necessarily reverses the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b495-8\" pgmap=\"495\">Judgment reversed</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
