Lessee of Hollingsworth et al., 1 Peters, R. 165, after the defendants had pleaded the general issue, the plaintiffs added a new count. The court say that the authorities cited \u201c prove unqustionably that upon amendments being made to the declaration, by adding a count, the defendants had the right to plead de novo; they prove nothing more. They do not show that the defendants in such cases must necessarily plead de novo / or, that judgment may he entered Try default, for want of a plea to the new count, if, before the amendment, they have pleaded the general issue. We think the practice is well settled to the contrary.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-12\" pgmap=\"213\">The court held the same thing in Parmelee v. Fischer, 22 Ill. 212; Saltus v. Bayard, 12 Wend. 228 ; 6 Taunt. 400; 5 Salk. 517; 1 Hall, (N. Y. Superior C.

Row, at the close of the last mentioned term, the second and third counts remained wholly unanswered ; and if the plaintiff was entitled to a default upon the common counts, it was because they likewise were never answered; and by the well established practice in this State, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to take the defendant\u2019s default, as to the second and third counts and said common counts, at the March term, at which he filed his replication to the special plea to first count, or his cause was discontinued, and could not be saved by taking such default at a subsequent term.

Goudy, for Defendant in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\" pgmap=\"214\">The plaintiff below first struck out, by leave of the court, the common counts of the original declaration, so that it stood with only three special counts, but had no common counts. Therefore, the plea to the common counts in the original declaration fell with such order and striking out. Hogan v. Ross, 13 How. (U. S.) 182.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\" pgmap=\"214\">The court then allowed the plaintiff to file an amended declaration, which was filed in the nature of a substitute for the original, and which differed from the original as left after the amendment, in containing the common counts.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\" pgmap=\"214\">Therefore there was no plea standing in the record which could apply to the common counts in the new declaration. It was treated as a new and substituted declaration.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-11\" pgmap=\"214\">Each count of the declaration is supposed to contain a different cause of action from the others, and in fact to be a declaration in itself.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\" pgmap=\"215\">The authorities cited by plaintiff in error to show there was a discontinuance, are where the plea proposes to answer a part of some one cownt on which issue is joined, and the case continued without default on the part of the count unanswered.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\" pgmap=\"215\">There is no discontinuance where issue is joined on one count, and the others are unanswered. Default may be taken in such case at any time. Hogan v. Ross, 13 How. 182; Everard v. Patterson, 6 Taunt. 645.</p> <opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b215-6\" pgmap=\"215\">Cat\u00f3n, O. J.</author> <p id=\"AMRF\" pgmap=\"215(321) 216(36)\">\"We can discover nothing in the least irregular in this proceeding. To the first count, the defendant filed a plea in bar, on which the plaintiff took issue. Subsequently the default of the defendant was entered upon the other three counts, and a jury was sworn to try the issue formed, and also to assess the damages on those counts on which the default was entered. The complaint is, that the default was not entered simultaneously with the formation of the issue on the plea filed to the first count. The doctrine of discontinuance by not taking judgment by nil dicit, for the part of the declaration unanswered, where the plea upon which issue is taken only professes to answer a part, when properly understood, does not apply where there are several counts in a declaration and the plea is filed to but one, or a part of those counts, and is a complete answer to these, leaving the other counts unanswered. In the application of this doctrine, each count should be considered as a separate declaration, as it in fact is, and if a plea professes to answer but a part of one of these counts or declarations, and in fact does answer but a part; as where the count is for taking three hundred sheep and the plea justifies the taking of two hundred of the sheep, and the plaintiff take issue on the plea without taking judgment for the hundred not justified, there is the technical discontinuance, unless he applies to the court for leave subsequently, to take judgment for the part unanswered. It is said he must do this at the same time at which he takes issue on the plea. This we do not think is indispensable. If he will take judgment by nil dicit before the trial of the issue, it should be deemed sufficient. The rule is an artificial and an arbitrary one, without any sensible reason to support it, and is by no means entitled to the favorable consideration of the court, and we are disposed to enforce it only when there is no other alternative.</p> <p id=\"b216-5\" pgmap=\"216\">If the general issue had been filed to the whole of the first declaration, then the authorities showing that it should stand to the amended declaration would apply. But the plea was only to the common counts, and these were dismissed by the plaintiff. Subsequently he toot leave to amend his declaration, and in his amended declaration he inserted the common counts. This imposed upon the defendant the necessity of answering the amended declaration, unless he had a plea which would answer any declaration in that form of action. A plea which answered but one count in the old declaration would not stand to a similar count in the amended declaration.</p> <p id=\"b216-6\" pgmap=\"216\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b216-7\" pgmap=\"216\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
