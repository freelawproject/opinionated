The plaintiff in error pleaded the general issue, with five special pleas. The plaintiff in error also ashed permission to file additional pleas, setting forth that the note sued on had been discounted at a usurious rate of interest. The court refused leave to file additional pleas. There was a trial, verdict and judgment for defendant in error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-5\" pgmap=\"314\">B. T.

But in this case, we thinh it was most properly refused. The case clearly shows that there was no corrupt agreement, no usury was bargained for, but the clerh in computing the interest which was agreed upon at the legal rate, made a mistahe, hence the note was for too much, not of interest any more than of principal. Besides, the plaintiff remitted the excess, which was put in by mistahe of the clerh.</p> <p id=\"b314-8\" pgmap=\"314\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"Aqh1\" pgmap=\"314\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
