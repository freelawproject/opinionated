That being such owner, he did on that day make and execute a certain agreement with William O. Heacock, by which it was agreed that after Swartwout- had procured a deed of said land from said canal trustees, he would cause the said title so procured to be conveyed to said Heacock, by a good and sufficient deed of conveyance, conveying as good and clear a title as he should receive, upon Heacock paying to him certain sums of money, (naming them); also avers, that Heacock accepted such agreement, and then and there promised to make said payments.</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">That Heacock, on the 24th day of August, 1857, sold to Andrew Garrison one undivided half part of all his right and interest in and to said contract, and Andrew Garrison conveyed that half part to Isaac D.

Heacock, and Andrew Garrison, defendants, under oath, admits that there was a contract, dated October 31, 1855, but denies that Swartwout was the owner of the said certificate; denies that said contract was of the effect set forth in the bill of complaint; and sets forth, that on that day William 0. Heacock was the owner of said ( certificate, and that said Swartwout received the assignment thereof, for the sole purpose of securing the sum of two thousand dollars, to be thereafter lent by Swartwout to said Heacock, at the usurious rate of interest of fifteen per cent, per annum ; and that upon such usurious agreement, and assignment of said certificate, Swartwout made, executed and delivered to Heacock an agreement, stating that \u201c in consideration of the payments hereinafter to be made, on the part of said Heacock, I agree to take up the two notes given by said Heacock to said trustees, according to the terms thereof, and as specified in said certificate, and said notes are thereby paid in full and to be delivered up and cancelled ; and I also covenant and agree to and with said William O.

Heacock, his heirs or assigns, by a good and sufficient deed of conveyance or instrument in writing, assuring and conveying to him as good and clear a title as I shall or may receive from said trustees by reason of said certificate and assignment above mentioned, upon his paying to me, and the same is on the express condition of his paying to me, the following sums of money, and at the times expressed as follows : (setting them out); the said moneys being paid as aforesaid, the said deed or conveyance as aforesaid mentioned to be given by me to said Heacock as aforesaid, is to be made and delivered to him.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-3\" pgmap=\"294\">Defendants admit the conveyance to Andrew and Isaac D. Garrison.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\" pgmap=\"294\">Payments by Heacock on the contract are admitted, and also the additional sum of $5.32 paid, not credited by Swartwout.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\" pgmap=\"294\">The defendants say, that on the 31st day of October, 1855, said certif\u00edcate, being the property of said Heacock, was assigned by him to said Swartwout for the security of the payment of money then lent and to be lent and advanced by Swartwout to Heacock, upon the illegal and usurious rate of interest of fifteen percent, per annum, and upon no other consideration whatever; that said Swartwout had not any other ownership to said certificate but as security as aforesaid; and that giving the assignment of said certificate to Swartwout, and the above obligation by him to Heacock, were concurrent acts and the same transaction, and were made and done to cover the said usurious transaction, and to secure the payment of said usury and the principal sum to be lent\u2014stating the amounts loaned by Swartwout to Heacock, and the rate of interest paid, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\" pgmap=\"294\">That after said notes became due, and when paid, Swartwout should hold the land for the security for the payment of said sum of money and said notes, the whole together to be a loan of two thousand dollars, and to bear interest at the rate of fifteen per cent, per annum.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\" pgmap=\"294\">Defendants claim and insist, because of such usury, all advantages, as if they had specially pleaded the same, of the statutes then and now in force, in regard to the rate and the rights, penalties and forfeitures granted and given by virtue of the same.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\" pgmap=\"294\">Defendants also insist that Swartwout ought not to retain the title to said land, nor they foreclosed, because of his usury and oppressive conduct, or be allowed to declare said obligation on their part forfeited, as, by his declaring ownership of the said land, and serving public notice in 1858 of his ownership, he hindered defendants from selling the same for the benefit of Heacock\u2019s creditors, and that defendant be now allowed the full time, if any part of said principal shall be found unpaid, to pay the same.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\" pgmap=\"295\">That Swartwout has never offered to return said notes, and defendants have no knowledge of- the same being cancelled or paid.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\" pgmap=\"295\">Deny that. Swartwout paid any taxes, and insist that it was his duty to do so, and that he has no claim on them therefor.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\" pgmap=\"295\">Defendants show, that several acres of the land have been taken for the track of Chicago and Joliet Railroad Company, who have constructed their track across the land, and fenced the same, and now have become the owners of the whole so fenced, some six rods wide, and.taken ten acres of said land; that said railroad company, by legal proceedings and through Swartwout, has become the owner of the land so taken by it, and that neither of said defendants have received anything because of the land so taken, or any damages in the premises, and are now barred from all claim of damages as against the company; and defendants insist, if the court should still deem that said Swartwout has it in his power to make a title, as he agreed, the above amount of one thousand dollars, the value of the land so taken, and the damage aforesaid, be allowed them as so much payment on the principal sum above mentioned.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\" pgmap=\"295\">A replication was filed.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-8\" pgmap=\"295\">W. 0. Heacock, one of the defendants, testified, that he was one of the parties to this suit, and he further testified to all the facts as stated in the answer; that he received but $1,000\u2014 how he received the same, that Swartwout was to take up the two notes, making in all a loan of $2,000, and that although written as payments, the first payment and all of them meant the usury of fifteen per cent, per annum; that giving the assignment of the certificate and contract and of Swartwout to him, was one and the same usurious transaction; also testified to the fact that he had paid the sum of $5.32 more than complainant had given him credit for.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-9\" pgmap=\"295(49) 296(113)\">The court below decreed, that the said contract above referred to and hereinafter set forth, be and is hereby terminated and annulled, and defendants each of them foreclosed from the right of redeeming the premises mentioned in said contract, and from the right of specific performance of said contract-, or in any way of enforcing the same\u2014unless the said defendants, or some one of them, shall, within ninety days from the date of this decree, pay unto the clerk of this court, the sum of $3,449.24, with interest thereon, from December 2, 1861, at six per cent.; but if defendants shall pay said sum of money, then complainant shall make and deliver a good deed to defendants of the land in question, and convey unto them the same title he received by reason of said certificate referred to in said contract, which contract is in the words and figures following: (here is inserted the contract as set forth in defendants\u2019 answer.)</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\" pgmap=\"296\">The defendants below brought error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-5\" pgmap=\"296\">A. Gakkisok, for Plaintiffs in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\" pgmap=\"296\">The court erred in not decreeing and finding, upon the answer and proofs, that said assignment of certificate and contract was a mortgage\u2014then how much was equitably due from Heacock to Swartwout, and if any amount was found due, decreeing sale, thereby allowing defendants and their creditors to bid or redeem pursuant to the statute. 1 vol.

He had no right to complain until he had put defendants in default; nor did he ever offer to return the notes made by Heacock to the trustees.

Complainant should do equity. 11 Ill. 194, 199 ; 2 Story Eq.

Yan Bueen, for Defendant in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\" pgmap=\"298\">The contract upon its face is one of bargain and sale. . If the defendant wished to set up usury, he must first do equity by tendering, or offering to pay, the actual amount due. This he has not done. This is the rule where a complainant seeks to get rid of a contract upon the ground of usury, and ' it is submitted that the same rule should apply in the case of a defendant. 1 Paige Chan. R. 544; 3 ib. 533.</p> <opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b298-8\" pgmap=\"298\">Cat\u00f3n, C. J.</author> <p id=\"A60\" pgmap=\"298\">Ho case could be more clearly made out than this, of a loan of money and a sale and agreement to re-sell, for the purpose of covering up an usurious rate of interest agreed upon between the parties. The testimony is all one way, perfectly consistent with the appearance and completion of the transaction. We shall spend no time on this part of the case.</p> <p id=\"b298-9\" pgmap=\"298(153) 299(24)\">What, then, were the rights of the parties ? Simply these. The complainant had a right to have his money back, with six per cent, interest, so soon as due, or,\u2019 in default, to have the land sold as upon a decree foreclosing a mortgage. Indeed, in equity, the transaction was but a mortgage. The defendants have the right to have a conveyance of the land upon the payment of the original money loaned at six per cent, interest, adding such taxes as the complainant has paid, and deducting such payments as the defendant has made, and also the amount the complainant has received from the railroad company for the right of way. Here the defendants cannot have the benefit of any penalties or forfeitures given by the statute. When a party asks the court of equity for relief from the letter of his contract which he could not obtain at law, the court will impose terms upon him to do equity. The decree is reversed, and the suit remanded for further proceedings consistently herewith.</p> <p id=\"b299-5\" pgmap=\"299\">jDecree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
