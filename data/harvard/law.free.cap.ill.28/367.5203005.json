Ruel Ambrose, Mr. Padelford and myself exchanged a farm and a house and lot in Elgin for the goods. Mr. Ambrose is the man we dealt -yith altogether. There was a levy made on the goods, in which Dr. Root was the receiptor, in which Mr. Ambrose agreed to have discharged. I did my business with Mr. Ambrose. Dr. Root gave us a discharge from it, so that we were satisfied.</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\" pgmap=\"370\">Int. 8.

As I said before, we did the business with Mr. Ambrose, receiving the release of the goods from Mr. Root.

State fully what you know, if anything, about the making out of the papers relating to the whole bargain.</summary><summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\" pgmap=\"371\">Ans. I think Mr. Padelford made out the papers\u2014a mortgage to Dr. Root signed by Mr. Ambrose. I deeded to Ruel Ambrose the farm. Mr. Padelford deeded to him the house and lot.</summary><summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\" pgmap=\"371\">Ini. 13.

Did Padelford make out the deeds, release and mortgage, all at the same time ?</summary><summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-13\" pgmap=\"371\">Ans. I think he did, or about the same time; it was considered the same transaction.</summary><summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-14\" pgmap=\"371\">Padelford\u2019s deposition:</summary><summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-15\" pgmap=\"371\">Ini. 2. Are you acquainted with the parties to this suit, and Ruel Ambrose ?</summary><summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-16\" pgmap=\"371\">Ans. I am acquainted with Anson Root and Ruel Ambrose. I don\u2019t know Curtis.</summary><summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-17\" pgmap=\"371\">Ini. 3. Did you and J. P.

J. P. Morgan and myself exchanged real estate with Ruel Ambrose for goods. The goods prior to this exchange had been levied upon by the sheriff against Ruel Ambrose. Morgan and myself refused to make the exchange without being indemnified against this levy; Anson Root was the receiptor of the goods to the sheriff. Anson Root executed a bond of indemnity to Morgan and myself, indemnifying us against any loss in consequence of the levy, whereupon I executed to him, Ruel Ambrose, a deed of the house and lot in Elgin, and J. P. Morgan executed a deed to Ruel Ambrose of the farm. Ruel Ambrose made to Anson Root a mortgage on the property sold by Morgan and myself to Ambrose, to secure Root for making the bond of indemnity to Morgan and myself.</summary><summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">Int. 4. Did Root at this time make to you and Morgan a release of any claim to said goods ?</summary><summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">Ans. I think nothing but the bond of indemnity.</summary><summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372\">Int. 5. State whether Root required of Ambrose security before he would release or make said bond of indemnity; if yea, state if he obtained security, and what it was.</summary><summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372\">Ans. He required it, and obtained security on the premises sold him by Morgan and myself.</summary><summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\" pgmap=\"372\">Int. 6. Did you draw the deeds from you and Morgan to Ambrose, and the mortgage from Ambrose to Root, spoken of ? if yea, state if it was all done at the same time or not.</summary><summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-10\" pgmap=\"372\">Ans. I think I did. It is possible that I did not draw the mortgage, but I think I did. My impression is that it was all done at the same time; it is a long time ago, and I don\u2019t pretend to recollect every minutia.</summary><summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-11\" pgmap=\"372\">Int. 7. State what you know of the execution of the said deeds and mortgage. State particularly as to the time of their execution; whether they were executed at the same time or not, and if not, the reason why. Objected to by defendant.</summary><summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-12\" pgmap=\"372\">Ans. The deeds were executed I think at the same time, and the mortgage before the papers were delivered; that is my impression. I had taken back from Ambrose a mortgage on the house and lots that I had sold to Ambrose, and it was the understanding that that should be the first lien. It is possible that Root\u2019s mortgage was dated a little later, in order to make my lien prior to the other.</summary><summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-13\" pgmap=\"372\">Int. 8. State if said deeds and mortgage were then considered as relating to the one transaction or bargain that you have stated.</summary><summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-4\" pgmap=\"373\">Ans. I considered that they were; we would not buy the goods of Ambrose unless we were indemnified, and Root would not indemnify unless he was secured.</summary><summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\" pgmap=\"373\">Int. 9. State if you know whether the land deeded by Morgan to Ambrose, and mortgage by Ambrose to Root, in the transaction you have mentioned, is the same land which is in controversy between the parties to this suit. State your knowledge on that subject.</summary><summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\" pgmap=\"373\">Ans. If it is the same suit that I was a witness in at Oswego, in Kendall county, it is the same.</summary><summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\" pgmap=\"373\">Examination closed on part of plaintiff.</summary><summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\" pgmap=\"373\">Int. 1.

Look at the mortgage now shown you, and state whether it is the same mortgage you have referred to, as given by Ambrose to yourself. If so, state the date of the mortgage, the date of the acknowledgment, and the date of the recording of the same, as appears by the certificate of the recorder thereon.</summary><summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-11\" pgmap=\"373\">Ans.

Spencer came here for the purpose of making a settlement of debts against Ambrose to persons in Hew York. Weed, Masters &amp; Weed, and Rossiter, were creditors. Don\u2019t recollect as to Haven or Curtis. Spencer bought a mortgage of witness on the house and lot. Thinks Spencer represented one Sackett; would not say that he represented Weed, Masters &amp; Weed. (The original mortgage from Ambrose to Root shown to witness.) \u201c This mortgage is the one I referred to in my deposition. I think the body of the mortgage is in Judge Wilson\u2019s handwriting. The body of the mortgage is not in my handwriting. I know that the mortgage was present during the transaction. *1 don\u2019t know what day, whether it was the same day that the deed was made or not.

J.</author> <p id=\"Abg\" pgmap=\"375(54) 376(399)\">Admitting, for the present, that as between the parties to a deed, and even as to third persons with notice, it is competent to show by parol, that the consideration and date of the deed, as expressed on its face, are different from the true consideration and date, in order to affect such third person, with such facts as do not appear on the face of the deed, there should he clear proof that he had knowledge of such extraneous facts thus proved by parol, and not appearing upon the face of the deed, before he can be affected by them. Now it is claimed that this mortgage was given to secure the purchase money of the land, and was executed at the same time that the deed was executed. We now have the mortgage before us, and upon its face it shows that it was given to indemnify the mortgagee against loss, which he might incur by reason of his having executed certain bonds as security for the mortgagor, and the date of the mortgage is nine days subsequent to the date of the deed, and three days subsequent to the date of the acknowledgment of the deed. The date of the acknowledgment of the mortgage is the same as that of the mortgage itself. Prima facie, at least, the object of this mortgage was not to secure the purchase money of the land, nor did it appear to have been executed at the same time with the deed, so that the execution of both might constitute one transaction. It was the duty of the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and his grantees, to examine . the records, and they are chargeable with notice of all the facts of which the mortgage could inform them. On its face, this mortgage did not show that it created a lien prior to that / of the judgment. When the purchaser saw this was so, he was not bound to inquire whether the mortgage did not express on its face a falsehood. He was not bound to suspect \\ that the mortgage was a trap to mislead him. If he is to \\ be charged with any extraneous facts, qualifying or contradicting the face of the mortgage, it should only be done upon clear and satisfactory proof that he had actual knowledge of such facts. Such proof is entirely wanting in this case. For aught that appears, the land was purchased at the sheriff\u2019s sale, upon the faith of the face of the record. If we are right in the principles we have stated, then the fourth instruction asked for the defendant should have been given without qualification. It is this :</p> <p id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376(24) 377(96)\">\u201c That the mortgage from Ambrose to Hoot does not purport on its face to be given to secure the payment of purchase money, but for an entirely different consideration, and even if the jury believe, from the evidence, that said mortgage was in fact given to secure the payment of purchase money, and executed at the same time with the deed from Morgan to Ambrose, such facts cannot affect the rights of the defendant, and the jury must find for the defendant, unless they also believe, from the evidence, that the defendant had notice of such facts prior to his purchase of said land, which notice is not to be inferred, but must be proven by the plaintiff.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b377-5\" pgmap=\"377\">This instruction the court qualified, as follows: \u201c But the recording of the mortgage before the purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale, if such fact is in proof, is sufficient to put the purchaser on his guard.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b377-6\" pgmap=\"377\">In this, we think the court was undoubtedly wrong. It could not put him on his guard in reference to a different state of facts than those expressed on the face of the mortgage, but on the other hand was well calculated to induce him to repose in security upon .those facts. It was upon this constructive notice, thus intimated by the court to be sufficient to chai\u2019ge him, that the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b377-7\" pgmap=\"377\">But it is insisted that the judgment was satisfied, and the lien destroyed, by the levy upon sufficient personal property to satisfy it. Such a levy is not an absolute satisfaction of the judgment, and where without any fault of the sheriff or of the plaintiff, or, at least, if by the instrumentality of the defendant, the property levied upon cannot be made available to the payment of the judgment, it is not a satisfaction. Here, by the action of the judgment debtor and this mortgagee, the property was taken from the custody of the sheriff, and never returned to him, as it was their duty, under the law and their bond, to have done. This was no satisfaction.</p> <p id=\"b377-8\" pgmap=\"377(64) 378(57)\">Again, it is claimed, that while judgment was pending before this court on appeal, it was not an existing lien on the property, and that during that time the mortgage lien attached, and thus acqxxired a priority over the judgment. The appeal did not vacate or destroy the lien of the judgment. It mex-ely suspended its execution. It was in full force all the time, as a vital judgment of the court, not only capable of holding all liens to which it attached at the term of its rendition, but it was capable of attaching to other property of which the judgment debtor might become the owner in the meantime, and thus subject such newly acquired property to its influence.</p> <p id=\"b378-5\" pgmap=\"378\">The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b378-6\" pgmap=\"378\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
