Ehle v. William Wait. That affidavit of the non-residence of William Wait had been filed in the office of the clerk of said court, etc. Notice was given that the said complainant had filed his bill in said court, and that summons was thereupon issued against said defendant, returnable on the third Monday of October next, and notifying the defendant to appear on the third Monday of October, 1860.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\" pgmap=\"71\">Default of the defendant in the usual form, taken as confessed and referred to master.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\" pgmap=\"71\">Report of master in the usual form, and approved by the court.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\" pgmap=\"71\">Decree for plaintiff against defendant for $950, without proofs to support it; and an order for the sale of the mortgaged premises ; and that a mistake made in the description of the premises in the mortgage mentioned be corrected, and the sale of the premises intended to be mortgaged ordered.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-8\" pgmap=\"71\">H. S.

The notice by publication recites the fact that affidavit of the non-residence of the defendant was filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court.</p> <p id=\"b72-4\" pgmap=\"72\">During the term of October, 1860, the master in chancery made his report, which was confirmed, and a decree of sale passed.</p> <p id=\"b72-5\" pgmap=\"72\">The errors in the proceedings are quite apparent.</p> <p id=\"b72-6\" pgmap=\"72\">The subpoena required the appearance of the defendant to the March term, 1S61, and makes a case in all respects like the case of Calhoun v. Webster and Hickox, 2 Scam. 221, and Hildreth v. Hough et al., 20 Ill. 331.</p> <p id=\"b72-7\" pgmap=\"72\">In the first of these cases the court said, where more than a term intervenes between the test and return day, of original process, the writ is a nullity. In the other case the summons was dated October 11, 1855, and made returnable to the fourth Monday of October next, in which case the summons was, by its own provision, made returnable to the fourth Monday of October, 1856, and thereby, more than one year would intervene the test and return of the writ. \u201c ISText,\u201d in its connection, refers to the month and not to the Monday. The writ is consequently a nullity, and the default taken irregular.</p> <p id=\"b72-8\" pgmap=\"72\">Here the term of March, 1860, and of October, 1860, intervened the test and return of the subpoena, and was therefore a nullity.</p> <p id=\"b72-9\" pgmap=\"72\">The notice by publication was also insufficient, admitting that an affidavit of non-residence was filed as recited by the clerk in the notice. It is insufficient because the notice recites that a summons was issued on filing the bill of complaint, returnable to the October term, 1860, whereas the record shows that no such summons issued, but a summons to appear at the March term, 1861, of said court.</p> <p id=\"b72-10\" pgmap=\"72\">The defendant then, not having been brought into court by summons or publication, and no appearance entered, the default against him and all subsequent proceedings were irregular and void, and the decree must be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b72-11\" pgmap=\"72\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
