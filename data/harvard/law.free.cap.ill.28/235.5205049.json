The policy was sealed with the corporate seal of the defendant. The policy contained several conditions, of which the thirteenth is in these words:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-18\" pgmap=\"235(9) 236(74)\">\u201c13. Insurance once made may be continued for such further term as may he agreed on, the premium being paid, and a renewal receipt given for the same; and it shall be considered as continued under the original representation, in-so-far as it may not be varied by a new representation in writing, which, in all cases, it shall be incumbent on the party insured to make when the risk has been changed, either within itself or by the surrounding or adjacent buildings.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-5\" pgmap=\"236\">On the first day of September, 1856, the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of $10, and the risk was extended for one year, and the defendant executed to the plaintiff a receipt.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\" pgmap=\"236\">There is no averment that the receipt was under seal.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-7\" pgmap=\"236\">On theffirst of September, 1857, the plaintiff paid $13 as premium, and defendant executed a receipt, extending the risk one year.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-8\" pgmap=\"236\">There is no averment that this receipt was under seal.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\" pgmap=\"236\">On April 11, 1857, an additional insurance 'of $300 was effected and written in the body of the policy.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-10\" pgmap=\"236\">These receipts were not under seal. The first question we desire to present is: Will covenant lie ? Ohitty states the rule \u2022to be as follows : \u201c And where a contract under seal has after-wards been varied in the terms of it by a distinct simple contract made upon a sufficient consideration, such substituted or .new agreement must be the subject of an action of assumpsit, and not of an action of covenant.\u201d 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleadings, 105, side paging.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-11\" pgmap=\"236\">Here were three n\u00e9w and distinct agreements, enlarging \u00a1and extending the risk and time.

The conditions \u00a1annexed to the policy make this application a warranty. The truth of the warranty is a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s Tight of recqvery. The declaration is defective in not setting out the application.

It attempts, and we think successfully, to avail of condition thirteen, by averring payment of the premium and the execution, by the company, of a renewal receipt for the same, which, by-force of the condition, continues the original policy.</p> <p id=\"b238-5\" pgmap=\"238\">It is not like the case of Luciani v. The Am. Fire Ins. Co., 2 Wharton, 172. The policy in that case, contained no such provision as this. In that case parol agreements had been indorsed on the original policy, variant from the policy, and the policy contained no covenant that it should be continued by such agreements. It seems to indicate, most clearly, that a new policy was to be executed upon the payment of the current premiums, since there is a stipulation that there shall be no charge for such new policy.</p> <p id=\"b238-6\" pgmap=\"238\">This policy continues itself by its own terms, on the performance of the condition precedent, to wit, the payment of the premiums, and taking a receipt therefor. This is the mode agreed upon by the parties for continuing the policy, and not by executing a new one. We think this is very clear, and the company should not be allowed to repudiate their agreement. They have received the premiums and given the renewal receipts, the effect of which, as they well understood, was to continue the original policy. These receipts are no new contracts, but merely evidence that the condition of the policy has been complied with by the assured.</p> <p id=\"b238-7\" pgmap=\"238\">The objection that the original application for insurance, being a condition precedent, is not set out, we think is not sound. We do not think the assured is bound to set out and prove the truth of his representations. They are subject to attack by the defendant, and if he shows their falsity, if material, the assured cannot recover.</p> <p id=\"b238-8\" pgmap=\"238\">As to the objection that notice was not given to the secretary of the company of the loss, it is sufficient if it was given and received at the office of the company.</p> <p id=\"b238-9\" pgmap=\"238(12) 239(118)\">As to the last objection, of the want of an averment that Bailey, whose certificate formed a part of the preliminary proof required by the terms of the policy, was the notary nearest to the place of the fire, it is sufficient to say, that the certificate was received, for aught that appears, by the insurance company, without any objection. As we said in the case of the Great Western Insurance Co. v. Staaden, 26 Ill. 365, good faith and the principle of fair dealing required that the company, if intending to insist upon this formal defect in the proof, should in a reasonable time have notified the assured, so that the defect might have been remedied. We must hold that this defect was waived by the company.</p> <p id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded, with, leave to the defendant to plead to issue.</p> <p id=\"b239-6\" pgmap=\"239\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
