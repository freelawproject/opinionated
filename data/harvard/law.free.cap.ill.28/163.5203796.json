That a former judgment was recovered in the Circuit Court of Stephenson county, at the December term, 1857, \u2022against the said defendant, John K.

The first and second replications to the second and third pleas were nul tiel record.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-18\" pgmap=\"164\">The second replication to the second plea, sets up that the defendant, J. M. Brewster, signed the note as security, and that J. 3L Brewster became insolvent, and, for the purpose of indemnifying his security, caused said judgment to be entered against himself by confession, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-19\" pgmap=\"164\">The third replication to the second plea is substantially same as the second, except that said judgment was entered without any agency or act of the plaintiffs, and for the sole benefit of J.

The court refused to strike from the files the 6th and 10th, to which the plaintiffs excepted, and by leave filed a further replication, in which they aver that said judgment was rendered by confession without process; that J. K. Brewster voluntarily confessed the same on said notes, which remained entirely unpaid and unsatisfied; that said Brewster was insolvent, that said judgments were wholly unpaid, and that said plaintiffs had never accepted the same in payment or satisfaction of said notes.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-8\" pgmap=\"165\">The demurrers to the 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th replications were overruled, and sustained as to the others, by the court, and the plaintiffs excepted.</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-9\" pgmap=\"165\">To the several replications the defendants rejoined.</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-10\" pgmap=\"165\">To the fourth\u2014First, that said J.

P. Malburn (for defendants) testified, that about the 1st of February, 1858, he had a conversation with Putnam, one of the plaintiffs, about Brewster\u2019s assignment being set aside, and Putnam said it would make no difference with them, because J. K. Brewster had confessed judgments on all the matters they were interested in, contained in the assignment.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-7\" pgmap=\"166\">Jason Maksh, for Plaintiffs in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\" pgmap=\"166\">The pleadings and proof in the case show, that the notes were executed in favor of the plaintiffs by the defendants jointly\u2014J. 3L Brewster as principal, and J. M. Brewster as surety. J. IL Brewster became insolvent, and caused judgment to be entered on these notes, by confession, in favor of the plaintiffs, not for their benefit at all, but simply to protect his co-maker, by providing that the plaintiffs might have a prior lien on his property, in case an assignment, which he had made, should be set aside.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\" pgmap=\"166\">The adjudged cases applicable to this question, do not seem so much to consider whether the mere existence of the first judgment operates as a bar to another one against the same person, as whether the doctrine of merger necessarily applies so as to prevent the second judgment. Sheehy v. Mandeville, 6 Cranch R. 253; Potter et al. v. McCoy, 26 Penn. R. 458.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\" pgmap=\"166(89) 167(35)\">The most that can be claimed in respect to a debt being put into judgment, is, that it thereby becomes a higher security ; and the uniform current of authorities clearly establishes the proposition, that the taking of a higher security does not merge or extinguish the original debt, unless it was taken in satisfaction by agreement of the parties.

Brewster, one of the makers of the notes sued upon in this case, if it does not show that it was confessed by their procurement. Putnam, one of the plaintiffs, filed amaffidavit in the office of the circuit clerk, in which he stated, that plaintiffs had recovered this judgment, and they had an execution issued thereon, which had been returned, no property found, and prayed garnishee process against Joseph M. Brewster, and other persons named in the affidavit. The executions were produced and read in evidence on the trial below. Malburn testified, that after Bennett had confessed the judgment, Putnam stated to the witness, that if the assignment was set aside, that it would make no difference with the plaintiffs, as Brewster had confessed judgment, on all the matters in which they had an interest, and which were embraced in the assignment. It can hardly be conceived how a ratification of the confession could be more clearly shown, than by this evidence. That such was the case, a doubt is not entertained.</p> <p id=\"b167-8\" pgmap=\"167(88) 168(85)\">These were joint notes. And the question is presented as to what was the effect of a recovery against one of the several makers, without embracing the others in the proceeding. It has been repeatedly held by this court, that a recovery against one of the several persons jointly liable, releases the others, and forms a complete bar to a recovery against them. Warren v. McNulty, 2 Gilm. 355 ; Thompson v. Emmett, 15 Ill. 415; Moore v. Rogers, 19 Ill. 247. These cases are in point, and decisive of this question. And the rule is so firmly-established in this court, and accords so fully with the adjudged cases in other tribunals, that we feel no disposition to again discuss the question, or to review the rules of law upon which it is based. If the judgment had been confessed without the knowledge of the payees, or had not been ratified by them, it might have been otherwise, but that question is not now before us and need not be discussed.</p> <p id=\"b168-5\" pgmap=\"168\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b168-6\" pgmap=\"168\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
