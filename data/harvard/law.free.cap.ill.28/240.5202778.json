That it did not appear by said assignment, etc., that any costs and damages were or had been awarded on the dissolution of said injunction, or at any other time, against the said James McKindley, the complainant in said injunction suit.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\" pgmap=\"245\">3.

That the matters assigned as a breach of the condition of said bond, are outside of the condition of the said bond, and constitute no breach of the same.</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-11\" pgmap=\"245\">6. That said bond is not conditioned to pay any of the sums of money, the failure to pay which, is assigned as a breach to the condition of said bond.</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-12\" pgmap=\"245\">7. That said bond is conditioned for the payment, by the said James McKindley, of all such costs and damages as shall be awarded, etc., and it does not appear that he has failed to pay all such costs and damages as were awarded.</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-13\" pgmap=\"245\">8. That it does not appear by said assignment, etc., that said plaintiffs have suffered any joint damage, nor have any costs been awarded to said plaintiffs jointly, and therefore they show no breach of the conditions of said bond.</summary><summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-4\" pgmap=\"246\">9. That said court had no authority to award any damages, and did not award any damages on the dissolution of said injunction.</summary><summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\" pgmap=\"246\">10. No forfeiture is alleged.</summary><summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\" pgmap=\"246\">12. That it does not appear by said second count, and said first breach, that any summons was issued or served, nor how long said plaintiffs were enjoined in said injunction suit, nor when said writ of injunction was served, and that said assignment is in other respects uncertain, informal and insufficient.</summary><summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\" pgmap=\"246\">The defendants set forth the same canses of demurrer to the second breach assigned by plaintiffs in their second count, as to the first breach.</summary><summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\" pgmap=\"246\">They also set forth the same causes of demurrer to the third breach, assigned as to the first, and the following additional causes:</summary><summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\" pgmap=\"246\">That said plaintiffs, by said third breach, claim remote and consequential damages.</summary><summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\" pgmap=\"246\">That plaintiffs set forth as a breach of the condition of said bond, the failure to pay damages for injury to their good \u2022.name, credit and business, in consequence of the charges in \u2022.said bill of complaint, filed in said injunction suit.</summary><summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-11\" pgmap=\"246\">To the fourth breach assigned, the defendants set forth the following causes of demurrer:</summary><summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\" pgmap=\"246\">1. That the statute required 'no bond to be filed, and the court had no authority to require the complainant in said injunction suit to file a bond.</summary><summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-13\" pgmap=\"246\">2. That said bond was conditioned, that if said James McKindley, William McKindley and Ira J.

That the court, in said injunction suit, had no authority to award damages, nor does it appear that said court did award any damages, and therefore there is no breach assigned.</summary><summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-15\" pgmap=\"246\">4. No allegation of the forfeiture of said bond.</summary><summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-16\" pgmap=\"246(12) 247(42)\">5. That it does not appear by said second count and assignment, that any summons was issued in said injunction suit, nor when said injunction writ was served, nor when, or how long, said plaintiffs were enjoined by said writ, and that said assignment is in other respects uncertain, informal and insufficient.</summary><summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\" pgmap=\"247\">To the fifth breach assigned, the defendants set forth the same causes of demurrer as to the first breach assigned, with the following additional causes :</summary><summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\" pgmap=\"247\">11. That the said plaintiffs do not in their said fifth assignment, etc., set forth or specify any particular breach of the condition of said bond.</summary><summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\" pgmap=\"247\">12. That it does not appear by said fifth assignment, etc., of plaintiffs, how any damages have been sustained by them.</summary><summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\" pgmap=\"247\">15. That it does not appear by said fifth assignment, etc., and said second count, that any summons was issued in said injunction suit, nor when said writ of injunction was served, nor how long said plaintiffs were enjoined.</summary><summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-9\" pgmap=\"247\">16. That it does not appear by said second count, and fifth assignment, etc., that plaintiffs have suffered any joint damage, nor that any costs have been awarded to plaintiffs jointly.</summary><summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-10\" pgmap=\"247\">The following judgment was rendered by the Circuit Court:</summary><summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-11\" pgmap=\"247\">This day again come the said parties by their attorneys. Whereupon the said plaintiffs by their said attorneys, now here in open court, freely say, that they will no further prosecute their said suit against the said defendants for the said breaches in the first count of their said declaration mentioned, and thereupon all and singular the premises being seen, and now fully understood, for that inasmuch as it appears to the court that the said second count of the said declaration of said plaintiffs, in manner and form, and the matters therein contained, are insufficient in law for them to have and maintain their aforesaid action in that behalf, against the said defendants, and the said plaintiffs electing to stand by their said second count of their said declaration ;</summary><summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-12\" pgmap=\"247(52) 248(13)\">Therefore, it is considered that the said plaintiffs take nothing by their said declaration. And it is further consid- ' ered by the court, that the said defendants do have and recover of the said plaintiffs their costs and charges, by them about their defense in that behalf expended, and have execution therefor; to which judgment and decision of the court the said plaintiffs except.</summary><summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\" pgmap=\"248\">There was a controversy between the attorneys of the respective parties, in reference to amendments to the declaration ; but that controversy is not considered in the opinion, which proceeds upon the declaration as it originally stood.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-6\" pgmap=\"248\">W. 0. Goudy, for Plaintiffs in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\" pgmap=\"248\">Without regard to the alterations or the decision of the court on the demurrer to the breaches claiming damages suffered by the writ of injunction, the decision of the court was erroneous, and the judgment below must be reversed.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\" pgmap=\"248\">The declaration with the fourth breach is not subject to any of the objections alleged.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\" pgmap=\"248\">The declaration first sets out an injunction bond, executed and sealed by the defendants to the plaintiffs in the penal sum of $1,000, with a condition reciting the circumstances in which the bond was given, and then providing \u201c that if the above bondmen, James McKindley, William McKindley and Ira J. Nichols, their heirs, etc., shall well and duly pay or cause to be paid to the said James (or John, it is immaterial which) H. Sherwood, Robert S. Randall, James A. Hibbard and Charles Miner, their executors, etc., all such costs and damages as shall be awarded against the said complainant, in case the said injunction shall be dissolved, then the above obligation to be void.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-10\" pgmap=\"248\">The declaration avers that the injunction was dissolved and the bill dismissed at the cost of the complainant, James McKindley.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-11\" pgmap=\"248\">The fourth breach avers, \u201c that a large amount of costs were awarded against the complainant in said suit, namely, the defendant, James McKindley, to wit, the sum of fifty dollars, and that the defendants have not paid the same or any part thereof.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-12\" pgmap=\"248(42) 249(42)\">This makes a complete cause of action. The penalty was payable to the plaintiffs, and the right of action to accrue when the condition was broken. The condition, among other things, was to pay the costs awarded on the dissolution of the injunction to certain persons named, it is immaterial whether plaintiffs or third persons, and the averment is made that the contingency arose, the condition was broken, and the costs were not paid at all by the defendants, to any person whatever.</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249\">The demurrer to this breach ought to have been overruled, and for that reason, at least, the judgment below must be reversed.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249\">Each breach is in the nature of a count, and in this case there was a general demurrer to each breach, each of which was sustained.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\" pgmap=\"249\">1. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th breaches all aver injury and damages suffered by Hibbard and Miner, two of the plaintiffs, while the action is in the name of all the obligees, four in number.</p><p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\" pgmap=\"249\">2. These breaches all claim damages suffered by the wrongful suing out of the injunction, and which were not awarded on the dissolution of the injunction, or in any intervening suit.</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\" pgmap=\"249\">The first breach was to recover solicitors\u2019 fees, costs and expenses paid to defend the injunction suit by Hibbard and Miner.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-10\" pgmap=\"249\">The second breach was to recover damages suffered by the closing of the store of Hibbard and Miner, in obedience to the writ of injunction, to wit, rent of store room and expenses, and profits.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-11\" pgmap=\"249\">The third breach was to recover damages for the loss of credit, and injury done to the business of Hibbard and Miner.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-12\" pgmap=\"249\">The fifth breach averred damages suffered generally by Hibbard and Miner.</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-13\" pgmap=\"249\">The bill in chancery, wherein the bond was filed, was to enforce a judgment at law against Sherwood and Eandall, out of goods owned by Hibbard and Miner, on the ground that Sherwood and Eandall had fraudulently sold to Hibbard and Miner.</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-14\" pgmap=\"249\">The action would lie to recover damages not awarded on* the dissolution of the injunction or in any intervening suit.</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-4\" pgmap=\"250\">It has been expressly decided by this court, that the nonpayment of damages occasioned by the wrongful suing out of an attachment, having exactly the same condition, is a breach of the condition to pay the damages awarded, and that no awarding is required before the suit on the bond. Churchill v. Abraham, 22 Ill. 455.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\" pgmap=\"250\">Again, in a case precisely like this, suit was brought on an injunction suit, where the bill had been dismissed at complainant\u2019s costs without an award of damages, with a condition \u201c to pay all such damages as shall be awarded,\u201d this court held that solicitors\u2019 fees and expenses of defense could be recovered. The bond was also a voluntary one, and not in compliance with law. Ryan et al. v. Anderson, 25 Ill. 372.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\" pgmap=\"250\">This doctrine has been expressly held elsewhere, where the point was expressly made, that the damages must first be awarded. Roberts et al. v. Dust, 4 Ohio S. R. 502.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\" pgmap=\"250\">The action in the name of the four plaintiffs will lie to recover damages suffered by two of them.</p><p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\" pgmap=\"250\">This is not an action of covenant on the condition; if it was, then those injured should sue. It is an action of debt for the penalty. The damages are limited to such as are suffered. If the condition is broken in any part or in any respect, the penalty is forfeited, and an action lies to recover it in the name of all the obligees, and it could not be brought in the name of a part of them. 1 Chitty, 9, 10; Richardson v. Jones, 1 Iredell, 296.</p><p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\" pgmap=\"250\">A penalty of a bond being joint, a joint action may be maintained in the name of all the obligees on the same, although the condition may require different amounts paid to each. Jacob Keller, one of the plaintiffs, had no interest in the amount sought to be recovered.</p><p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-10\" pgmap=\"250\">A several action might be maintained on the condition for the amount due to each, but this does not preclude the right to the joint action in the name of all on the penal undertaking to all.

It is a general rule of pleading in personal actions, that the time of every traversable fact must be stated, to promote certainty; and this is especially necessary in the declaration, for .the additional reason, that the cause of action must always \u00a1appear,,by the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, to have accrued before .the commencement of the suit.

Sherwood et al., costs and damages awarded against said complainant, was an uncertain event, and there is no averment in the breaches, that either of said events had happened, and in this respect the breaches assigned were defective. Nelson v. Bostwick, 5 Hill, 40, 41; Brown v. Stebins, 4 Hill, 154.</p><p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\" pgmap=\"253\">The record in this case shows that this suit was commenced April 27, 1860. But the plaintiff's in their second count, after having stated that the first bond given in said injunction suit was adjudged insufficient, and the complainant was ordered to give and file a sufficient bond, state as follows, to wit:</p><p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\" pgmap=\"253\">\u201c Afterwards, to wit, on the 16th day of November, A. D. 1860, at and within the county of Cook aforesaid, the said defendants made their other wilting obligatory, sealed with their seals, and now to the court here shown, etc.,\u201d thereby showing that the suit was commenced before the cause of action accrued, the plaintiffs basing their second count, which is the only count on the record, upon the second bond, which they allege was made in November, 1860, after the suit was commenced, and the subsequent allegation that the bond bore date prior to the commencement of the suit, does not remove the difficulty, for it might have been ante-dated; neither does the subsequent statement that the bond was filed on a day prior to the commencement of the suit, aid them, for the dates of the making and filing are inconsistent.

Under our practice, the plaintiff, in an action on a penal bond, is required to assign the breaches in his declaration, and not upon the record, as required by the ancient English practice. According to the rules of pleading, the plaintiff may assign as many breaches as he deems necessary, on a penal bond, in one count, or he may file as many counts as there are breaches of the bond. When the former course is adopted, each breach, answers the place of a separate count. The commencement,, the general breach, and conclusion, are all to be considered in. reference to each special breach, as though it formed the only breach in the count. And as a further consequence, each breach is subject to a demurrer, precisely as is each several, count in the declaration. And it may be sustained to several and awarded to others, in the same manner that it may to several counts in the same declaration.</p> <p id=\"b254-4\" pgmap=\"254\">To each of the five breaches in the declaration, in this case, there was a several demurrer, and on which special grounds were assigned. One of the grounds to a portion of these assignments was, that they.fail to aver that the defendants had failed to pay the sum of money claimed in the breach. It is urged, that, to have been formal, they should have averred that defendants, nor either of them, had paid the money to plaintiffs. It is obvious, that where a number of persons are jointly, or jointly and severally, bound for the performance of an act, its performance hy one of them is a performance by all, and no other construction can be given to the language of the breaches. Had it appeared upon, the trial, that either of the defendants had paid the money demanded, it would have undeniably defeated a recovery. This part of the breach is is not obnoxious to the special demurrer. The other averment that the defendants \u201chad not paid the money\u201d demanded, is, perhaps, insufficient of itself, but the general breach contains a full formal averment that the defendants had not paid the money, or any part thereof, to the plaintiffs, or to either of them. When the general breach is considered as a continuation of the special breach, it renders them technically formal and precisely accurate, and renders them unobjectionable.</p> <p id=\"b254-5\" pgmap=\"254(152) 255(60)\">It is further insisted, that when the plaintiffs aver a failure to pay John H. Sherwood, James A. Hibbard and Robert S. Randall, there is no breach shown, as the agreement was to pay James H. Sherwood and the others. The body of the bond is payable to John and the other persons. The condition recites, that the injunction was sued out against John H. Sherwood and the other persons named. Rut in the latter part of the condition his name is written James. It having been three times previously written \u201c John,\u201d there can be no question, from the instrument itself, that John H. Sherwood was the obligee. And where reference is made to the \u201c said James H. Sherwood,\u201d there can be no room to doubt that John is the person intended. It is perfectly apparent that such was the design. We have to resort to the whole instrument to ascertain the intention of the parties, and no other can be gathered from this bond and condition. The name \u201cJames,\u201d where it appears in the condition of the bond, should therefore be disregarded, as inoperative and repugnant to the other portions of the bond, and thereby give effect to the intention of the parties, otherwise so clearly manifested.</p> <p id=\"b255-5\" pgmap=\"255\">The other grounds of demurrer urged upon the argument are general, although assigned as special causes. It is insisted, that the bond is conditioned to pay all such costs and damages as shall be awarded against the obligors, and that the breaches fail to aver that any damages were awarded on the dismissal of the bill and dissolution of the injunction. It is manifest that a statutory bond, where the form is prescribed, and it is observed, will be construed to have the effect given by the statute, as it enters into and forms a part of the instrument. Love v. Fairfield, 5 Gilm. 303; Churchill v. Abraham, 22 Ill. 455. But when the bond is a common law instrument, the liability of the obligors is limited by the terms of the condition. The condition is the limit of their liability. These breaches are not all assigned in the terms of condition, but it is insisted that they are according to the legal effect. The fourth breach avers, that a large amount of costs were awarded against MeKindley, \u201c to wit, the sum of fifty dollars,\u201d and defendants have not paid it. This breach is in the precise terms of the condition. When the bill was dismissed at complainant\u2019s costs, they were in terms awarded against him.</p> <p id=\"b255-6\" pgmap=\"255(121) 256(72)\">There is no averment in the first breach, that solicitors\u2019 fees were awarded to plaintiffs. Nor in the second, that damages were awarded for the loss of rents and profits, on the dissolution of the injunction. Nor in the third, that damages were awarded for damages occasioned by a loss of credit, produced by the wrongful suing out of the injunction. Nor in the fifth, that any amount was awarded for damages for the wrongful suing out of the injunction. This presents the question, whether the condition of the bond authorizes a recovery, unless the damages are awarded at the time the injunction is dissolved. The condition is \u201cto pay\u201d all such costs and damages as shall be awarded against complainant, in case \u201c the said injunction shall he dissolved.\u201d It will be observed, that it is not the damages and costs to be awarded on the dissolution. If such were its terms, then it might possibly confine the liability to the damages and costs then found and ascertained by the decree. But in this condition it is the costs and damages that shall be awarded in ease the injunction is dissolved.</p> <p id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">This condition does not provide, that the damages shall be awarded at the time of the dissolution of the injunction. It only provides, that if the worst shall happen, the obligors shall pay such damages as shall be awarded, and whether they shall be awarded at that or a future period, in that or a different proceeding, makes no difference. A recovery in an action upon the bond, would be an award of damages within the condition. Nor was it necessary that a separate recovery should be had against the complainant, before the liability attached against the securities. When a judgment is recovered against him and the other obligors, the condition is answered, as the damages are then awarded against him. The first, second and fourth breaches were also well assigned.</p> <p id=\"b256-6\" pgmap=\"256\">The third and fifth breaches, however, were obnoxious to a demurrer. The third claims damages for a slander of the firm, or rather for an injury to its credit, by suing out the writ of injunction. The damages, if any, resulting from that cause are too remote to be included in a recovery on this bond. The object of the bond is to indemnify the defendant against immediate and actual loss. The fifth breach is too general and indefinite. It avers no fact constituting the breach, but simply the wrongful suing out of the writ. The demurrer was properly sustained to the third and fifth breaches, but should have been overruled as to the others, as they were sufficient without any amendment.</p> <p id=\"b256-7\" pgmap=\"256\">The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b256-8\" pgmap=\"256\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
