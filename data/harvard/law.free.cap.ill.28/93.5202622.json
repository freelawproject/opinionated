In this particular the case of Turney v. Turney, 21IJ1. 626, considered and explained.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-8\" pgmap=\"93\">The precise statements required by the statute, and an application for the aid of the court, are all that such a petition need contain.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-9\" pgmap=\"93\">Any newspaper printed at the county seat answers the intention of the law requiring a notice to be published in the nearest newspaper.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-10\" pgmap=\"93\">Such petition and notice, with proof of publication, under the statute, give the court jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties interested therein.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-11\" pgmap=\"93\">A decision of the court, where the jurisdiction has attached under such circumstances, is valid and binding everywhere, until reversed on a direct proceeding, in a superior court.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-12\" pgmap=\"93\">Under such a proceeding, if it were affirmatively shown that there were no debts to be paid out of the proceeds of the real estate, still the decree would be binding till reversed upon a direct proceeding.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-13\" pgmap=\"93\">A decree or order for the sale of \u201c the real estate described in the petition\u201d justifies the sale of all the estate so described.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-14\" pgmap=\"93\">Under such an order or decree, if but part be sold and report made and confirmed, no further proceedings being had, it is competent under the same order to proceed subsequently and Bell the residue.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-15\" pgmap=\"93\">Though it is proper in the decree or order to require the administrator to report his proceedings, and he may be compelled to do so, yet the statute makes no such report and approval necessary to the validity of the sale, as in the case of guardians\u2019 sales.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-16\" pgmap=\"93\">Where there is a valid decree, the intention of the statute is to hold the sale valid. Sec. 106, Statute of Wills, supersedes the necessity of inquiring whether the administrator followed strictly the directions of the statute in making the sale. Nor does public policy require that a purchaser should examine into the fact of indebtedness, so as to ascertain if the sale is justified.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-17\" pgmap=\"93\">Where R. enters into a contract with B. for the purchase of real estate upon condition of making certain payments which are not made before the death of R., and the administrator goes to B. and gets him to treat the contract as forfeited and to give him a new contract, for the benefit of the heirs of R., he being one of the heirs; semble, if B., on payment of the purchase-money out of funds of the estate, deed the land to \u201c the heirs of A.,\u201d without otherwise naming them, the heirs of R. hold the land in trust for the estate;</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b93-18\" pgmap=\"93(16) 94(77)\">And where the money raised to make payment to B. was in part raised by sale by the administrator under sec. 103 of Statute of Wills, the purchasers to whom the administrator conveyed and whose money was paid to B. may, after the deed is executed to \"the heirs of R.f file a bill against them, though minors, and compel a conveyance of their interest to such purchasers. The minor heirs were treated as the holders of legal estate in trust for the benefit of the purchasers who had acquired the equitable title.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b94-4\" pgmap=\"94\">Such conveyance in this ease was ordered to be made by a master.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\" pgmap=\"94\">Defendants in error, by bill filed on the chancery side of the cour-t below, July 6, 1860, state, that Elisha Bailey, August 21, 1848, was seized of one-half acre of land, described by metes and bounds, and made his agreement in writing to sell and convey said premises to David Rattray, (since deceased,) thereby covenanting and agreeing to and with the said Rattray, \u201chis heirs, executors, administrators and assignees,\u201d that upon condition said Rattray, his executors or administrators, should pay $200 in one year, and $200 in two years, from said date, to convey to said Rattray, his heirs, etc., the premises; which agreement was recorded.

The premises described as a half acre in the bill, were, before the sale, in connection with another half acre adjoining, subdivided by the administratrix into twelve lots, numbered from one to twelve inclusive. The purchasers at the time of the sale did not know the condition of the title, but were assured by Waughop and Stow that it was all right, after the sale, when deeds were executed. Default had occurred in paying the money according to the terms of the contract read in evidence from Bailey to Rattray, dated August 2, 1818. Bailey claimed the right to forfeit the contract, and according to the recollection of the witness Waughop, he did declare a forfeiture before April 7, 1851. At that time Bailey entered into anew and substituted contract with Jane Rattray, in trust for herself and the minor children of David Rattray, for the same premises, for $550, $200 cash and the balance in six months, and six dollars per month as rent, this sum being over $100 more than was due on the old contract of August 2, 1848. Besides the $200 paid at the time of making this contract, Jane R. Stow, late Rattray, paid $200, December 11, 1851, and sometime in 1852, $100 more. On the 27th of July, 1853, the balance due on this contract was ascertained, from $50 to $75, and an order drawn by Mrs. Stow on Waughop, for the amount, who paid it from the money in his hands received at the sale the day before, without the direction or knowledge of the purchasers, and took from Bailey the deed to the \u201c heirs of David Rattray,\u201d he, Waughop, supposing that the title would enure to the use of the purchasers. The payments on this contract, prior to the last, were made from the proceeds of real estate sold under decree for the payment of debts before the sale in controversy.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-5\" pgmap=\"102\">W.

J.</author> <p id=\"A9n\" pgmap=\"106\">We said in Turney v. Turney, 24 Ill. 625, in a direct proceeding to reverse the order of sale, that the petition in a proceeding like this, should contain the names of the heirs; but that case was finally decided upon another point. We are not prepared to hold that the whole proceeding is void where the heirs are not named in the petition.</p> <p id=\"b106-17\" pgmap=\"106(11) 107(173)\">The statute, which is the one hundred and third section of our Statute of Wills, says the administrator \u201cshall make out a petition to the Circuit Court of the county in which the administration shall have been granted, stating therein what real estate the said testator or intestate died seized of, and so much thereof as will be necessary to pay his or her debts as aforesaid, and request the aid of the court in the premises.\u201d This is all the statute says about the form or contents of the petition, and we cannot hold that the proceeding was void, when the petition, as in this case, contains the precise statements which the statute says it shall contain. It would be difficult to compute the number of titles that would be overturned by such a decision. Sound and judicious practice no doubt requires that the names of the heirs and devisees, and their grantees, if known, should be inserted in the petition, but the statute has not prescribed it, and we must not hold the proceeding void for the want of it.</p> <p id=\"b107-5\" pgmap=\"107\">The statute also requires the petitioner to serve a copy of the petition and account mentioned in the fore part of the section, on each of the heirs or their guardian, \u201c or by publishing in the nearest newspaper, for three weeks successively, commencing at least six weeks before presenting of said petition, of the intention of presenting the same to the Circuit Court for the sale of the whole or so much of the real estate of the said testator or intestate as will be sufficient to pay his or her debts, and requesting all persons interested in said real estate to show cause why it should not be sold for the purposes aforesaid.\u201d Such a notice was published for the time specified, in a newspaper in Chicago, the county seat where the court was held. An objection, which we hardly think worthy of notice, is made that it is not shown that this was the nearest newspaper. The statute has no such trifling meaning as that it is necessary to measure with chain or tape line, the distance from the judges\u2019 bench to the printing office, to see which of two or more newspapers published at the county seat is the nearest. Any newspaper printed at that place answers the intention of the law.</p> <p id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107(30) 108(115)\">That this petition and notice gave the court jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the parties interested in the' real1 estate, we are satisfied. The court was thus properly called upon to hear, to consider and to decide upon the matter, and when it has so decided, that decision is valid and binding everywhere, till it is reversed on a direct proceeding by a superior court. In this collateral action we cannot inquire whether such a case was made out before the court, as justified its decree. If the court acted without proof, or even if it were affirmatively shown that there were no debts to be paid out of the proceeds of the real estate, still we could not, for that reason, treat the decree as void. As before remarked, it is binding till reversed upon a direct proceeding for that purpose.</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">The decree is very broad in its terms, and directs the administratrix to sell all of the real estate mentioned in the petition, including the property in question. At the first sale under the decree, but a part of the property was sold. This sale was reported to and approved by the court, and there the order stopped\u2014afterwards the administratrix sold the property now in controversy. It is now objected, that as no order was made at the time the first sale was approved, either ordering a further sale or continuing the cause, that it then ceased to be a matter pending in court, and consequently the power to sell expired. We can hardly adopt this conclusion. The administratrix was, by the order, directed to sell the whole of the estate. She sold a part and reported it, and her proceedings thus far were approved. We do not see where the necessity was for the court to make any other order at that time. The first decree told her to sell the whole, which necessarily included that which remained unsold, and it would have been \u2022mere repetition for the court to make another order directing \u00a1the sale of the residue.</p> <p id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108(101) 109(77)\">Although the order of sale very properly required the \u2022administratrix to report her doings under the order of the court, and she should have been compelled by the court to comply with that portion of the order, yet neither the decree of the court nor the statute, made such a report and approval necessary to the validity of the sale, as is the case in the sale of the estate of minors for their support and maintenance. It seems to be the intention of the statute to hold the sale valid wherever there is a valid decree ordering the sale. Section 106 says, that if any executor or administrator who shall be ordered to make sale of real estate as aforesaid, \u201c shall sell the same contrary to the provisions of this chapter,\u201d he shall forfeit the sum\u2019of five hundred dollars, \u201cprovided that no such offense shall be deemed to affect the validity of such sale.\u201d This supercedes the necessity of inquiring whether the administratrix followed strictly the directions of the statute in making the sale.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">The last objection is, that the property did not belong to the intestate, but was the property of the heirs in their own right. At the time of his death, the intestate had a contract for the purchase of this land upon which but a portion of the purchase money had been paid. Eor the evident purpose of defrauding somebody, the administratrix went to Bailey and got him to treat the contract as forfeited for non-payment of the installments, and give her a new contract for the same land for the benefit of the other heirs and herself, then filed this petition and sold the land under it, as having belonged to her father, placed the proceeds among the assets and paid for the land out of the assets, and then took a deed \u201c to the heirs\u201d of the intestate; and now, coolly turns round to the purchasers and tells them that her father had no interest in the land, and that consequently she could sell them none\u2014that the land all the time belonged to herself, and the other heirs\u2014and that although the heirs got the benefit of the purchase money, they must now hold the land also. This maneuver is too transparent to require a moment\u2019s hesitation to treat it as it really deserves. We do not hesitate to say, that a court of equity must hold, that the conveyance which wras made to the heirs was in fact made under and in pursuance of the contract of purchase with the intestate, and that the heirs must be treated as trustees holding legal title for the benefit of those who have acquired the equitable title, which was in the intestate at the time of his death.</p> <p id=\"b109-6\" pgmap=\"109(34) 110(13)\">We affirm the decree, and order that the master in chancery in the decree mentioned, execute the deeds as therein mentioned before the next term of this court, to be held in this division, and that he report his doings herein at the said next term.</p> <p id=\"b110-4\" pgmap=\"110\">Decree affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b110-5\" pgmap=\"110\">After the foregoing opinion had been recorded, Mr. Goudy, for the plaintiff in error, filed a petition for a re-hearing, which was granted. After the cause had been again heard, the following opinion was announced. [Reporter.]</p> <p id=\"b110-6\" pgmap=\"110\">Cat\u00f3n, C. J. As some of the questions involved in this suit are of very great importance, a re-argument of this cause was ordered after an opinion had been filed affirming the decree below. The whole case has been again considered by the court, with the additional light afforded by the re-argument, and we are very clear that the judgment affirming the decree, and the opinion which was filed, should be adhered to. There is one point which was presented upon the first argument, and has again been urged upon this, which was not sufficiently noticed in the opinion, and which will now be considered.</p> <p id=\"b110-7\" pgmap=\"110(213) 111(17)\">It is insisted that before the last sale was made, there were no debts remaining unpaid, and consequently the power of the administratrix was necessarily exhausted, there remaining no legal object for which the land could be sold. Now this may be so as to the debts which had been allowed and entered of record by the County Court, but we are not prepared to find it was so in point of fact. Certain it is that there were debts against the estate which were paid in part at least out of the proceeds of those lands, and which it did not suit the purposes of the administratrix ever to have presented or allowed against the estate. Such was the case of the entire purchase money for the land which was due to Bailey, and every dollar of which, according to the testimony of Mr. Waughop, was paid out of the assets of the estate, and the last payment, at least, was made out of the proceeds of the sale of these lands. Now certainly as between third parties, if not always and everywhere, those were good and valid payments. This was a legitimate claim against the estate, and the administratrix, by paying it out of the assets, no doubt took the responsibility of proving that the claim was a valid one, when called to account for such payment.</p> <p id=\"b111-5\" pgmap=\"111\">But conceding the utmost that is claimed, that enough money had been raised by the first sale of lands to pay all the debts, and we still think that the last sale was not void. The court had complete jurisdiction of the matter, and in the exercise of that jurisdiction it decreed that all of the lands mentioned in the petition, specifying and describing them particularly, should be sold to pay the debts of the estate. Surely, if here was jurisdiction in the court to make this decree, it furnished authority to the administratrix to make the sale. It may have been an erroneous decree, but it was not void. To hold that every purchaser at such a sale shall go and see that in truth there are debts owing by the estate sufficient to require the sale of the particular land, at the peril of getting nothing by his purchase, would drive all prudent men from such sales, and leave only sharpers and speculators as purchasers, and enable them to get the lands at mere nominal prices, or at least at most ruinous sacrifices. Ho surer plan could possibly be devised to make estates insolvent, and to fritter away the real estate of heirs and devisees.</p> <p id=\"b111-6\" pgmap=\"111\">We adhere to our former decision, and affirm the decree.</p> <p id=\"b111-7\" pgmap=\"111\">Decree affirmed,</p> <p id=\"b111-8\" pgmap=\"111\">Mr. Justice Walker, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
