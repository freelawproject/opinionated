The State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Evidence was adduced at the hearing to show that a \u201ccongressional candidate\u201d had presented information to the grand jury of Prince George\u2019s County concerning alleged irregularities in zoning matters and that among those persons alleged to be \u201cinvolved\u201d was the appellee. In a newspaper article admitted in evidence it was stated that the State\u2019s Attorney said that \u201cevery name\u201d given by the informant would be questioned by the grand jury. The appellee testified that he was aware of this. He said that on November 3, 1966, Vincent J. Femia, then an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, called him about making a statement to the State Police investigators. Later that day, about 11:30 P.M., Femia again called the appellee, who, as a result of the call, went to the Seat Pleasant Station, arriving there about midnight. Femia and two State Police corporals were present. He was interrogated \u201con matters pertaining to these zoning irregularities\u201d for about two and one-half hours. At the conclusion of the interrogation the appellee asked Femia \u201cif it would be necessary for me to appear before the Grand Jury since I had already given this testimony to the police officers, and he answered yes * * * I then asked him when and he said, \u2018this morning.\u2019 \u201d The appellee called Femia about 9:15 A.M. on November 4th, and Femia asked him to \u201ccome down.\u201d He met Femia at the police office and they went to the grand jury room by way of the \u201cback door\u201d to avoid publicity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellee testified before the grand jury on the zoning matters. A transcript of a part of the proceedings before the grand jury was read into evidence. It showed that the appellee was sworn and requested that he be permitted to make an opening statement. His remarks were transcribed as follows</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cMay I say that at the outset I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the staff of the State\u2019s Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ney\u2019s Office\u2014excuse me\u2014the staff of the State\u2019s Attorney, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Femia, and to the members and foreman of the Grand Jury for affording me this opportunity to appear before you this morning to clarify any allegations that may have been made concerning me in the past several weeks. I previously had instructed my accountant to make all his records available to you. I gave your investigators a very comprehensive statement as early as this morning and turned over any records that I had to them for any verification of any facts, and I shall try to answer any questions that may be propounded to me as truthfully and as conscientiously as I possibly can.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">At the hearing in the instant case the appellee testified that he had appeared before grand juries at least twice a year since 1955 and always made an introductory statement similar to the one he made on November 4th.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Femia\u2019s testimony confirmed the circumstances surrounding the interrogation of the appellee in the early morning hours of November 4th. His recollection was that the appellee said upon the conclusion of the interrogation, \u201cWould it help if I appeared before the Grand Jury?\u201d Before receiving a reply, the appellee changed the question to \u201cWould it help the Grand Jury if I appeared before the Grand Jury?\u201d Femia replied, \u201cWell, to tell you the truth, George, from what I heard tonight it sure can\u2019t hurt you and it has to help them, any information they can get.\u201d He denied telling the appellee that it was necessary for the appellee to appear before the grand jury and did not recall the appellee asking if it was necessary for him to go before that body. \u201cBut I do know this, that at no time did I indicate that he had to testify. At no time did I indicate this-to him. Now, I have been a prosecutor long enough to know that if a man stands accused of anything the last place you take him is in the Grand Jury room. That sort of puts you out of business.\u201d The Court said to Femia, \u201cAs I understood a while ago (the appellee) didn\u2019t in so many words say, \u201cI want to go before the Grand Jury,\u201d and Femia replied, \u201cthat is correct, not to me anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Each of the State Police officers present during the interrogation of the appellee had some recollection of the conversation between Femia and the appellee about the grand jury. Neither could recall the exact words. One said that the 'appellee \u201csaid something to the effect that he wanted to appear and get this whole mess straightened out.\u201d The other stated he heard the appellee saying that \u201che was anxious to clear this matter up, that he wanted to do anything possible to clear the matter up, and that he was \u2014 wanted to know if he could help the Grand Jury in any way by testifying, and that he was anxious to testify before the Grand Jury if that \u2022would help in any way clear it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince 'George\u2019s County, testified that during the investigation the \u25a0 appellee offered \u201cto turn over all his books and records, I 'think he did, and income tax statements. I believe he has \u25a0done that. He offered to meet with these State Police investigators, and I do know offered to do anything that was \u2022possible to bring this to a conclusion.\u201d Between October 25, 1966 and November 4, 1966 during a telephone conversation between Marshall and the appellee, the appellee asked \u201c* * * 'if there was anything he could do, and he offered to come \"before the Grand Jury or do anything further that he could \u25a0possibly do to cooperate. I think his words would have been \u25a0something to the effect like, \u2018Would it help to come before the Grand Jury, would it satisfy them,\u2019 and I think my response would have been something like, \u2018It certainly wouldn\u2019t \u2018hurt you.\u2019 \u201d Marshall said he never directed the appellee to -appear before the grand jury, did not issue a summons for him to appear and did <em>not, </em>either by letter or orally, direct 'his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It is clear that the appellee appeared before the grand jury \u25a0of Prince George\u2019s County on November 4, 1966 and testified. We think, and it is not contended to the contrary, that 'his testimony was with regard to the investigation by the \u25a0grand jury of zoning matters, and that the indictments returned against him were a result of that investigation. The \u25a0question is whether the appellee was exempt from proseen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tion, trial and punishment because he appeared before the grand jury and so testified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">On March 30, 1868 the General Assembly approved Chapter 369 of the Acts of 1868, enacted in compliance with the requirements of Article 3, \u00a7 50 of the Constitution of Maryland of 1867. As now codified, with amendments, in Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 23, it proscribes, in part here relevant, bribing public officials, including a member of any municipal corporation of this State, and the demand or receipt of a bribe by such officials. The section continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201cand any person so bribing * * * or so demanding or receiving a bribe shall be a competent witness, and compellable to testify against any person or persons who may have committed any of the aforesaid offenses ; provided, that any person so compelled to testify in behalf of the State in any such case shall be exempt from prosecution, trial and punishment for any such crime of which such person so testifying may have been guilty or a participant therein, and about which he was so compelled to testify.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The exemptions in \u00a7 23 extend to proceedings before grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>juries. <em>Brown v. State, </em>233 Md. 288. In resolving the question, therefore, it must be determined whether the appellee was compelled to testify, and, if so, whether, under the circumstances present, he obtained immunity. We think that <em>State v. Comes, </em>237 Md. 271, is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>THE COMPULSION OF THE WITNESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">In <em>State v. Comes, supra, </em>the Court had before it whether a subpoena was an indispensable factor in compelling a witness to testify under the statute. It said, p. 278:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cMany lengthy and able opinions have been written dealing with the compulsoriness or the voluntariness of the disclosure made. However, we see no necessity for laboring this question unduly. The following is, we think, a short but complete answer thereto. Every person is presumed to know the law; hence, the appellee, once he got before the grand jury whether by subpoena or otherwise, presumptively knew that he was subject to contempt proceedings and imprisonment, if he refused to answer questions relative to the bribery laws. <em>Brown v. State, supra. </em>As we stated in <em>Sullivan v. Sullivan, </em>234 Md. 67 (a divorce case):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u2018Acquiescence to or assent to what one cannot prevent does not amount to a voluntary agreement thereto.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We must take this language to mean what it clearly says. Therefore, with regard to the question of a witness being compelled to testify, it is immaterial how he got before the grand jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once he is there, is sworn and testifies, he has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>compelled to testify within the meaning of the statute. We hold that the appellee was \u201ccompelled to testify in behalf of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\n<em>THE IMMUNITY OE THE WITNESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">It does not necessarily follow, however, that although a person is compelled to testify within the meaning of the statute by the fact of the grand jury receiving his testimony relevant to the matter before it, that such person is always exempt from prosecution on such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Both Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provide, although in slightly different language, that no person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case. In <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U. S. 1, the Supreme Court held that the protection of the federal constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination flowed to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. But even before the decision in that case, the Court of Appeals of this State, in <em>Brown v. State, supra, </em>held that the two constitutional provisions against self-incrimination were in <em>pari materia </em>and should receive a like construction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute, here under consideration, by its express terms, not only makes a person a competent witness in bribery cases, but compels him to testify. It thus takes away his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination when he is compelled so to testify and grants him an immunity from prosecution, trial and punishment in place of the privilege. Such a statute is valid if its effect is to grant protection as broad as that afforded by the privilege which it displaces. Art. 27, \u00a7 23 has been held to afford such protection. <em>Brown v. State, supra, </em>p. 297. \u201cImmunity\u201d and \u201cprivilege\u201d are therefore not interchangeable terms and it is necessary to distinguish between them. <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(McNaughton Rev.) Yol. VIII, \u00a7 2281 \u201cpoints out that \u2018immunity\u2019 signifies the beneficial result to the offender, i.e., the nonliability of the offender for the offense itself, while \u2018privilege\u2019 denotes the non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>compellability to speak about the offense. In other words, by an immunity the offender\u2019s guilt ceases; under a privilege it continues.\u201d <em>State v. Comes, supra, </em>pages 275-276. It is within such frame of reference that the holdings in <em>Comes </em>come in focus. <em>Comes </em>held that under the statute here involved it was not necessary that a witness claim his privilege against self-incrimination in order to obtain the exemption afforded by the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think it obvious that as the statute takes away the privilege, the witness cannot lose the immunity granted by the statute by failing to assert a privilege not available to him. The Court concluded its opinion in <em>State v. Comes, supra, </em>by saying, p, 282:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cIn making this ruling, we are not to be understood as intimating that no witness, who appears before a grand jury and testifies, may not do so \u2018voluntarily\u2019. Instances have been known where witnesses, either by subterfuge (such as a witness using another witness\u2019 subpoena), collusion, or otherwise have appeared before grand juries and testified for the specific purpose of attempting to obtain immunity. No such question is raised herein (and we leave all questions of this nature open) ; the appellee, in good faith, responded to the radio call to appear before the grand jury, was sworn, and testified under oath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Although the Court in making the statement referred to the appearance of a witness \u201cvoluntarily\u201d, we think it clear from the opinion that it was not then considering the question of the compellability of a witness but the question of immunity afforded him; the appearance of a witness before a grand jury for the specific purpose of attempting to obtain immunity under the circumstances set forth by the Court would result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>in a waiver, by reason of his conduct, of the immunity to which he would be otherwise entitled. AVe note that the Court referred to instances where witnesses appeared before grand juries \u201cby subterfuge * * *, collusion, <em>or otherwise\u201d, </em>(emphasis added) and testified for the specific purpose of attempting to obtain immunity. We think, therefore, that there may be instances other than \u201csubterfuge\u201d and \u201ccollusion\u201d whereby a witness waives his immunity. Even a constitutional right may be waived. <em>Cohen v. State, </em>235 Md. 62, 70, cert. den. 379 U. S. 844; <em>Goetzke v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 3, 7 and cases therein cited. <em>We </em>feel that a witness may waive his immunity, expressly or by his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The appellee did not expressly waive immunity from prosecution with respect to his appearance on November 4th.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The lower court found as a fact that there was \u201cno such * * * \u2018subterfuge, collusion\u2019 or the like to get in the grand jury room for the sole ptirpose of obtaining immunity\u201d and from the record before us, we agree. We also think that there were no other circumstances shown sufficient to establish that the appellee otherwise waived immunity by his conduct. That he may have hoped to convince the grand jury that he was in no way culpable and so prevent an indictment from being returned against him or that, in the words of the lower court, \u201chis hope in going before the grand jury was to help him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>self,\u201d are not sufficient to constitute a constructive waiver of immunity. Nor may he be denied the immunity because he in fact knew or was presumed to know the law and was thus aware that if he testified under the circumstances here present, he would be exempt from prosecution. The grand jury and the prosecuting authorities are also presumed to know the law, and when the appellee was permitted to testify without an express waiver of immunity by him, he was then, under the circumstances existing, in the absence of conduct on his part sufficient to constitute a waiver, exempt from prosecution, trial and punishment. The lower court did not err in granting the motions to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing the indictments affirmed; county commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">. According to the clerk charged with the ministerial duty of scheduling and arranging for the appearance of witnesses before the grand jury, the name of the appellee was not on her list of witnesses for November 4, 1966 and she did not know that he was to appear that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">. Within the context of the question, we consider the phrase \u201cexempt from prosecution, trial and punishment\u201d to be synonymous with the word \u201cimmunity\u201d and use them interchangeably in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. The immunity granted by the statute is a broad one. \u201cIt effectively bars the use of \u2018leads\u2019 to convict the witness of the offense as to which he testifies, and it covers the offense of attempting to bribe as well as actual bribing. We further think that the broad language referring to \u2018any such crime of which\u2019 he \u2018may have been guilty\u2019 may fairly be construed and should be construed as including conspiracy to violate the bribery law; but even if it were not, this gap in statutory protection would be closed by Section 39 of Article 27.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>233 Md. 288, 297-298.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 39 provides for immunity to like effect with regard to conspiring to commit the offenses set forth in \u00a7 23, (and also subtitles \u201cGaming\u201d and \u201cLotteries\u201d). <em>Brozvn, </em>note 2 at p. 294, lists other statutes in this State dealing with compellability of testimony and grant of immunity, noting that the language is not uniform.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">. In <em>Comes </em>the appellee was not subpoenaed but appeared before the grand jury and testified after receiving a radio call from the dispatcher\u2019s office of his employer. The dispatcher received his order to call the appellee from the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, who in turn, had been directed by the grand jury to secure the appellee\u2019s attendance. The Court held that the appellee did not appear before the grand jury voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\">. Although not material to his compellability, the circumstances of his appearance may be material to a determination of whether he waived immunity as hereinafter discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">. <em>Malloy v. Hogan </em>was decided June 15, 1964 and <em>Brown v. State </em>was decided January 13, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. Absent a statute compelling a witness to testify and granting him immunity if so compelled, if he wants the privilege he must claim it. Neither the State nor the federal constitutional provision precludes a witness from testifying, voluntarily, relative to matters which may incriminate him. See <em>United States v. Monia, </em>317 U. S. 424; <em>Gamble v. State, </em>164 Md. 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. The Court asked Femia why a written waiver was not obtained and in explanation P'emia said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201cSir, very simply, we - - - he asked us, we didn\u2019t ask him. And, Judge, remember, he is the Chief of Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">The man asked us to come and testify before the Grand Jury.

At his subsequent appearance he signed a waiver of immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
