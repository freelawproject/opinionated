The applicant was sentenced to an imprisonment for an indeterminate period not to exceed 4 years accounting from February 16, 1967, and the codefendant for a term of 4 years accounting from April 8, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In his petition, one of the applicant\u2019s allegations is that his attorney, whom he privately retained to represent him at his trial, was appointed by the court to represent the codefendant also and that as there was a conflict of interest between him and the codefendant, he did not receive a fair trial. Upon a hearing on the petition, the lower court found that the attorney retained by the appellant was appointed by the trial court to represent the codefendant with instructions to the attorney that if he felt there was a conflict of interest to so inform the court. After talking to each of his clients, the attorney decided there was no conflict. After \u201cthe testimony was in\u201d at the trial, however, the attorney, as he testified at the post conviction hearing, \u201cfelt obliged to and did argue to the jury, that there was more evidence against the applicant than there was against the codefendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The hearing court, after reviewing the evidence produced at the trial, found that there was \u201ca lamentable and deplorable conflict of interest,\u201d and that the applicant \u201chad a right to be disturbed when his attorney told the jury that there was more evidence against him than there was against\u201d the codefendant. It is stated in the memorandum accompanying the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201cThe concept of conflict of interest is based on the theory that no man can serve two masters, and certainly the attorney found himself in a most unenviable position when it came to argue the case to the jury. The conflict of interest here was sharp and clear\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">After so finding, the hearing court concluded that although the applicant \u201cwas in a way used to help (the codefendant), a matter of which he was rightfully disturbed, nevertheless his predicament did not help (the codefendant), and the jury found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>sufficient evidence, not only to convict the (applicant) but also (the codefendant). If the case had been that (.the codefendant) had been acquitted and (the applicant) convicted, it would have been a clear case of injury by reason of conflict of interest.\u201d So concluding, the hearing court held that since \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to convict even the less involved of the two,\u201d the applicant \u201cfailed to show any injury by his attorney\u2019s conflict of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In support of the holding, the he\u00e1ring court cited <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 616 and <em>Boggs v. Warden, </em>232 Md. 656. In <em>McCoy </em>there was no conflict of interest shown, the Court stating that \u201cthe mere appointment of the same counsel to defend codefendants, does not, in itself, establish any conflict of interest.\u201d It added, \u201cFurthermore, the applicant alleges no facts to show that he was prejudiced in any way, and his claim of conflict of interest amounts to no more than another bald allegation.\u201d 234 Md. 618. In <em>Boggs </em>the Court said that \u201cthe unsupported statement that his interest had been subordinated to that of his codefendant was not enough to state a ground of relief.\u201d 232 Md. 657. These cases are readily distinguishable from the instant case. Here the hearing court found a \u201csharp and clear\u201d conflict of interest and we cannot agree that .there was no prejudice to the applicant for. the reasons ,advanced by the court. We recognize that what constitutes sufficient .prejudice is uncertain, but we note the admonition of the Supreme Court in <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U. S. 60, 76, that \u201c[t]he right to. have assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.\u201d We think it obvious that if the trial court had knowledge prior to trial of the conflict of interest as became apparent during trial, the applicant and the codefendant would have proceeded to trial with separate counsel. We cannot find that the applicant was afforded effective assistance of counsel under the circumstances here present, and must grant the applicant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In view of our finding it is not necessary to determine the merits of the other allegations of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\n<em>Application granted; case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
