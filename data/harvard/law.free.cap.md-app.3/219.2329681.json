Cardin, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b240-15\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">John Arthur Johnson, the appellant, was convicted of common law rape in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, Judge James K. Cullen presiding without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">The evidence adduced at the trial showed that in the afternoon of November <em>7, </em>1966, Johnson, who had just been released from the Maryland Penitentiary, went to the home of his friend Eddie Smith. According to the testimony of Eddie\u2019s mother, Johnson, upon learning that Eddie was not at home, forced his way into the Smith apartment. Johnson then pulled down the shade in the living room and grabbed Mrs. Smith. He hit her several times with a brick; and he raped her while holding a soda pop bottle over her head. A few minutes later Eddie Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>returned home. After Mrs. Smith let her son in, Johnson, according to the prosecutrix's testimony, threatened that if Eddie should call the police he would kill him. Mrs. Smith, nonetheless, called the police while her son stayed with Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Johnson contends that there was insufficient evidence of penetration to sustain the conviction as required by <em>Craig v. State, </em>214 Md. 546, 136 A. 2d 243. He specifically says that Mrs. Smith\u2019s testimony that \u201che intercoursed with me\u201d was not enough to show penetration. In <em>McEntire v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 449, 235 A. 2d 311, it was held that proof of penetration was shown by use of the term \u201csex relations.\u201d The Court of Appeals in <em>Robert v. State, </em>220 Md. 159, 151 A. 2d 737 held that sufficient proof was established by the term \u201csexual intercourse.\u201d The Court of Appeals, further, stated that the jury was entitled to examine other pertinent facts in weighing the testimony of the prosecutrix to see if she understood the meaning and ramification of words\u2014sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Mrs. Smith, at the time of the trial was forty-four years old, a married woman and mother of three. She was nervous while on the stand and somewhat reluctant to go into the details of the penetration. She did testify that Johnson threatened to kill her after he had \u201cfinished busting his nut.\u201d In answer to the meaning of this phrase, she testified that it meant \u201cthe intercourse, finish intercourse.\u201d On cross-examination Mrs. Smith stated that she reported to her son that Johnson had raped her, not \u201cattempted to rape her\u201d as suggested by counsel. At the end of her testimony, the court asked her if Johnson had penetrated her and her answer was in the affirmative. When asked by the State\u2019s Attorney to explain what \u201che intercoursed with me\u201d meant, appellant\u2019s counsel objected whereupon Mrs. Smith said \u201cDo you want me to say that word?\u201d Although counsel withdrew his objection, the court stated \u201cI will sustain the objection, but I\u2014intercourse\u2014I suppose I know what that means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">It seems clear that Mrs. Smith, a forty-four year old mother knew what \u201che intercoursed with me\u201d meant. It is further clear from the tone of the whole testimony that the court and counsel were aware of the full implications of that phrase\u2014\u201che intercoursed with me.\u201d We hold that on the facts of this case these words are sufficient to prove penetration, see <em>McEntire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>v. State, supra. </em>The testimony of the prosecutrix need not be corroborated, <em>Lucas v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 590, 235 A. 2d 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Johnson, further, points out that the medical report, received into evidence on stipulation, stated that there was no injury to the thighs or external genitalia and spermatozoa were not found by a smear test. This would not be inconsistent with the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony in that force does not have to be physical, <em>Lucas v. State, supra, </em>and it is not necessary for the sex act to be completed in order that penetration be proven, see <em>Green v. State, </em>243 Md. 75, 220 A. 2d 131, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Johnson contends that Mrs. Smith\u2019s testimony was so contradictory as to be totally unreliable. The mere fact that Mrs. Smith\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with Johnson\u2019s does not bring it within <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A. 2d 683. Under this rule, the inconsistencies must occur within the witness\u2019s own testimony and relate to pertinent issues, see <em>Bell v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 471, 235 A. 2d 307. This did not happen here. The trier of facts is under no obligation to believe Johnson\u2019s version, <em>Logan v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 213, 228 A. 2d 837, <em>Johnson v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 486, 236 A. 2d 41, and furthermore the \u201cweight of the evidence and credibility of the witness are for the trier of facts to determine,\u201d <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 444, 230 A. 2d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
