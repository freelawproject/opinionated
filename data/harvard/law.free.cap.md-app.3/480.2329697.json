Hamill sitting in the Circuit Court for Allegany County denying relief prayed under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The applicant alleged in his petition for relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">(1) that at his trial at which he was convicted of assault with intent to carnally know a female under the age of 14 years, his wife \u201cwas forced to testify by the State\u2019s Attorney\u201d on the threat that if she did not testify the State\u2019s Attorney would bring out her \u201cpast criminal background\u201d, and that her testimony was \u201cprejudiced\u201d ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">(2) that one of the two judges who presided at his trial was prejudiced;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">(3) that it was impossible for him to have received an \u201cunbias trial\u201d due to \u201clocal newspaper advertisement\u201d of his case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">(4) that his counsel was incompetent \u201cas he even failed to cross-examine\u201d the appellant\u2019s wife;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">(5) that he made oral statements to the police without being advised of his rights and \u201cwithout presence of counsel\u201d ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">(6) that evidence \u201cobtained through an illegal search and seizure, presented to the Court, even though ordered stricken from the record was hard to erase from the minds of the two presiding Judges\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">(7) that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">The applicant was afforded a full evidentiary hearing at which he was represented by counsel appointed for him. Nine witnesses testified, including both judges who presided at his trial, his wife and the attorney representing him at the trial, privately retained, who had been a member of the bar for 50 years and had extensive experience in the defense of criminal matters. We have reviewed the transcript of the testimony at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">With regard to the first allegation, the applicant testified that he had not heard the State\u2019s Attorney threaten his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>but was told of the threats by someone whose name he refused to divulge. We find nothing in the testimony of the applicant or his wife to show that her testimony at the trial was prejudiced. There is no merit in the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">With regard to the second allegation, we agree with the finding of the hearing judge that there was not \u201can iota or scrap-, of evidence whatsoever\u201d that the trial judge about whom the applicant complained was \u201cin any way prejudiced in this, case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">With regard to the third allegation, the hearing judge found that there was not \u201ca bit of competent testimony or evidence presented * * * to show that there was any impartiality (sic.) or prejudicial statements by the newspapers.\u201d We agree. See <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">With regard to the fourth allegation, assuming it to be true\u201e the failure to cross-examine is a matter of trial tactics and not <em>per se </em>sufficient to show that counsel was incompetent. <em>Hines v. Warden, </em>236 Md. 406; <em>Norris v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 69. At the hearing the allegation was made that counsel at the-trial had failed to call witnesses suggested by the applicant.. Counsel testified that he talked to the suggested witnesses and they had no evidence which was relevant to the trial. Three of them testified at the hearing and had no personal knowledge of the case. The hearing court found that the applicant\u2019s counsel was justified in not calling the witnesses at the trial and we-agree. At the trial, counsel, by timely objection, was successful' in having a statement made by the applicant to the police kept out of evidence, made motions for judgment of acquittal and\u2019 advised the applicant not to testify. We find nothing in the record to show that the applicant was not afforded a genuine and\u2019 effective representation at his trial. <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">With regard to the fifth allegation, as we have noted, the-statement of the applicant was not received in evidence at his trial. By the applicant\u2019s own words in stating the sixth allegation, the evidence complained of was not admitted at his trial. The allegations have no merit. See <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362; <em>Stackhouse v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>With regard to the seventh allegation, the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction is not to be considered in a post conviction procedure. <em>Nixon v. Director, </em>1 Md. App. 14; <em>Lyde v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">At the hearing, a question arose as to direct appeal from the judgment against the applicant. It was shown that a timely appeal was noted by counsel who then wrote the applicant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\"><em>\u201cI </em>wish to advise that to protect any rights which you might have, I have filed an order for appeal to the Court of Appeals. If you wish this case to be appealed and tried on Appeal, you should write to Judge Naughton at Cumberland, and if you have no funds with which to pay for the appeal, tell the Court this in a letter, and ask him to appoint some lawyer to handle the case for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">Please let me know at once if you receive this letter and what you want done concerning the appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">'The appeal was not perfected. The applicant admitted receiving 'the letter, and claimed he wrote both the presiding judges asking that counsel be appointed for him. Both judges testified that they had not received such a request. The hearing judge found that the evidence clearly indicated that counsel had advised the \u25a0applicant \u201cexactly what he should do with regard to taking an -appeal to the Court of Appeals and he failed to do it.\u201d We agree. See <em>Wampler v. </em>Warden, 231 Md. 639, 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">In the application for leave to appeal the applicant attempts to raise two additional allegations. He claims counsel representing him at the post conviction hearing was incompetent \u25a0and that he was denied a transcript of his trial. The applicant mentioned during his testimony at the hearing that he needed the transcript to ascertain the name of a police officer who could \"testify in his behalf. Although it is not clear from the record, it appeared that the applicant thought that his wife had called someone and that the officer knew whom she had called. But \"he made no proffer of what his wife said to the unknown man saying only that the officer \u201ccould testify that that night if it \"was the man that she called that what went on that night.\u201d IFrom the record we do not think that any rights of the applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>were denied by the failure to furnish him a transcript. See <em>Klein v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 603. The question of competency of counsel at the post conviction hearing was not raised below and is not properly before us. Md. Rules, 1085. In any event, the transcript of the proceedings shows clearly that the applicant was afforded competent representation at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
