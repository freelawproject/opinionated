The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">In <em>Watson v. Warden, </em>2 Md. App. 134 we held that there was no denial of rights guaranteed by the 6th and 14th Amend'ments to the Constitution of the United States by the exclusion \u25a0of an accused and his attorney from the proceedings of the grand .jury leading to indictment. We cited <em>Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. 558, where the Court said, pages 566-567:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">\u201cThe grand jury is an accusing body, and not a judicial tribunal; and it acts upon knowledge possessed by its members from any source, whether from witnesses brought before it, or from information gained before its sessions. Tn this state they have plenary in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>quisitorial powers, and may lawfully themselves, and upon their own motion, originate charges against offenders, though no preliminary proceedings have been had before a magistrate, and though neither the court nor the state\u2019s attorney has laid the matter before them.\u2019 <em>Blaney v. State, </em>74 Md. 153, 21 A. 547, 548; <em>In re Grand Jury Report, </em>152 Md. 616, 137 A. 370. And their oath requires them to present all things truly as they come to their knowledge, according to the best of their understanding. But it is an inflexible requirement that their investigations shall be carried on secretly and free from outside interference or influence; and great care is taken that they shall be so carried on. The purposes of this are many. Freedom of inquiry is to be preserved, and at the same time individuals whose conduct may be investigated, but against whom no indictment may be found, are to be protected from disrepute, and all individuals are to be protected from one-sided presentations of unfavorable evidence, without opportunity to reply, before any one present unnecessarily. See <em>In re Grand Jury Report, </em>152 Md. 616, 631, 137 A. 370. This protection from one-sided hearings has, indeed, been regarded as demanded in constitutional provisions for inauguration of criminal proceedings by indictment. <em>Comm. v. Harris, </em>231 Mass. 584, 121 N. E. 409. It is, moreover, \u201cinherent in the grand jury system with all the force of a statutory enactment.\u2019 <em>United States v. Edgerton </em>(D. C.), 80 Fed. 374, 375. And it is found embodied in the familiar grand jury oath that the members sworn shall keep secret the counsel of the state, their fellows, and their own, and shall not present any one for envy, hatred, or malice, nor leave any one unpresented for fear, favor, or affection, or hope of reward. The rule is not merely a remedial one, that injury shown to have been sustained by the accused in a particular case shall be remedied, but also a preventive one, which interposes in advance for private benefit and public benefit as w\u2019ell. Discriminations between degrees of depar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ture from it are difficult to manage, and, unless the bar is maintained in all cases, it can hardly have any effective existence. Therefore the law must act upon the existence of opportunity rather than await proof of abuse, as in cases of communications with petit jurors, and also in civil cases of conflicts of interests of agents, attorney, or trustees. <em>Mason v. Martin, </em>4 Md. 124; <em>Gaither v. Myrick, </em>9 Md. 118, 143; <em>Derlin v. Derlin, </em>142 Md. 352, 121 A. 27. \u2018Their findings must be their own, uninfluenced by the promptings or suggestions of others, or the opportunity thereof.\u2019 <em>Lewis v. Board of Commrs. of Wake County, </em>74 N. C. 194.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We said in <em>Watson </em>at page 140:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cNo Attorney, other than the State\u2019s Attorney, his assistants, or someone appointed in their stead is permitted to attend the proceedings before the grand jury. <em>Coblentz v. State, supra, </em>at page 564. The appearance of any person before the grand jury attempting to influence the jury is not permissible. <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 95. It has been held that one who is being investigated by the grand jury has no right, constitutional or otherwise, to appear before that body. <em>Duke v. United States, </em>90 F. 2d 840 (4th Cir. 1937) cert. denied 302 U. S. 685, rehearing denied 302 U. S. 775, (cited as authority in <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>supra) ; <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>144 F. 2d 604 (2nd Cir. 1944) opinions by L. Hand; J. cert. denied 323 U. S. 790. In <em>Hitzelberger v. State, </em>173 Md. 435 it was held that one under investigation who attempts to influence a member of a grand jury to present certain evidence in favor of that person may be held in contempt. It has also been held that one who merely solicits the grand jury to allow him to testify in his own defense may be held in contempt. <em>Commonwealth v. McNary, </em>246 Mass. 46, 140 N. E. 255, 256 (cited with approval of <em>Hitzelberger v. State, supra.)\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">We are not persuaded by the authorities relied on by the appellant to depart from our holding in <em>Watson </em>that neither the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>cused nor counsel representing him have any right to be present during the proceedings before the grand jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of the nature of the functions of the grand jury, the cases cited by the appellant in support of his contention are not in point and are not apposite by analogy. They conclude that assistance of counsel may, under certain circumstances, be necessary to assure certain rights of an accused, at a preliminary hearing or arraignment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at a lineup,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at the obtaining of a confession,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and at the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor do we construe <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400, where the Court held that the right of the accused to confront the witnesses against him was denied where a transcript of testimony at a preliminary hearing, at which there was no opportunity for cross-examination, was admitted in evidence at the trial on the merits, to compel such confrontation of witnesses in grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The appellant also alleges that, because prior to conviction, an accused who is charged with an offense, the maximum punishment for which is capital, is not entitled to bail \u201cas a matter of law\u201d (Md. Rules, <em>777 </em>a), the action of the grand jury in indicting him deprived him of his liberty without due process of law. But the rule continues: \u201cIn a capital case the accused may be admitted to bail in the discretion of the court.\u201d We see no merit in this allegation. The question presented by a denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>bail in such case is one of the exercise of the discretionary power of the court and there is no allegation here that the discretion was abused. See <em>Fisher v. Ball, </em>212 Md. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We find no error in the denial to dismiss the indictments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Molly Manigold testified that about 11:00 P.M. on the evening of September 23, 1966 while she was walking from her brother\u2019s house at 1010 Mosher Street to the house of another brother at 1207 Winchester Street, \u201csomebody grabbed me around my neck * * * and pulled me backwards and twisted my neck and told me if I holler, say T kill you.\u2019 \u201d She was able to see her assailant \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll never forget him\u201d\u2014and identified him as the appellant. She asked him why he was doing this to her, and he said, \u201cShut up bitch,\u201d and hit her in her face with his fist. He dragged her down the alley and threw her down, \u201cbeating my face from side to side.\u201d He \u201cstraightened\u201d her with his leg across her and had intercourse, tearing her clothes \u201coff her.\u201d He said, \u201cit\u2019s women like you I like to hurt.\u201d She was \u201chalfway out and he did what he wanted to do * * * He put his penis in me.\u201d He asked her if she had any money and when she replied that she did he took \u201cabout a dollar and something\u201d from her pocket while he was still \u201csitting on top\u201d of her. He told her he was going to kill her and \u201che started beating me in my face again and I could feel my face swelling up all over.\u201d He finally permitted her to get up but had her arm twisted around her back. He pushed her in this manner to her brother\u2019s house and she \u201cfell in the door,\u201d and hollered for help. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>was then \u201cin shock\u201d and \u201call I know is waking up down at University Hospital, the doctors talking to me.\u201d The victim\u2019s brother, Charles Mason, testified that he tvas sitting in his house when the \u201coutside door, slung open\u201d and his sister hollered, \u201cHelp.\u201d He ran out the door and saw the appellant running \u25a0\u201ceastward on Winchester towards the alley.\u201d Mason ran after the appellant and caught him near the entrance to the alley. The appellant put his hand \u201cinto his sweater\u201d and Mason hit him, \u201cknocked him between the white fence and the brick wall.\u201d He brought him back to the house and held him until the police, whom neighbors had called, arrived. The police officer who responded to the call testified that when he arrived on the scene Mason was holding the appellant. Molly Manigold came out of the house and pointed to the appellant saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the man that beat me up and raped me.\u201d She showed the officer where the assault occurred and the police found her shoe about \u201ca quarter way down the alley\u201d and her black wig about \u201cthree quarters of the way down the alley.\u201d He also found some of her underclothing\u2014part of a slip and part of a pair of panties\u2014in the area of the attack. The items were admitted in evidence. A police physician testified that he had examined Molly Manigold at 1:40 A.M. on September 24, 1966. His examination \u201cshowed both eyes blackened, with a huge hematoma beneath the left eye with splitting of the surface skin. Eyes were divergent, pointing out in both directions. Pupils were small and equal. Three vertical splits beneath the upper lip, the longest three-quarters of an inch, the other two a half inch. The lower lip was bruised and swollen. Blood was caked at the right nostril. On her legs there was an abrasion of the right knee, multiple abrasions of both feet, heels, inner and outer surfaces. Her eyes were not tracking together. They did not go from side to side together. Seemed to wander off. An X-ray of the head was recommended to the family. The body also showed that she had had a bowel movement. There was feces over the buttocks and thighs. The external genitalia was normal, female. The hymen showed an old, complete destruction. Bacterial exudate was negative. The outlet was paros\u2014that means she has had children\u2014relaxed. No tears, abrasions or cuts. The vagina, a small amount of mucoid material. The cervix was normal in appearance. Discharge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>negative. A slide which I made was positive for non-motile spermatozoa.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Diagnosis was multiple facial injuries, multiple abrasions of extremities, evidence of penetration and ejaculation.\u201d The only witness called by the defense was the appellant\u2019s mother who testified that the appellant had a hernia operation in 1966 and had complained that he seemed to be \u201closing his nature,\u201d both before and after the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We have no difficulty in determining that the court below had sufficient evidence from which it could fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant\u2019s guilt both as to the rape and the robbery as charged. <em>Scott v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 709; <em>Lucas v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 590; <em>McEntire v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 449; <em>McFadden v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 511. The appellant complains that the testimony of Molly Manigold was so-inconsistent that it should not have been accepted by the trial court. <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, held that where the sole witness\u2019 testimony was so contradictory as to have no probative force, the trier of facts could not speculate about it and select one or another contradictory statements as the basis of the verdict. That principle has no application here. At most Molly Manigold\u2019s testimony was contradictory only in minor details, going only to its weight, and her testimony was corroborated in substantial part by other evidence. There was no need for the trial court to speculate in arriving at its verdicts. <em>Bell v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 471, 472. The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses was for the trial judge to determine. <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 444; <em>Sadler v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 383. The judgments of the lower court on the evidence were not clearly erroneous and we shall not set them aside. Md. Rules, 1086; <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The appellant alleges that after the trial he learned that his pants had been examined at the crime laboratory of the Baltimore City Police Department and that the examination showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>they \u201cwere negative for sperm.\u201d He claims that the report o\u00ed the examination was \u201cknown to the State at the time of his trial.\u201d He contends that this was a suppression of evidence by the State and denied him due process of law. The record before us is silent as to an examination of the pants. It does not show if, in fact, such an examination was made, or, assuming it was made, what it disclosed or whether the appellant had knowledge of it prior to trial or could reasonably have learned of it. The contention is not available to the appellant on direct appeal, as on the state of the record there is nothing for this court to review. Not being tried and decided by the lower court, the point is not properly before us. Md. Rules, 1085.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-13\">. The appellant filed pleas of not guilty and not guilty by rea\u2022son of insanity at the time of the commission of the offense and at the time of the trial. By order of the lower court he was examined -and evaluated at Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital and a report was submitted by the superintendent of that institution. The issue \u25a0of sanity was determined preliminarily by the court after hearing \"testimony of a staff psychiatrist of Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital. The court found that the appellant was legally sane at the \"time of the commission of the offense and sane at the time of the \"trial. Those findings are not contested on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. In accord, see <em>Allred, v. State, </em>387 So. 2d 28 (Miss. 1966); <em>U. S. ex rel.
