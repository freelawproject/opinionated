Digges, Special Assistant Attorney </em>General, with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>and <em>James C. Kenhil, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b663-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Appellant, Jay Chambers, was found guilty of criminal contempt by a jury, Chief Judge J. Dudley Digges presiding, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, and was sentenced by the court to serve one year in the Maryland House of Correction, and appealed. He had been adjudged to be in contempt of court for failing to obey a court order to take a blood test in connection with a paternity proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">In its brief and oral argument before the court the State-moves that this appeal be dismissed on the grounds that this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction in contempt cases. Since the granting of the motion will be dispositive of the appeal, we will consider the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">The lower court, the State\u2019s attorney and the appellant all\u2019 considered this case to be in the nature of a criminal contempt. In support of its motion the State argues that, assuming this proceeding is of a criminal nature, it is not such a \u201cconviction\u201d as referred to in Maryland Code (1967 Cum. Supp.), Article-5, sec. 12 (Criminal Appeals) or non-capital \u201ccriminal case\u201d' as stated in Maryland Code (1966 Repl. Vol.), Article 26, sec. 130, over which this Court has appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">Under the common law there was no appeal from the judgment or order of the court in contempt proceedings regardless of whether the contempt was criminal or civil in its nature, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>less specially authorized by statute. This was the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Kelly v. Montebello Park Co., </em>141 Md. 194, 118 A. 600 (1922). There \u25a0the Court in its opinion pointed out that since there is no statute in this State providing for appeals in contempt cases, the \"common law would apply, and \u201cthe order appealed from is not subject to review by this Court.\u201d The Court of Appeals reached -a similar conclusion in the later case of <em>Ex Parte Sturm, </em>152 Md. 114, 124-126, 136 A. 312 (1927), where the Court found 'that a judgment imposing a fine for criminal contempt in violating an order within the legitimate scope of the Court\u2019s authority was not appealable, since there was no statute in force expressly providing for appeals in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Following the decision in <em>Ex Parte Sturm, supra, </em>the General Assembly enacted express legislation authorizing appeals to be taken in all contempt proceedings. Laws of Maryland 1927, Ch. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The statutory authorization for appeals in contempt cases is now set forth in Sections 18 and 7 (e) of Article 5 of the Maryland Code (1957) and (Cum. Supp. 1967). Section 18 of Ar'ticle 5 (Code 1957) titled \u201cAppeals in Contempt Cases\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201cAny person may appeal to the Court of Appeals from any order or judgment passed to preserve the power or to vindicate the dignity of the court and adjudging him in contempt of court. Upon such appeal, in cases of both direct and constructive contempt, the Court of Appeals shall consider and pass upon the law and the facts and shall make such order as to it may deem proper, including the reversal or modification of the order from which the appeal was taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Section 7(e) of Article 5 (1967 Cum. Supp.) titled \u201cAppeals from Certain Interlocutory Orders\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">\u201cAny party may appeal to the Court of Appeals from any of the following interlocutory orders entered by or actions of a court of equity* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">\u201c(e) An order, remedial in its nature, adjudging in \u25a0contempt of court any party to a cause or any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>not a party thereto, except orders entered requiring the payment of alimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Section 12 of Article 5 (Code 1957), titled \u201cAppeals in Criminal Cases,\u201d was amended in 1966 (Ch. 12, sec. 1, Raws of Maryland 1966), to transfer jurisdiction in all non-capital criminal cases from the Court of Appeals to the Court of Special Appeals. However, Sections 7(e) and 18 of Article 5 (Code 1957), authorizing appeals in contempt cases were not so amended, and appeals from orders and judgments for contempt remain exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Had the General Assembly intended otherwise, it would have amended Sections 7(e) and 18 of Article 5 (Code 1957) in the same manner that it amended Section 12 of Article 5, to transfer jurisdiction from the Court of Appeals to the Court of Special Appeals. Not having done so, we can only conclude that the General Assembly intended jurisdiction in criminal contempt proceedings to remain in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Since appeals in criminal contempt cases were not authorized under the general statutory provisions for criminal appeals (See <em>Ex Parte Sturm, supra, </em>and <em>Montebello Park Co., supra), </em>the amendment of Article 5, Sec. 12 (Code 1957) passed in 1966 (Cum. Supp. 1967) would not vest this Court with appellate jurisdiction over such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">As we find that we have no appellate jurisdiction in criminal contempt proceedings, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">However, an examination of the record discloses that appellant noted his appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals from' the judgment in this case, but, through a clerical error, the record was transferred from the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland and docketed in that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, without prejudice to any right he may have to further perfect his appeal to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\"><em>Appeal </em>dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
