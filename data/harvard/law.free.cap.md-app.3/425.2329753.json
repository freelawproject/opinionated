Cullen, sitting in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, denying relief sought under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Applicant raised six contentions in his petition ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">1. He was denied the assistance of counsel at the time he made oral statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">2. His oral statements were made after being confronted with evidence obtained through an illegal search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">3. The evidence used in court was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty to a charge of burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">4. The judge at his trial was biased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">5. His indictment and trial were invalid because of the decision in <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">6. His court appointed counsel was incompetent in failing to properly prepare the appeal from applicant\u2019s conviction and in persuading applicant to waive his rights under <em>Schowgurow, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">As found by the lower court, applicant\u2019s first contention has no merit. The Supreme Court ruling in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966) is not retroactive so as to cover applicant\u2019s trial in 1964, <em>Watson v. Warden, </em>2 Md. App. 134. <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478 (1964) will also not afford applicant relief as there is no allegation nor any evidence that counsel was requested by applicant and denied by the police, see <em>Curnyn v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The second contention, that the oral statements should have been suppressed since they were made after being confronted with evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure, was considered twice by the Court of Appeals of Maryland. <em>Dailey v. State, </em>234 Md. 325; <em>Dailey v. State, </em>239 Md. 596.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both times it was held that although the arrest of applicant was illegal and the resulting search and seizure was unlawful, the statements made by applicant were freely and voluntarily given. Since <em>Dailey v. State, 239 </em>Md. 596 was an appeal from the conviction which is presently being contested in this petition, this issue has been \u201cfinally litigated\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (b) and thus cannot be raised again under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. <em>Husk v. Warden, </em>240 Md. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The third contention, that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the verdict, cannot be raised under the Act. <em>Husk v. Warden, supra; Fisher v. Warden, </em>230 Md. 612. This is a proper subject for direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Petitioner\u2019s fourth contention is that the judge at his trial was biased. The lower court held that this allegation was not properly raised under the Act on the authority of <em>Bryant v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 658. However, the law has changed and many contentions which were formerly not grounds for relief under the Act may now be raised. See <em>Fennell v. Warden, 236 </em>Md. 423; <em>Ledbetter v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 643. A contention of bias on the part of the trial judge is one that alleges a violation of the constitutional right to due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Tumey v. Ohio, 273 </em>U. S. 510, 47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927); <em>State v. Justice Court, </em>202 P. 2d 927 (Wash. 1949); <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>231 F. Supp. 37 (S. D. Ohio 1964); <em>Ex Parte Wallace, </em>152 P. 2d 1 (Calif. 1944); <em>United States v. Denno, </em>313 F. 2d 364 (2nd Cir. 1963), cert. den. 372 U. S. 978. Since the allegation of bias on the part of a trial judge is an allegation of a denial of due process, or deprivation of a constitutional right, it could be properly raised under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. See Md. Code (1967 Repl. -Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (a) ; <em>Jackson v. Warden, </em>236 Md. 634; <em>Gee v. State, </em>239 Md. 604. And this contention has been considered under the Act before. See <em>Jacobs v. Warden, 232 </em>Md. 627. However, since the lower court also found no bias, in fact, for this allegation, it will afford the applicant no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In regard to the fifth and sixth contentions, the court correctly found that applicant had freely and voluntarily waived his right to be retried by reason of the <em>Schowgurow </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>and that applicant\u2019s counsel was competent under the standard set forth in <em>Slater v. Warden, </em>241 Md. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-13\">. U. S. Cert, denied in 384 U. S. 913; U. S. Reh. denied in 384 U.
