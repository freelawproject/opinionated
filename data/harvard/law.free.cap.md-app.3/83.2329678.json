Raine, Jr., sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, denying relief sought under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">Petitioner was brought to trial on January 17, 1962, before Judge W. Albert Menchine in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on charges of assault and robbery, and escaping from a place of legal confinement. He pled guilty to these charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>and on this same day was sentenced to five years in the Maryland Penitentiary on the escape charge and to nine years on the assault and robbery charge, the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Petitioner states four grounds for relief in his amended petition filed on January 12, 1967:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">(1) His arrest without a warrant was illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">(2) The evidence obtained by the result of an illegal search and seizure should have been suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">(3) His escape was lawful since he was confined as a result of an illegal arrest, thus making his plea of guilty and the resulting sentence nullities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">(4) Incompetency of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">A prior habeas corpus proceeding was initiated on September 13, 1963, when applicant filed a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and alleged the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">1. Illegality of the arrest because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">(a) \u201cThe police could not have showed just cause for the arrest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">(b) The arrest was made by Baltimore County police officers within the limits of Baltimore City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">2. Illegal search of his apartment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">3. Incompetency of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">A hearing was held in open court on October 30, 1964, at which time the applicant testified. His attorney later submitted an eight page memorandum of authorities to support the contentions. The petition was denied by Judge Walter M. Jenifer in a well-reasoned eight page memorandum opinion and order filed on February 5, 1965. In it, Judge Jenifer found that applicant\u2019s escape from custody was illegal and a violation of the escape statute, Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 139, since he had found that the applicant had been \u201clegally detained and confined.\u201d He also fully considered all of the grounds alleged in the present petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">The Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201can allegation of error shall be deemed to be finally-litigated * * * when a Court of original jurisdiction, after a full and fair hearing, has rendered a decision on the merits thereof upon a petition for a writ of habeas corpus * * * unless said decision upon the merits of such petition is clearly erroneous.\u201d Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Since applicant has had a \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d on the merits of his contentions and the decision of Judge Jenifer in the lower court is not clearly erroneous, applicant\u2019s contentions have been finally litigated within the meaning of the Act and cannot be properly raised under the Act today. Despite this, Judge Raine fully considered all of the applicant\u2019s contentions. Thus, the applicant was given more consideration than he was entitled to receive and he has no reason to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Petitioner has also failed to comply with Md. Rule BK 46 (b), which requires that the application for leave to appeal \u201ccontain a brief statement of the reasons why the order should be reversed or modified.\u201d For this reason alone, the application should be denied.
