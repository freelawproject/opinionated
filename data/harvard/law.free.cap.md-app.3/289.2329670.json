Chapin </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-11\"><em>Bernard L. Silbert, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>and <em>Benjamin R. Woiman, Assistant State's Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b310-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">John Preston Poff appeals from his convictions by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of breaking a dwelling house with intent to steal and grand larceny and the concurrent sentences of four years on each conviction. He complains that the lower court improperly denied the admission of certain testimony and that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">The appellant first contends that the refusal of the lower court \u201c* * * to admit testimony of an impeaching witness as to the reputation of a witness for the State * * * was prejudicial error.\u201d He proffered, out of the presence of the jury, the testimony of Raymond Rudolph Mileski, who was indicted with him, to impeach the prosecuting witness. The proffered testimony was that the prosecuting witness was a \u201cfence\u201d\u2014a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ceiver of stolen goods.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe long settled practice, both in England and in this State * * *, requires that the witness called to prove character, either good or bad, should be interrogated as to his means of knowledge of the general reputation of the person in question among his neighbors, and, what that reputation is.\u201d <em>Sloan v. Edwards, </em>61 Md. 89, 103. The inquiry must be as to his reputation for truth and veracity. <em>Hoffman v. State, </em>93 Md. 388, 389. The examination must be confined to general reputation, and not be permitted as to particular facts. <em>Richardson v. State, </em>103 Md. 112, 118; <em>Rau v. State, </em>133 Md. 613, 616. Compare <em>Comi v. State, </em>202 Md. 472. \u201cThe regular mode of examining into the character of the person in question, is to ask the witness whether he knows his general reputation (for truth and veracity) among his neighbors,\u2014what that reputation is,\u2014and whether, from such knowledge, he would believe him upon his oath.\u201d <em>Sloan v. Edwards, supra, </em>at 103. In the instant case Mileski did not know the prosecuting witness, did not know others who knew him and had only heard his name mentioned several times by people Mileski did not know. \u201cI can\u2019t even recall the time or the place, but I was familiar somewhat with his name. * * * I never had any personal dealings with him.\u201d We think it clear that the proffered testimony was not properly admissible. Not only did Mileski not know the general reputation of the prosecuting witness for truth and veracity among his neighbors, but the inquiry here proposed had no reference to the general reputation of the witness for truth and veracity. It by no means follows that a reputation for being a \u201cfence,\u201d even if shown, and here it was not shown, necessarily includes a bad reputation for veracity. The lower court did not err in refusing to admit the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The appellant also proffered the testimony of Mileski to the effect that Mileski did not commit the crime for which he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the appellant were indicted. We think such testimony was in no way relevant to the guilt or innocence of the appellant. The appellant concedes that he is unable to cite any authority \u201cdirectly on the question of the relevancy\u201d of such testimony. We know of no authority holding it to be relevant and doubt the existence of any. The appellant urges that, by analogy, Md. Code, (1965 Repl. Vol.), Art. 35, \u00a7 4, as interpreted in <em>Kinnard v. State, </em>183 Md. 377, permits the testimony proffered. The statute provides that the person charged, at his own request, shall be deemed a competent witness. <em>Kinnard </em>held that one co-defendant is competent to testify against another co-defendant, on trial together, under a joint indictment, even over the objection of the defendant against whom the testimony is proffered. 183 Md. at 383. Neither the statute nor the case are apposite here, where Mileski\u2019s testimony would be that he, Mile-ski, although indicted, was innocent of the crime. See <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 11. We note that at the request of the appellant the docket entries were admitted in evidence, and that the docket entries showed that the case against Mileski had been stetted. We find no error in the refusal of the lower court to admit the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">With regard to the sufficiency of the evidence, the contention goes to the identification of the appellant, the appellant urging that the testimony of \u201cthe only eyewitness to the alleged crimes was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty.\u201d He concedes that the rule in this State is that the identification of a single eyewitness, if believed, is sufficient to support a conviction. <em>Turner v. State, </em>242 Md. 408; <em>Crumb v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 98. He argues, however, that the testimony of the eyewitness, Alfonzo Williams, in the instant case was so contradictory as to have no probative force. <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334. The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are a matter for the trier of facts, <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362; <em>Scott v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 481, and we do not agree that Williams\u2019 testimony was so inconsistent that it should not have been accepted. <em>Bell v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 471. Williams, a youth 15 years of age, stated that on the day the victim\u2019s apartment was broken into, he had been working outside the building on the lawn. He knew the location of the victim\u2019s apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and he was in the hall of the building when he saw three men leave the apartment \u201ccarrying stuff with them.\u201d Each of them was carrying something. He identified, the appellant as one of them. He saw them get in a station wagon in the parking lot and drive off. He said that he saw the men \u201cclose-up,\u201d that he knew the number of the apartment and that he could see the station wagon in the parking lot. The fact that, on direct examination, he gave the time he saw the men as \u201cabout three, something like that. I was getting ready to get off from work,\u201d and on cross examination said the time was \u201ctwo or something like that,\u201d that on being questioned about the length of the appellant\u2019s hair on the day of the crime, he said, \u201cI am not sure, but I think it was\u201d a little bit longer than at the time of the trial, although the wife of the appellant and another witness for the defense testified that it was shorter at the time of the crime than at the time of the trial, and that there was an alleged inconsistency in his identification of another participant in the crime do not, taking the testimony of the witness as a whole, make his testimony so contradictory that it had no probative force. So finding, we cannot say that there was no legally sufficient evidence or inferences drawable therefrom on which the jury could find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and we shall not overturn the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">. It is clear that the appellant was attempting to show the alleged bad character of the prosecuting witness and that the-proffer was not directed toward impeachment by contradictory proof, by proof of former inconsistent statements or by proof tending to show bias or interest.
