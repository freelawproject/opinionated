Four children were born of the marriage, the oldest, as of May 1966, being 12 years of age and the youngest 5 years of age. For the first four years of the marriage all went well, but the marriage relationship from that time on was marked by frequent beatings by the husband of his wife. Although the husband drank excessively, the beatings appeared to be the result of his violent temper rather than alcohol. He beat her up and blackened her eyes \u201cmany a times,\u201d gave her a \u201cbloody nose, bloody mouth,\u201d broke her teeth, making it necessary for her to get a dental plate, hit her in the ear causing a hearing defect, broke her eyeglasses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>about five or six times\u2014\u201cthat is what he would hit for first because I can\u2019t see without my glasses\u201d\u2014kicked her in the stomach, pulled her hair, knocked her down, beat her with his fist and whipped her with a belt. He would beat her up because \u201cthat is just the way he was. He just had a bad temper and would beat me up just for little things I did around the house or for mistakes I made.\u201d He destroyed the household effects while in his angry moods and in 1965 she bought five sets of new dishes because he broke \u201call the others that I had.\u201d He called her a whore and cursed her in the presence of the children and taunted her as being only half a woman after she had a hysterectomy. He beat the children on occasions and compelled them to watch while he beat her. She called the police on only one occasion in January 1966, because he told her that if she ever reported the beatings he would kill her and the children. She also did not want him arrested because she thought \u201cit might make him lose his job at the mill or something like that.\u201d He was a good provider, giving her all but about $15 of his weekly check of between $50 and $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">About October 1965 Howard Hott became ill \u201cin the form mostly of gastrointestinal complaints, nausea, vomiting and stomach ache pain that cleared up.\u201d In December of that same year he had \u201csome swelling of his face and redness of his eyes an&lt;i * * * some more abdominal pain.\u201d He began to have burning and tingling sensations in his fingers and toes. On February 1, 1966 he was admitted to Potomac Valley Hospital complaining of recurrent vomiting, discomfort in the upper abdomen, a skin rash on the hands and feet and a tingling sensation of the hands and feet. Routine laboratory and X-ray studies indicated he had \u201can ulcer in the first part of the small intestine just below the stomach. It was initially felt that this ulcer could have caused his vomiting and discomfort in the upper abdomen and he was started on routine ulcer management.\u201d He was in the hospital until February 10th and his condition seemed to improve. When he was discharged \u201che had persistent numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, but otherwise he was essentially asymptomatic.\u201d The day following his discharge from the hospital he again began to have recurrent vomiting and discomfort in the upper abdomen. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>readmitted to the hospital on February 13, 1966 and \u201chis condition had deteriorated considerably. At that time he complained of rather severe headache, recurring vomiting, discomfort in the upper abdomen, weakness of the upper extremities, and of the lower extremities, making it somewhat difficult for him to walk and the parasthesia or numbness of his hands and feet had increased.\u201d The exact cause for this set of symptoms was not apparent to his physician and on February 17th he was transferred to West Virginia University Medical Center. At that time \u201che was seriously ill * * * and his condition was deteriorating relatively rapidly.\u201d His pulse was fast, his heart rate was fast, his skin was dry and his mouth, throat and the lining inside his eyes were dry and inflamed. He had a scaling red rash on his body and decreased breath sounds in the base of both lungs. There was no evidence of heart failure except the fast heart rate and a chest X-ray confirmed this. He could not move his arms and legs and his reflexes were diseased. Based on symptoms, findings and laboratory data the conclusion clinically was that he was suffering from arsenic intoxication. He died March 2, 1966. The final clinical diagnosis was death due to arsenic intoxication. The conclusion on the findings of the autopsy was that the cause of death was \u201ccardiac failure secondary to myocarditis, which was produced by arsenic.\u201d An analysis was made of specimens of the deceased\u2019s liver, bones, hair and fingernails. Arsenic was present in each.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">On March 30, 1966 the wife of the deceased gave a statement to the police which was reduced to writing, subscribed and swmrn to by her. She described the marital relationship substantially as heretofore summarized. She said that in September 1965 her husband \u201cbrought home a bottle of poison and poured it along the cellar walls\u201d because there were termites in the cellar. He used it all and brought home a second bottle which he placed on a window-shelf in the basement \u201cright beside the door that goes outside.\u201d On Monday or Tuesday before Halloween, either October 25th or 26th 1965 she \u201cstarted to put it in Howard\u2019s coffee * * * I put it in his coffee for supper that night.\u201d She put about a half an inch of the poison in his cup of coffee. Fie drank it. He had slapped her and called her a w'hore two days before and \u201cit took me that long to get enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>nerve to do it.\u201d She put about the same amount of poison in his coffee at supper three or four days before Thanksgiving, about November 22, 1965 and again the day after Christmas, 1965. Either Friday or Saturday, January 14th or 15th, 1966 she and her husband had been out and when they arrived home he shoved her for no reason at all. Her brother was present and her husband hit her \u201cthree or four times\u201d and pulled her hair. Her brother made him stop. Her husband asked for another cup of coffee. \u201cWhen he said that, I thought that would be a good time to give him another shot.\u201d She brought the poison bottle up from the cellar, poured the same amount as before in a cup, filled the cup with coffee and gave it to her husband. \u201cHe drank the cups of coffee each of the four times I put the poison in them.\u201d After that she did not give him \u201cany additional poison * * * he got sick on Sunday, January 30, 1966, and that\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t have to give him any more.\u201d She agreed to give the bottle and its remaining contents to the police and accompanied them to her home. She gave them a pint bottle of \u201cElkays Insect Killer.\u201d It had been locked in a cabinet in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On April 4, 1966 the grand jury presented that Doris Helene Hott did \u201cmurder Howard Vernon Hott by administering a certain poison.\u201d An indictment was returned against her and she was tried in the Circuit Court of Allegany County before a jury. On May 17, 1966 she was found guilty of poisoning and defiling and corrupting and contaminating certain drink or food of Howard Vernon Hott, which was the offense charged in the second count of the four count indictment, the other counts charging the offenses of murder by poison, attempt to commit the offense of which she was convicted and attempt to poison. On June 22, 1966 she was sentenced to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 8 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On appeal from the judgment it is contended that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction and that the written statement given by her to the police was improperly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The offense of which the appellant was convicted is proscribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 451, Md. Code (1967 Repl. VoL). The section consists of only one sentence but contains two parts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>first part concerns the corruption or contamination of sources of domestic water supply \u201cby means of disease germs or bacteria or the insertion of any other poison or poisonous matter therein.\u201d The second part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201c* * * and every person, his aiders and abettors, who, by like means, knowingly and wilfully poisons, defiles or in any way corrupts or contaminates any drink, food or food products or supply, or attempts so to do, or conspires or connives thereat; shall be guilty of a felony * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">It is clear, therefore, that the poisoning, defiling, corruption or contamination of drink or food must be by means of disease germs, bacteria, poison or poisonous matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">There was in evidence two definitions of poison. A resident physician in internal medicine at the West Virginia University Medical Center defined it, according to Dorland\u2019s Medical Dictionary, as \u201cany substance when injected into, digested, absorbed, applied or made within the body itself or inhaled, can cause damage to structure or disturbance of functioning.\u201d An \u201cassistant toxicologist to the Chief Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in Baltimore\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cA poison, in very broad terms, is any substance absorbed by any roots to any significant amount which proves detrimental to the health or causes death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">A chemist for the West Virginia State Police made an analysis of Elkays Insect Killer and found no arsenic in it. He stated that the compounds contained in the solution \u201ccould be harmful, but it takes a fairly large quantity of it to be harmful.\u201d He was unable to give an opinion as to how great a quantity would prove harmful to a human being but he did not believe that the amount of liquid shown to have been taken out of the bottle of the insect killer given to the police by the appellant over a period of four months would have any deleterious effect mixed with coffee. Nor could the toxicologist give a definite answer as to what quantity would have to be taken in order for it to be toxic or harmful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to answer this question. Lots of things have to be considered. What amount might be fatal or what amount might cause an ill effect. Considering that a man who is healthy was impaired already, for example, by abuse of alcohol, it might be quite different and be much less amount of the substance to be injurious to health. We do know definitely from the literature, for example, that quite a margin exists in taking such substances from small amounts up to one liter. Even so, the question cannot be easily answered by saying well, one gram or ten milliliters is poisonous or toxic or harmful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">His analysis showed that the principal ingredient, 99.5 per cent, of Elkays was a solvent, a hydrocarbon, which he referred to in plain terms as kerosene. There was a \u201cvery, very small concentration of the three chemicals which are considered as insect killers * * *. If you take now a cupful of this substance, even a coffee cup full of this substance, there might only be a few drops or a few crystals of this insect killer in it (the rest being the solvent, kerosene) * * * so the harmful effect of the solvent has to be considered primarily, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">It has been consistently held that in order to overturn a judgment entered on the verdict of a jury for insufficiency of the evidence, it is necessary that there be no legally sufficient evidence or rational inferences drawable therefrom on which the jury could find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Agresti v. </em>State, 2 Md. App. 278, 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We agree with the appellant that the evidence adduced was not sufficient to show' that the coffee, by the introduction in it of Elkays, was poisoned, defiled or in any way corrupted or contaminated by the means required by the statute. Elkays was not shown to be a poison within the definitions. One expert did not believe that the amount of the substance alleged to have been placed in the coffee over a period of four months would have any deleterious effect. It appeared from the testimony of the other expert that the three chemicals considered as insect killers in the substance were not in sufficient quantity in the coffee to be harmful and that if the Elkays was harmful to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the deceased it would have to be from the solvent, kerosene. But there is no evidence that his illness was caused by the kerosene. On the contrary, his illness and death were from arsenic poisoning, and no arsenic was found in Elkays. However, this finding is not dispositive of the case. The proof of the charge under which the appellant was convicted was not limited to Elkays Insect Killer as the means of poisoning the food, and the question is whether there was sufficient evidence or rational inferences drawable therefrom on which the jury could find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of contaminating the food or drink of her husband by means of arsenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We think it clear from the evidence that arsenic is a poison \u2014it was the cause of the death of Howard Vernon Hott. The internist produced by the State stated that the most common form of arsenic, arsenic trioxide, is <em>\u201ca </em>white powder, practically tasteless and odorless.\u201d In her statement the appellant said the label of the bottle containing the substance which she put in her husband\u2019s coffee contained the word \u201cPoison.\u201d She said, I read the label and it said, \u2018Do Not Take Internally\u2019 and \u2018Poison.\u2019 \u201d Asked how the word \u201cPoison\u201d was written out, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t remember but it said \u201cPoison.\u201d On the stand she admitted saying that. The bottle of Elkays given by her to the police did not contain the word \u201cPoison\u201d anywhere on the labels. Although the label on the back of the bottle cautions: \u201cHarmful if swallowed,\u201d the labels do not say \u201cDo Not Take Internally.\u201d Further in her statement upon being asked when she noticed the words on the label of the bottle of poison, \u201cDo Not Take Internally\u201d and \u201cPoison\u201d she replied, \u201cWhen Howard was pouring it out one time, I don\u2019t remember when it was.\u201d The word \u201cpoison\u201d in describing what she gave her husband is used some forty-five times in the statement, once in her own handwriting when she interlined, \u201cPie drank the cups of coffee each of the four times I put the poison in them,\u201d but the substance is never referred to as Elkays and when asked if she knew what kind of poison she was administering to her husband she said \u201cno,\u201d explaining in her testimony that she so answered \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t any poison * * * I knew it wouldn\u2019t hurt him because I stuck my finger down in the bottle and tasted it myself.\u201d Yet she also said that she decided to poison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>her husband because of the beatings, \u201cI was going to hurt him like he hurt me.\u201d She also said in her statement that the bottle was full when she started to give it to her husband and that after putting it in his coffee four times it was <em>\u201ca </em>little over half full.\u201d The bottle given to the police was marked by them to show the height of the contents. The mark indicated that it was over three-quarters full. Elkays, on its labels, represents that it \u201ccontrols flies, mosquitoes, ants, several types of roaches, water bugs, centipedes, silverfish, gnats, bed bugs and clothes moths.\u201d Termites are not mentioned, but her husband bought something to kill what he thought were termites. There was testimony that forms of arsenic, calcium arsenate and lead arsenate, are in other insecticides. The toxicologist testified that he poured some of the Elkays Insect Killer into a cup of coffee because \u201c* * * when I was confronted first with the problem I got this bottle, which has a certain odor and which I immediately saw is an immersible solvent with water. I wondered how that could be, how can it be mixed because it won\u2019t mix. If you pour that into any liquid solution like coffee or water or what have you you certainly will have a separation of the two layers. It\u2019s like oil pouring on water. It doesn\u2019t mix with it. It stays as a clear layer on top of it. It has a peculiar faint odor and I wondered, without knowing anything about the case, how anybody could drink such a thing, if he is not, if you permit me to say, drunk. He would immediately recognize there is something which doesn\u2019t belong in it. So, without knowing anything about the case, I just wondered, * * *, how anybody could drink such a thing.\u201d We think, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that it was not the Elkays Insect Killer that the appellant put in her husband\u2019s coffee and that the bottle she gave to the police did not contain the substance she put in his coffee. Whether she gave that bottle to the police by mistake or on purpose is immaterial. But it does not follow that there was no evidence or rational inferences therefrom sufficient for the jury to find that she put arsenic in the coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">During her husband\u2019s illness the attending physicians talked to her several times about poison per se and arsenic, but she made no mention to them of what she had done because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>was \u201cafraid.\u201d Asked if she realized that if she told the doctors that she had given her husband poison \u201cthey would have a better chance of getting Howard better or saving his life,\u201d she said, \u201cI never thought of that.\u201d There was testimony, without objection, from a sister of the deceased that the deceased said in the hospital in the presence of the appellant, that he wished his wife would get out of the room, \u201cshe has tried to poison me too many times.\u201d The appellant made no reply. Another witness, a friend of the deceased, visited the deceased at his home on February 12, 1966. This witness testified, without objection, that the deceased, \u201cout of a clear, blue sky sat up on the bed and said, T believe the old woman is trying to poison me with arsenic.\u2019 \u201d The appellant \u201cwas sitting on the other side of the bed and she looked at me and she filled up with tears and said, \u2018ain\u2019t that awful, the way I have been taking care of him.\u2019 And that is all that was said about that.\u201d The deceased was employed by the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Mill. A criminal investigator of the Maryland State police testified that he made an investigation at the Mill which showed that no arsenic was used there, \u201ceverything that they use is * * * Federal Drug Administration approved.\u201d The appellant was asked by the police on March 30, 1966 if her husband had any insurance on his life and she replied, \u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about any insurance. He always took care of that.\u201d She denied that any insurance company had been in touch with her and said she had not received any insurance money. \u201cI have a little over $300 and have been living on that.\u201d The mother-in-law, father-in-law, and two sisters-in-law of the appellant testified that on January 2, 1966 the appellant said that if anything happened to Howard \u201cI will be a rich widow.\u201d There was evidence that the appellant was the beneficiary of an \u201cimmediate relief fund\u201d from the employer of her husband in the amount of $1102.50 and under a group insurance policy in the amount of $6000. There was testimony from an insurance agent that the appellant was the beneficiary under two insurance contracts totalling $15,460 and that he had discussed them with the deceased and the appellant in March of 1963. He had called on the appellant about March 8, 1966, received the policies from her and completed the claim forms. At the time of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>only $500 had been, paid to the appellant and this from the amount due under the immediate relief fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It is not disputed that the appellant put something in her husband\u2019s coffee on four separate occasions, the latter part of each of October, November and December 1965 and the middle of January 1966. Her husband first became <em>ill in </em>October 1965. In December 1965 he had \u201cswelling of his face and redness of his eyes * * * some more abdominal pains\u201d and burning and tingling sensations in his fingers and toes. He became much worse on January 30, 1966 and was admitted to the hospital on February 1st. He improved enough to be discharged but the day after he returned home he began to have recurrent vomiting and discomfort in the upper abdomen. After three days at home his condition had deteriorated considerably and he was readmitted to the hospital. He died on March 2nd and it was determined that his illness and death were due to arsenic poisoning. From the evidence, the appellant had a primary motive and obvious opportunity to administer poison to her husband. We do not inquire into and measure the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether the State has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, as that is the prerogative of the trier of facts. But we think it clear that the evidence and proper inferences therefrom were sufficient to show that the appellant had contaminated the coffee of her husband by means of arsenic and that the jury, on such evidence and inferences could find the appellant guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The contention that the written statement given by the appellant to the police was improperly admitted in evidence is predicated upon the allegation that the guidelines enunciated in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, were not followed by the police in obtaining the statement. She does not contend that it was otherwise involuntary. <em>Miranda </em>is only applicable to those cases, the trial of which began after June 13, 1966. <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719; <em>Boone v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 80. The appellant\u2019s trial began May 16, 1966 and <em>Miranda </em>is not available to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
