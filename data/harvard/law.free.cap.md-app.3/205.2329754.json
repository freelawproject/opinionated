Carter, sitting in the \u2022Criminal Court of Baltimore, denying relief sought under the \u25a0Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In his petition, and at his evidentiary hearing, the applicant raised eleven contentions which were disposed of by the lower \u2022court as affording the applicant no relief. We agree with the \u25a0court\u2019s disposition of all petitioner\u2019s contentions except the tenth, <em>viz., </em>that a confession, which was introduced into \u25a0evidence at his trial, was signed when he was intoxicated. This was disposed of by the lower court on the ground that while the issue of the voluntariness of a confession could be raised \u25a0on appeal, it could not be attacked collaterally under the Act. .Although this was formerly the law, <em>Whitley v. Warden, </em>222 Md. 608, in the later case of <em>Ledbetter v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 643, it was held, in effect, that the voluntariness of a confession \u2022could be raised under the Act. See also <em>Strosnider v. Warden, 245 </em>Md. 692; <em>Dennis v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">That petitioner has a right to raise such contention on post \u2022conviction is, of course, subject to the provisions of the Act with regard to waiver. See Section 645A(c) of Article 27 of the Maryland Code (1967 Repl. Vol.). Appellant did not appeal from his original conviction, although he raised the voluntariness issue at his trial. In his petition under the Act, the applicant does not appear to set forth any special circumstances to excuse his failure to appeal, and it may be that he has waived his right to now raise the question on post conviction. See <em>Bagley v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 154. Whether \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exist, however, is initially a matter for the determination of the trial judge. We shall, therefore, remand the case for further consideration of appellant\u2019s tenth contention concerning the voluntariness of his confession. Should the trial judge \u25a0determine that the waiver provisions of the Act are not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>plicable, then, of course, he must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the voluntariness of applicant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>Application granted; case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
