Hale and violently did steal from her forty-five dollars, the property of High\u2019s Dairy Products Division of Capitol Milk Producers Co-operative, Inc., a body corporate t/a High\u2019s Dairy Store. Specifically he contends that the ownership by the corporation was not proven. Since it was not necessary to allege ownership it is obvious that it was not necessary to prove it. The statutory form of indictment for armed robbery, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 489, as well as the statutory form for robbery, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 487, do not require an allegation of ownership.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Lee v. State, </em>238 Md. 224, 208 A. 2d 375, and <em>Sippio v. State, 227 </em>Md. 449, 177 A. 2d 261 held that proof of ownership was not required. This Court made the same holding in <em>Harrison v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 148, 238 A. 2d 153. What the cases do require is that the victim be the owner or have a legal interest or special property in what was stolen as for example be in \u201clawful possession as bailee.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the issue of lawful custody of the victim the evidence here was clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The testimony of Irene Hale was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201cQ.

Yes, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>McMillan, in proper person, alleges that he was denied \u201cdue process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution\u201d in the manner in which the Grand and Petty Juries were selected. He did not comply with Maryland Rules 725 and 744 requiring that such challenges be made prior to trial. The issue was not presented to the tidal court so we are ordinarily precluded, under Maryland Rule 1085, from considering it. Anticipating our decision, McMillan alleges that these rules are unconstitutional citing no authority therefor. State procedural requirements have been upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. See <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 84 A.L.R.2d 933, n. 9; <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U. S. 443, 448, 85 S. Ct. 564, 567, 13 L. Ed. 2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In a supplemental paper McMillan makes other allegations. Under Maryland Rule 1031 we need not consider issues which are not presented and argued in the briefs. In addition these issues were not presented to or ruled on by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-11\">. \u201cIn any indictment or warrant for robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon and attempt to rob with a dangerous or deadly weapon, it shall be sufficient to use a formula substantially to the following effect: \u2018That A-B on the - day of -, 19\u2014, in the County (City) aforesaid feloniously with a dangerous and deadly weapon did rob C-D (or did attempt with a dangerous and deadly weapon to rob C-D, as the case may be) and violently did steal (or attempt to steal, as the case may be) from him - dollars (here list property stolen); contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such cases made and provided and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u2019 \u201d Md.
