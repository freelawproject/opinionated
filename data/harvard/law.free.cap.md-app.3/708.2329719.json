White, III, </em>on the brief, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b730-13\"><em>Fred Oken, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, </em>and <em>William Parsons Pennell, State\u2019s Attorney for Kent County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b730-14\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">The appellant was found guilty by a jury in the Circuit Court for Kent County of five offenses of uttering a false check. On \u2022each offense the judgment of the court was that he restore the property taken or pay the full value thereof. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 2 years on the first offense. A like term was imposed on each of the other four offenses, each \u2022of those sentences to run consecutively with each of the sentences imposed prior to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">On appeal the appellant attacks the validity of each of the judgments by contending that the lineup in which he appeared was not conducted in a fair and impartial manner. The short answer is that testimony as to the identification of the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>at the lineup and his identification in court came into evidence in the State\u2019s case on direct examination of a police officer and six other witnesses without objection and the witnesses were cross-examined at length on the matter by appellant\u2019s counsel. There was no motion to strike the testimony. The point not being tried and decided by the lower court, it is not properly before this Court and we do not deem it necessary or desirable for us to decide it within the purview of Md. Rule, 1085. See <em>Bell v. </em>State, <em>2 </em>Md. App. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The appellant attacks two of the judgments against him on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the convictions with regard to them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arguments as to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the challenged convictions go only to the identification of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Evidence adduced by the State showed that 100 blank drafts of the Cnited States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, numbers 222301 to 222401, had been found to be missing from that Company\u2019s supply. Five of them, numbers 222313, 222314, 222316, 222317 and 222399, proved to be forged, were the basis of the charges against the appellant. Each of them, the blanks filled out by typewriter, were identical except for a fictitious claim number. Each was dated July 5, 1966, payable to the order of Floyd Dover, 4008 Cedardale Rd., Baltimore 15, Maryland, in the amount of $95 and designated the date of the accident as February 17, 1966. Each bore an unauthorized countersignature, '\u201cVan Crawford\u201d and each was endorsed \u201cLloyd Dover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Mathilda Wessell, a note teller of the Maryland National Bank, testified that she cashed draft No. 222314. Asked who gave her the check to cash she said, \u201cI think it was the defendant, but I am not absolutely sure. It was a busy evening.\u201d She designated the appellant as the man to whom she referred. She said she had identified the appellant at a lineup. \u201cI picked him out among the group that was there. As I say, the night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>I cashed the check it was a busy evening, but he was the one that I thought, felt pretty sure was the man I cashed the check for.\u201d She also had picked his photograph from among four photographs shown her. She had no difficulty picking out the photograph of the appellant. \u201cI thought it was the picture. I knew it wasn\u2019t any of the others. I felt pretty sure that this was the picture of the man I had seen, that I cashed the check for. I knew it was not any of the other pictures that I saw.\u201d On cross-examination she said, \u201cI feel sure it was the defendant. I couldn\u2019t swear to it.\u201d Asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not positive?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo sir.\u201d The police officer who conducted the lineup testified that she had picked the appellant \u201cout as the man who' had cashed the check\u201d but as she \u201cwalked out in the hall (after viewing the lineup) she said, \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s him, I\u2019m almost sure that\u2019s him.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Alex Rasin, an employee of The Peoples Bank of Chester-town testified that he cashed draft No. 222317. The appellant and another man came into the bank and came up to the window. Rasin identified the appellant as one of the men. He had been shown some photographs but was unable to identify the appellant from the photographs shown him. Later he attended a lineup and \u201cI was able to positively point out the defendant as one of the two men that presented the check to me * * * I had no difficulty whatsoever then.\u201d Asked during his testimony, \u201cDo you have any doubt now that the defendant in the Courtroom today was one of the men that participated in this transaction wherein a check was cashed by you at People\u2019s Bank * * *?\u201d he replied, \u201cNo sir, no doubt whatsoever.\u201d The police officer who conducted the lineup testified that when Rasin viewed the lineup \u201che pointed to the defendant as the one immediately as he walked in the room.\u201d But while Rasin was positive in his identification of the appellant as one of the two men who came up to his window and requested the draft be cashed, he could not say which of the two endorsed the check and showed him a Maryland driver\u2019s license for identification, representing himself as \u201cLloyd Dover.\u201d He said, \u201cI cannot remember which one presented the check. They were together and one of them presented it and one of them signed it and one of the men is the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The five indictments under which the appellant was charged were consolidated for trial. There was evidence before the jury, as the appellant concedes, sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had uttered three other similar false drafts about the same time he uttered the two here discussed. The evidence with regard to those other three charges was relevant, not only as to the guilt of the appellant as to those specific charges, but also as to his guilt with respect to the drafts cashed at the Maryland National Bank and The Peoples Bank of Chestertown. The Court of Appeals said in <em>Ward v. State, </em>219 Md. 559, 562-563:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201cAn accused must be convicted by evidence which shows that he is guilty of the offense charged; and, under ordinary circumstances, evidence that he has done other acts which constitute a crime has no relevance towards showing that he did that with which he is presently charged. If, however, the evidence of another offense has a natural tendency to establish, or offers a reasonable presumption or inference as to, a principal fact at issue or matter in dispute, it should be admitted even though it discloses other offenses, (cases cited). This Court said in <em>Purviance v. State, </em>185 Md. 189, 196: \u2018While guilt cannot be established by proving that the defendant has committed other crimes, it is firmly established that evidence of acts may be admitted to show motive, intent, absence of mistake or accident, a common scheme, or identity embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Thus the evidence as to the cashing of substantially identical drafts at three other places, at about the same time as the cashing of the two drafts which were the basis of the charges here challenged, was relevant with respect to convictions here attacked on the element of guilty knowledge of the appellant in uttering the drafts, on the issue of a scheme or plan to cash a series of identical forged drafts to obtain goods and money from various merchants and business establishments and on the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>tion of identity. <em>Bishop v. State, </em>55 Md. 138; <em>Bell v. State, </em>57 Md. 108; <em>Lyman v. State, </em>136 Md. 40; <em>Mazer v. State, </em>212 Md. 60. Further, with regard to the testimony of Mrs. Wessell, the lack of positiveness of the identification of the appellant affected only its weight and the sufficiency of the identification was a matter for the jury to determine. <em>Logan v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 213, 217. And with regard to the testimony of Rasin, it is clear that the appellant was one of the two men who-participated in the cashing of the draft. It was immaterial whether the appellant was the one who in fact physically presented the draft to Rasin or was the other participant. Assuming that he was not the one who actually presented the draft and forged the endorsement, by his presence in concert with the actual perpetrator, in a position to assist if necessary, or prevent interference or detection, or for the purposes of encouragement at the moment of the commission of the felony, he was a principal in the second degree, the evidence showing that the one here assumed <em>arguendo </em>to have presented the check was a principal in the first degree. <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 278, 280; Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 44. As to indictment, conviction and punishment, there is no distinction between-principals in the first and second degree. <em>McEntire v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 449, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">This Court does not weigh the evidence presented to the jury, but only determines its sufficiency to take a particular issue, or the entire case, to the jury, when the point is properly preserved. It has been consistently held that in order to overturn a judgment entered on a verdict of a jury for insufficiency of the evidence it is necessary that there be no legally sufficient evidence or inferences drawable therefrom on which the jury could find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Quinn v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 373, 375. In the instant case, we find that there was such legally sufficient evidence before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\">. The record includes a written motion for judgment of acquittal which was presented to the court and denied at the close of the evidence offered by the State and \u201cre-presented\u201d and denied at the close of all the evidence. The motions and actions thereon do not appear in the transcript of the trial but are reflected in the \u2022docket entries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
