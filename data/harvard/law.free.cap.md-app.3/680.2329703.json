Long and Nelson, </em>1 Md. App. 326, 230 A. 2d 119, <em>Kelly v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 730, 237 A. 2d 459. For a discussion of these various factors see 51 Virginia Law Review 1587. Waiver will, of course, dispose of a case, but the other three factors are relative and must be considered together in arriving at a decision in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">I Questioned Time</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Although we have set out all important dates connected with this case since July 17, 1959 Hall complains of only the delay between February 11, 1964, the date of his last trial which resulted in a mistrial because of the inability of the jury to agree on a verdict, and December 19, 1966 when he was reindicted after his election to void his prior indictment pursuant to <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, 213 A. 2d 475. We agree with counsel that the time prior to February 11, 1964 and subsequent to December 19, 1966 do not contribute to the denial of a speedy trial. <em>State v. Murdock, </em>235 Md. 116, 200 A. 2d 666, <em>State v. Long and Nelson, supra. </em>We now examine what transpired in the questioned period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">(a) Preliminary Period</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">We hold that the record shows that Hall waived his right to a speedy trial by several affirmative acts between February 11, 1964 and June 29, 1965, which we call the \u201cPreliminary Period.\u201d During this period Hall kept the prosecutors and the courts busy with a number of proceedings :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">1. Between April 3, 1964 and April 30, 1964\u2014Motion to suppress evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">2. Between May 12, 1964 and <em>August </em>12, 1964\u2014Motion for transcript (granted in part) and reconsideration of motion to suppress (denied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">3. August 12, 1964\u2014Preparation of partial transcript of prior trial ordered (record does not disclose when transcript was filed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>4. Between January 11, 1965 and March 24, 1965\u2014Removal of case to Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">5. Between March 24, 1965 and April 19, 1965\u2014-Setting of trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">6. Between May 5, 1965 and June 8, 1965\u2014-Petition of Defendant\u2019s counsel for postponement until after June 8, 1965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Waiver of a speedy trial need not be express but may be by acts of the accused, <em>State v. Murdock, supra, State v. Long and Nelson, supra. </em>It should also be noted that prior to June 29, 1965 there was no demand for a speedy trial which in itself has been treated as a waiver. <em>Harris v. State, </em>194 Md. 288, 71 A. 2d 36, <em>Allen v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 249, 229 A. 2d 446, <em>Manning v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 177, 233 A. 2d 821.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">(b) Second Period</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">On June 29, 1965 there was a demand for speedy trial filed with the Administrative Office of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Between June 29, 1965 and January 14, 1966 the appellant\u2019s counsel met with the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County and requested a prompt trial. We think this \u201cSecond Period\u201d is the crucial period because more than six months elapsed when the only activity of record by either side was the appellant\u2019s demands for trial. Relying on <em>Harris v. State, supra, </em>the State contends that the application for a speedy trial must be made to a court, and not to the State\u2019s Attorney or to an administrative official. Although subsequent cases seem to have raised some question as to the necessity for the application being made to the court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we do not need to decide that point here because we have no hesitancy in holding that where a trial court has appointed an assignment clerk to set cases for trial an application to that official is the same as an application to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The basic rule interpreting \u201cspeedy trial\u201d guaranteed by the State and Federal Constitutions, Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States was stated and applied by this court in <em>Fabian v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 270, 239 A. 2d 100, and in <em>State v. Long and Nelson, supra. </em>In those cases we quoted from <em>Jones v. State, </em>241 Md. 599, 608, 217 A. 2d 367, 373, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201c22A C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 467 a (4), states the general rule thus:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u2018A speedy trial is, in general, one had as soon as the prosecution, with reasonable diligence, can prepare for it; a trial according to fixed rules, free from capricious and oppressive delays, but the time within which it must be had to satisfy the guaranty depends on the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In a recent case the Supreme Court of the United States set out the speedy trial doctrine fully, <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U. S. 116, 119, 86 S. Ct. 773, 776, 15 L. Ed. 2d 627:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cWe cannot agree that the passage of 19 months between the original arrests and the hearings on the later indictments itself demonstrates a violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a speedy trial. This guarantee is an important safeguard to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial, to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself. However, in large measure because of the many procedural safeguards provided an accused, the ordinary procedures for criminal prosecution are designed to move at a deliberate pace. A requirement of unreasonable speed would have a deleterious effect both upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself. Therefore, this Court has consistently been of the view that \u2018The right of a speedy trial is necessarily relative. It is consistent with delays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>and depends upon circumstances. It secures rights to a defendant. It does not preclude the rights of public justice.\u2019 <em>Beavers v. Haubert, </em>198 U. S. <em>77, </em>87, 25 S. Ct. 573, 576, 49 L. Ed. 950. \u2018Whether delay in completing a prosecution * * * amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of rights depends upon the circumstances. * * * The delay must not be purposeful or oppressive,\u2019 <em>Pollard v. United States, </em>352 U. S. 354, 361, 77 S. Ct. 481, 486, 1 L. Ed. 2d 393. \u2018[T]he essential ingredient is orderly expedition and not mere speed.\u2019 <em>Smith v. United States, </em>360 U. S. 1, 10, 79 S. Ct. 991, 997, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1041.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We hold that during this \u201cSecond Period\u201d the prosecuting officials of this State were faced with difficult and unusual conditions and therefore the delay was reasonable and not purposeful or oppressive for the following reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">In <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>313 F. 2d 483 (January 17, 1963) <em>cert. denied, sub nom. Pepersack v. Hall, </em>374 U. S. 809, 83 S. Ct. 1693, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1032 the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the present appellant relief based on the retroactivity of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (Illegal searches and seizures). On June 7, 1965, the Supreme Court of the United States reached a contrary result in <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U. S. 618, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601. After a long delay, the State filed a motion on March 25, 1966 to vacate the judgment in <em>Hall v. Warden, supra. </em>The motion was denied July 26, 1966, <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>364 F. 2d 495. If this were the only complication during what we have designated the \u201cCrucial Period\u201d we would reverse, but there was another which caused considerably greater problems for the prosecutor in this case as well as for prosecutors throughout the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">On October 11, 1965 the Court of Appeals of Maryland decided <em>Schowgurow v. State, supra, </em>which held that virtually all juries within this State were illegally constituted because the individual members were required to have expressed a belief in God. <em>Schowgurow </em>was a Buddist and did not believe in God. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The decision was held to be prospective only except as to convictions which had not then become final.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On October 21, 1965 the same court decided <em>State v. Madison, </em>240 Md. 265, 213 A. 2d 880 applying the <em>Schowgurow </em>doctrine even though the accused believed in God.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On November 30, 1965 the same court decided <em>Smith v. State, </em>240 Md. 464, 214 A. 2d 563 which held that the <em>Schowgurow </em>defect in an indictment could be expressly waived. <em>Hays v. State, </em>240 Md. 482, 214 A. 2d 573, decided the same date held that such a defect could not be impliedly waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On January 14, 1966 Hall elected to vacate his prior indictment under the <em>Schowgurow </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The mere listing of the holdings of the various cases in the \u201cSecond Period\u201d is sufficient to show the many problems Hall\u2019s prosecutors faced and that the delay during this period was not purposeful or oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">(c) Final Period</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">We shall call the period of time between January 14, 1966 the date of the <em>Schowgurow </em>election, and December 19, 1966 the date of his reindictment, the \u201cFinal Period.\u201d We have no difficulty in holding that Hall was not denied a speedy trial during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In <em>Allen v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 249, 229 A. 2d 446, we held that where there was a delay in a trial because of reversals obtained by an accused there was no denial of a speedy trial. Obviously, when Hall exercised his election under <em>Schowgurow </em>the state had a reasonable time in which to reindict him. Ordinarily, the statute of limitations determines the time in which an indictment may be filed. <em>Price v. State, </em>235 Md. 295, 201 A. 2d 505, <em>Brown v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 571, 232 A. 2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>In <em>Osborne v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 161, 238 A. 2d 145, 146 we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cWhen Osborne challenged the validity of his original indictments on the basis of <em>Schowgurow, supra, </em>they properly were ruled to be null and void. Thus, during the period from March 4, 1966, when the ruling was issued and February 20, 1967, the date of his reindictment, there was no criminal prosecution pending against him arising out of the crimes charged in the original indictment. Presumably the State could have elected not to seek reindictment or, presumably the Grand Jury, on the evidence presented, could have refused to reindict. In any event, during this period, which is the period of time that the Appellant contends constituted a denial of a speedy trial, there was no prosecution pending. Hence, he cannot successfully complain of the delay since the institution of the prosecution by the return of the indictments by the Grand Jury on February 20, 1967 was well within the Statute of Limitations. Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, Secs. 12 and 139.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">It should be noted: (1) that it was not until July 26, 1966 that the state\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment of <em>Hall v. Warden, supra, </em>was denied and it was certain that there must be a reindictment; (2) that on November 22, 1966 Hall filed a habeas corpus in the U. S. District Court and that this was not disposed of until March 9, 1967. On these facts we cannot hold that the five month delay in the reindictment, (demanded by Hall), from July 26, 1966 until December 19, 1966 was an unconstitutional delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">II Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Hall alleges that his motion to dismiss should be granted because the stipulation filed in these proceedings shows that he was prejudiced because two prospective witnesses have died and four others have disappeared.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although none of these wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>nesses testified at either of his trials, he alleges that he did not discover them until after his last trial. It will be observed that all of the questioned time was consumed by the proceedings instituted by Hall or, in a small portion, by the State\u2019s reasonable reaction to those proceedings. There is no showing whether the witness became unavailable during the time chargeable to Hall or to the State. Under the circumstances of this case we find no unconstitutional delay; therefore, the prejudice, if any, is only one consideration. This thought becomes more clear if we consider that an important witness may die at any time and the accused be prejudiced in a trial conducted very promptly after the offense. In <em>Allen v. </em>State, <em>supra </em>at 1 Md. App. 249 at 252 we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">\u201cIn the case of <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U. S. 116, 86 S. Ct. 773, 15 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1966) it was held that the passage of nineteen months, in a Federal case, between the original arrest and the hearings on later indictments replacing those that had been dismissed on motion of the accused did not violate the Speedy Trial Clause. The Court said: (86 S. Ct. at page 777)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">'It has long been the rule that when a defendant obtains a reversal of a prior, unsatisfied conviction, he may be retried in the normal course of events. * * * The rule of these cases, which dealt with the Double Jeopardy Clause, has been thought wise because it protects the societal interest in trying people accused of crime, rather than granting them immunization because of legal error at a previous trial, and because it enhances the probability that appellate courts will be vigilant to strike down previous convictions that are tainted with reversible error.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">For the reasons detailed above we see no denial of a speedy trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-10\">.
