Burch, Attorney General, Charles B. Moylan, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>Raymond Baby, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">On March 15, 1967, the appellant, Jimmie McRae, was tried in the Criminal Court of Baltimore by Judge Charles D. Harris, sitting without a jury, and was convicted of grand larceny. He received a sentence of not more than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Appellant raises four contentions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">1. That the arresting officer did not have sufficient probable cause to arrest the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">2. That the evidence was illegally obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">3. That the pre-lineup preparation was conducted in such a way as to prejudicially suggest the identification of the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-15\">4. That the State\u2019s failure to provide the appellant with the names of \u201cinformers\u201d constituted reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">On January 31, 1967, at about 2 a.m., a seaman named Sivert S. Nygaard was drinking coffee in the Plying Saucer Restaurant in Baltimore City, when he ordered and paid for a coke for a man seated next to him. Thereafter, he asked that man the whereabouts of the men\u2019s room. Upon entering the restroom he noted he was accompanied by his new acquaintance. They remained in the restroom for two and one-half minutes \u201cand as I was standing there, all of a sudden, all of a sudden I felt a hand in my right hip pocket. He took my wallet.\u201d The wallet con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tamed approximately $895.00. Appellant ran from the restaurant and Mr. Nygaard could not catch him, so he called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Officer Frank Wolski was assigned to the investigation and from Mr. Nygaard\u2019s description went to the Police Department\u2019s Bureau of Identification obtaining five photographs, including appellant\u2019s. Officer Wolski testified he had known the appellant and had observed him in the neighborhood. The photographs were viewed by Mr. Nygaard and he identified the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On February 2, 1967, at about 2:15 a.m., appellant was arrested by Officer Wolski without a warrant and a search of his person revealed $4.00 in his pocket and $320.00 in his left sock.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Mr. Nygaard successfully picked the appellant from a lineup and subsequently identified him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">As we stated in <em>Boone v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 479, 480, 235 A. 2d 567 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\u201cIt has long been the rule in this State that a police officer may arrest without a warrant where he has reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed and that the person arrested has committed the felony. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense had been committed. <em>Mulcahy v. State, </em>221 Md. 413, 158 A. 2d 80 (1960); <em>Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 95, 218 A. 2d 7 (1966).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">It is well settled that sufficient probable cause for an arrest exists where there is a report of a felony and a description of the perpetrator. <em>Hopkins and Terry v. State, </em>239 Md. 517, 520, 211 A. 2d 831 (1965) citing <em>Farrow v. State, </em>233 Md. 526, 531, 197 A. 2d 434 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">In the instant case, Officer Wolski knew the felony had been committed, was possessed of the victim\u2019s description of his assailant, was present when the victim picked appellant\u2019s photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>graph from the group of five presented, and personally knew the appellant frequented the neighborhood where the crime occurred. Under the above facts and circumstances, we find that there was sufficient probable cause to believe that a felony had been committed and that the person arrested had committed that felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u201c[Wjhere circumstances make an arrest without a warrant lawful, it is permissible, as an incident to the arrest, to search the person of the suspect and to take into custody and examine the tangible evidence or instruments of the crime, whether upon his person or within his present or immediate possession.\u201d <em>Mulcahy v. State, </em>221 Md. 413, 422, 158 A. 2d 80 (1960); <em>David v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 666, 669-670, 232 A. 2d 553 (1967). Here, the evidence seized was secured incidental to a lawful arrest and therefore was properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Appellant\u2019s third contention that the pre-lineup preparation was conducted in such a way as to prejudicially suggest the identification of the appellant is without merit. While it is true that the victim identified the appellant from a group of photographs prior to the lineup at which he later identified the appellant, there is no indication from the testimony that the appellant\u2019s identification was prejudicially inspired, as the victim had ample opportunity to observe the features of the appellant during the time that he was seated next to him in the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Furthermore, it was settled by <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199, that the legal principles enunciated in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149, and <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U. S. 263, 87 S. Ct. 1951, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1178, all decided on June 12, 1967, apply only to lineups conducted after June 12, 1967. <em>Tender v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 692, 696, 237 A. 2d 65 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Furthermore, the victim\u2019s testimony indicates that the police officer informed him of the appellant\u2019s name only after the appellant\u2019s photograph had been clearly and positively picked out by the victim from the group of five photographs submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>him. The testimony of Officer Wolski fully supports this inference. The victim also identified the appellant in court. It is well established that the positive identification of a single eyewitness, if believed by the trier of facts, is ample evidence to sustain the conviction. <em>Montague v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 66, 71, 237 A. 2d 816 <em>(1968); Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362, 367, 230 A. 2d 352 (1967); <em>Crumb v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 98, 103, 227 A. 2d 369 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Assuming arguendo, some conflict in the testimony of the victim and officer regarding this point, it is clear that in non-jury trials, the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses is for the determination of the trial judge. <em>Lucas v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 590, 593, 235 A. 2d 780 (1968); <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 444, 230 A. 2d 690 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is also without merit. The thrust of this contention is that informers supplied the prerequisite probable cause upon which the appellant\u2019s arrest was based and therefore their identification was essential to a fair determination of this cause. The issue of probable cause was foreclosed by the officer\u2019s testimony that he had relied solely upon the description and information supplied by the victim in conjunction with the victim picking the appellant\u2019s photograph from the group of five presented. The additional information sought from the witnesses at the situs of the crime was in no way linked to the establishment of probable cause for appellant\u2019s arrest. As noted above, the victim\u2019s report and his description of the perpetrator supplied ample probable cause. <em>Hopkins and Terry v. State, supra; Farrow v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
