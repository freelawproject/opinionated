The negotiated plea contemplated appellant Sanchez enter a plea of guilty to count I in the case then undergoing preliminary examination, No. 208979, and the People would move to dismiss count II. Appellant Sanchez would also enter a plea of guilty to the section 11352 violation alleged in information No. 209002 in exchange for a recommendation from the prosecution that punishment for the two counts run concurrently. Additionally, there was apparently a third case, as yet unfiled, which the prosecution agreed to dismiss after entry of the above-stated guilty piea. Appellant Sanchez was then advised of his rights as to both cases and entered his pleas of guilty. The cases were then certified to superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>On September 4, 1985, the sentencing court denied appellant Sanchez probation and sentenced him to prison for the middle term of four years and awarded the appropriate time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Appellant Sanchez filed timely notices of appeal in each of his cases. Upon motion of appellant Sanchez to consolidate the appeals, these two cases were ordered consolidated on January 15, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Appellant Castillo</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On August 22,1985, a two-count complaint was filed in the Tulare County Municipal Court charging appellant Castillo and codefendant Felicitis Tejada of violating section 11352. Count I charged appellant with sale of heroin and count II charged appellant with the sale of cocaine, both offenses occurring on August 20, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On September 3, 1985, Castillo, pursuant to a plea bargain, entered a plea of guilty to a violation of section 11351, possession of heroin for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">On October 1,1985, the sentencing court denied appellant Castillo probation and sentenced him to state prison for the medium term of two years. Appellant Castillo filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Upon this court\u2019s own motion, the appeals of appellants Sanchez and Castillo were ordered consolidated for a determination of all appellate issues raised therein on September 5, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Since both appellants\u2019 convictions are predicated upon pleas of guilty, no facts relating to the crimes will be set forth except as they become relevant in the course of the subsequent discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">I. Federal and State Guaranties of Equal Protection and Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Both appellants contend the trial court\u2019s denial of probation due to their respective status as an illegal alien violated their federal and state guaranties of equal protection and due process. Both appellants argue classification based on alienage is subject to strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">The United States Supreme Court held illegal aliens may claim the benefit of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of equal protection <em>(Plyler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>v. <em>Doe </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 202, 215 [72 L.Ed.2d 786, 798, 102 S.Ct. 2382].) In <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 365 [29 L.Ed.2d 534, 91 S.Ct. 1848], the high court held that a state could not deny welfare benefits to <em>lawfully resident </em>aliens. That court\u2019s decisions have \u201cestablished that classifications based on alienage, like those based on nationality or race, are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. Aliens as a class are a prime example of a \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 minority [citation] for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 371-372, fns. omitted [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 541-542].)  <em>Alonso </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 242 [123 Cal.Rtpr. 536, 87 A.L.R.3d 678], distinguished between cases involving \u201clawfully resident\u201d aliens and aliens unlawfully in this country. The Second District Court of Appeal determined that \u201c[i]f an alien is here <em>unlawfully, </em>he has no rights under the Constitution of the United States to equal opportunity of employment as enjoyed by lawfully resident aliens [citations] and has no right to work.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The equal protection clause directs that \u201call persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u201d <em>(Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1920) 253 U.S. 412, 415 [64 L.Ed.2d 989, 991, 40 S.Ct. 560].) However, the \u201cConstitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.\u201d <em>(Tigner </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 141, 147 [84 L.Ed. 1124, 1128, 60 S.Ct. 879, 130 A.L.R. 1321].) Despite appellants\u2019 contentions to the contrary, legal residents of the United States and illegal residents are not persons \u201csimilarly circumstanced\u201d which the federal and state Constitutions require to be treated alike. In fact, while the Supreme Court held that children of illegal entrants could not be deprived of a free, basic education based on their parents\u2019 misconduct as to do so would not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice, the court further noted that \u201cthose who elect to enter our territory by stealth and in violation of our law should be prepared to bear the consequences, including, but not limited to, deportation.\u201d <em>(Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>457 U.S. 202, 220 [72 L.Ed.2d 786, 801].)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The distinction between illegal aliens and lawful residents is particularly marked when considered in terms of granting or denying probation. The <em>Plyler </em>court further noted, \u201cundocumented status is not irrelevant to any proper legislative goal. Nor is undocumented status an absolutely immutable characteristic since it is the product of conscious, indeed unlawful, action.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u201c \u2018Granting or denying probation rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and a heavy burden is imposed upon a defendant to show abuse of that discretion in denying a request for probation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Goodson </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 290, 295 [145 Cal.Rptr. 489], quoting <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Kingston </em>(1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 629, 637 [118 Cal.Rptr. 896].) California Rules of Court (hereinafter Rule), rule 414(d)(3) provides that a defendant\u2019s willingness and ability to comply with terms of probation shall be considered in a decision to grant or deny probation.\u201d Rule 414(d)(4) provides that a defendant\u2019s family background and ties are factors affecting eligibility for probation. The advisory committee comment to Rule 414 reads in part as follows: \u201cThe decision whether to grant probation is normally based on an overall evaluation of the likelihood that the defendant will live successfully in the general community. Each criterion points to evidence that the likelihood of success is great or small. A single criterion will rarely be determinative; in most cases, the sentencing judge will have to balance favorable and unfavorable facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u201cUnder criterion (d)(3) (\u2018willingness and ability\u2019) it is appropriate to consider the defendant\u2019s expressions of willingness to comply and their apparent sincerity, and whether the defendant\u2019s home and work environment and primary associates will be supportive of his efforts to comply with the terms of probation, among other factors.\u201d (See Advisory Com. Comment, 23 West\u2019s Cal. Codes Ann. Rules, pt. 1 (1981 ed.) rule 414, p. 673.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In the instant case, in light of appellants\u2019 lack of ties with the community, . the sentencing judges were concerned with appellants\u2019 \u201cability to comply with the terms of probation.\u201d (Rule 414(d)(3).) In our view, such concern is a legitimate factor to be weighed and considered by a sentencing court in determining whether or not to grant probation to an illegal alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Initially we note appellants\u2019 illegal alien, or undocumented alien, status was not disputed in the instant cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When dealing with an illegal or undocumented alien, the trial judge must assume, barring presentation of cognizable and credible evidence to the contrary, a defendant will be deported upon completion of any term of incarceration imposed, whether it be local time as a condition of probation or state prison, or upon his release from custody when no period of incarceration is imposed.  This is particularly true where a defendant is convicted of possession or sale of a controlled substance. As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Arciga </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 991, at page 1000 [227 Cal.Rptr. 611]: \u201cOur state [Legislature has recognized the important problem of narcotic abuse by illegal aliens and the need to cooperate with federal authorities: \u2018When there is reason to believe that any person arrested for violation of [certain uniform controlled substances sections] may not be a citizen of the United States, the arresting agency shall notify the appropriate agency of the United States having charge of deporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tion matters.\u2019 (Health [&amp;] Saf. Code, \u00a7 11369.)\u201d (Fn. omitted.)  Moreover, in the typical case, an illegal alien will have at best limited ties to the general community and, upon deportation, such ties to the community as do exist will necessarily be terminated. Obviously, a convicted illegal alien felon, upon deportation, would be unable to comply with any terms and conditions of probation beyond the serving of any period of local incarceration imposed. These are legitimate factors for consideration by the trial judge in determining whether or not to grant probation in a particular case. We do not suggest illegal alien status should preclude the granting of probation. Rather, we conclude only that such fact may properly be considered by the sentencing court with all other relevant factors in exercising its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">As previously stated, the illegal alien status of appellants Castillo and Sanchez was not denied or disputed in the instant case. Contrary to the respective appellants\u2019 assertions, the record in each case reflects that the trial judge\u2019s denial of probation was not predicated solely upon either appellant\u2019s illegal alien status but, rather, this factor was one of several factors weighed and considered by the trial court in reaching its sentence choice. In each case the court reviewed and considered the appellant\u2019s probation report and the sentence recommendation, invited comment from appellant\u2019s counsel, the prosecuting attorney and the deputy probation officer, and engaged in substantial discussion with counsel regarding sentencing options. As to appellant Castillo, the trial judge then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Pereira [defense counsel], I really do not feel that probation is appropriate in this case. This defendant is an undocumented alien. There is no way that he should be part of the probationary system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201cAlso it appears to me this is not just a random occasional transaction, it appears to be a commercial type transaction, and I do not think that a period of local incarceration is called for here at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u201cAccordingly, the Court is going to deny probation in this case, and will order the defendant sentenced to serve the medium term in state prison.\u201d In sentencing appellant Sanchez, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I am going to find that the Defendant is not a suitable candidate for a grant of probation. The Defendant is apparently illegally in the United States and subject to deportation immediately upon release from custody. It would appear that that is the case and he\u2019s not accordingly in a position to respond appropriately to supervision by the Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201cIn addition, while the Defendant has no prior criminal record there are circumstances here that suggest at least that he has been involved in the sales of heroin more than simply the two transactions and I don\u2019t think that this under those circumstances would render him an amenable subject for probationary consideration. Probation under those circumstances will be ordered denied.\u201d Considering the record before us as to each appellant, it is clear the illegal alien status of Mr. Castillo and Mr. Sanchez was but one of several factors weighed and considered by the trial courts in denying probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our view this was proper and did not constitute a denial of federal and/or California state guaranties of equal protection or due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">II., III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Franson, Acting P. J., and Hamlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Petitions for a rehearing were denied April 13, 1987, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellants\u2019 petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied June 25, 1987.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-13\">All further statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In our view it is incumbent upon the defendant to dispute or deny illegal alien status and offer available evidence supporting his contention in an appropriate case. Otherwise, the trial judge will properly assume this fact is conceded by the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Mr. Castillo further contends the sentencing court used an additional improper factor, i.e., this was a \u201ccommercial-type transaction,\u201d in denying probation, it being an element of the offense. However, when reviewing the entire record before us and considering the court\u2019s remarks in context, it is clear the lower court inartfully classified the subject transaction as other than a single, isolated, casual transaction between friends or acquaintances, but rather as one actively involved in the sale of heroin for profit. Furthermore, in light of our conclusion the lower court properly considered appellants\u2019 illegal alien status in denying probation, our decision is not in conflict with the principles enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 217 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">We also considered and reject the contention the denial of probation in the instant cases violates 42 United States Code section 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-10\">See footnote on page 224, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
