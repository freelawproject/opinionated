On this appeal we consider the related issue of whether section 31103 and like statutes immunize a poultry owner whose employee shoots and wounds a trespassing dog which subsequently bites a veterinary assistant during the course of treatment of the dog\u2019s injuries. We conclude that the poultry owner is immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">Background and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">The events which gave rise to this litigation are simple and undisputed. Defendant Wilfred Lieb is the owner of a poultry farm situated within the city limits of the city of Novato. He employed Daniel Marrin, who lived on the premises, to tend and protect the poultry. On August 23, 1982, Marrin fired a shotgun at a dog which Marrin discovered on defendant\u2019s farm. The wounded dog returned to its owner, a Ms. Atkisson, who took it to the office of veterinarian Dennis Clifton. Dr. Clifton administered morphine and a tranquilizer preparatory to local surgery. About 20 minutes later the dog bit plaintiff Gail Scozzafava, Dr. Clifton\u2019s assistant, as she was attempting to pick it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Plaintiff commenced this action against defendant for negligence. Neither Ms. Atkisson nor Dr. Clifton was named as a defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his answer defendant pleaded affirmative defenses to the effect that \u201c[t]he act of which plaintiff complains was privileged, and that plaintiff\u2019s complaint is barred by operation of\u2019 sections 31102, 31103, 31104, and 31152. After discovery was conducted by the parties, defendant moved to terminate the action by summary judgment. His first motion to this end was based on the immunity provisions specified in his answer, This was denied in July of 1984. The following month the trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary adjudication that defendant was not immune from liability by reason of sections 31102 and 31152.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">In April of 1985, defendant again moved for summary judgment, this time on a ground wholly unrelated to statutory immunity. This motion was granted and a summary judgment was entered in August of that same year. Plaintiff then perfected this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">I<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Defendant has at various points in this litigation invoked the protection of all of the immunity statutes, to wit, sections 31102, 31103, 31104, and 31152.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He is, however, not entitled to claim each and all as germane to his situation. Section 31152 is not applicable because the board of supervisors has not adopted a resolution making its provisions effective within Marin County. (See \u00a7 31151, quoted in fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Section 31104 is also inapplicable. Section 31104 is not a substantive immunity source, but a limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>upon the scope of the immunity granted by sections 31102 and 31103. Section 31104 is at the same time a reinforcement of a common thread found in sections 31102 and 31103\u2014the privilege to kill a dog discovered while actually molesting livestock or poultry. Because, as will be shown, the dog which bit plaintiff was shot by plaintiff\u2019s employee Martin when he discovered the dog chasing poultry on defendant\u2019s property, the issue before us is whether sections 31102 and 31103 preclude plaintiff recovering damages from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Defendant\u2019s showing on his initial motion for summary judgment consisted of declarations by himself and Martin. As pertinent here,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendant stated in his declaration as follows: \u201cAt the time of the events complained of in the complaint, I had an employee, Dan Martin, who was charged with the responsibility of tending and protecting poultry on my farm. Mr. Martin lived on the premises, in a house close to the chicken coup <em>[sic\\ </em>known as [the] \u2018brooding house\u2019 which was used to shelter newly hatched chicks. Beside the brooding house, there was a pen constructed of chicken wire attached to fence posts.... [11] Over the many years I have operated this poultry farm, ... I have had numerous problems with roving dogs ... coming onto my property and killing my poultry. Before the date of this incident, I had instructed my employee to shoot any unlicensed dog he saw worrying or molesting the poultry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Martin stated in his declaration: \u201cOn or about the date of the incident complained of, shortly after waking, I heard a commotion in the brooding house, which indicated that an animal may have gotten into the house and was molesting the chicks. Upon investigation, I could see that a dog was in the brooding house and the pen area adjacent to it chasing chickens, and that the chickens were terrified and in danger of death by suffocation from their attempts to huddle into a comer to escape the dog. [11] Upon seeing this, I took a shotgun which had been left for me by Mr. LIEB, and approached the pen. I took one shot at the dog, apparently striking him in the rear end. The dog then ran____[11] Before shooting, I got a good look at the dog, and ... there was no collar or license on the dog at the time. [H] Before the date of this occurrence, I had been instructed by my employer to shoot any unlicensed dog found worrying the poultry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">Our decision in <em>Katsaris, </em>which was filed approximately 20 months after defendant\u2019s initial summary judgment motion was denied, began its analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>by examining the purpose and effect of section 31103: \u201cBy enacting section 31103 the Legislature found the public\u2019s interest in protecting farm animals outweighed the dog owners\u2019 right to permit their animals to roam freely on land occupied by livestock. To promote the Legislature\u2019s goal, it gave livestock owners, in section 31103, a privilege to kill or seize trespassing dogs.\u201d <em>(Katsaris </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 256 at pp. 263-264 [fns. omitted].) We determined that the privilege was a qualified or conditional one which \u201cprotects the actor only if he acts for the purpose of advancing or protecting the interest which the privilege seeks to protect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 265.) We concluded: \u201cIf the policy choice made by the Legislature in enacting section 31103 is to protect livestock owners from economic loss stemming from the death or injury of their animals, then arguably conduct by livestock owners which goes beyond what is necessary to protect their livestock from trespassing dogs is not covered by the privilege. [1\u00cd] Any conduct necessary to the killing of a trespassing dog will be within the privilege. Decisions by the owner of livestock about when, where or how to kill a trespassing dog and dispose of its body, as well as the owner\u2019s delegation of those decisions to his employees, is conduct which comes within the privilege.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\"><em>Katsaris </em>involved the actual killing of two dogs. It is thus not dispositive of this case, which involves only the wounding of a dog. Nevertheless, <em>Katsaris </em>developed an analytical framework that is instructive. The causes of action at issue in <em>Katsaris </em>were damages for the loss of the dogs themselves; negligence regarding the manner in which the livestock owners supervised the employee who killed the dogs and the owners\u2019 \u201cpermitting] guns to be kept and to be shot\u201d; and intentional infliction of emotional distress for not advising the dogs\u2019 owner that they had been killed. The causes of action were scrutinized in light of chronological and functional criteria to determine whether they were barred by the privilege. Accordingly, if the claim involved \u201can act necessary to the killing,\u201d or \u201cmatters ... intimately linked to the [dogs\u2019] deaths,\u201d or \u201c[i]f the factual basis of th[e] claim lies in the manner in which the defendants killed the dogs or disposed of their bodies, then the privilege ... bars the claim.\u201d Likewise, \u201cif the duty of care was breached by the shooting of the dogs, the claim is barred____\u201d <em>(Katsaris </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 256 at pp. 266-267.) Conversely, \u201cpost shooting conduct\u201d was excluded from the ambit of the privilege if not transactionally related to the shooting. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 267-269.) When measured against these criteria, the damages and negligence causes were held to be barred by the privilege, whereas that for emotional distress was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Here, plaintiff\u2019s sole cause of action against defendant is for \u201cnegligence in the management of his chicken farm; in the selection, training, and supervision of employees; and in the care, maintenance and use of firearms.\u201d All elements of this cause of action relate to the shooting and involve a \u201cduty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>of care [purportedly] breached by the shooting....\u201d No part of plaintiffs claim has any reference to any \u201cpost shooting conduct\u201d by either defendant or Martin. (See <em>Katsaris </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 256 at pp. 266-267.) In short, plaintiffs cause of action rests on the shooting and nothing but the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">There is no dispute that Martin intended to kill the dog,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or that he fired only after discovering the dog actually molesting defendant\u2019s chickens in defendant\u2019s chicken coop on defendant\u2019s chicken farm. These circumstances satisfy the essential predicate for operation of sections 31102, 31103, and 31104. With the sole distinction that <em>Katsaris </em>dealt with the killing of dogs and this case involves only the wounding of a marauding dog, plaintiffs negligence claim is virtually identical to that in <em>Katsaris. </em> The context of <em>Katsaris </em>makes it clear that the test of acts or conduct \u201cnecessary to the killing\u201d is not rigidly limited to such obvious incidents as loading and aiming, but is instead generously construed so as to reach categories of specific decisions pertaining to more general areas such as employment practices, business policies, and most manner of matters concerning firearms. These are precisely the issues for which plaintiff seeks to impose liability on defendant. Just as we did in <em>Katsaris, </em>we hold that these acts and omissions constitute decisions necessary to the exercise of the privilege to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Plaintiff struggles to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the privilege is confined by plain statutory language to killing of dogs, and thus has no bearing to an action for negligence in wounding a dog prosecuted by someone other than the owner of the dog. As plaintiff puts it: \u201cSuch a rule would make no sense for it would completely immunize a person from negligent or even reckless wounding of his neighbors in the course of trying to shoot a trespassing dog (even if he used a machine gun or a cannon).\u201d Weaponry aside, this argument possesses undeniable force, but several considerations militate against accepting it here.  With respect to plaintiffs reliance on the language of sections 31102, 31103, and 31104, it is a standard canon of construction that \u201cwhatever is necessarily implied in a statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed.\u201d <em>(Johnston </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1914) 167 Cal. 260, 264 [139 P. 86]; accord <em>Lum </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 952, 956 [ 190 Cal.Rptr. <em>599]; Sondeno v. Union Commerce Bank </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 391, 395 [139 Cal.Rptr. 229]; <em>Charles S. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 83, 94 [97 Cal.Rptr. 422].)  Obedience to this principle leaves no choice but to recognize that a statutory privilege to kill necessarily reaches shooting intended to kill yet which does not result in death.  Although it is true that the privilege is a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>tional one subject to strict construction (see <em>Katsaris </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 256 at pp. 265-266), it is nevertheless \u201c[t]he rule that an express grant of power or right carries all incidental powers or rights necessary to carry the grant into effect provides one of the most common qualifications to the rule of strict interpretation.\u201d (3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (Sands 4th ed. 1986) \u00a7 63.10, p. 164, fn. omitted.) As plaintiff\u2019s hypothetical illustration suggests, situations may indeed arise where conduct so unreasonable may require the privilege to be treated as lost through abuse. (See <em>Katsaris </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>at p. 265.) This may be reserved for the future.  For present purposes it suffices to conclude that the widely recognized privilege of a property owner to protect his livestock (see Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a721, pp. 136-137; 3A C.J.S. (1973) Animals, \u00a7291, p. 810), as recognized in sections 31102, 31103, and 31104, was demonstrated by defendant to be a complete defense to plaintiff\u2019s action. Plaintiff having failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact, defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Isaacs </em>v. <em>Huntington Memorial Hospital </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653]; <em>Bass </em>v. <em>Pratt </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 129, 131-132 [222 Cal.Rptr. 723]; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Farrar </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 462, 466 [188 Cal.Rptr. 823].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Anderson, P. J., and Channell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 24, 1987.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1196-14\">Statutory citations are to the Food and Agricultural Code unless otherwise indicated.

It is readily inferable from the Doe allegations of plaintiffs complaint that Marrin qualified as an unnamed defendant, although whether he was ever served with a copy of the complaint and a summons does not appear from the record. In any event, Marrin, Clifton, and Ms. Atkisson played no part in the summary judgment proceedings in the trial court.
