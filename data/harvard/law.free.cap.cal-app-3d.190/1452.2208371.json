J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXt\">Petitioner Eddie Rivera (applicant) seeks review of a decision of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) reinstating the decision of the Rehabilitation Bureau (Bureau) which terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>applicant\u2019s rehabilitation benefits. We conclude that the Board erred in determining that applicant\u2019s appeal from the Bureau decision was procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Applicant, while employed as a peace officer by defendant California Youth Authority, sustained industrial injury in March 1980 resulting in a permanent disability award and a compromise and release of all his claims except entitlement to rehabilitation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">After his initial request for rehabilitation benefits, Bureau proceedings commenced and he was paid vocational-rehabilitation temporary-disability indemnity. Following consultation, a rehabilitation plan was developed and submitted to the Bureau. The Bureau approved the plan; however, the planned program proved unsuccessful. A Bureau conference was then requested in an attempt to salvage applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. The conference was held before Mr. Breffitt, the Bureau\u2019s consultant. Applicant and his counsel were present. In view of failure of the plan, Mr. Breffitt referred applicant to an independent vocational evaluator for opinion as to applicant\u2019s status as a qualified injured worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Following interviews and counseling, the evaluator found that applicant was hostile, rude, uncooperative, and unrealistic in his approach to rehabilitation; and that no reasonable expectation existed for applicant\u2019s return to competitive labor through vocational rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">Defendant\u2019s adjusting agency then indicated that it would seek closure of rehabilitation benefits, whereupon applicant requested a hearing. The Bureau consultant by telephone advised applicant\u2019s counsel that the Bureau would not grant the request for hearing. Consequently, on May 1, 1984, applicant filed with the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) a declaration of readiness to proceed, stating: \u201cRehab Appeal (Request for Conference\u2014see attached); per telephone conference with consultant, Mr. Breffitt he refuses to set a conference; a hearing is necessary ... principal issues are \u2014 ... Request for Order to hold conference ... Alternatively\u2014a request for extension of Rehab benefits and continuing VRTD [vocational rehabilitation temporary disability]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">Thereafter, on May 7, 1984, the Bureau issued its formal decision and order, based on the evaluator\u2019s report, that applicant cannot reasonably be expected to return to suitable gainful employment through vocational rehabilitation services, and accordingly can no longer be considered a qualified injured worker under California Administrative Code, title 8, chapter 4.5, section 10003, subdivision (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>The WCJ set applicant\u2019s readiness declaration for hearing as an appeal. Several medical reports were received in evidence at the hearing, including a May 1984 report of Dr. Smith that applicant was physically able to return to some occupations, such as a paralegal. Consultant Breffitt testified that the procedural rules as to \u201cdocumentation and adequacy\u201d in filing an appeal are \u201cwidely not followed,\u201d and \u201cthe [WCJs] generally allow supplementation and proceed to [determine the appeal] on the merits of the case.\u201d Mr. Breffitt testified further that he based his termination order on the report of the evaluator he had appointed at the \u201coral conference\u201d on December 13, 1983; he expected the <em>\u201cLaird </em>principle\u201d <em>(Laird </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 198 [195 Cal.Rptr. 44]) would be applied, and so advised defendant; and defendant \u201cappeared to be unhappy with the process of continuing benefits or possibly continuing benefits.\u201d Mr. Breffitt also testified that he received no new medical reports since December of 1983; the rule permitting remand to him on appeal \u201cwould serve no useful purpose in this case\u201d; and he \u201cbelieved that was necessary to move the case on to the Board level for a determination of the issue which he had already concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The WCJ ordered the Bureau\u2019s decision set aside and the case remanded to the Bureau for reevaluation, hearing, and consideration of any new or additional cumulative evidence presented by either party; and to then issue an appropriate order, preserving the rights of the parties to appeal that order. The WCJ concluded that the record is overwhelmingly clear that applicant indicated to his counsel he wanted to be heard before a decision was made, and yet was not granted a hearing; and that a hearing should have been granted, and is \u201cmandated by elementary rules of due process as enumerated in the <em>Laird </em>case.\u201d The WCJ opined further that the Bureau \u201cwould be well advised to hear people before they shut them off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">The Board granted reconsideration, reversed the WCJ, and reinstated the Bureau\u2019s May 7, 1984, decision terminating rehabilitation benefits. The Board, citing its panel decision in another case <em>(Perez </em>v. <em>Eagle Truck Line, Inc. </em>(1979) 44 Cal.Comp.Cases 1030, 1032), opined that applicant\u2019s readiness declaration did not comply with the formal requirements of pleading set forth in sections 10008, 10955, and 10956 of title 8 chapter 4.5, of the California Administrative Code so as to constitute a \u201cproper petition or appeal from the Bureau\u2019s decision\u201d in that no \u201c \u2018petition\u2019 \u201d was filed. In view of that conclusion, the Board did not address on the merits the issue whether applicant had been denied his due process right to a hearing before the Bureau terminated rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Applicant then petitioned for reconsideration, urging that the Board\u2019s decision was condoning and promoting form over substance. The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>rejected this assertion, and again disposed of the matter on the ground that applicant\u2019s readiness declaration did not satisfy the formal requirements for an appeal from the Bureau\u2019s decision, noting an additional factor that the declaration was filed (on May 1, 1984) prior to the Bureau\u2019s May 7, 1984 decision, and that the Board\u2019s rules of practice and procedure \u201cmust be followed, otherwise the [Board] would be inundated with \u2018appeals\u2019 or Declarations of Readiness to Proceed on the issue of rehabilitation when that issue was still pending at the Rehabilitation Bureau.\u201d This in turn would result in confusion and frustration of Board proceedings and \u201cwould not serve to promote the constitutional mandate to process workers\u2019 compensation cases expeditiously and without [i]ncumbrances of any character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\"> The Board clearly erred in reversing the WCJ and reinstating the Bureau\u2019s decision. In basing its ruling on the procedural technicality that applicant\u2019s readiness declaration did not meet the formal requirements for filing an appeal from the Bureau decision, the Board overlooked case law that workers\u2019 compensation pleadings and proceedings are informal and not utilized to preclude Board jurisdiction. (See <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 324 [90 Cal.Rptr. 431, 475 P.2d 663]; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 590 [126 Cal.Rptr. 187]; <em>Beaida </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 204 [69 Cal.Rptr. 516].) The Board also overlooked the constitutional mandate (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4), the legislative mandate (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202), and repeated decisions of the Supreme Court (see <em>LeBoeuf </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 234, 241 [193 Cal.Rptr. 547, 666 P.2d 989]; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 621 [170 Cal.Rptr. 32, 620 P.2d 618]; <em>Veilleux </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 235, 241 [220 Cal.Rptr. 568]; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 633, 638 [211 Cal.Rptr. 683]) that workers\u2019 compensation laws be liberally construed in favor of affording substantial justice to injured workers. As stated in <em>Beveridge </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 592, 598 [346 P.2d 895], \u201capplicant\u2019s claim is entitled to adjudication upon substance rather than upon formality of statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">The Board\u2019s reasoning that to permit applicant\u2019s readiness declaration to formally satisfy the requirements for filing an appeal \u201cwould not serve to promote the constitutional mandate to process workers\u2019 compensation cases expeditiously and without [i]ncumbrance of any character\u201d neglects the key phrase, \u201csubstantial justice,\u201d in that mandate. California Constitution, article XIV, section 4 mandates that the Board, in determining disputes, .. shall accomplish <em>substantial justice </em>in all cases expeditiously... and without incumbrance of any character____\u201d (Italics added.) Here, the Board did indeed rely on form at the expense of substance to avoid resolving the matter on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>The Board\u2019s reliance on its panel decision in the <em>Perez </em>case <em>(supra, </em>44 Cal.Comp.Cases 1030) is misplaced. In <em>Perez </em>the defendant filed a readiness declaration instead of a formal petition when seeking to appeal a Bureau order. The Board <em>{id., </em>at p. 1033) criticized the \u201cwidespread practice\u201d of filing a readiness declaration in lieu of a formal petition, and noted that a petition appealing a Bureau order should state in sufficient detail the issues on which relief is sought and facts which would justify the relief. Nevertheless, the Board, in view of the widespread practice of filing readiness declarations in lieu of formal petitions, permitted defendant to file a proper petition appealing the Bureau decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">In a subsequent panel decision <em>(Machado </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>(1983) 80 L.A. 456-970, 11 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 125), where applicant filed a readiness declaration in lieu of a formal petition, the Board panel, interpreting <em>Perez, </em>concluded that the readiness declaration satisfied the formal requirement for an appeal since it sufficiently specified the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">Here, applicant\u2019s readiness declaration specifically stated that it was an appeal from the Bureau decision; it specified the issue on appeal that the Bureau denied applicant\u2019s right to a pretermination hearing; and it set forth facts regarding such denial. Thus, the WCJ correctly entertained jurisdiction of the readiness declaration as an appeal on the merits; and the Board erred in deciding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Finally, the Board\u2019s belated resort to alleged \u201cprematurity\u201d of the readiness declaration as justification for the Board\u2019s decision is of no avail. Applicant\u2019s readiness declaration (appeal) was filed on May 1, 1984, after the Bureau consultant had orally advised applicant\u2019s counsel of the Bureau\u2019s intended decision, which decision was not formally filed until May 8, 1984. Since an appealable order was in fact entered by the Bureau, applicant\u2019s readiness certificate should be given full effect even though filed before the written order was entered. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 412, pp. 410-411.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">In view of the foregoing, the Board erred in determining that applicant\u2019s appeal from the Bureau decision was procedurally defective. Consequently, the Board\u2019s decision must be annulled, and the matter remanded to the Board for a decision on the merits of applicant\u2019s petition for reconsideration, including determination whether applicant was afforded his due process right to a hearing by the Bureau in accordance with <em>Veilleux </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d 235 and <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 198 [195 Cal.Rptr. 44],</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">The April 8, 1986, decision of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board denying reconsideration, as well as its February 28, 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>decision after reconsideration setting aside the June 22, 1984, order of the workers\u2019 compensation judge and reinstating the Rehabilitation Bureau\u2019s May 7, 1984 decision, are annulled; and the matter is remanded to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board for determination on the merits of applicant\u2019s appeal from the Rehabilitation Bureau\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Gilbert, J. and Abbe, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 17, 1987.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
