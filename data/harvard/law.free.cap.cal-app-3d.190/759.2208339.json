J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABT\">In this proceeding we review an order reversing a decision of the Rehabilitation Bureau (Bureau) that awarded retroactive vocational rehabilitation temporary disability indemnity (VRTD) to a retired Los Angeles County (County) deputy sheriff. We are presented with the issue whether a county may refuse to provide VRTD to an industrially injured public safety worker because the worker receives a County Employees Retirement Law (CERL) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31450 et seq.) disability pension and a Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS) service pension that was earned solely as a result of former employment by a city. We conclude that the employee\u2019s entitlement to and receipt of both pensions does not relieve the county of its obligation to provide VRTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Applicant was employed by the City of Lynwood (City) as a police officer from July 1, 1957, to May 1, 1977, and had a vested right to a PERS service pension as a result of his employment by City.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">On May 1, 1977, City contracted with County to perform police services for County. As a result, applicant became a County deputy sheriff. During the May 1, 1977, to June 23, 1983, period of applicant\u2019s employment as a deputy sheriff, applicant sustained industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">On December 5, 1983, pursuant to stipulation, applicant was awarded 33% percent permanent disability based upon a preclusion from very heavy work and undue emotional stress; the disability indemnity was made payable beginning June 26, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">On March 10, 1984, applicant was granted a disability retirement under the CERL as a result of the industrial injury. He elected at that time to begin receiving his PERS service pension. He receives approximately $1,600 per month from the CERL disability pension and a similar amount from the PERS service pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Applicant was determined to be a qualified injured worker and participated in a rehabilitation program, which he completed on May 12, 1985. County failed to provide VRTD, but provided other vocational rehabilitation benefits. On March 10, 1986, the Bureau ordered that applicant be paid VRTD for the March 10, 1984, through May 12, 1985, period but that County receive credit for any temporary disability indemnity paid and wages earned during this period. Upon County\u2019s appeal, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) vacated the Bureau\u2019s decision and order. In his opinion on decision, he explained that he based his decision on Labor Code section 4853 and <em>Gorman v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 998 [184 Cal.Rptr. 406]. Applicant thereafter petitioned for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In the WCJ\u2019s report and recommendation on the petition for reconsideration, the WCJ reiterated that <em>Gorman </em>and Labor Code section 4853 precluded an award of VRTD. He noted that section 4853 does not mention CERL retirements and observed that the section \u201cdoes not specifically mention that the retirement under the \u2018Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Act\u2019 has to be a disability retirement as opposed to a service retirement.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIt should be noted that the applicant\u2019s Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System service retirement began simultaneously with his County disability retirement, and it is this judge\u2019s opinion that it was the intention of Labor Code Section 4853 to include the applicant\u2019s situation. [I] To allow the applicant to receive vocational rehabilitation temporary disability while receiving the combination Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and County retirement would be in violation of Labor Code Section 4853.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) unanimously adopted the WCJ\u2019s report and denied reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Applicant contends that County may not disallow VRTD because the injured worker is receiving a PERS service pension. County and the Board contend (1) that VRTD was unnecessary in the present case because the combined pension payments provided adequate sustenance, and (2) that under Labor Code section 4853 a deputy sheriff\u2019s right to VRTD terminates on the effective date of any PERS retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">At the time of applicant\u2019s injury (see Lab. Code, \u00a7 5412), Labor Code section 4850 provided in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever any city policeman, city fireman, county fireman, fireman of any fire district, sheriff or any officer or employee of a sheriff\u2019s office, any inspector, investigator, detective or personnel with comparable title in any district attorney\u2019s office, or lifeguard employed year round on a regular, full-time basis by a county of the first class, who is a member of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System or subject to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 (com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>mencing with Section 31450), Part 3, Division 4, Title 3, Government Code) is disabled, whether temporarily or permanently, by injury or illness arising out of and in the course of his duties, he shall become entitled, regardless of his period of service with the city or county, to leave of absence while so disabled without loss of salary in lieu of temporary disability payments, if any, which would be payable under this chapter, for the period of such disability but not exceeding one year, <em>or until such earlier date as he is retired on permanent disability </em>pension____\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 981, \u00a7 1, p.2957; italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Labor Code section 4853 provides: \u201cWhenever such disability of any such officer or employee continues for a period beyond one year, such member shall thereafter be subject as to disability indemnity to the provisions of this division other than Section 4850 during the remainder of the period of said disability <em>or until the effective date of his retirement under the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, </em>and the leave of absence shall continue.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. (County of Los Angeles) </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 55 [97 Cal.Rptr. 380], this court held that a county deputy sheriff was entitled to temporary disability indemnity after retiring on a CERL industrial disability pension because Labor Code section 4853 does not mention CERL retirements. <em>(Pennington, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d at pp. 57-60.) In so holding, this court noted: \u201c[U]nder P.E.R.S., an amount equal to [workers\u2019] compensation benefits paid is deducted from benefits payable under the system (Gov. Code, \u00a7 21027). No similar provision is now found in C.E.R.L. Former sections 32080-32082 required that retirement benefits would be reduced by the amount of any [workers\u2019] compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>received. [Citation.] But those sections were repealed in 1959. [IT] In view of this difference, it is hardly surprising to find that the [workers\u2019] compensation law contains some provisions which apply differently to the two classes of retirees.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 59.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Contra Costa County </em>(1982) 47 Cal.Comp.Cases 512, en banc, the Board relied on <em>Pennington </em>to hold that the county was not entitled to credit against VRTD for CERL disability pension payments received by a county fire fighter. <em>(Quintana, supra, </em>47 Cal.Comp.Cases at pp. 515-516, 519-520.) After mentioning the importance of vocational rehabilitation, the Board stated: \u201cThe concern for avoiding double recovery is secondary and may not even be applicable where the payments stem from different and perhaps separate obligations of the employer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 520.) The Board stated in dictum: \u201c[A] public safety employee subject to Labor Code Section 4850 is subject to termination of his temporary disability benefits, including rehabilitation temporary disability if he is retired under PERS____\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 516.) In reaching this conclusion, the Board discussed an unpublished Board panel decision determining that a county deputy sheriff was not entitled to continuing VRTD after his PERS retirement, but did not explain whether the retirement was a disability retirement or a service retirement. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 514-516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d 998, the Fourth District Court of Appeal held that a city police officer was not entitled to receive VRTD after his PERS disability retirement. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 999-1002.) Without mentioning CERL retirements or specifically discussing PERS service retirements, the court stated: \u201cPetitioner acknowledges that generally a safety employee\u2019s right to temporary disability benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act terminates on the effective date of his retirement pursuant to section 4853....</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">\u201c[T]he purpose of continued payments during rehabilitation is to provide sustenance for the employee during the rehabilitative process. However, that statutory purpose is in no way thwarted by the ruling and order of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>that a safety employee who has retired for disability and is receiving disability retirement payments is not also entitled to continued temporary disability payments. Sustenance is provided the employee during the rehabilitative process by the disability retirement payments being received by him.\u201d <em>(Gorman, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 1001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Matthews) </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 823 (198 Cal.Rptr. 116], Division Seven of this court held that a nonsafety member of PERS was entitled to receive VRTD concurrently with PERS disability pension payments. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 826-830.) The court explained that to allow the employer credit for the pension payments would contravene the objective of the workers\u2019 compensation laws and specifically that of Labor Code section 139.5 \u201cto maximally promote the vocational rehabilitation of the injured worker. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 232 (110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].)\u201d <em>(Matthews, supra, </em>at p. 828.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court determined that Government Code section 21025.6 neither expressly nor implicitly provides for a credit offset. <em>(Matthews, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 829.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The parties have not directed this court\u2019s attention to any opinion discussing whether a public safety worker who is industrially injured during employment by a county that is a member of the CERL system may receive VRTD after the effective date of the employee\u2019s CERL disability retirement if the employee also receives a PERS service pension earned solely as a result of former employment by another governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">As noted, <em>ante, </em>at the time of applicant\u2019s injury Labor Code section 4850 provided that an industrially injured county deputy sheriff may receive full salary in lieu of temporary disability indemnity for a period not exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>one year or \u201cuntil such earlier date as [the employee] is retired [under CERL or PERS] on permanent disability pension.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 981, \u00a71, p. 2957.) Labor Code section 4853 provides that whenever the disability continues beyond one year, \u201csuch member\u201d may receive disability indemnity \u201cduring the remainder of the period of said disability or until the effective date of his retirement under the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Act ....\u201d Thus, neither section expressly addresses whether a public safety employee within one of the categories listed in section 4850 may receive temporary disability indemnity after the date of disability retirement during a period in which the disability has continued for less than a year. In <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. (Freitas) </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 200 [103 Cal.Rptr. 29], the court noted this disparity and concluded that under Labor Code section 4853 an award of temporary disability indemnity to a city police officer may not extend beyond the effective date of the officer\u2019s PERS disability retirement. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.3d at p. 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Three aspects of Labor Code section 4853 are significant to the present case. First, section 4853 does not refer to CERL retirements. It therefore does not purport to limit the right to VRTD after the effective date of such a retirement. <em>(Quintana </em>v. <em>Contra Costa County, supra, </em>47 Cal.Comp.Cases at pp. 516, 519-520; see <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d at pp. 59-60.)  Second, while section 4853 does not specify the nature of the PERS retirement that terminates certain benefits of listed safety employees, it refers to Labor Code section 4850, which describes the relevant retirement in that section as a retirement on a \u201cpermanent disability pension.\u201d When both sections are read as part of an entire statutory scheme, it is apparent that the PERS retirement mentioned in section 4853 is an industrial disability retirement. Third, section 4853 describes the duration of a public safety employee\u2019s right to receipt of \u201cdisability indemnity\u201d under \u201cthe provisions of this division [division 4 of the Labor Code].\u201d The right to VRTD, however, is governed by Labor Code section 139.5, subdivision (c), which is part of division l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In construing Labor Code section 4853, we observe that the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that the rule of liberal construction must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>be applied to all aspects of workers\u2019 compensation law and that the underlying policy of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes and their constitutional foundation (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4), as well as the recurrent theme of countless appellate decisions, has been \u201cone of pervasive and abiding solicitude for the worker. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 633, 638 [211 Cal.Rptr. 683]; see, e.g., <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 621, 626-634 [170 Cal.Rptr. 32, 620 P.2d 618].) Respondents urge this court to apply the dictum in <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d 998, that VRTD need not be provided after the effective date of a public safety employee\u2019s disability retirement or, alternatively, to hold that because of the amounts of applicant\u2019s pension payments, applicant is receiving adequate sustenance and does not need VRTD. While applicant\u2019s simultaneous receipt of a CERL disability pension and a PERS service pension may well constitute a greater income than is received by the average qualified injured worker, we decline respondents\u2019 invitation to apply the <em>Gorman </em>dictum or adopt a case by case approach to the right to VRTD after retirement dependent upon the degree of sympathy or lack thereof evoked by the financial circumstances of a particular case. Such an approach would lead in many cases to undue delay in the provision of needed VRTD. (See <em>Kerley </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 223, 230 [93 Cal.Rptr. 192, 481 P.2d 200] [genuine doubt as to liability for benefits constitutes satisfactory excuse for delay].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 621, the Supreme Court explained that the Legislature has required prompt provision of vocational rehabilitation and VRTD for two reasons: \u201cThe first was to encourage employees to enroll in rehabilitation training by maintaining financial support to help defray their expenses while they participate in such programs. [Citation.] The second, equally clear, was to place on employers the primary duty of promptly making rehabilitation available in order to enable injured employees to reenter the work force as soon as practicable.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Applying the rule of liberal construction to Labor Code section 4853 as we are required to do <em>(Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 626-627; see <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 233 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]), we conclude that Labor Code section 4853 does not affect the right of a deputy sheriff or other public safety worker specified in Labor Code section 4850 to receive VRTD after the effective date of the employee\u2019s CERL disability pension. We further conclude that such an employee\u2019s right to VRTD is unaltered by the employee\u2019s simultaneous receipt of a CERL disability pension and a PERS service pension earned in prior employment for a different governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Our construction of Labor Code section 4853 is consistent with the objective of Labor Code section 139.5 \u201cto maximally promote the vocational rehabilitation of the injured worker\" <em>(Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Matthews), supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 828) and the overall purpose of workers\u2019 compensation \u201c \u2018to insure to the injured employee and those dependent upon him adequate means of subsistence while he is unable to work and also to bring about his recovery as soon as possible in order that he may be returned to the ranks of productive labor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 233.) Because we conclude that the WCJ erred in vacating the Bureau\u2019s award of retroactive VRTD, the matter must be remanded to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The July 30, 1986, order of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board denying reconsideration is annulled, and the matter is remanded to respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Kingsley, J., and McClosky, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In 1983 Labor Code section 4850 was amended to provide that salary benefits were payable for a period not exceeding one year \u201cor until such earlier date as [the employee] is retired on permanent disability pension, and is actually receiving disability pension payments.\u201d (Stats. 1983, ch. 762, \u00a7 1, p. 2802.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Labor Code section 4850 currently provides in part: \u201cWhenever any city policeman, harbor policeman of any harbor district, city, county, or district firefighter, sheriff or any officer or employee of a sheriffs office, any inspector, investigator, detective, or personnel with comparable title in any district attorney\u2019s office, or lifeguard employed year round on a regular, full-time basis by a county of the first class, who is a member of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System or subject to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3 of the Government Code) is disabled, whether temporarily or permanently, by injury or illness arising out of and in the course of his or her duties, he or she shall become entitled, regardless of his or her period of service with the city, county, or district, to leave of absence while so disabled without loss of salary in lieu of temporary disability payments, if any, which would be payable under this chapter, for the period of the disability, but not exceeding one year, <em>or until such earlier date as he or she is retired on permanent disability pension, and is actually receiving disability pension payments, or advanced disability pension payments pursuant to Section 4850.3 of the Labor </em>Code....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Government Code section 21027 provides: \u201cIf it is not claimed that the disability is industrial or if such claim is made and the member so requests, the board shall proceed with retirement and with the payment of such benefits as are payable when disability is not industrial.

The Board did not discuss the fact that Labor Code section 139.5 is part of a separate division of the Labor Code, and we are unpersuaded by its apparent conclusion that in the context of vocational rehabilitation the section defining compensation for purposes of division 4 is more significant than Labor Code section 139.5, which specifies affirmative obligations of the employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
