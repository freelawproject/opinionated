Ct. 104, 46 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1975), our Supreme Court held that an indigent defendant is entitled to the assistance of a state funded expert witness to counter expert testimony presented by the state, such as DNA testing, that is derived from new scientific technology. The principal issue in this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing a last-minute request by a criminal defendant to have an incriminating DNA test reexamined by a testing agency of the defendant\u2019s choice. We affirm the ruling of the trial court and its subsequent judgment finding the defendant guilty of the crimes with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In a two count information filed May 8, 2007, the state charged the defendant, Martin Gray, with having engaged in sexual intercourse with a person under thirteen years of age in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with having had intimate sexual contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>with a child under the age of sixteen in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 53-21 (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After accepting the jury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of these crimes, the trial court imposed a total effective sentence of forty-five years of incarceration, execution suspended after thirty-five years, followed by fifteen years of probation. The defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The juiy reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant became a member of the victim\u2019s household when she was six years old.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Six years later, when the victim began to occupy a bedroom of her own, the defendant repeatedly engaged in sexual intercourse with her. His misconduct came to light when the victim became pregnant and had a baby. The state\u2019s DNA testing of the victim, the baby and the defendant showed a high statistical probability that the defendant was the baby\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">To counter this incriminating evidence, the defendant maintains on appeal, as he argued at trial, that the trial court (1) improperly deprived him of the opportunity for an independent retest of the state\u2019s inculpatory DNA test and (2) misinstructed the jury on the relationship between intoxication and criminal liability. We are not persuaded by either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">DNA RETESTING</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The defendant\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that his conviction should be set aside because he was deprived of an opportunity to have an independent laboratory examine the DNA swabs that, according to the state\u2019s experts, demonstrated that he was the father of the victim\u2019s baby. In February, 2006, buccal swabs<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the victim, her baby and the defendant were submitted to the state laboratory for DNA paternity testing. The laboratory reported that the results were \u201cconsistent with [the defendant] being the father of [the victim\u2019s baby].\u201d At trial, the state\u2019s expert witness, although acknowledging that the test is a statistical comparison that cannot establish paternity definitively, opined that the probability of the defendant being the father was high.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In view of the incriminating nature of this DNA evidence, on May 1, 2007, in advance of the trial, the defendant filed a motion, pursuant to Practice Book (2007) \u00a7 40-11,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>in which he sought a court order requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>state to arrange for the DNA buccal swabs to be sent for retesting to Orchid Cellmark, a laboratory in Dayton, Ohio. The defendant\u2019s counsel explained to the court that, despite intensive efforts to move forward, she had only recently been able to identify this laboratory as a qualified testing resource.6 Expressing skepticism that such a test could be conducted in the five day period before the scheduled date for the commencement of the defendant\u2019s trial, the state opposed the motion. It emphasized that it had disclosed the DNA results to the defendant many months earlier, on October 4, 2006. The court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>observed, as well, that on February 14,2007, the defendant had been granted a continuance for the very purpose of enabling his counsel to consult with her own DNA experts. Although the defendant disclaimed any intention to ask for a further continuance and described a plan for an expedited processing of the DNA samples once they had been received from the state, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Focusing on the unique importance of DNA testing in the determination of the defendant\u2019s culpability in this case, the defendant asks us to review the denial of his motion for an independent examination of the DNA samples in accordance with the plenary standard of review that governs evidentiary claims that have significant constitutional implications. He relies on recent case law in which our Supreme Court has undertaken a plenary review of arguably suggestive pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>identification procedures; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>291 Conn. 122,137-38, 967 A.2d 56, cert. denied, 558 U.S. 895,130 S. Ct. 237,175 L. Ed. 2d 163 (2009); and of the materiality of undisclosed exculpatory evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 721-22, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The state reminds us, however, that, our Supreme Court\u2019s review of the propriety of sanctions for violations of discovery rules consistently has emphasized the discretion of the trial court to \u201cweigh the need for exclusion against the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tutson, </em>278 Conn. 715, 740,899 A.2d 598 (2006), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 214, 506 A.2d 125 (1986). In light of these precedents, we agree with the state that we may reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for independent retesting of the DNA samples only if we are persuaded that the court\u2019s ruling was an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In support of the defendant\u2019s contention that the denial of an opportunity for an independent retest was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion, he argues that (1) it would not have been burdensome for the state to challenge the results of a DNA retest, even if these results had been delayed, because such a retest would have been conducted in accordance with standard scientific protocols with which the state had demonstrable familiarity, (2) defense counsel\u2019s delay in identifying a testing authority was due not to negligence but to administrative delay in the assignment of counsel to represent the defendant and to the difficulty of identifying a laboratory to conduct the DNA retest, (3) the absence of an independent DNA retest would impair defense counsel\u2019s ability to conduct a searching cross-examination of the state\u2019s DNA evidence and (4) any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>delay occasioned by a belated return of the DNA samples after the retest would not have delayed the trial because jury selection had not yet begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The state relies, as it did in the trial court, on the fact that the defendant\u2019s motion was untimely in light of the ten weeks that had elapsed after the continuance that had been granted for the specific purpose of enabling the defense to consult a DNA expert. We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s additional suggestion that, to justify a request for a DNA retest, the defendant was required to anticipate the evidence that such a retest would have disclosed. The state was entitled, however, to question the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s representation that an out-of-state DNA retest could be completed in the five day time interval between the hearing on the motion and the scheduled commencement of the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">On the record before us, the defendant\u2019s ten week delay in asking for a retest, combined with the imminence of the commencement of the defendant\u2019s trial, provided ample factual support for the court\u2019s decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion. We therefore agree with the state that the court\u2019s ruling was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The defendant\u2019s alternate claim on appeal is a challenge to the propriety of the court\u2019s jury instructions relating to his denial of having intentionally engaged in intercourse with the victim. Our standard of review for a claim of instructional impropriety is well established, ^individual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge .... The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. ... In other words, we must consider whether the instructions [in totality] are sufficiently correct in law, adapted to the issues and ample for the guidance of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez-Roman, </em>297 Conn. 66, 89, 3 A.3d 783 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that he often drank alcohol to excess and took illegal drugs and that, as a result, he often would fall into a deep sleep that resembled a blackout. Because he could not recall anything that had occurred while he had been asleep, he hypothesized that his intercourse with the victim must have resulted from her actions and not his own. Although he conceded that voluntary intoxication was not a defense to the crimes with which he was charged, he argued, in reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 216, 514 A.2d 724 (1986), on appeal after remand, 208 Conn. 683, 546 A.2d 268 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1016, 109 S. Ct. 1131, 103 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1989), that because his inebriation rendered him unconscious, his conduct, like the conduct of a person under hypnosis, had not been voluntary and, therefore, could not properly be found to have been criminal misbehavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In accordance with the defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction with respect to intoxication, the court informed the jury of the defendant\u2019s contention that his intoxication, and his resultant unconsciousness, disabled him from engaging in wilful misconduct. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>defendant concedes that the instruction accurately presented his theory of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">However, at the request of the state, and over the objection of the defendant, the court also instructed the jury that both of the crimes with which he was charged were \u201cgeneral intent crimes. . . . Such acts must be voluntary or purposeful and not accidental or inadvertent or unconsciously done. There is no requirement that the defendant act with a criminal purpose. A voluntary act is defined as proceeding from the will or from one\u2019s own choice or consent or done by design or intention. Involuntary is defined as the contrary to our own choice. Voluntary bodily movements as used in this instruction on general intent have nothing to do with memory. The question is whether the bodily movements are voluntary or involuntary, not whether the actor has a conscious memory of them. Also, the voluntary ingestion of alcohol or illegal drugs is no defense to the crimes charged herein.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The defendant maintains that the court\u2019s charge on general intent was misleading because the evidence of intoxication that he had presented did not and could not explain how the intercourse had occurred and had not been proffered by the defendant as an excuse or defense. In response, the state argues, as it did at trial, that, in light of the totality of the evidence before the jury and the arguments of the parties, the court\u2019s instructions had to provide guidance to the jury on the complex interaction between intoxication, general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>intent and voluntary acts presented by the record. The defendant had himself presented the issue of his intoxication to the jury. Even if the jury believed the defendant\u2019s testimony that, because of his abuse of alcohol and drugs, he did not recall having engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim, it might also have believed the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had entered her room at night and there had sexually assaulted her. Without appropriate instructions, the jury might not have understood that the defendant\u2019s failure to <em>recall </em>his conduct did not establish that his conduct was <em>involuntary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We agree, therefore, with the state that, on this record, it was appropriate for the court to instruct the jury on the relationship between intoxication and general intent and of the relationship between intoxication and the state\u2019s burden of proving that the defendant had engaged in the acts with which he was charged. Indeed, <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 216, on which the defendant relies, supports the state\u2019s position because it holds that, in the <em>absence </em>of evidence of lack of the requisite mental capacity, a court need not charge on general intent. Id., 218. By contrast, in this case, once the defendant introduced such evidence at the trial, the state was entitled to request the charge on general intent that the court gave the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

In 2007, \u00a7 53-21 was amended. See Public Acts 2007, No. 07-143, \u00a7 4. Because the relevant 2003 and 2005 revisions of \u00a7 53-21 are identical, for convenience, we refer to the 2003 revision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse and the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to indentify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained.

The record makes it clear, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for further DNA testing, there was no confusion about the nature of the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\"> In light of the frequency of criminal cases involving some kind of DNA evidence, it is notable that it is apparently the responsibility of an individual public defender to identify a laboratory to conduct a DNA retest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\"> The defendant renewed his motion at his trial before the court, <em>Licari, J., </em>but the motion was again denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\"> Without objection, the court also instructed the jury as follows: \u201cA person\u2019s intent may be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence.

The only way a jury can determine a person\u2019s \u2014 what a person\u2019s intention was at any given time, aside from that person\u2019s own testimony is by circumstantial evidence. You may or may not believe that testimony according to whether or not you find it worthy of belief.\u201d The defendant has not challenged the validity of this instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
