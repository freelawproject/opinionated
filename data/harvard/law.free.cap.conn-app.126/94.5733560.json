On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to bad faith, (2) the plaintiff was entitled to full recovery under the parties\u2019 contract, including interest, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (3) the defendant\u2019s attempt to rescind the contract and his demand for recoupment of sums paid to the plaintiff were unavailing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The primary issue to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>resolved is whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover, pursuant to the contract, interest, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, despite the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff violated some provisions of the Home Improvement Act (act), General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because of the defendant\u2019s bad faith as found by the court. We conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the value of the work performed but is not entitled to recover, under the \u201cbad faith\u201d exception, additional damages provided for in the contract when the contract is otherwise unenforceable due to the plaintiff\u2019s violation of the act. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court only insofar as it awarded interest, attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the plaintiff. We otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. By complaint filed May 14, 2007, the plaintiff alleged that it had performed all of its obligations under a contract with the defendant but that the defendant had not satisfied his obligation to pay for the services rendered. The plaintiff sought to recover money damages, past due balances for services rendered, attorney\u2019s fees, interest and costs as provided for in the contract, and such other relief as the court deemed proper. The defendant filed two special defenses alleging that the plaintiff had failed to perform its work in a workmanlike manner, thereby breaching the contract, and that it violated the act in certain enumerated ways. The defendant also filed a counterclaim. In its response to the special defenses and counterclaim, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had filed his defenses pursuant to the act in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-53,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the case was referred to an attorney fact finder, who heard evidence on the matter on January 26 and February 9, 2009, and, who, on April 20, 2009, made the findings of fact, which follow. The parties entered into a written contract, pursuant to which the plaintiff agreed to install a fence and the defendant agreed to pay $22,318. At the time the defendant executed the contract, he paid a deposit of $11,000. The work was substantiality completed in November, 2004. In May, 2005, the plaintiff sought payment for the balance owed. The defendant refused, stating that his small dog could escape under the fence. The plaintiff designed a free \u201cfix\u201d by adding additional fencing around the bottom of the fence, but the defendant still refused to pay the balance due. In January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>2006, the plaintiff sent the defendant a written demand for payment under the contract, including attorney\u2019s fees, interest and costs as provided therein and commenced litigation thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The fact finder found that the contract did not comply with the act pursuant to \u00a7 20-429 (a) (7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the fact finder found the issues in favor of the plaintiff, including a finding that the defendant invoked the act in bad faith, and recommended that the court render judgment for the balance due, as well as for attorney\u2019s fees, costs and interest per the contract. The defendant objected to the court\u2019s acceptance of the findings of fact made by the attorney fact finder. See Practice Book \u00a7 23-57. After a hearing on the objection, the court sustained the objection only as to the attorney\u2019s fees and reduced the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded. The court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the fact finder\u2019s report, as modified by orders of the court. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In each of his claims, the defendant challenges both the factual conclusions reached by the attorney fact finder and the factual and legal conclusions of the trial court. We set forth our standard of review. \u201cAttorney fact finders are empowered to hear and decide issues of fact on contract actions pending in the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>.... On appeal, [o]ur function ... is not to examine the record to see if the trier of fact could have reached a contrary conclusion. . . . Rather, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. . . . This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Frazao Building Corp., </em>115 Conn. App. 324, 329, 972 A.2d 284 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u201cFinally, we note that, because the attorney [fact finder] does not have the powers of a court and is simply a fact finder, [a]ny legal conclusions reached by an attorney [fact finder] have no conclusive effect. . . . The reviewing court is the effective arbiter of the law and the legal opinions of [an attorney fact finder], like those of the parties, though they may be helpful, carry no weight not justified by their soundness as viewed by the court that renders judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 329-30. With the foregoing in mind, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We first address the claim that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not amount to bad faith. The defendant maintains that there was evidence before the fact finder that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>he disputed the quality of the plaintiffs work, which he claims is insufficient to constitute bad faith. The plaintiff claims, in response, that the facts found show the defendant\u2019s bad faith intent to avoid paying the balance due on the contract without any defense to payment. We agree with the plaintiff and uphold the trial court\u2019s finding of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We set forth the applicable principles of law. The act, pursuant to \u00a7 20-429 (a), provides that no home improvement contract shall be valid or enforceable against a homeowner unless it meets certain enumerated criteria. \u201cThe [act] is a remedial statute that was enacted for the purpose of providing the public with a form of consumer protection against unscrupulous home improvement contractors. . . . The aim of the statute is to promote understanding on the part of consumers with respect to the terms of home improvement contracts and their right to cancel such contracts so as to allow them to make informed decisions when purchasing home improvement services.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Wright Bros. Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>247 Conn. 218,231,720 A.2d235 (1998). <em>\u201cIn Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>[215 Conn. 316, 328, 576 A.2d 455 (1990)], our Supreme Court stated, in dictum, that a homeowner could not avail himself of the protection afforded to him by \u00a7 20-429 if he invoked the statute in bad faith. Our Supreme Court subsequently applied the bad faith exception in <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 618 A.2d 501 (1992), in which it upheld a trial court\u2019s factual finding of bad faith.\u201d <em>New England Custom Concrete, LLC </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>102 Conn. App. 652, 660-61, 927 A.2d 333 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In <em>Lucien </em>v. <em>McCormick Construction, LLC, </em>122 Conn. App. 295, 296, 998 A.2d 250 (2010), this court reversed a trial court\u2019s ruling, which had concluded that a homeowner had invoked the act in bad faith. <em>\u201cHabetz </em>[v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 231] made it clear . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that mere disagreement about contract performance does not suffice to establish bad faith. <em>Habetz </em>defined bad faith as involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one\u2019s rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive. . . . Bad faith means more than mere negligence; it involves a dishonest purpose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lucien </em>v. <em>McCormick Construction, LLC, </em>supra, 300. In <em>Lucien, </em>the trial court had concluded that the contractor had met its burden to establish the homeowner\u2019s bad faith, reasoning that the homeowner\u2019s representation by counsel throughout the negotiation process and the homeowner\u2019s failure to raise the noncompliance with the act until the defendant raised a claim of nonpayment established bad faith. Id., 301. This court concluded that there was \u201csimply . . . nothing in the stipulated facts that can legally and logically support the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff acted with a dishonest purpose in claiming that the defendant violated the act.\u201d Id., 302-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In the present case, the fact finder recited the following facts as evidence of the defendant\u2019s bad faith. After the work was substantially completed, the defendant, from November, 2004, through May, 2005, delayed payment of the balance due and, when pressed, revealed the existence of his small dog and his newly voiced concern about its escape. The defendant delayed the plaintiffs installation of a free fix for another six months because the parties could not agree on a date for the fix to be installed and could not agree that the balance would be paid upon completion. After the fix was installed, the defendant continued to refuse to pay the balance due, even though his only real concern about the work was addressed by the fix. Moreover, he testified at trial that the fence work was completed; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>simply decided he would not pay the balance due on the contract. The fact finder concluded that the plaintiff proved the defendant\u2019s bad faith, and the trial court accepted that finding over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly found that the defendant acted in bad faith when he invoked the act as a defense to payment of the balance due on the home improvement contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The defendant next claims that the bad faith exception does not entitle the plaintiff, who violated the act, to full recovery under the contract, including interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees. We agree with the defendant and conclude that, under the bad faith exception, the plaintiff is entitled only to recover the value of the work performed because the contract is otherwise unenforceable due to the plaintiff\u2019s violation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The following additional facts, as found by the attorney fact finder and accepted by the trial court, are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. Pursuant to \u00a7 20-429 (a) (7) of the act, the contract was deficient in that it failed to set forth start and completion times for the work performed. The failure to set forth a start date and a completion date was not merely a technical deficiency under the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the plaintiff had proven that the defendant raised the act as a defense to the plaintiffs breach of contract action in bad faith and that proof, according to the fact finder, entitled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>plaintiff to full recovery under the contract, including costs, interest and attorney\u2019s fees as provided therein. In his objection to the court\u2019s acceptance of these findings, the defendant challenged the conclusion that even if bad faith exists, the plaintiff was entitled to more than the contract amount. The trial court overruled that objection in part, rendering judgment awarding costs and interest pursuant to the contract but reducing the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, the court awarded the plaintiff $11,318 for the balance due on the work performed, $712.19 in costs, $1697.70 in attorney\u2019s fees and $7470 in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u201cBecause the requirements of the [act] are mandatoiy and must be strictly construed, the absence of [a commencement and a completion date] constitutes a violation of the [act] that renders the contract unenforceable. . . . Thus, the plaintiff is precluded from [any] recovery against the defendants unless the plaintiff can establish that the defendants\u2019 invocation of the [act] as the basis for their repudiation of the contract was in bad faith.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>232 Conn. 666, 680, 657 A.2d 1087 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff proved to the trial court that the defendant invoked the act in bad faith. Before proceeding to the question presented, namely, whether the plaintiff is entitled to costs, interest and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the bad faith exception, we must first address the defendant\u2019s claims as to the applicability of \u00a7 20-429 (f). Insofar as the defendant argues that the legislature overruled the bad faith exception by enacting \u00a7 20-429 (f), we find no merit to this argument. Similarly unavailing is the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff must prove <em>both </em>the homeowner\u2019s bad faith and the contractor\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 20-429 (f) in order to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Section 20-429 (f) provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall preclude a contractor who has complied with subdivisions (1), (2), (6), (7) and (8) of subsection (a) of this section from the recovery of payment for work performed based on the reasonable value of services which were requested by the owner, provided the court determines that it would be inequitable to deny such recovery.\u201d \u201cThe legislature added subsection (f) to \u00a7 20-429 when it enacted No. 93-215, \u00a7 1, of the 1993 Public Acts, in order to address what it considered to be the harsh result of <em>Barrett [Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 316] . . . .<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsection (f) of \u00a7 20-429 allows quantum meruit recovery in certain cases of partial noncompliance with subsection (a) . . . . Thus, if a court determines that the requirements of subsection (f) are met, it may award damages under a theory of unjust enrichment even if all of the requirements of the [act] are not met.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Newtown Pool Construction, LLC </em>v. <em>Errico, </em>103 Conn. App. 566, 569-70, 930 A.2d 50 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">As noted by our Supreme Court, albeit prior to the addition of subsection (f): \u201cIn the absence of specific legislative indication ... we do not read the act to override the general principle embodied in the bad faith exception: that an individual should not profit from his own deceptive and unscrupulous conduct. This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>never intended to advance the cause of the unscrupulous. We can only presume that the legislature had a similar intent. The question is . . . whether, in the absence of specific legislative indication otherwise, a doctrine founded on public policy and containing a strong strain of estoppel can prevent a misbehaving party from invoking the benefits of a statute which is absolute on its face.\u201d <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We do not read subsection (f) to override the bad faith exception because it does not, by its terms, purport to address the defense of bad faith. Rather, \u00a7 20-429 (f) addresses the availability of restitutionary remedies to a contractor who performs work under a partially defective home improvement contract, regardless of whether the homeowner acted in bad faith. Thus, a plaintiff contractor who enters into a contract for home improvement services but who does not comply with the act so that the contract is unenforceable has two potential avenues for recovery: \u00a7 20-429 (f) and the bad faith exception. The former avenue was created by the legislature, while the latter was judicially created.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We now turn to the question presented, which is whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover, under the bad faith exception, interest, attorney\u2019s fees and costs as provided for in the contract when the contract is otherwise unenforceable due to the plaintiffs violation of the act. Precedent from our Supreme Court suggests that the answer to that question is no: the bad faith exception allows a contractor to recover only the value of the work performed after it has completed its end of the bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 234-35, the trial court found that the contract did not conform with \u00a7 20-429 (a) (6) of the act but, nonetheless, rendered judgment in favor of the defendant contractor on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>counts of his counterclaim, awarding him $16,244, the amount unpaid under the original contract and for extras performed at the homeowners\u2019 request, because it found that the homeowners had raised the act as a defense in bad faith. Our Supreme Court \u201crecognized that proof of bad faith on the part of the homeowner is an exception to what might otherwise be a harsh lesson to the home improvement contractor unable to recover due to a violation of the act. The central element giving rise to this exception is the recognition that to allow the homeowner who acted in bad faith to repudiate the contract and hide behind the act would be to allow him to benefit from his own wrong, and indeed encourage him to act thusly. Proof of bad faith therefore serves to preclude the homeowner from hiding behind the protection of the act.\u201d Id., 237. \u201c[A] contractor, otherwise precluded from recovering moneys owed for his work because of a violation of the act, must be permitted to assert that the homeowner\u2019s bad faith precludes [the homeowner] from safely repudiating the contract and hiding behind the act in order to bar the contractor\u2019s recovery.\u201d Id., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 668, a contractor brought an action for breach of contract against the homeowners when the homeowners refused to allow the contractor to install a swimming pool pursuant to their contract. The contract to install the swimming pool did not conform with \u00a7 20-429 (a) (7) in that it did not contain a commencement or a completion date and was thus unenforceable because it did not comply with the act. Id., 680. The contractor attempted to invoke the bad faith exception and recover for the homeowners\u2019 contractual breach under the liquidated damages provision of the contract. Id., 681 n.24. Our Supreme Court concluded that the contractor could not recover under that provision because the contract was unenforceable. Id., 680-81. \u201cThe bad faith exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>... is intended to preclude a homeowner from unfairly invoking the [act] [t]o deny the contractor any opportunity of recovery after he has completed his end of the bargain . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 681. The contractor had not performed the home improvement services contemplated, and, thus, he could not recover. Id., 681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We find that <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 231, and <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 666, control the question presented. In the present case, the contract was deficient in that it failed to set forth a commencement date and a completion date for the work performed. The contract was thus rendered unenforceable. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429 (a) (7); <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 680. The plaintiff established that it completed the installation of the fence, that the defendant failed to pay the balance due in bad faith and that the defendant raised the act as a defense to payment in bad faith. See <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 237-38. Such proof of bad faith precludes the homeowner from hiding behind the protection of the act. Id., 237. Accordingly, it was legally and logically correct for the trial court to conclude that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the $11,318 for the balance due for the work performed. The plaintiff raised no basis other than the contract to support an award for attorney\u2019s fees, costs and interest. Because the contract was unenforceable, there was no basis to support the award of attorney\u2019s fees, costs and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly concluded that his attempt to rescind the contract almost three years after the fence was installed and his demand for recoupment of his deposit were unavailing. The theory under which the defendant believed he was entitled to rescind the contract and recoup his deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>is, at best, unclear. We find this claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant filed a three count counterclaim alleging that the plaintiffs performance was substandard, that its violations of the act constituted per se violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (CUTPA) and that the defendant was entitled to rescind the contract and recoup the consideration he had paid. In the third count, the defendant pleaded that he was entitled to rescind the contract and recoup all moneys paid pursuant to the \u201cterms and conditions of the [act] and [CUTPA] . . . .\u201d The defendant failed to demonstrate any damages arising out of the claimed violation of the act and the court declined to award any damages pursuant to CUTPA. The fact finder believed that, in the third count of the counterclaim, captioned \u201c[recoupment,\u201d the defendant appeared to be making a claim for equitable relief pursuant to CUTPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact finder concluded that granting recoupment would be inequitable because the defendant would have received a benefit, a fence around his property for $11,000 even though he had agreed to pay $22,000 for it. Further, the fact finder concluded that the provision in the contract regarding the defendant\u2019s right to cancellation and rescission complied with the requirements of the act, \u00a7 20-429 (a) (6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court accepted these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the lack of damages arising out of the claimed violation of CUTPA. Nor does he challenge the finding that the notice of cancellation complied with the requirements of the act. Rather, the defendant, relying on an isolated provision in the Truth-In-Lending Act, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-675 et seq., maintains that he was entitled to rescind the contract and recoup his $11,000 deposit at any time \u201cwithin three years of the completion of the transaction\u201d because the plaintiff did not give the defendant a copy of the contract signed by both parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He claims that, in \u00a7 20-429 (e), the act requires that the contractor comply with the Truth-in-Lending Act when a homeowner, for example, agrees to pay a finance charge for the privilege of paying the contract price in installments over a period of time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This portion of \u00a7 20-429 (e) does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the contract at issue. Moreover, were we to agree with the defendant\u2019s position, we would, in effect, award him an unwarranted windfall that the legislature could not have intended. See <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>290 Conn. 1, 15-16, 961 A.2d 373 (2009) (holding that act does not preclude trial court from reducing homeowner\u2019s damages by amount left unpaid under contract, otherwise act \u201ccould be read to allow a homeowner affirmatively to obtain a free home improvement project from the contractor, rather than simply to prevent the contractor from enforcing otherwise valid claims against the homeowner\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the award to the plaintiff of attorney\u2019s fees, costs and interest, and the case is remanded with direction to vacate that award, and to render judgment awarding the plaintiff the balance due on the work performed. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-12\"> The defendant also claims that the court improperly concluded that the contract was enforceable against him despite the fact that he was the only party to the contract to sign it. The following additional facts are necessary to understand the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant objected to the court\u2019s acceptance of the attorney fact finder\u2019s findings on a number of grounds, including the finding that a written contract existed between the parties even though the only copies of the contract in evidence contained only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the defendant\u2019s and not the plaintiffs signature. The trial court heard the defendant\u2019s objections at ahearing on June 15,2009, and ordered memoranda of law on this issue, which it received June 29, 2009. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to the findings on July 6, 2009, in part but did not state its reasons. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objections as to attorney\u2019s fees only. The defendant did not seek an articulation of this ruling. Because we address the issue of the enforceability of the contract on a wholly separate ground in part n of this opinion, and because the record is inadequate to review the defendant\u2019s claim, we decline to afford it review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No home improvement contract shall be valid or enforceable against an owner unless it: (1) Is in writing, (2) is signed by the owner and the contractor, (3) contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor, (4) contains the date of the transaction, (5) contains the name and address of the contractor, (6) contains a notice of the owner\u2019s cancellation rights in accordance with the provisions of [the Home Solicitation Sales Act], (7) contains a starting date and completion date, and (8) is entered into by a registered salesman or registered contractor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u201c(c) The contractor shall provide and deliver to the owner, without charge, a completed copy of the home improvement contract at the time such contract is executed. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201c(f) Nothing in this section shall preclude a contractor who has complied with subdivisions (1), (2), (6), (7) and (8) of subsection (a) of this section from the recovery of payment for work performed based on the reasonable value of services which were requested by the owner, provided the court determines that it would be inequitable to deny such recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">For convenience, all subsequent references to \u00a7 20-429 will be to the 2003 revision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-5\"> Practice Book \u00a7 23-53 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court, on its own motion, may refer to a fact finder any contract action pending in the superior court ... in which money damages only are claimed, which is based upon an express or implied promise to pay a definite sum, and in which the amount, legal interest or properly in controversy is less than $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\"> Specifically, the contract did not contain a starting date and a completion date in violation of \u00a7 20-429 (a) (7). The fact finder also found that the contract did not contain the contractor\u2019s registration number in violation of \u00a7 20-429 (a) (5), although he also found that the plaintiff is a registered home improvement contractor. We note that the statute in effect at the time the contract was executed did not require that the contractor include his registration number. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429 (a) (5). Although the plaintiff did not produce a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff, the fact finder did not find that the plaintiff failed to sign the contract. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Accordingly, we will focus our analysis on the plaintiffs failure to include a starting date and a completion date in the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> Compare <em>Wright Bros.
