Irving. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) failed to find that the defendant breached her contract with the plaintiff and (2) awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb. We agree with the plaintiffs second claim and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record reveal the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff is a skilled nursing care facility that provides medical care, including long-term care, room and board, and prescription medication for its residents. William P. Ammon, the defendant\u2019s father, was admitted to the plaintiffs facility on October 29, 2002. Upon his admission, the defendant signed a \u201cPatient/Resident Admissions Agreement\u201d (admission agreement) and various other documents as the \u201cresponsible party\u201d for the patient. Section II, paragraph 10, of the admission agreement states that \u201c[i]f the responsible party has control of or access to the patient/ resident\u2019s income and/or assets, the responsible party agrees that these funds shall be used for the patient/ resident\u2019s welfare, including but not limited to making prompt payment for care and services rendered to the patient/resident in accordance with the terms of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The defendant never had her father\u2019s power of attorney, nor had she ever been appointed conservatrix of his person or estate, or executrix or administratrix of his estate after he died. When her father was admitted to the facility, the defendant informed the plaintiff that she would be the contact person for matters concerning her father\u2019s personal care, and that her brother, William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>P. Ammon, Jr. (Ammon, Jr.), would be responsible for their father\u2019s financial matters. The admitting record form lists Ammon, Jr., as the person responsible for the account, and the plaintiff mailed monthly bills directly to him. Ammon, Jr., held a power of attorney for their father and paid the father\u2019s bills from the father\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The defendant\u2019s father was a resident at the plaintiffs nursing care facility from the date of his admission until his death on July 24, 2003. Initially, the charges for his residency were covered by medicare. His private health insurance then paid for his care until March 1, 2003, at which time the plaintiff was notified by the insurer that the coverage was being discontinued on the ground that he no longer required skilled care. From June 11, 2003, until the date of his death, the private health insurance again paid for the father\u2019s residency. Thus, the period of time uncovered by either medicare or the private health insurance was March 1 through June 10, 2003, which resulted in a total unpaid balance of $27,340.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The father\u2019s bank statements for the period of March 1 through June 30, 2003, indicated account balances fluctuating between $26,000 and $54,000. The father had additional assets, including shares of stock, certificates of deposit and a house in Bridgeport. Although the plaintiff sent monthly invoices to Ammon, Jr., the account for the father remained unpaid. Despite the outstanding bill, Ammon, Jr., wrote a check payable to the defendant for $11,000 from the father\u2019s account as a gift in April, 2003. Similarly, he wrote a check to himself at the same time for $11,000 from the father\u2019s account. After the father\u2019s death, the house in Bridgeport was sold, and Ammon, Jr., gifted the defendant $55,000, and, similarly, gifted himself $55,000 from the proceeds of that sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The defendant never questioned the quality of care provided her father during his stay at the plaintiffs facility. In fact, she testified that the \u201ccaregivers are exceptional.\u201d Notably, her mother was a resident at the plaintiffs facility at the time of trial, and the defendant herself had been a resident in the past. Nevertheless, neither the defendant nor Ammon, Jr., paid the outstanding bill from their father\u2019s assets even though the assets were ample and more than sufficient to satisfy the amount due the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The plaintiff filed the present action against the defendant in March, 2006, claiming breach of contract and fraud. The defendant, represented by her husband, attorney Charles J. Irving, filed an answer with seven special defenses and a four count counterclaim. Pretrial discovery and pleadings were handled by attorney Irving. Shortly before trial, the firm of Krasow, Garlick and Hadley, LLC, filed an appearance in lieu of attorney Irving on behalf of the defendant. The case was tried before the court on April 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">By memorandum of decision filed September 24, 2008, the court found that the defendant did not have a power of attorney for her father and did not have access to his checking account or to any of his other financial resources. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant on the complaint. The court found the issues in favor of the plaintiff on the counterclaim. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for reargument and reconsideration pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-12, which the court granted but denied the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">By motion filed October 8, 2008, the defendant requested attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb and Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 for her successful defense against the complaint. The plaintiff filed an objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>motion, claiming, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees were spent primarily on the prosecution of the counterclaim and not in the defense of the plaintiffs claim. A hearing was held November 3, 2008, at which time the defendant requested $39,000 for pretrial and trial representation. Of that amount, $25,481.25 was requested by the defendant\u2019s husband\u2019s firm, Charles J. Irving, LLC, for pretrial representation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 25, 2008, Charles J. Irving, LLC, filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant in addition to the appearance already on file of Krasow, Gaxlick and Hadley, LLC. On February 27, 2009, the court issued its memorandum of decision on the request for attorney\u2019s fees. In that decision, the court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiff argues that the attorney\u2019s fees should not apply to the counterclaim upon which she did not prevail. The court agrees with this argument. Accordingly, the court awards to defendant Janet Irving attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $36,000 for successfully defending the complaint in this case.\u201d No further explanation was provided for the court\u2019s calculation of the amount awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On September 22, 2009, attorney Irving filed an application for a prejudgment remedy in the amount of $75,000 to secure the attorney\u2019s fees already awarded and to secure \u201csubstantial additional [attorney\u2019s] fees for the defense of the plaintiffs appeal, which [attorney\u2019s] fees are subject to a further award to the defendant pursuant to [\u00a7] 42-150bb.\u201d The court granted the application in the amount of $50,000. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">LIABILITY UNDER THE CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly failed to find the defendant liable under the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>agreement for those funds that she received as gifts and reimbursements from her father\u2019s assets through Ammon, Jr., by means of the father\u2019s power of attorney. The defendant argues that the court concluded correctly that the only person who had access to the patient\u2019s funds was Ammon, Jr., and that the defendant was under no obligation to remit to the plaintiff any gifts or reimbursements that she received. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The following additional facts were found by the court in a supplementary memorandum of decision filed June 1, 2009. The father had a joint checking account with his wife from which Ammon, Jr., paid their bills pursuant to his power of attorney. As previously noted, between March and June, 2003, the period during which the $27,340 balance accrued, Ammon, Jr., transferred various sums of money to himself and to the defendant. The funds transferred to the defendant from the checking account were either reimbursements for funds expended by the defendant on behalf of her father and/ or mother or monetary gifts from her father and/or mother. Specifically, one check to the defendant was the previously mentioned gift in the amount of $11,000. Various other checks reimbursed the defendant for purchases she made for her father for such items as shoes, sweaters and pants, bringing the total amount transferred to the defendant from the checking account to $13,630.89. The court concluded that, upon the defendant\u2019s receipt of the funds, the funds became her property, and not the father\u2019s, and therefore she was under no legal obligation to use these funds to pay the plaintiffs outstanding bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge these findings. Rather, it challenges the conclusion that the defendant was under no legal obligation to use the $13,630.89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to pay the plaintiffs outstanding bill. It maintains that because she had \u201caccess\u201d to her father\u2019s funds, the defendant\u2019s failure to remit the funds to the plaintiff constituted a breach of the admission agreement. To resolve this question, we must examine the language of the admission agreement that the plaintiff relies on to support its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">\u201cWe begin by setting forth our standard of review. The standard of review for the issue of contract interpretation is well established. When, as here, there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . . Accordingly, our review is plenary. . . . The reviewing court must decide whether [the trial court\u2019s] conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Genua </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>118 Conn. App. 270, 273-74, 982 A.2d 1125 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201cWhether there was a breach of contract is ordinarily a question of fact. . . . We review the court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. . . . The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colliers, Dow &amp; Condon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>77 Conn. App. 462, 471-72, 823 A.2d 438 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">It is undisputed that the defendant was the \u201cresponsible party,\u201d as that term is used in the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>agreement. She signed many documents on her father\u2019s behalf, including documents relating to organ donation, the administration of oxygen and an influenza vaccine, and regarding her father\u2019s participation in facility activities and social events. The admission agreement provides that <em>\u201c[i]f </em>the responsible party has control of or access to the patient/resident\u2019s income and/or assets, the responsible party agrees that these funds shall be used for the patient/resident\u2019s welfare, including but not limited to making prompt payment for care and services rendered to the patient/resident in accordance with the terms of this agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The contract, as drafted by the plaintiff, employs the word \u201cif.\u201d The contract does not require that the person serving as the \u201cresponsible party\u201d also be the person in control of the patient\u2019s income or assets. The plain language of the contract contemplates a scenario in which one party may be responsible for making decisions for the patient\u2019s personal care while another may be responsible for \u201cmaking prompt payment for care and services rendered to the patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The evidence on which the plaintiff relies for the proposition that the defendant had \u201caccess\u201d to the patient\u2019s assets is that she received $13,630.89 in gifts and reimbursements from him during the relevant period. We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that when the defendant received a gift from her father through the power of attorney, title vested in her immediately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, that sum could not be considered accessible funds for the purpose of holding the defendant liable for her father\u2019s debt under the admission agreement. Similarly, we do not agree that, when the defendant expended her own funds for the benefit of her father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>and received reimbursements from her father through Ammon, Jr., the reimbursed sums were accessible funds such that the defendant is liable for breach of contract. The evidence indicates that the plaintiff mailed monthly bills for its services to Ammon, Jr., as the person responsible for the account, and not to the defendant. Ample evidence was presented to support the court\u2019s finding that Ammon, Jr., and not the defendant, had their father\u2019s power of attorney and had access to their father\u2019s checking account and other financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Sunrise Healthcare Corp. </em>v. <em>Azarigian, </em>76 Conn. App. 800, 821 A.2d 835 (2003), is misplaced. Unlike the defendant in the present case, the defendant in <em>Sunrise Healthcare Corp. </em>had executed a contract with a nursing care facility both as the \u201cresponsible party\u201d under the contract <em>and </em>as the patient\u2019s power of attorney. Id., 802. As such, she had \u201c \u2018control of or access to the resident\u2019s income and/or assets\u2019 id., 808; and breached the contract with the facility by misusing the patient\u2019s assets. Id., 813. We agree with the court that the defendant in the present case had no such control or access. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant is not obligated under the admission agreement to remit to the plaintiff any sums that she received from her father as gifts or reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Section 42-150bb<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that a consumer may recover attorney\u2019s fees against a commercial party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>when the consumer successfully defends an action based on a contract \u201cin which the money, property or service which is the subject of the transaction is primarily for personal, family or household purposes\u201d if the contract provides for attorney\u2019s fees for the commercial party. The plaintiff challenges whether \u00a7 42-150bb applies to this contract, whether the defendant was a consumer entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, if this court concludes that the statute does apply, whether the attorney\u2019s fees awarded were reasonable. We conclude that the statute does not apply because the defendant is not a consumer and, therefore, that the court improperly awarded the attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We set forth our standard of review and the relevant principles of law. \u201cThe general rule of law known as the American rule is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception. . . . This rule is generally followed throughout the country. . . . Connecticut adheres to the American rule. . . . There are few exceptions. For example, a specific contractual term may provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and costs ... or a statute may confer such rights.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 576, 582, 923 A.2d 697 (2007). \u201cThe law expects parties to bear their own litigation expenses, except where the legislature has dictated otherwise by way of statute. . . . Section 42-150bb clearly authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim on a consumer contract or lease.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Traystman, Coric &amp; Keramidas, P.C. </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>282 Conn. 418, 429, 922 A.2d 1056 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Whether the defendant is a \u201cconsumer\u201d pursuant to the statute presents a question of statutory construction. Statutory construction is \u201ca [question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute], General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 525, 978 A.2d 487 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Section 42-150bb provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any contract or lease ... to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney\u2019s fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease. . . .\u201d As noted by our Supreme Court in <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 75, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997), the purpose of \u00a7 42-150bb is to make attorney\u2019s fees clauses \u201c \u2018reciprocal\u2019 \u201d in order to bring parity between a commercial party and a consumer. The legislature was concerned with remedying an inequitable situation: \u201cWhat [the statute] does is give some equity to the situation. At the present time, many form contracts include attorney\u2019s fees provisions for the commercial party, and even though . . . that [commercial] party may be wrong and a consumer successfully defends an action against him, or her, [the consumer] would not be entitled to receive attorney\u2019s fees in defending that action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 42-150bb, the court has no latitude to deny [attorney\u2019s fees] to a <em>consumer </em>who successfully defends an action brought against him by a commercial party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 66. Such attorney\u2019s fees are available, rather, by operation of law. Id. Section 42-150bb provides in relevant part that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section . . . \u2018consumer\u2019 means the buyer, debtor, lessee or personal representative of any of them. . . .\u201d The defendant concedes, and we agree, that she is not a buyer, debtor or lessee as those terms are used in the statute. We agree with both parties that if anyone was a buyer pursuant to the statute, it was the father because it was he who received the plaintiffs services and it was from his assets that outstanding bills were to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The defendant maintains, however, that she was the buyer\u2019s \u201cpersonal representative\u201d and is thus a \u201cconsumer\u201d for the purposes of the statute. The term \u201cpersonal representative\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 42-150bb<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>is used throughout our statutes to refer to a person who acts as a custodian or guardian of a person who lacks capacity or one with authority to act on behalf of a decedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[w]hen a statute does not provide a definition, words and phrases in a particular statute are to be construed according to their common usage. ... To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Potvin </em>v. <em>Lincoln Service &amp; Equipment Co., </em>298 Conn. 620, 633, 6 A.3d 60 (2010). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) defines a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d as \u201ca person (as an executor or administrator for a deceased person, heir or next of kin for an ancestor, a devisee or legatee for a testator, a receiver for an absent or insolvent person or guardian or conservator or committee for an incompetent) who stands in the place of another or who represents his legal interests.\u201d See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) (\u201cpersonal representative. ... A person who manages the legal affairs of another because of incapacity or death, such as the executor of an estate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In the present case, no conservator ever was appointed for the defendant\u2019s father. The defendant did not have his power of attorney,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was not appointed his conservatrix and was not the executrix or administra-trix of his estate after he died. She simply does not fall within that term as it has been used in our statutory scheme or fall within the definition of personal representative as defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary or Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. She signed the admission agreement as the responsible party and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>obligated herself to pay the plaintiff for her father\u2019s care from her father\u2019s assets if she had control over his assets. The defendant consistently took the position, and the trial court agreed, that she had no authority over the disposition of her father\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The terms responsible party and personal representative are not synonymous. We decline to expand the definition of personal representative to include the defendant, and, especially under these circumstances, it would not be legally sound to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Furthermore, as we previously noted, Connecticut adheres to the American rule. <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 282 Conn. 582. Section 42-150bb, enacted in 1979, provides for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based on a consumer contract. \u201c[W]hen a statute is in derogation of common law or creates a liability where formerly none existed, it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rawling </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>206 Conn. 100, 105, 537 A.2d 439 (1988). Accordingly, \u00a7 42-150bb should be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We are particularly reluctant to expand the definition of personal representative to include responsible party because the award of statutory fees under \u00a7 42-150bb is mandatory. \u201c[T]he court has no latitude to deny such an award to a consumer who successfully defends an action brought against him by a commercial party.\u201d <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 66. The court has no discretion; it is obligated to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees by operation of law. Id. To expand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the definition of personal representative in the way proposed by the defendant and the dissent represents a policy decision more properly left to the legislature, not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Because the defendant is not a buyer, debtor, lessee or personal representative, her claim that she is a consumer under \u00a7 42-150bb must fail. Accordingly, she was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under that statutory provision, and the court improperly awarded those fees to her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and the case is remanded with direction to vacate that award. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In this opinion LAVINE, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> In reviewing attorney Irving\u2019s billing summary, we note that the first three entries are for legal services performed in July and September, 2005, which was prior to the service of process of the complaint, which occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>many months later on March 13, 2006.

Although I agree with part I of the majority opinion, I respectfully disagree with part II. The plaintiff, Aaron Manor, Inc., claimed in its breach of contract action that the defendant, Janet A. Irving, was the party responsible for payments for the care of its patient, her late father, William Ammon. The defendant successfully defended the action. In my view, the defendant was a \u201cconsumer\u201d entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from the plaintiff under General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I dissent from part II in which the majority concludes that the defendant was not entitled to recover such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The plaintiff, a nursing facility that provides medical care and services, incurred expenses providing such services to Ammon. The record indicates that on the day he was admitted to the facility, \u201cconfusion\u201d prevented him from signing the forms necessary for admission. In order to gain him admission to the facility, his daughter, the defendant, signed a number of documents, including the admission agreement, as the \u201cresponsible party.\u201d As found by the trial court, the defendant informed the plaintiff that she would be the contact person for matters concerning the patient\u2019s personal care, and that her brother, William P. Ammon, Jr. (Ammon, Jr.), would be responsible for the patient\u2019s financial matters. The admitting record form lists Ammon, Jr., as the person responsible for the account. Ammon, Jr., held a power of attorney for his father and managed his financial affairs, including paying his bills from his bank account. The plaintiff mailed monthly bills for the services provided to the patient directly to Ammon, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The plaintiff provided care and services for which it was not paid by either medicare or the patient\u2019s insurance carrier. The plaintiff, a commercial party, commenced the present action against the defendant, alleging in its complaint that she had agreed, by signing the admission agreement, to apply her father\u2019s income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>and assets to pay for such care and services if she had control of or access to her father\u2019s income or assets. The plaintiff alleged that she had such control or access but had failed to pay the outstanding balance for the services. It alleged further that, because of the defendant\u2019s breach of the admission agreement, it was entitled to interest and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as provided in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The defendant successfully defended this breach of contract action based on the plaintiffs failure to prove that she had the requisite control of or access to her father\u2019s income or assets. The defendant requested the court to award her attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb and Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, which the court granted in the amount of $36,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Section 42-150bb provides that a \u201cconsumer\u201d may recover attorney\u2019s fees against a commercial party when the consumer successfully defends an action based upon a contract \u201cin which the money, property or service which is the subject of the transaction is primarily for personal, family or household purposes\u201d if the contract provides for attorney\u2019s fees for the commercial party. General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb. Section 42-150bb provides in relevant part that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section . . . \u2018consumer\u2019 means the buyer, debtor, lessee or personal representative of any of them. ...\u201d As noted by the majority, the issue in the present appeal is whether the defendant was the \u201cpersonal representative\u201d of her father, and therefore, a \u201cconsumer\u201d entitled to avail herself of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Whether the defendant is a \u201cconsumer\u201d pursuant to the statute presents an issue of statutory construction, which is \u201ca [question] of law, over which [this court exercises] plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 525, 978 A.2d 487 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">As the majority points out, the statute is in derogation of the common law American rule that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not awarded to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception. <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 576, 582, 923 A.2d 697 (2007). While there axe few exceptions to this rule, it does not necessarily follow that the statute must be construed narrowly, as the majority determines. \u201cThe law expects parties to bear their own litigation expenses, <em>except </em>where the legislature has dictated otherwise by way of statute. . . . Section 42-150bb clearly authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim on a consumer contract or lease.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Traystman, Coric &amp; Keramidas, P.C. </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>282 Conn. 418, 429, 922 A.2d 1056 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The purpose of \u00a7 42-150bb is to make attorney\u2019s fees clauses reciprocal in order to bring parity between a commercial party and a consumer. <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 75, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997). In <em>Rizzo Pool Co., </em>our Supreme Court examined the legislative history of the statute, noting that \u201c[i]n 1979, the Connecticut legislature enacted No. 79-453 of the 1979 Public Acts, entitled \u2018An Act Concerning Attorney\u2019s Fee Clauses in Consumer Contracts.\u2019 \u201d Id., 74.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The legislative emphasis on reciprocity, equity, fairness and consumer protection is evident throughout the debate on the bill. For example, speaking on behalf of the bill, Senator Alfred Santaniello, Jr., remarked: \u201cThis bill makes attorney\u2019s fee clauses reciprocal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 75. Representative Richard D. Tulisano commented: \u201cWhat [the statute] does is give some <em>equity </em>to the situation.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In response to a remark in opposition to the bill, in which the opponent argued that the bill took away the parties\u2019 freedom of contract, Senator Salvatore C. DePiano stated: \u201cI think that most of the time these consumer contracts are drawn up by the creditor and under the circumstances many of the consumers are not aware of [the attorney\u2019s fees] provision in the [contract], and therefore, I think [the consumers] should be protected because ... if a creditor brings a lawsuit . . . had he been successful, he would have collected attorney\u2019s fees. I think it\u2019s only fair that we legislate that the consumer can get the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>same protection and therefore be entitled [to] attorney\u2019s fees [should the consumer prevail]. I think it\u2019s a good consumer bill and I urge its passage . . . .\u201d 22 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1979 Sess., pp. 4276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">I conclude that, as a consumer protection statute, \u00a7 42-150bb has a remedial purpose that should be <em>interpreted broadly </em>in favor of those persons whom the legislature intended to protect. See, e.g., <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>232 Conn. 666, 678, 657 A.2d 1087 (1995) (noting that \u201c[a]s remedial legislation [the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.] must be afforded a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit\u201d); <em>Cagiva North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schenk, </em>239 Conn. 1, 14, 680 A.2d 964 (1996) (noting that \u201cthe Lemon Law [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-179 through 42-186] is a remedial statute that ought to be read broadly in favor of those consumers whom the law is designed to protect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In the present case, the issue is whether the defendant is a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d of the buyer. As noted by the majority, the term \u201cpersonal representative\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 42-150bb but is commonly used in various statutes to refer to a person who acts as a custodian or guardian of a person who lacks capacity or one with authority to act on behalf of a decedent. In this instance, however, unlike such statutes as the Uniform Transfer on Death Security Registration Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Connecticut Uniform Transfers to Minors Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the legislature chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>not to define the term in a way that limited its application to legal representatives.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Evidence of the defendant\u2019s authority to make decisions of a personal and medical nature on the patient\u2019s behalf was presented to the court by the plaintiff, itself. Before her father could be admitted to the facility, the defendant was required to sign various forms on his behalf as the representative of her father with respect to certain matters affecting her father\u2019s well-being and other interests. For example, she was required to sign a document concerning which \u201cheroic measures\u201d could be administered to him, in which she declined cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She was required to sign other documents regarding his medical care and treatment, including an organ and tissue donation form, an admission screening form for medicare as a secondary insurance, an assignment of medicare benefits form and a form consenting to such rehabilitation therapy as may be ordered by his physician. On that same day, she was required to sign various other documents required by the plaintiff, including the admission agreement, a document regarding the resident\u2019s responsibilities, his consent to be photographed, his consent to room changes, notifications concerning the privacy act and the patient\u2019s bill of rights and other documents. On a date shortly thereafter, as the responsible party and at the plaintiffs request, she authorized the facility to administer an influenza vaccine to her father.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The plaintiff commenced this action against this defendant <em>precisely because </em>she was the party who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>signed the forms <em>that it required </em>in order for her father to receive care. The plaintiff relied on the defendant\u2019s position and authority as the \u201cresponsible party\u201d under the agreement that it had required when it initiated the lawsuit against her. It alleged that, by virtue of her authority as the \u201cresponsible party,\u201d she was hable for her father\u2019s outstanding bill, at least insofar as she had control of or access to his income or assets per the admission agreement. The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant had the requisite control of or access to the patient\u2019s assets. As a result, she prevailed in the breach of contract action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The purpose of \u00a7 42-150bb is to bring parity between a commercial party and a consumer who defends successfully an action on a contract prepared by the commercial party. The plaintiff bears full responsibility for placing the defendant in the position of having to defend a breach of contract action by alleging that, as the \u201cresponsible party,\u201d she was responsible for paying certain outstanding bills by virtue of her authority to act on behalf of the patient. It cannot now maintain that, because <em>it failed to prove </em>that she had access to or control of the patient\u2019s financial assets, she had <em>no </em>authority to act on behalf of the patient and is not entitled to recover the fees she incurred defending that action. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, I would conclude that the defendant was the \u201cpersonal representative\u201d of the patient buyer for the purposes of the statute and, accordingly, is a \u201cconsumer\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u00a7 42-150bb. Because the defendant is a consumer who defended the action successfully, pursuant to terms of the statute, she would be entitled by operation of law to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as provided in the contract. Accordingly, I dissent from part II of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Because the majority concluded that the defendant was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, it did not reach the question of whether the fees awarded were reasonable. Because I conclude that the defendant was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees by operation of law as provided in the contract, I will address the plaintiffs argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision did not go into detail on the issue of the reasonableness of the fee awarded. The court found that the defendant was entitled to \u201creasonable\u201d attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb and the contract for defending the complaint but not for prosecuting the counterclaim on which she did not prevail. Although the defendant requested $39,000 in fees, the court awarded $36,000 without making any other findings pertaining to the reasonableness of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The plaintiff objects primarily to the portion of the attorney\u2019s fees awarded that were incurred by the defendant\u2019s husband, which was the basis for approximately $25,500 of the amount claimed. The itemized bill from the defendant\u2019s husband was admitted as a full exhibit at trial, but the plaintiff did not challenge the bill at that time. At oral argument on the motion for counsel fees, the court asked the plaintiff whether it challenged the amount of counsel fees or the reasonableness of the counsel fees claimed, and the court heard the plaintiffs argument. In light of this record, I find the plaintiffs claim that it had no opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the fees to be unavailing. The plaintiff had at least two such opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Moreover, the plaintiff failed to seek an articulation from the court as to how it arrived at the $36,000 award. Making every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, the evidence before the court included the itemized bills from which it reasonably could have determined that $3000 was an appropriate deduction for the prosecution of the counterclaim. See <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 681 n.5, 443 A.2d 486 (1982) (itemized list of services, court file and court\u2019s own general knowledge could provide evidentiary basis for court to decide amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees). Although the amount of the award is troubling, I find no basis on which to reverse the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb provides: \u201cWhenever any contract or lease entered into on or after October 1, 1979, to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney\u2019s fee shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease.
