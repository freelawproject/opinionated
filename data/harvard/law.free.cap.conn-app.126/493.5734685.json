On appeal, the respondent claims that the court improperly vested temporary custody of the child in Denise R. in light of its finding that the child was not in immediate physical danger from her surroundings. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On April 29, 2010, the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) filed a motion for an order of temporary custody with respect to the child. The commissioner previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>had filed a petition of neglect with respect to the child on March 17, 2010. The court granted the commissioner\u2019s motion for an order of temporary custody on an ex parte basis and ordered that the care and custody of the child be temporarily vested in Denise R. pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 12, 2010, a contested hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion took place during which the court received extensive evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the child\u2019s living situation and relationship with the respondent. Following this hearing, the court determined that the child was not in immediate physical danger from her surroundings and thus vacated the ex parte order of temporary custody. Nonetheless, the court designated Denise R. as the continuing temporary custodian of the child until \u201can appropriate court determines that she should be placed safely elsewhere.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The respondent now claims that the court improperly vested temporary custody of the child in Denise R., despite vacating the ex parte order for temporary custody. Specifically, the respondent argues that, because the court explicitly determined that the child was not in immediate physical danger from her surroundings, the court thereby was precluded from ordering that the child be placed in the temporary custody of Denise R.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Connecticut law is clear that, in the context of a hearing for an order of temporary custody pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (b), a finding of immediate physical danger is a prerequisite to the court\u2019s entry of a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>order vesting custody of a child in one other than the child\u2019s parents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 290-91, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). As our Supreme Court has explained, \u00a7 46b-129 (b) limits the utilization of a \u201ctemporary custody order to those situations in which the child or youth\u2019s condition or the circumstances surrounding [her] care require that [her] custody be immediately assumed to safeguard [her] welfare.\u201d Id., 288. This is because \u201c[petitions for neglect and for temporary custody orders . . . are particularly vulnerable to the risk that judges . . . will be tempted, consciously or unconsciously, to compare unfavorably the material advantages of the child\u2019s natural parents with those of prospective adoptive parents [or foster parents].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 292. Therefore, where there is no \u201csubstantial showing . . . made at the temporary custody hearing that ... [a child] . . . would be in immediate physical danger if [he or she] were returned to the [respondent\u2019s] home . . . [i]t [is] error for the court to grant . . . temporary custody\u201d in one other than the child\u2019s parents. Id., 289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In the present case, not only was there no \u201csubstantial showing\u201d of immediate physical danger, but the court explicitly determined that the child was <em>not </em>in immediate physical danger as otherwise required under \u00a7 46b-129 (b). Despite this determination, the court ordered that the child remain in the temporary custody of Denise R. until \u201can appropriate court determines that she should be placed safely elsewhere.\u201d Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>supra, 189 Conn. 276, unequivocally demonstrates that this ruling was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to set aside the order of temporary custody and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-14\"> The mother of the child involved in this appeal also was a respondent in the underlying proceedings. Because she is not a party to this appeal, we refer to the respondent father as the respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf it appears . . . that there is reasonable cause to believe that ... [a] child ... is in immediate physical danger from the child\u2019s . . . surroundings, and . . . that as a result of said conditions, the child\u2019s . . . safety is endangered and immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s . . . safety, the court shall . . . issue an order ex parte vesting in some suitable . . . person the child\u2019s . . . temporary care and custody. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> We note that \u00a7 46b-129 (b) also provides for the entry of an order of temporary custody when there is reasonable cause to believe that a child is \u201csuffering from serous physical illness or serious physical injury . . . .\u201d For purposes of this appeal, however, we consider only \u201cimmediate physical danger\u201d as the basis for an order of temporary custody, as this was the sole basis for the commissioner\u2019s motion pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
