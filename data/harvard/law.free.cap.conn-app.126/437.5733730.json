Farah, appeals from the judgments of conviction, following a jury trial, of two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) and seven counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). On appeal, the defendant claims that the court violated his constitutional rights to due process, confrontation and to present a defense, as well as his rights pursuant to (1) General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 17a-28 <em>(l), </em>when it would not order the state\u2019s attorney to examine department of children and families (department) records pertaining to the minor victims of the defendant\u2019s sexual assaults for exculpatory information, and (2) General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f, referred to as the rape shield statute, when it prohibited him from eliciting testimony from the victims pertaining to their exposure to sexual activity with individuals other than the defendant. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant was bom in Ecuador on April 4, 1961, and moved to the Hartford area in 1989. Between 1999 and 2001, the defendant resided in Manchester, and then in Hartford before moving to New Britain in July, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Sometime in 1999 or 2000, D,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who was then fourteen years old, was walking on a street in Hartford when the defendant, who was sitting in his parked car, asked her if she \u201cwanted to hang out and stuff like that.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>defendant then gave D his cell phone number so they could arrange to meet again later.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">D called the defendant\u2019s cell phone number several times. In response, the defendant picked up D from a location near her home and took her to one of his former residences in Hartford or Manchester. The defendant paid D approximately $20 to $25 to engage in oral sex with him during these visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">On one occasion, the defendant went looking for D at her home, but she was not there. Instead, the defendant encountered D\u2019s older sister, S. This was the first time that the defendant had met S. The defendant and S, who was then fifteen years old, developed a relationship that was similar to his relationship with D. The defendant took S to one of his former or current residences in Hartford, Manchester or New Britain and paid her money to engage in sexual intercourse. During some of those encounters, the defendant also provided S with alcohol.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">S and D later introduced the defendant to a mutual friend, M. When M was fourteen years old, the defendant convinced her to come to his residence in Hartford by telling her that he was going to get her drunk. The defendant provided M with drugs and alcohol and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Afterward, the defendant gave her approximately $20. The defendant engaged in this conduct with M a couple of more times in both Hartford and Manchester.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The police became aware of the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victims during an unrelated investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of alleged sexual assaults involving the victims. Those assaults were perpetrated by Ismael and Paula and were captured on video and made available on the Internet. During this investigation, M\u2019s sister, R, notified the police that the defendant called M on the telephone and that he came to M\u2019s house to pick her up in his car. R was able to identify the defendant because her boyfriend had recognized him as a counselor from a detoxification clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In connection with his conduct with the victims, the defendant was charged in two separate criminal files with eight counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), two counts of risk of injury of a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). These files were joined for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">On August 23, 2007, the defendant filed a motion for disclosure, production and inspection, requesting that the court order the state to produce all exculpatory information or material that may be favorable to him. On October 1,2007, the court addressed the defendant\u2019s motion and, at this hearing, defense counsel specifically indicated that she was interested in department reports. The court, however, did not issue an order concerning the defendant\u2019s motion at that time. Also on October 1, 2007, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude application of \u00a7 54-86f to the risk of injury charges, thereby permitting him to present evidence of the victims\u2019 sexual histories.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>On October 11, 2007, the defendant filed a second motion for disclosure, production and inspection in which he requested the court to order the state to comply with his August 23, 2007 motion. In support of his request, the defendant noted that it was his understanding that the department had reports and notes that contained or might contain exculpatory information. The defendant also requested that, at a minimum, such potentially exculpatory material should be submitted to the court for an in camera review.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The court held a hearing on the same day to consider all outstanding motions, including the defendant\u2019s second motion for disclosure, production and inspection and motion in limine. With respect to the motion for disclosure, production and inspection, the court, relying on <em>State v. Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166,471 A.2d 949 (1984),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and without objection, stated that the department records could only be reviewed if the defense made a preliminary showing that they should be disclosed and then the witness to whom the records applied authorized disclosure. If the witness did not give authorization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>then, the court noted, the witness\u2019 testimony would be stricken from the record. The state indicated during this hearing that it was unaware of any department records in reference to the defendant\u2019s case and that it had spoken to a department worker who stated that there had been no disclosures from the victims in the defendant\u2019s case. The court then denied the defendant\u2019s motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The court also denied, without prejudice, the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 644 A.2d 887 (1994), the court concluded that it could not grant \u201ca categorical [m]otion in limine.\u201d It stated, however, that if, during trial, the defendant made an offer of proof that met one or more of the four exceptions listed in \u00a7 54-86f, the court would revisit the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The evidentiary portion of the defendant\u2019s trial began on October 15, 2007. Before the jury entered the courtroom, defense counsel indicated that she had subpoenaed the department records relating to Paula. The court responded that it intended, absent some agreement by counsel to the contrary, to follow <em>Espos-ito, </em>and that the defendant still needed to make a preliminary showing to warrant any in camera review of the confidential material.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During trial, however, Paula was not called as a witness, and the victims were not questioned, either by the state or the defense, about any information that they gave to the department concerning the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>After commencement of the evidence portion of the trial, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, defense counsel also sought permission to question D concerning her prior sexual conduct and sexual conduct contemporaneous with the period in which she alleged she had engaged in sexual activity with the defendant. Specifically, counsel argued that pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f (2) and (4), the defense should be permitted to pierce the rape shield statute because D was unclear and hesitant in her identification of the defendant and may have been confusing him with a different sexual partner. The court sustained the state\u2019s objection to this line of questioning, concluding that there was no possibility of confusion, the evidence proffered was not relevant or material and that evidence of D\u2019s sexual history did not constitute a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">On October 18, 2007, the jury returned verdicts of guilty to seven counts of sexual assault in the second degree and two counts of risk of injury to a child. On January 4, 2008, the defendant was sentenced on both dockets to fifty years imprisonment, execution suspended after serving thirty years, followed by thirty-five years of probation. The defendant appealed from the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the proper standard of review. The defendant claims that the record demonstrates that the court violated his constitutional and statutory rights. While confrontation issues provide a backstop, we note that his claims challenge the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. \u201cPutting a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim will no more change its essential character than calling a bull a cow will change its gender.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u201c[0]ur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. ... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>118 Conn. App. 763, 786, 986 A.2d 1058, cert. denied, 295 Conn. 908, 989 A.2d 604 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The defendant first claims that the court violated his constitutional rights to due process, confrontation and to present a defense, as well as his rights pursuant to \u00a7 17a-28 (0,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> when it would not order the state to examine department records pertaining to the victims for exculpatory information. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We repeat that \u201c[i]t is well established that a defendant has the right to confront witnesses against him as guaranteed by the confrontation clauses of both our federal and state constitutions. . . . [T]he right of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the [s]tate\u2019s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>process. . . . We are mindful, however, that the right to confront and to cross-examine is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 174-75, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">One such circumstance in which the constitutional right to confrontation will give way to other legitimate interests occurs when confidential department records are involved. General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 17a-28 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201crecords maintained by the department shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed. Such records of any person may only be disclosed, in whole or in part, to any individual, agency, coiporation or organization with the consent of the person or as provided in this section . . . .\u201d Our courts have recognized that the primary purpose of this statute is \u201cto preserve the confidentiality of information in connection with the department\u2019s child protection activities or activities related to a child while in the care or custody of the department.\u201d <em>Abreu </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>120 Conn. App. 390,411, 992 A.2d 331, cert. denied, 297 Conn. 926, 998 A.2d 1193 (2010). The statute also protects children from \u201cthe embarrassment, stigmatization and emotional harm that can result from the mere disclosure that he or she is under the department\u2019s care.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Section 17a-28 and our case law, however, establish certain circumstances in which department records may be disclosed without the consent of the individual to whom they apply. Specifically, to obtain an in camera review of confidential department records believed to contain exculpatory information, \u201cthe defendant must at least make some plausible statement of how the information would be both material and favorable to his defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leduc, </em>40 Conn. App. 233, 248, 670 A.2d 1309 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Berube, </em>256 Conn. 742, 756, 775 A.2d 966 (2001) (\u201c[although we agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>due process requires that a defendant be entitled to an in camera review of confidential department files in some instances, we conclude that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant in this case met the requisite threshold that would require a court to undertake such a review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">A threshold showing is required notwithstanding a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Leduc, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 244-50; and confrontation rights; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>113 Conn. App. 142,159, 965 A.2d 586, cert. denied, 291 Conn. 912, 969 A.2d 176 (2009). While our cases have not addressed whether a preliminary showing is required for claims based on a right to present a defense, we note that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to present a defense is rooted in the compulsory process and confrontation clauses of the sixth amendment\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>297 Conn. 621, 625 n.2, 1 A.3d 1051 (2010); and apply the same requirements applicable to a claim based on rights pursuant to the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Although advance notice of the need to make a preliminary showing is not required, the court, nonetheless, notified the defendant on two separate occasions that it would not review any department records absent a preliminary showing that the records contained exculpatory information.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defense counsel also acknowledged the proper procedures for disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>department records and that she was fully aware of the steps that needed to be taken before the court could conduct an in camera review. Still, there is nothing in the record to suggest that a threshold showing was made. Speculation that records might contain exculpatory information does not suffice. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by failing to review the department records subpoenaed by the defendant or ordering the state\u2019s attorney to review the records because the defendant did not make a preliminary showing that they contained exculpatory information.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The defendant argues, however, that the court applied the wrong procedure for determining whether confidential records may be disclosed or undergo an in camera review. Specifically, he argues that the procedures articulated in <em>Esposito </em>are not applicable to disclosure of department records. Instead, the defendant claims that \u00a7 17a-28 (Q mandates that the state both read the relevant department files and disclose any exculpatory material that they contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">At trial, the defendant did not object to the court\u2019s use of the procedures articulated in <em>Esposito </em>for disclosure of confidential records, nor did he raise any claims pursuant to his rights under \u00a7 17a-28 (Q.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part that this court \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . .\u201d Additionally, this court previously has stated that it \u201cwill not consider issues which are brought to the court\u2019s attention for the first time by way of the appellant\u2019s brief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>CMB Capital </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Appreciation, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>124 Conn. App. 379, 396, 4 A.3d 1256 (2010). We conclude, therefore, that the defendant failed to preserve this claim for appeal properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The defendant argues, alternatively, that if this issue has not been preserved, his claim is adequate for review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. The defendant\u2019s claim, however, does not meet the requirements for <em>Golding </em>or plain error review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore decline to address it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The defendant next argues that the court violated his constitutional rights to due process, confrontation and to present a defense, as well as his rights pursuant to \u00a7 54-861', when it prohibited him from presenting evidence concerning the victims\u2019 sexual histories.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>not persuaded and conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting the defendant from questioning the victims about their sexual histories.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Section 54-86f \u201cwas enacted to bar or limit the use of prior sexual conduct of an alleged victim of sexual assault because it is such highly prejudicial material. . . . Our legislature has determined that, except in specific instances, and taking the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights into account, evidence of prior sexual conduct is to be excluded for policy purposes. Some of these policies include protecting the victim\u2019s sexual privacy and shielding her from undue [harassment], encouraging reports of sexual assault, and enabling the victim to testify in court with less fear of embarrassment. . . . Other policies promoted by the law include avoiding prejudice to the victim, jury confusion and waste of time on collateral matters.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clifford P., </em>124 Conn. App. 176,182-83,3 A.3d 1052, cert. denied, 299 Conn. 911, 10 A.3d 529 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The rape shield statute \u201cdirects the court to examine the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, implicating both his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses and his fourteenth amendment due process right to call witnesses on his own behalf.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Malon, </em>96 Conn. App. 59, 74, 898 A.2d 843, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 906, 907 A.2d 93 (2006). As with laws and policies surrounding the disclosure of confidential department records, the right to confront and to cross-examine victims of sexual assault about their sexual histories is not absolute and may bow to accommodate other legitimate interests. Id. \u201cOne of the legitimate interests is the court\u2019s right, indeed, duty, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>exclude irr elevant evidence. ... If the court determines that the proffered evidence is not relevant, the defendant\u2019s right to present witnesses in his own behalf has not been affected and the evidence can properly be excluded.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Finally, \u201c[a] defendant who seeks to introduce evidence under one of the exceptions of \u00a7 54-86f must first make an offer of proof.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Martinez, 295 Conn. 758, 771, 991 A.2d 1086 (2010). \u201cA clear statement of the defendant\u2019s theory of relevance is all important in determining whether the evidence is offered for a permissible purpose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecil J., </em>291 Conn. 813, 825, 970 A.2d 710 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In his attempt to introduce evidence concerning the victims\u2019 sexual histories, the defendant made no offers of proof in regard to M and S but did make such an offer as to D.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, the court properly prohibited any inquiries concerning M\u2019s and S\u2019s sexual histories.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Our determination of whether the court properly prohibited the defendant from questioning D about her sexual history is guided by <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Conn. 43. In <em>Kulmac, </em>the defendant had sexually abused two girls when they were nine and eleven years old. Id., 49-50. At the time of trial, the girls were fourteen and fifteen years old. Id., 49. The defendant claimed that the court violated his rights pursuant to the confrontation clause by excluding evidence, based on the rape shield statute, that other men had sexually abused the two girls. Id., 50. Specifically, the defendant claimed that this evidence was necessary because the high number of assaults committed on the girls by other men created a risk of confusion. Id., 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On appeal, our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[w]hether there is a sufficient basis for a claim that a witness is confused, so as to permit cross-examination that would otherwise be inadmissible, is a question of fact that is properly left to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Id. The court noted that the trial court specifically concluded that the victims were not confused and affirmed the court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence of their sexual histories.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">As in <em>Kulmac, </em>the court here specifically found that D did not appear confused. Moreover, the court found that any sexual activity that D had with other men would not constitute a defense for the defendant. Therefore, we conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion by precluding inquiry into D\u2019s prior sexual history.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse and the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victims or others through whom the victims\u2019 identities may be ascertained.

If, for example, one of the actual complaining witnesses, with respect to that witness if the preliminary showing is made, the court may well conclude that the <em>Esposito </em>procedure should be implemented with respect, you know, to that particular witness. . . . So, I mean, you\u2019d still have to make the preliminary showing with respect to that particular witness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 17a-28 \u00a9 provides in relevant part: \u201cInformation disclosed from a person\u2019s [department of children and families] record shall not be disclosed further without the written consent of the person, except if disclosed to a party or his counsel pursuant to an order of a comt in which a criminal prosecution or an abuse, neglect, commitment or termination proceeding against the party is pending. A state\u2019s attorney shall disclose to the defendant or his counsel in a criminal prosecution, without the necessity of a court order, exculpatory information and material contained in such record and may disclose, without a court order, information and material contained in such record which could be the subject of a disclosure order. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Additionally, we note that \u201c[t]he sixth amendment to the United States constitution require [s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. . . .

Additionally, \u201c[t]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility.

In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . .

D testified on direct examination that she stopped seeing the defendant when she became pregnant. D later clarified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>on cross-examination she was not claiming that the defendant was the father of her child, but the proverbial door concerning D\u2019s sexual history had been opened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\"> The defendant relied on a police witness statement made by D as his offer of proof.
