The principal issue is whether the court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider claims concerning the validity of his plea. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In the wake of multiple physical injuries to the defendant\u2019s infant son over the course of several months, the state, on February 2, 2009, filed a substitute information accusing the defendant of two counts of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). Pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant, on February 4, 2009, pleaded guilty to two counts of risk of injury to a child under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, the court canvassed the defendant concerning his plea and, following the canvass, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>accepted the plea as \u201cknowingly and intelligently entered with the assistance of competent counsel with full understanding of the nature and elements of the crimes charged and the possible penalties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">A sentencing hearing followed on April 30, 2009. The state recommended a sentence of twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after ten years, with five years probation. Both the defendant and his counsel spoke as to why a lesser sentence was warranted. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court imposed a sentence of twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after eight and one-half years, with five years probation, which was less than that urged by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On May 21, 2009, the defendant, acting pro se, filed what he termed a \u201cmotion and request for [a] reversal of plea agreement and advisement of judicial notice,\u201d in which he sought to vacate his plea. The court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the claims set forth therein that attacked the validity of the defendant\u2019s plea. The court denied on its merits the defendant\u2019s claim that the imposition of probation violated the plea agreement, interpreting this claim as a motion to correct an illegal sentence. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently filed a \u201cmotion requesting court to consider additional argument and facts in support of June 11, 2009 hearing requesting reversal of plea and judicial notice,\u201d which the court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">We first consider the issue of whether the court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his plea. Our review thereof is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeVivo, </em>106 Conn. App. 641, 644, 942 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>A.2d 1066 (2008). It is well established that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant\u2019s sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take any action affecting a defendant\u2019s sentence unless it expressly has been authorized to act.\u201d <em>Cobham v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 30, 37, 779 A.2d 80 (2001). Likewise, Practice Book \u00a7 39-26 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] defendant may not withdraw his or her plea after the conclusion of the proceeding at which the sentence was imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Because the defendant first moved to vacate his plea weeks after his sentence began, the court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider any claims regarding the validity of the plea. As our Supreme Court recently reiterated, \u201conce a defendant\u2019s sentence is executed, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to entertain any claims regarding the validity of that plea in the absence of a statute or rule of practice to the contrary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Das, </em>291 Conn. 356, 368, 968 A.2d 367 (2009). Thus, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s claims concerning the sufficiency of the factual basis for his plea and the alleged ineffective assistance of his counsel. See also <em>State v. Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517,541-42, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining claims merit little discussion. He claims that the state at the plea hearing improperly informed the court of prior injuries suffered by the victim for which the defendant was not charged, the defendant\u2019s criminal record and the results of his polygraph examination. The defendant did not object to those statements during the plea hearing or otherwise preserve such claims for appellate review. He further has not affirmatively requested review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We thus do not consider those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>We also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the imposition of consecutive sentences was unlawful. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37 authorizes a sentencing court to impose consecutive sentences on a criminal defendant. In addition, \u201ccourts have . . . discretion to impose \u2018concurrent\u2019 terms, or issue a stay or \u2018consecutive\u2019 terms, as an incident to their judicial function.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leak, </em>297 Conn. 524, 537-38, 998 A.2d 1182 (2010). On appeal, the defendant has provided no analysis or authority to the contrary. Accordingly, his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). Under that doctrine, \u201ca criminal defendant is not required to admit his guilt, but consents to being punished <em>as if he were guilty </em>to avoid the risk of proceeding to trial. ... A guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine is a judicial oxymoron in that the defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea nevertheless.\u201d (Emphasis in original; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174,204-205, 842 A.2d 567 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> Although the defendant represents that the court heard argument on his motion on June 11, 2009, the record before us is bereft of any evidence or transcript of that proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
