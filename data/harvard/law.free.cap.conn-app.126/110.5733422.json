On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>appeal, he claims that the court improperly concluded that he had not been denied effective assistance of counsel when his habeas counsel failed: (1) to raise claims of ineffective assistance of his trial and appellate counsel, (2) to raise a claim that the prosecution did not disclose exculpatory evidence, (3) to investigate potentially exculpatory information and (4) to raise a claim that the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial constituted a violation of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The relevant facts and procedural history surrounding the petitioner\u2019s conviction were set forth by this court in our decision affirming the denial of his first petition for habeas relief. See <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>101 Conn. App. 133, 134-35, 921 A.2d 128, cert. denied, 283 Conn. 905, 927 A.2d 916 (2007). \u201cShortly before 7:30 p.m. on October 27, 1997, George David Wright drove a stolen Jeep Cherokee to the Quinnipiac Terrace housing complex in New Haven, also known as the Island. The victim, Daryl Price, was in the passenger seat of the Jeep, and Calvin Taylor was seated in the back. At the housing complex, Wright and Taylor exited the vehicle, and Tacuma Grear approached the Jeep to talk to the victim. They talked about the [fatal shooting] of Grear\u2019s brother, Corey Grear [by the victim], which had occurred approximately one week earlier, for which the victim . . . apologized. Corey Grear was a friend of the [petitioner], and the [petitioner] had held [Corey Grear] in his arms after [Corey] Grear was fatally shot by the victim. The [petitioner] had witnessed the victim shoot Corey Grear. Corey Grear was also a member, as was the [petitioner], of the Island Brothers, a street gang into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>which the victim had been introduced and sponsored by the [petitioner]. As his sponsor, the [petitioner] was responsible for disciplining the victim should the victim kill a fellow gang member. As Tacuma Grear walked away from the Jeep, the [petitioner] had come up to the driver\u2019s side of the Jeep carrying a handgun. He then leaned into the Jeep and fired four times into the vehicle. Two .45 caliber bullets hit the victim, killing him, and two other bullets were found in the Jeep. . . . After a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 134-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">After his conviction, the petitioner filed a direct appeal with this court, and we affirmed the conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>83 Conn. App. 615, 852 A.2d 762, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 910, 859 A.2d 571 (2004). At all times during his direct appeal, the petitioner was represented by attorney Adele V. Patterson. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cFollowing his unsuccessful appeal, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, Leo Ahem, who had represented the petitioner throughout his first criminal trial, which resulted in a mistrial, and then again in his second trial.\u201d <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 101 Conn. App. 135. In the first habeas trial, the petitioner claimed that Ahem rendered ineffective assistance by fading to object to the admission of the transcript testimony of Travis Jenkins, which was elicited during the petitioner\u2019s first criminal trial and that he failed to investigate or to obtain evidence prior to the start of the second criminal trial. See id., 134, 138. The petitioner argued that Jenkins\u2019 testimony was inadmissible because he was unavailable for cross-examination at the second criminal trial. See id., 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>At the conclusion of his first habeas trial, the court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and this court affirmed that judgment. Id., 144. In that appeal, we concluded that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate that \u201cthere [was] a reasonable probability that, but for the admission of the Jenkins transcript, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See id., 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On June 21, 2007, the petitioner filed a third amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming, on this occasion, that his first habeas counsel, attorney Genevieve Salvatore, rendered ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, he claimed, inter alia, that Salvatore rendered ineffective assistance by failing: (1) to raise various claims of ineffective assistance of the petitioner\u2019s trial and appellate counsel, (2) to investigate potentially exculpatory information, (3) to raise a claim that the prosecution did not disclose exculpatory evidence and (4) to raise a claim that the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial violated double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In that habeas trial, which is the subject of this appeal, the court, <em>A. Santos, J., </em>heard testimony from the petitioner, Salvatore and Detective Richard Pelletier of the New Haven police department. In particular, Salvatore was questioned extensively regarding her representation of the petitioner during his first habeas trial. On January 26, 2009, the court, by way of a twenty page memorandum of decision, denied the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In reviewing claims that are based on ineffective assistance of counsel, we begin by setting forth the familiar and well settled standard of review articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687,104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). \u201cIn <em>Strickland, </em>which applies to claims of ineffective assistance during criminal proceedings generally, the United States Supreme Court determined that the claim must be supported by evidence establishing that (1) counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, <em>and </em>(2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense because there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had it not been for the deficient performance.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>285 Conn. 556, 575, 941 A.2d 248 (2008). \u201cThe first prong is satisfied by proving that counsel made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the sixth amendment. The second prong is satisfied if it is demonstrated that there exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>49 Conn. App. 52, 53, 712 A.2d 978, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 916, 722 A.2d 807 (1998), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>525 U.S. 1161, 119 S. Ct. 1073, 143 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u201c \u2018[When] applied to a claim of ineffective assistance of prior habeas counsel, the <em>Strickland </em>standard requires the petitioner to demonstrate that his prior habeas counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective and that this ineffectiveness prejudiced the petitioner\u2019s prior habeas proceeding. . . . [T]he petitioner will have to prove that one or both of the prior habeas counsel, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>presenting his claims, was ineffective and that <em>effective </em>representation by habeas counsel establishes a reasonable probability that the habeas court would have found that he was entitled to reversal of the conviction and a new trial . . . .\u2019 <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>108 Conn. App. 201, 209-10, 947 A.2d 435, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 911, 953 A.2d 652 (2008). Therefore, as explained by our Supreme Court in <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 834, 613 A.2d 818 (1992), a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of habeas counsel on the basis of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must essentially <em>satisfy Strickland </em>twice: he must \u2018prove both (1) that his appointed habeas counsel was ineffective, <em>and </em>(2) that his trial counsel was ineffective.\u2019 ... Id., 842; see also <em>Denby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>66 Conn. App. 809, 812-13, 786 A.2d 442 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 908, 789 A.2d 994 (2002).\u201d (Emphasis altered.) <em>Lapointe </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>113 Conn. App. 378, 394-95, 966 A.2d 780 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u201cBecause both prongs [of <em>Strickland] </em>must be established for a habeas petitioner to prevail, a court <em>may </em>dismiss a petitioner\u2019s claim if he fails to meet either prong. . . . Accordingly, a court need not determine the deficiency of counsel\u2019s performance if consideration of the prejudice prong will be dispositive of the ineffectiveness claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>100 Conn. App. 1,11-12, 916 A.2d 864, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 908, 920 A.2d 1017 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We will now address each of the petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance individually, cognizant that his claims regarding previous habeas counsel will not succeed if the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel lack merit. See <em>Lapointe </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 113 Conn. App. 395. On appeal, the petitioner asserts, inter alia, that the court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>concluded that attorney Salvatore did not render ineffective assistance. Under this rubric, the petitioner raises eight issues. We will address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Under the first set of issues put forth by the petitioner, he claims that Salvatore rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The petitioner\u2019s first argument within this set of issues asserts that Ahem provided ineffective assistance for failing to object to the out-of-court photographic identification of the petitioner offered through the testimony of Detective William Piascyk of the New Haven police department. Specifically, the petitioner argues that because the identifying witness, Jenkins, was unavailable for cross-examination at the second criminal trial, any extrajudicial identification of the petitioner provided by him is prohibited by our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>216 Conn. 492, 582 A.2d 751 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claim. During the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial, Jenkins was unavailable to testify. Thereafter, the court admitted into evidence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>transcript of Jenkins\u2019 testimony from the petitioner\u2019s first criminal trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 101 Conn. App. 138. The transcript of Jenkins\u2019 direct and cross-examination from the petitioner\u2019s first criminal trial provided a version of the events different from what he originally had told Piascyk during their initial interview. During that interview, Jenkins identified the petitioner from a photographic array and told police that he had witnessed the petitioner shoot the victim. See id., 139. At the petitioner\u2019s first criminal trial, however, he recanted these statements and gave equivocal testimony with respect to his identification of the petitioner from the photographic array.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See id., 139-40. After the transcript was admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>into evidence, the prosecution called Piascyk to the witness stand. Piascyk testified that prior to Jenkins\u2019 giving his written statement identifying the petitioner as the person who had shot the victim, Jenkins was shown a photographic array from which he also identified the petitioner. The petitioner now argues that Ahern\u2019s failure to object to this testimony resulted in ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the court found that neither Ahem nor Salvatore provided ineffective assistance by not challenging Piascyk\u2019s testimony, which included Jenkins\u2019 extrajudicial identification of the petitioner from the photographic array, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 492. The court also found that \u201ceven if deficient performance were to be presumed, the petitioner [could not] establish prejudice\u201d because the identification of him by Jenkins was already admitted into evidence prior to Piascyk\u2019s testimony regarding the photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">We agree with the habeas court that the petitioner failed to establish prejudice under Strickland,.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>court correctly concluded, Jenkins\u2019 testimony identifying the petitioner from the photographic array had already been admitted into evidence through the transcript. Consequently, Piascyk\u2019s testimony appears duplicative of evidence that had already been presented to the jury, namely, that Jenkins identified the petitioner from a photographic array. This testimony merely served to supplement the transcript testimony and did not prejudice the petitioner. See <em>Jeffrey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>36 Conn. App. 216, 223, 650 A.2d 602 (1994) (no prejudice to petitioner when jury presented with evidence that was substantially same); <em>Schnabelv. Tyler, </em>32 Conn. App. 704, 712, 630 A.2d 1361 (1993) (\u201c[ejvidence that \u2018was simply cumulative and supplementary\u2019 to the other evidence admitted during the course of the trial is unlikely to have an effect on the jury\u201d), aff'd, 230 Conn. 735, 646 A.2d 152 (1994); cf. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Mill Management Co. of Greenwich, Inc., </em>124 Conn. App. 415,424,4 A.3d 1268 (2010) (reversal not required when improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosedom, </em>34 Conn. App. 141, 147, 640 A.2d 634 (1994) (virtually identical evidence unlikely to have prejudicial effect on jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Moreover, Piascyk\u2019s testimony was far from the only evidence linking the petitioner to the murder. The state also introduced other significant evidence that was probative of the petitioner\u2019s guilt. See <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 101 Conn. App. 140 (admission of Jenkins transcript nonprejudicial in light of other probative evidence presented by state). Based on the foregoing, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that, but for Piascyk\u2019s testimony, the result of the trial would have been different. Accordingly, the petitioner has failed to satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 694-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The petitioner next argues that Salvatore rendered ineffective assistance by failing to claim that Ahern\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to object to the admission into evidence of a tape-recorded statement by Tacuma Grear. Specifically, the petitioner claims that Tacuma Grear\u2019s 1998 tape-recorded statement to police was unreliable in light of his previous inconsistent statements at the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing and, thus, was inadmissible under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753-54, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claim. During the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing on December 23, 1997, Tacuma Grear testified that he was at the crime scene, and, although he heard gunshots and witnessed a person near the driver\u2019s side of the Jeep, he could not identify that person. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 620. On June 18, 1998, Tacuma Grear provided police with a tape-recorded statement, and this time he indicated that he had witnessed the petitioner at the crime scene leaning into the driver\u2019s side window of the vehicle and then simultaneously saw flashes coming from the petitioner\u2019s arm, heard gunshots and then saw the victim slumped in the seat of the vehicle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At trial, a partial transcript of the 1998 tape-recorded statement was admitted as a prior inconsistent statement, and Tacuma Grear was cross-examined regarding its contents. The petitioner now claims that because Tacuma Grear had a motive for killing the victim and was fearful that he would be charged with the murder, the 1998 statement was rendered unreliable. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The habeas court found that the tape-recorded statement of Tacuma Grear fell under the exception to the hearsay rule for prior inconsistent statements articulated in <em>Whelan. </em>See footnote 10 of this opinion. Accordingly, the court concluded that Salvatore did not render ineffective assistance for not raising this claim as a result of there being little basis for an objection from Ahern.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>After a careful review of the record, we agree with the court and conclude that Tacuma Grear\u2019s 1998 tape-recorded statement satisfied all of the <em>Whelan </em>criteria and, thus, was sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>118 Conn. App. 763, 783, 986 A.2d 1058 (statement that satisfies <em>Whelan </em>requirements is presumptively admissible absent strong showing that it is unreliable), cert. denied, 295 Conn. 908, 989 A.2d 604 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The petitioner argues that because Tacuma Grear\u2019s statement contradicted his previous testimony at the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing, both Ahem and Salvatore rendered ineffective assistance when they failed to challenge the testimony as being unreliable under <em>Whelan. </em>We find this argument to be unavailing. Inconsistent statements are precisely the type of substantive evidence that is allowed under the rule of <em>Whelan. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 752. The fact that a statement, submitted under <em>Whelan, </em>may or may not be truthful does not diminish its reliability. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 307, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000) (once statement satisfies <em>Whelan </em>requirements, \u201cits credibility is grist for the cross-examination mill\u201d). Because Tacuma Grear\u2019s statement satisfied the conditions precedent set forth in <em>Whelan, </em>we cannot conclude that counsels\u2019 failure to object to the statement or to raise the issue on habeas appeal constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Additionally, we are not persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s assertion that Tacuma Grear\u2019s statement was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>under circumstances so unduly coercive or extreme as to render it unreliable. See id., 306. The petitioner argues that because Tacuma Grear testified that police threatened him with arrest if he did not implicate the petitioner, his statement was unreliable. Detective Frank Roberts of the New Haven police department, however, testified that during the interview with Tacuma Grear the tape recorder was never turned off and then on; Tacuma Grear was not told to implicate the petitioner in any way; Tacuma Grear was not threatened in any way; nor did Tacuma Grear appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Therefore, we agree with the court that this was hardly the unusual case in which a statement satisfies the requirements of <em>Whelan, </em>yet must be kept from the jury because it was deemed unduly coercive or extreme. See id., 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Based on the foregoing we cannot conclude that counsels\u2019 performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d for failure to raise this claim. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 668. Accordingly, the petitioner\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>See id., 687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The petitioner next argues that the court improperly concluded that his appellate counsel, Patterson, did not render ineffective assistance by failing to brief a claim of prosecutorial impropriety adequately. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on his <em>post-Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silence during closing arguments in violation of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The following additional facts aid our discussion. On November 3, 1997, the petitioner voluntarily went to the New Haven police station to speak with Piascyk. Although the petitioner was not in custody, Piascyk read the petitioner his <em>Miranda </em>rights because he was the primary suspect in the murder investigation. After receiving those rights, the petitioner signed a form voluntarily waiving his right to remain silent and proceeded to answer the majority of Piascyk\u2019s questions. Thereafter, the petitioner informed Piascyk that he had several alibi witnesses who would attest to his innocence; however, when asked by Piascyk to identify the names of those alleged witnesses, he refused. Subsequently, at the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial, the prosecutor argued during his closing remarks: \u201cRemember, on November 3, 1997, [the petitioner] wouldn\u2019t even tell the police who his alibi witness[es] were [or] who was there . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On direct appeal, we declined to review this issue because we concluded that the petitioner had failed to brief the claim adequately. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 660. Although the petitioner continues to claim that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were an improper comment on his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, the claim is now advanced under the auspices of an ineffective assistance claim against Salvatore.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The habeas court concluded that the petitioner could not succeed on this claim because there was clearly no <em>Doyle </em>violation, and, consequently, the petitioner failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to demonstrate prejudice under the second prong of Strickland.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u201cIt is axiomatic . . . that <em>Doyle </em>is not applicable when a defendant has waived his right to remain silent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>123 Conn. App. 355, 365, 1 A.3d 1216, cert. denied, 298 Conn. 931, 5 A.3d 491 (2010). \u201cWhile a defendant may invoke his right to remain silent at any time, even after he has initially waived his right to remain silent, it does not necessarily follow that he may remain \u2018selectively\u2019 silent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985). Furthermore, \u201c[a] <em>Doyle </em>violation may, in a particular case, be so insignificant that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible question or comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence following a <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>231 Conn. 195, 212, 647 A.2d 342 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1099, 115 S. Ct. 770, 130 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1995). \u201cThe cases wherein the error has been found to be prejudicial disclose repetitive references to the defendant\u2019s silence, reemphasis of the fact on closing argument, and extensive, strongly-worded argument suggesting a connection between the defendant\u2019s silence and his guilt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Ct. 1194,10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the petitioner argues that Tacuma Grear\u2019s testimony from <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CR-97-0446889-T (January 8, 1999), provided exculpatory evidence that would have impacted the decision in the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial, and, thus, the state was required to disclose this evidence pursuant to <em>Brady. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The following additional facts aid our discussion. During the same period of time that the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial was under way, Tacuma Grear also testified at the <em>Talton </em>trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> His testimony in <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>identified \u201cSlim Goodie\u201d as Shawn Bethea, although at the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial, Tacuma Grear identified the petitioner as \u201cSlim Goodie.\u201d The habeas court resolved this discrepancy by noting that during his second habeas trial the petitioner explained that the surname \u201cBethea\u201d comes from his mother\u2019s side of the family and that he is, in fact, known on the street as \u201cGoodie\u201d or \u201cSlim Goodie.\u201d The court also noted that Tacuma Grear\u2019s taped statement to the police also identified the petitioner as Goody. Although Salvatore could not recall reviewing the <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>transcript specifically, she testified that it was her understanding that the petitioner had several street names and that raising a claim premised on the misidentification of these names was without merit because \u201cShawn Bethea and Shawn Crocker and Slim Goodie [were] all the same person.\u201d The habeas court found that Tacuma Grear\u2019s testimony in <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>did not contradict his later testimony, nor did it provide exculpatory evidence for the petitioner. Consequently, the court concluded that the state was not required to disclose Tacuma Grear\u2019s testimony under Brady, and, thus, the petitioner failed to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201c \u2018Exculpatory\u2019 has been defined to mean \u2018[cjlearing or tending to clear from alleged fault or guilt; excusing.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>90 Conn.

Id., 122. In the present case, Tacuma Grear\u2019s testimony was already rife with inconsistencies. See part I B of this opinion. Moreover, his testimony from <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>appears to refer simply to the petitioner by one of his many street names. We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that adding one more inconsistency, in which Tacuma Grear confusingly refers to the petitioner by a different street name, was immaterial to the petitioner\u2019s guilt and that it did not alter Tacuma Grear\u2019s credibility to a degree that mandated disclosure under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Accordingly, we agree with the court that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation in the present case and that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>as to this claim. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 688-90, 694-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The petitioner next claims that Salvatore rendered ineffective assistance in failing to investigate potentially exculpatory information. Specifically, he argues that both Salvatore and Ahem should have explored introducing statements given by Ernest Henry. The petitioner argues that Henry\u2019s purported statements to a private investigator would have challenged the reliability of Wright\u2019s testimony identifying the petitioner as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the perpetrator of the crime.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> At the second habeas trial, Salvatore testified that she was aware of Henry\u2019s statements but made a tactical determination that they would not have been beneficial in the petitioner\u2019s habeas appeal. The habeas court agreed and found that Salvatore\u2019s decision not to make this claim was a strategic decision well within the range provided by reasonable professional assistance under <em>Strickland. </em>On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court overlooked the benefits of raising such a claim when it rendered its decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">After our careful review of the record, we agree with the habeas court and conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that Salvatore\u2019s performance was \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\u201d articulated in <em>Strickland. </em>See id., 690. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 87, 96, 608 A.2d 667 (1992), our Supreme Court construed the performance prong of <em>Strickland, </em>stating that \u201c[strategic choices made after thorough investigation of [the] law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable . . . .\u201d \u201c[T]he [petitioner] must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 689, quoting <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S. Ct. 158, 100 L. Ed. 83 (1955). It is clear from the record that Salvatore considered bringing a claim using Henry\u2019s statement but ultimately concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the risk of relying on Henry\u2019s statement outweighed its benefit because it included information that might have inculpated the petitioner. See footnote 20 of this opinion. This decision by Salvatore \u201cfalls into the category of trial strategy or judgment calls that we consistently have declined to second guess.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>89 Conn. App. 850, 868, 877 A.2d 11, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 905, 882 A.2d 672 (2005). Accordingly, the petitioner\u2019s claim fails. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 688-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The petitioner next claims that Salvatore was ineffective for failing to raise a claim that Ahern\u2019s performance was deficient by not preventing the testimony of Wright from being entered into evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, the petitioner claims that Salvatore failed to investigate adequately evidence that would have illustrated Ahern\u2019s ineffective assistance regarding the admission of this testimony. The court concluded that the petitioner had abandoned this claim because (1) it was not addressed in his posttrial brief and (2) he failed to adduce evidence in support of the claim during the habeas trial. See <em>Wooten v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>104 Conn. App. 793, 801, 936 A.2d 263 (2007) (claim deemed \u201cabandoned because the petitioner failed to present any evidence in support of his position\u201d), cert. denied, 289 Conn. 911, 957 A.2d 868 (2008). Although the petitioner now addresses the inadmissibility of Wright\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>in an ineffective assistance claim, he is, for all practical purposes, challenging the admissibility of Wright\u2019s testimony during the second criminal trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Having carefully reviewed the record, we agree with the court that the petitioner failed to adduce new evidence that would have supported his claim that Salvatore failed to investigate adequately evidence that would have ultimately rendered Wright\u2019s testimony unreliable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 650-51 (petitioner\u2019s adequate and full opportunity to cross-examine witness rendered testimony reliable). Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We turn finally to the petitioner\u2019s claim that the court improperly concluded that Salvatore did not render ineffective assistance for failing to claim that his second criminal trial violated his rights pursuant to the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. Specifically, the petitioner asserts that Ahem failed to properly frame his motion to dismiss on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at the close of the first criminal trial were a deliberate attempt to produce a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects a criminal defendant from repeated prosecutions for the same offense.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.

Although the petitioner asserts broadly that the state initiated a mistrial because it was aware that the first trial was not going well, he has failed to offer evidence that the prosecutor in the first trial <em>intended to produce a mistrial. </em>Based on the habeas court\u2019s findings and the petitioner\u2019s own dearth of evidence regarding any prosecutorial intent to produce a mistrial, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s claim is without merit. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 861 (petitioner\u2019s failure to produce evidence to support claims resulted in failure to demonstrate prejudice under Strickland).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s claim is without merit.

See Practice Book \u00a7 23-31. Relying on <em>Cobham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 30, 40, 779 A.2d 80 (2001), the court concluded that the petitioner failed to satisfy the cause and prejudice components required to cure such a.default. The court found that even if it presumed that the petitioner could show cause, he could not establish prejudice. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> Salvatore testified that she was aware of a statement that Henry had given to a private investigator in which he identified the shooter as short and stocky with no restrictions to his gait, whereas the petitioner is tall and slender and reportedly walked with a limp. Salvatore decided, however, that the remainder of Henry\u2019s statement contradicted what the petitioner had told her and, therefore, was potentially damaging to the case. Consequently, Salvatore opined that basing a claim on Henry\u2019s alleged statements was not worth the risk in order \u201cto try and elicit one jewel . . . that maybe could help you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> During the petitioner\u2019s second criminal trial, the transcript of Wright\u2019s testimony from the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing was admitted into evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 646. The trial court found that Wright was unavailable pursuant to \u00a7 8-6 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Id. On direct appeal, we concluded that, not only was the admission of Wright\u2019s testimony sufficiently reliable to satisfy the requirements for an unavailable witness, as set forth in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36,124 S. Ct. 1354,158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>supra, 646-50; moreover, the testimony did not prejudice the petitioner. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>supra, 649-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> The court also concluded that, because the claim regarding the admissibility of Wright\u2019s testimony had been addressed on direct appeal, it was precluded from considering <em>the </em>claim. See footnote 21 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> In his brief, the petitioner cursorily argues that Salvatore did not give a logical reason why this claim was not raised during his first habeas appeal. Our review of the transcript from the second habeas trial, however, reveals that Salvatore did give a tactical reason for not raising the issue and that she was aware that Wright\u2019s account of what the petitioner was wearing differed somewhat from what the petitioner claimed he was wearing on the night of the murder. In her testimony, Salvatore stated that she had advised the petitioner that, in her opinion, his testimony effectively \u201cnullified other people\u2019s testimony\u201d because there were so many conflicting versions of the events regarding the petitioner that were introduced at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> The petitioner\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial as a result of a hung jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
