Over the next few days, police learned that she and Nathaniel Jackson had plotted to kill Fingerhut. Both Roberts and Jackson were arrested, convicted of aggravated murder, and sentenced to death. This opinion addresses the appeal by defendant-appellant, Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">{\u00b6 2} As evidence at trial showed, Roberts and Fingerhut had been divorced in 1985, but were living together in the Howland Township home. Almost all of the couple\u2019s assets, including two Greyhound bus terminals in Warren and Youngstown, were in Roberts\u2019s name. Fingerhut managed the terminals. Many of those who dealt with the couple assumed that they were married, and Fingerhut referred to Roberts as his wife in many business dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">{\u00b6 3} Donna Roberts and Nathaniel Jackson met and began having an affair sometime before 2001. Their romantic relationship was interrupted during most of 2001 while Jackson was incarcerated in the Lorain Correctional Institution. At the time of Fingerhut\u2019s murder, Jackson was 29 years old, Roberts was 57, and Fingerhut was 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">{\u00b6 4} While Jackson was in prison, he and Roberts exchanged letters and spoke on the phone. Because phone calls from prisoners are routinely recorded at the Lorain Correctional Institution and kept for at least six months, there were digital recordings of 19 of their phone conversations. Many of the letters and conversations were sexually graphic, describing the couple\u2019s plans after Jackson\u2019s release. The couple used veiled terms in their letters and conversations to discuss how they would deal with Fingerhut once Jackson was out of prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Three days before Jackson was released from prison on December 9, 2001, a woman reserved a Jacuzzi suite at the Wagon Wheel Motel in Youngstown. The woman paid for the room, and she and Jackson stayed there on the night of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">{\u00b6 6} For the next few days, Roberts and Jackson were seen together at various places. On the afternoon of December 10, Frank Reynolds, an employee of the Youngstown Greyhound bus terminal, saw Roberts and Jackson talking near the terminal before Fingerhut arrived for work. Later, Reynolds overheard Roberts ask Fingerhut for $3,000, which he refused to give her. According to Reynolds, Roberts was nervous and shaky and gave Fingerhut \u201cthe dirtiest look like it can kill a person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 7} The next afternoon, December 11, the day of the murder, at approximately 4:35 p.m., bus driver Jim McCoy saw Fingerhut working alone at the Youngstown terminal. Shortly afterwards, McCoy drove his bus to the Warren bus terminal, where he saw Roberts with a black male who identified himself as \u201cNathaniel.\u201d According to McCoy, the two appeared to be in a hurry to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 8} Shortly before 6:00 p.m. that evening, a waitress at the Red Lobster restaurant in Niles began serving Roberts and Jackson. The two paid for their dinner at 6:43 p.m. and left the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 9} Fingerhut left the Youngstown bus terminal at 9:00 p.m., telling the security guard that he was going home.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 10} Near 9:30 p.m. the same evening, a neighbor of Roberts saw her driving near her home. Although no one else was on the road at the time, Roberts was driving very slowly. Meanwhile, Fingerhut left the Youngstown bus terminal at 9:00 p.m., telling the on-duty security guard, \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 11} Later that night, Roberts reserved a room for a week at the Days Inn Motel in Boardman. The room receipt indicates that she paid for the room at 11:33 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 12} Shortly after midnight, December 12, 2001, Roberts called 911 screaming that there was something wrong with her husband. The computer showed that the call came from Roberts and Fingerhut\u2019s home in Howland Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 13} These facts from the trial record are consistent with the state\u2019s theory that Roberts let Jackson into her home to wait for Fingerhut to return from work; that when Fingerhut got home, Jackson shot him and stole his car and then called Roberts\u2019s cell phone from the cell phone in Fingerhut\u2019s car; that Jackson abandoned Fingerhut\u2019s car, and Roberts picked him up and took him to Days Inn, where she reserved a room for a week; and that Roberts then went home and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Upon arriving at the scene, police found Fingerhut\u2019s bloody corpse lying face down on the kitchen floor near the door to the garage. Roberts told police to do whatever they had to do to catch the killer. She also gave police permission to search the house and her car in the garage. She asked police several times where her \u201chusband\u2019s car\u201d was, but told police later that somebody had stolen it. Roberts\u2019s emotional state fluctuated. At times she was very coherent, while at other times she was screaming, crying, and asking police why they were not doing anything. Eventually, police arranged for Roberts\u2019s brother to come and get her while police continued to process the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 15} The deputy coroner for Trumbull County, Dr. Humphrey Germaniuk, observed the victim at the crime scene and later performed an autopsy. Finger-hut had sustained lacerations and abrasions to his left hand and head, as well as three gunshot wounds: one to his head, a perforating wound that started at the right side of his back and went through his chest, and a grazing wound to the right side of his back. Germaniuk concluded that the gunshot to his head was fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 16} During the search of the crime scene, police found a fully loaded .38-caliber revolver near Fingerhut\u2019s body. Near the gun was a bloody shoe print. A firearms expert with the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) concluded that the bullets recovered from the crime scene and the victim had all been fired from the same weapon, but not from the one found at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 17} In a dresser in the master bedroom of the house, police discovered 145 letters and cards handwritten by Jackson to Roberts. Most were addressed to Roberts at a post office box in Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 18} In the trunk of Roberts\u2019s car parked in the garage, police found a brown paper bag with Jackson\u2019s name on it. Inside the bag were clothing and 139 handwritten letters from Roberts to Jackson dated from October through early December 2001. Roberts told police that she had written the letters. Also in the trunk, police found an empty handcuffs box.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 19} During the ensuing investigation, police learned that Jackson and Roberts had spent a night at the Wagon Wheel Motel and that Roberts had registered for a room (room No. 129) at the Days Inn and had paid for a week. Police and a BCI agent found bloodstains in room No. 129. Police also recovered a garbage bag that had been in room No. 129 containing a nearly empty bottle of hydrogen peroxide and bloodstained bandages and gauze. The DNA of the blood was later determined to be consistent with Jackson\u2019s DNA profile. Fingerprints lifted from inside room No. 129 and from a Days Inn room-key envelope marked \u201c129,\u201d which was also found in the garbage bag, matched Jackson\u2019s fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Police also learned that Fingerhut had two life-insurance policies naming Roberts as sole beneficiary. The aggregate benefit from the two policies was $550,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 21} Police discovered Fingerhut\u2019s car abandoned on the east side of Youngstown. A BCI forensic scientist found blood on the driver\u2019s visor and elsewhere inside the car. The blood on the visor was a mixture consistent with both Jackson\u2019s and Fingerhut\u2019s DNA profiles. Blood recovered from the trunk-release lever inside the car was a mixture with a major profile consistent with Jackson\u2019s DNA and a minor profile consistent with Fingerhut\u2019s DNA. The occurrence frequency of the DNA profile from blood found on the trunk-release lever is one in 45 quintillion, 170 quadrillion in the Caucasian population, one in 29 quadrillion, 860 trillion in the African-American population, and -one in 22 quintillion, 400 quadrillion in the Hispanic population.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 22} Passages from the letters exchanged between Jackson and Roberts, as well as recorded phone calls Jackson made to Roberts from prison, revealed a plot to murder Robert Fingerhut. The subject was raised on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 23} For example, on October 2, 2001, Jackson wrote to Roberts: \u201c[W]hy don\u2019t you leave Robert an lets carry on with a world of our own? Or let me do what I was gonna do to him, because you know that \u2014 that was our little thing so you better not go an try to get know one else to do it, because I told you its getting done when I come home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 24} On October 8, 2001, Jackson wrote: \u201cDonna I got it already planned out on how we are gonna take care of the Robert situation. An baby its the best plan ever! Because Donna its now time that we really be together so that we can really see the true side of our love because I\u2019m tired of not being able to be with you * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 25} In an October 20, 2001 letter, Jackson wrote: \u201cAn Donna I don\u2019t care what you say but Robert has to go! An I\u2019m not gonna let you stop me this time. An Donna you know that I\u2019ve always wanted to live my life with you an only you but everytime that I wanted to take care of the situation by myself you wouldn\u2019t never let me. * * * Because you wouldn\u2019t let me do what I wanted to do to make you happy an that was get rid of him! So Donna can I do this so that we can go on an live happy? An then maybe we can sell the house an move on to somewhere else in our own world. An I\u2019m not gonna be happy until that happens!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">{\u00b6 26} On October 26, 2001, Jackson wrote: \u201cAn then after that you don\u2019t ever have to worry about making know more excuses to him, because he will no longer be with us after 12-10-01 an then it\u2019ll be me an you totally an completely * * *.\u201d Within that same passage, Jackson drew a tombstone with the inscription \u201cRest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>In Piss.\u201d Later in the same letter, Jackson wrote: \u201cHey Donna just think come 12-11-01 you\u2019ll be waking up to me or maybe we\u2019ll give it a couple of days to let things look cool an then after the funeral baby when I come home I\u2019m never leaving an we\u2019re only doing it like that just to make it look good * * *. Alls I need is for my baby not to worry an leave everything else up to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 27} On October 29, 2001, Jackson wrote: \u201cAn as far as the Robert problem? Yes I\u2019m taking care of that the next night, because I told you I\u2019m tired of living like this when I don\u2019t have to. An after that will you get me a 2002 Cadillac Deville?\u201d Later in the same letter, Jackson wrote: \u201cAn even if I gotta come to the house and shoot Robert in his fucking head you\u2019re gonna be with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 28} On October 30, Jackson wrote: \u201cWell I see now you know that I\u2019m about my business when I get out as far as our little situation? An get me a size large leather gloves an see if you can find me a ski mask hat okay? An I need them handcuffs you have an its mandatory, so get them for me, because the way that I\u2019m gonna do it is gonna be right okay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 29} In recorded phone conversations between Jackson and Roberts during November 2001, the two continued to discuss Jackson\u2019s plans for Fingerhut. In a November 8, 2001 conversation, Jackson told Roberts that he wanted Fingerhut to see her perform fellatio on him before Fingerhut \u201cgoes away man.\u201d In their conversation on November 22, Roberts expressed worries that Jackson would get caught:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[Jackson]: * * * You know what I\u2019m saying, the next day after. You know what I told you I wanted to do right?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[Roberts]: I\u2019m afraid Nate.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[Jackson]: What you, man.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[Roberts]: I can\u2019t afford to lose you.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[Jackson]: And I, listen, listen here.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[Roberts]: I can not lose you. Like I will kill myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[Jackson]: Man, look. See man.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c[Roberts]: If you go away from me again.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[Jackson]: Just forget about it man, * * * when a person, man, know what he\u2019s doing, man, * * * that\u2019s like jinxing, man. * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c[Roberts]: But what was the story with the trunk and handcuffs, that\u2019s too involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c[Jackson]: Just, just, just leave it alone, alright.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[Roberts]: It\u2019s too much involved. Your gonna leave hair, your gonna leave prints, your gonna,</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>{\u00b6 42} \u201c[Jackson]: Leave it alone, man. Leave it alone, alright.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c[Jackson]: Come on man. This ain\u2019t Perry Mason man.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[Roberts]: I don\u2019t want to know anything about it ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 46} Two days later, on November 24, Jackson tried to reassure Roberts about his plan:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c[Jackson]: Man, * * * we gonna really talk when I come home, ok.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c[Roberts]: Ok.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c[Jackson]: Especially about our, that situation, man. You know.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c[Roberts]: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c[Jackson]: I mean, it just, you know, you get too nervous at times, that\u2019s all the deal is.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c[Roberts]: Yeah I know, it part of my nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c[Jackson]: And then you said DNA, the only way they can do a DNA is if they got the other, the person\u2019s, you know what I\u2019m saying. If they got the person and the hair cause they can\u2019t just take no hair and say this is such and such hair. * * * [T]he laws that we got in the State of Ohio and the laws from everywhere else, you know what I\u2019m saying, I mean they way different. * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c[Roberts]: Really.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c[Jackson]: Hell yeah. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll talk about it when I come home Donna. Ok, I don\u2019t want to talk about it over the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">{\u00b6 56} On December 8, the day before Jackson was released from prison, Jackson and Roberts had one final recorded conversation. Roberts expressed misgivings about what Jackson was planning to do to Fingerhut, but Jackson told her, \u201cI got to do this Donna. I got to.\u201d Roberts told Jackson that she did not want to know about it, and then the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-20\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cN. Jackson: Just consider it a done deal. Only thing I\u2019m gonna need is one thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-21\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cD. Roberts: What?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-22\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b395-23\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cN. Jackson: I just need to be in that house when he come home.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-24\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cD. Roberts: Oh no.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-25\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b395-26\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cN. Jackson: Baby it ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house man, I promise you.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-27\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>{\u00b6 65} \u201cN. Jackson: I just need to be in there man. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house man. I mean I ain\u2019t gonna jeopardize that man.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cD. Roberts: Well, let\u2019s not talk about it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cN. Jackson: Ok. We\u2019ll talk, we\u2019ll, I\u2019ll just wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 68} Police arrested Roberts at her home on the night of December 20, 2001. Shortly afterwards, police arrested Jackson at the Youngstown home of Sheila Fields, Jackson\u2019s friend. Jackson surrendered without incident, and police noticed that he had a bandage on his left index finger. Police searched the home, with Fields\u2019s consent, and seized a pair of tennis shoes and a pair of black leather gloves. The index finger of the left glove appeared to have been torn off, and there was a red substance on what remained of that finger. The tread pattern of the shoes was consistent with the print left in blood near Fingerhut\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 69} Police brought Jackson to the Trumbull County Sheriffs Office around 2:00 a.m. on December 21, 2001, and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Jackson initialed and signed the waiver-of-rights form. Jackson told Detectives Monroe and Hoolihan, \u201cI just didn\u2019t mean to do it, man.\u201d Jackson then related on videotape his version of what happened, essentially claiming that he had shot Fingerhut in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 70} Jackson\u2019s story was that he approached Fingerhut at the Youngstown bus terminal about getting a job and Fingerhut told him to meet him outside a restaurant later that evening. Jackson claimed to have known Fingerhut for a couple of years. Jackson claimed to have sold Fingerhut \u201csome weed\u201d when Fingerhut picked him up at the restaurant. Once inside Fingerhut\u2019s car, the two discussed a job at the bus terminal. Jackson asked whether he could stay at Fingerhut\u2019s house for the night and then get an early start on learning the job at the terminal the next day. Fingerhut agreed and took Jackson to his home, which Jackson acknowledged having visited before.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 71} Inside the home, Jackson claimed, Fingerhut started \u201cdisrespecting\u201d him, and the two argued. Jackson said that Fingerhut then pointed a gun at him and shot him in the finger as Jackson tried to disarm him. Jackson claimed that he and Fingerhut had struggled over the gun and then Jackson got control of it and shot Fingerhut a couple of times. Jackson then grabbed car keys off the kitchen counter and fled in Fingerhut\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 72} Jackson asserted that he had been scared and had not meant to kill Fingerhut. He threw the gun from the car window while driving on the freeway back to Youngstown. He then called Roberts on the cell phone in Fingerhut\u2019s car and asked her to pick him up at Sheila Fields\u2019s house and get him a room at Days Inn. Jackson said he did not tell Roberts what had happened with Fingerhut and claimed, \u201cDonna ain\u2019t had nothing to do with it at all, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>{\u00b6 73} On December 28, 2001, a grand jury indicted Jackson on two counts of aggravated murder for killing Robert Fingerhut in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A) and (B). Both murder counts carried two felony-murder death-penalty specifications: murder during an aggravated burglary and during an aggravated robbery. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The grand jury also indicted Jackson on separate counts of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery with a firearm specification on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 74} Before a jury, the state presented numerous witnesses establishing the facts already mentioned. The defense presented three witnesses, whose testimony revealed that ownership documents for most of the property shared by Roberts and Fingerhut named Roberts as the owner. This evidence was intended to undermine the financial motive for the killing asserted by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 75} The jury found Jackson guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 76} At the conclusion of the penalty phase of the trial, the jury recommended death, and the court imposed the death sentence on Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 77} Jackson has raised 12 propositions of law. We have reviewed each and have determined that none justifies reversal of Jackson\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh any mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we affirm Jackson\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">PRETRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Apx\">\n<em>Suppression Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 78} In proposition of law I, Jackson argues that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling the motion to suppress his pretrial statement to police. Jackson contended at the suppression hearing that he repeatedly requested counsel but that police ignored his requests. He also claims that he told detectives that he did not want to answer any more questions but that the detectives continued to interrogate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">{\u00b6 79} At the suppression hearing, Warren Police Detective Jeff Hoolihan testified that he arrested Jackson the night of December 20, 2001, and told him he was under arrest for aggravated murder. Hoolihan advised Jackson of his <em>Miranda </em>rights on the ride to the Trumbull County Jail. According to Hoolihan, without being questioned, Jackson denied killing anybody and asked whether he had the right to an attorney at any time. Hoolihan replied that he did. Jackson then told Hoolihan that he was on the phone with Roberts when he saw that police were surrounding the home where he was arrested. Hoolihan then told Jackson that Roberts had \u201csnitched him out\u201d and that he would have a chance to 'tell his side of the story when they arrived at the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b6 80} Jackson was taken to the jail, where he waited with Howland Township Police Sgt. Dillon and a corrections officer for approximately an hour until Captain Bacon arrived to open the interview room. Jackson was not questioned before Captain Bacon arrived. At approximately 1:45 a.m. on December 21, 2001, he was taken to the interview room, where Hoolihan and Howland Township Police Detective Paul Monroe questioned him. Jackson was given coffee and cigarettes and was very polite, cooperative, and alert. Jackson claimed that Fingerhut shot him in the finger and that he then wrested the gun from Fingerhut and shot him. Jackson agreed to allow police to videotape his statement. According to Hoolihan, Jackson did not ask for a lawyer or decline to answer questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 81} At 2:13 a.m., police began videotaping the interview and again informed Jackson of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave him a waiver-of-rights form, which he initialed and signed, thereby waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The interview lasted approximately an hour. Jackson claimed that he did not mean to kill Fingerhut and essentially claimed that he had acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 82} At the suppression hearing, Jackson testified that during the interview, he had asked to speak to an attorney. Jackson testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to speak to them unless I had an attorney around.\u201d Jackson claimed that the police persisted in questioning him, even though he asserted, several times, his rights to say nothing more and to have an attorney present. Jackson also asserted that he had been high on painkillers and marijuana at the time. Although Jackson admitted signing the waiver, he claimed that no one had read him his rights beforehand.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 83} The trial court overruled the motion to suppress Jackson\u2019s confession after according no weight to Jackson\u2019s testimony. Instead, the trial court found Det. Hoolihan\u2019s testimony to be more persuasive. The court concluded that Jackson had been sufficiently advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and had voluntarily waived those rights. The court also found that Jackson had not unambiguously or unequivocally requested counsel before or during questioning. \u201cAt a suppression hearing, the evaluation of evidence and the credibility of witnesses are issues for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 84} During the videotaped statement, Jackson recounted his version of his interaction with Fingerhut before the shooting, described shooting Fingerhut in self-defense, and explained meeting with Roberts after the shooting. The detectives then asked Jackson how he was able to treat the wound to his finger. Jackson now asserts that at that point in the questioning, he requested counsel. He claims that the request is clear from the following portion of the transcript of the interview:</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>{\u00b6 85} \u201cDet Hoolihan: Okay, but then she goes to Walgreens and brings the stuff to the room?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cJackson: (Mumbles) I, you know, I, I, I told you, you know what I\u2019m saying, but what I had to say, man, I mean, I mean, I can\u2019t just sit here, you know what I\u2019m saying, I mean, just, keep on, you know what I\u2019m saying, backtracking, I mean, I don\u2019t even want to talk about it no more, man. I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m through with it, man, just, man, you know what I mean, police, you know, I mean, I, I talked to a lawyer or something, man, you know what I mean, \u2018cause I, I mean, I ain\u2019t got time to just, just keep on, over and over, man, I\u2019m, I\u2019m through, man, I\u2019m through, man, you know what I\u2019m saying. I say, I mean, I, I ain\u2019t mean to do it, I\u2019m sorry I did it, you know what I\u2019m saying, I mean, but, I was left, I had no choice, man. And that\u2019s it. End of discussion, man.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cDet Monroe: Anything else you want to say?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cJackson: (Inaudible) all I got to say, man, I didn\u2019t mean to do it, man. I mean, I mean, I\u2019m sorry it happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 89} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cDet Monroe: Well, there\u2019s, there\u2019s more here that we didn\u2019t get to.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cJackson: We, we just sum it up like I said, man, when, when I talk to my lawyer, man, you know what I\u2019m saying. Other than that, man, you know, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 92} The interrogation continued a little longer and then stopped at 3:15 a.m., when Jackson said: \u201cI have to go lay down, I don\u2019t want to, but shit, I got to, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 93} Under the Fifth Amendment, an accused must clearly invoke his constitutional right to counsel in order to raise a claim of deprivation of counsel. \u201c[T]he suspect must unambiguously request counsel. * * * [H]e must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney. If the statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, <em>Edwards [v. Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378] does not require that the officers stop questioning the subject.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 94} Here, we find that Jackson\u2019s alleged request for counsel was neither clear nor unambiguous. In <em>State v. Henness </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 53, 62-63, 679 N.E.2d 686, we held that \u201cI think I need a lawyer\u201d is not an unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel. In <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 19, we held that \u201cdon\u2019t I supposed to have a lawyer present\u201d was \u201cat best ambiguous.\u201d Other courts have found similar remarks to be ambiguous and thus not invoking the constitutional right to counsel. See, e.g., <em>Mueller v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Angelone </em>(C.A.4, 1999), 181 F.3d 557, 573-574 (defendant\u2019s question to police, \u201cdo you think I need an attorney here\u201d answered by headshaking, a shrug, and the statement \u201cYou\u2019re just talking to us,\u201d was not an unequivocal request); <em>Dormire v. Wilkinson </em>(C.A.8, 2001) 249 F.3d 801 (\u201cCould I call my lawyer?\u201d followed by police response of \u201cyes\u201d did not invoke the right to counsel); <em>United States v. Zamora </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 222 F.3d 756, 766 (\u201cI might want to talk to an attorney\u201d was not \u201can unequivocal request for counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 95} Because Jackson\u2019s words \u201cI talked to a lawyer or something\u201d or \u201cwhen I talk to my lawyer\u201d did not amount to a clear, unambiguous, or unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 96} Nor did Jackson unequivocally assert his right to remain silent during questioning by the police detectives. In <em>Michigan v. Mosley </em>(1975), 423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313, the United States Supreme Court held that once a suspect invokes the right to remain silent, police must cease questioning him. However, similar to the invocation of the right to counsel, invocation of the right to stop questioning must be honored by police only if it is unambiguous. <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 520, 747 N.E.2d 765, citing <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. at 461-462, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362. In <em>Murphy, </em>we held that the statement \u201cI\u2019m ready to quit talking now and I\u2019m ready to go home, too\u201d was ambiguous and not a clear invocation of the right to remain silent. Id. at 519, 521, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 97} Here, Jackson initially told the detective at the beginning of the videotaped interview, \u201cI don\u2019t even like talking about it man * * * cause you know what I mean, it\u2019s fucked for me, man, * * * I told you * * * what happened, man, * * * I mean, I don\u2019t even want to, you know what I\u2019m saying, discuss no more about it, man, you know, \u2018cause it ain\u2019t gonna, you know, it ain\u2019t gonna to bring, ain\u2019t gonna bring the man back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 98} Later, in the colloquy set forth above during which Jackson alleges that he invoked his right to counsel, he stated: \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about it no more, man. I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m through with it, man,\u201d and then a few phrases later says: \u201cAnd that\u2019s it. End of discussion, man.\u201d Those statements alone might suggest that Jackson invoked his right to remain silent; but between those statements Jackson said, \u201cI ain\u2019t mean to do it, I\u2019m sorry I did it, * * * but, I was left, I had no choice, man.\u201d Given his equivocation, it is unclear whether Jackson wanted to end the discussion by invoking his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 99} Although the police should have stopped their questioning once Jackson asserted, \u201cAnd that\u2019s it. End of discussion,\u201d the statements Jackson made after this assertion did not add anything of any consequence or implicate him further. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>We find that the admission of the subsequent statements by Jackson was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 100} Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding that Jackson was properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he waived those rights is amply supported in the record. Jackson neither unequivocally nor unambiguously asserted his right to counsel. Any infringement of his right to remain silent during his custodial interrogation was nonprejudicial. Accordingly, we overrule proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">\n<em>Judicial Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 101} In proposition of law IV, Jackson asserts that four instances of error committed by the trial court denied him due process and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 102} Two incidents cited by Jackson occurred during guilt-phase closing argument. First, Jackson complains that the prosecutor improperly accused defense counsel of creating a diversion, thereby implying that the defense was somehow lying or committing a fraud upon the court and jury. After an in-chambers conference regarding Jackson\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization, the trial court failed to rule on the objection or- issue a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 103} However, after the defense objected, the trial court told the jury: \u201cPlease disregard this little exchange. It\u2019s not part of this case.\u201d Even if the prosecutor\u2019s diversion comment were improper, Jackson must also show he was prejudiced. \u201cNot every intemperate remark by counsel can be a basis for reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112, 559 N.E.2d 710. Defense counsel directly rebutted the prosecution\u2019s diversion accusation by stating during closing argument: \u2018When he says * * * the defense is going to give you a diversion, he wants you to believe that I\u2019m going to trick you somehow, okay. Well, I\u2019m not going to trick you. You\u2019re smarter than that * * *.\u201d In our view, the trial court\u2019s failure to directly rule on the defense objection did not materially prejudice Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 104} Second, Jackson argues that the trial court improperly allowed the prosecutor to theorize about the evidence. The prosecutor stated during closing argument that Donna Roberts \u201cdepended on Robert [Fingerhut] and she was not in a position to financially take on the relationship [with Jackson] and have the way of life she had been used to with this guy.\u201d The defense objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 105} Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he prosecution is entitled to a certain degree of latitude in summation.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 466, 739 N.E.2d 749. Several witnesses testified to the upper-middle-class lifestyle Roberts and Fingerhut enjoyed. In a letter to Jackson, Roberts complained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Fingerhut had begun restricting her spending and that she was not used to living that way. She wrote, \u201cI am used to having plenty of cash for whatever I want and buying everything I want.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s comments were fair inferences based on this evidence. See, e.g., <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 144. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant\u2019s objection, and Jackson -does not demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 106} The third instance cited by Jackson took place during penalty-phase closing argument. Jackson complains that the prosecutor commented on the absence of a mitigating factor not raised by Jackson. Specifically, the prosecutor stated: \u201cThis lady [Jackson\u2019s expert psychologist] testified that there was no mental disease or defect, that mitigating factor does not exist in this case.\u201d Jackson\u2019s objection was essentially overruled by the trial court after a sidebar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 107} The court erred here in permitting the prosecutor to argue the absence of a mitigating factor not raised by Jackson. Prosecutorial comment is appropriate only with regard to those factors actually offered in mitigation by defendant. <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 289, 528 N.E.2d 542; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 373, 582 N.E.2d 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 108} The state contends that the defense opened the door to the issue when the defense expert testified that Jackson had once tested at a 70 IQ. Although the prosecutor was entitled to minimize that evidence by emphasizing Jackson\u2019s mental abilities, it was misconduct to cast his comments explicitly in terms of the absence of a statutory mitigating factor. Nevertheless, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was harmless error, given the overwhelming weight of the aggravating circumstances over the mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 109} Jackson also claims that error occurred during the testimony of prosecution witness Frank Reynolds, Fingerhut\u2019s former employee. Reynolds recalled overhearing a conversation between Fingerhut and Roberts the day before the murder. According to Reynolds, Roberts asked Fingerhut for $3,000, and when Fingerhut refused, she gave Fingerhut \u201cthe dirtiest look like it can kill a person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 110} The defense objected on hearsay grounds. The trial court correctly overruled the defense objections. Roberts\u2019s request for money was not a statement as defined in Evid.R. 801(A), and thus Reynolds\u2019s testimony was not hearsay. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, paragraph two of the syllabus. Fingerhut\u2019s response was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>{\u00b6 111} Last, Jackson claims that cumulative errors by the trial court denied him a fair trial. We disagree. Jackson received a fair trial. Accordingly, we overrule proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 112} In propositions of law V and VI, Jackson argues that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on purpose and reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 113} In proposition V, Jackson contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction on purpose relieved the state of its burden of proof on the mens rea element of a capital crime. He further asserts that the purpose instruction created a mandatory, rebuttable presumption of the mens rea element from the mere use of a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 114} But Jackson\u2019s failure to object to the purpose instruction waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 13-14, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332. This court has repeatedly rejected similar arguments. The trial court\u2019s instructions on mens rea, purpose, and causation were similar to the instructions this court upheld in, e.g., <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 80-81, 641 N.E.2d 1082; and <em>State v. Taylor, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 27, 2002-Ohio-7017, 781 N.E.2d 72, \u00b6 71-75. The instructions were therefore not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 115} In addition, Jackson\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 393, 659 N.E.2d 292, is misplaced. The instruction criticized there appears nowhere in any of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 116} In proposition VI, Jackson complains that the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instructions in both phases of the trial based on the language of R.C. 2901.05(D) were erroneous. Jackson\u2019s failure to object to either reasonable-doubt instruction waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d at 13-14, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332. This court has repeatedly upheld use of reasonable-doubt instructions based on the statutory language.- E.g., <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph eight of the syllabus; <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 65, 173. Accordingly, proposition VI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">\n<em>Sentencing Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">{\u00b6 117} In proposition of law VII, Jackson argues that the trial court, in its sentencing opinion, improperly weighed both R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) alternatives contrary to <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744, and in effect required mitigation to be justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>{\u00b6 118} In contending that the trial court weighed both R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) alternatives (principal offender, prior calculation and design), Jackson points to the following passages in the court\u2019s sentencing opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cThe evidence reveals that the sole purpose for the Defendant\u2019s illegal entry in the Fingerhut residence was not to commit a theft, a kidnapping or a rape, but to [sic] rather to carry out the premeditated, cold blooded execution [of] Robert S. Fingerhut. This is the most heinous form of Aggravated Burglary, and it is entitled to unsurpassed weight. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 120} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 121} \u201c * * * From the overwhelming evidence, it is this Court\u2019s opinion that the Defendant and the Co-Defendant plotted the murder of Robert S. Fingerhut solely to collect $550,00[0].00 in insurance proceeds. This was accomplished by trespassing in the residence where Fingerhut resided, for the sole purpose of ambushing and murdering him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 122} Jackson\u2019s arguments are not well taken. The jury found Jackson guilty of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design in count one. In count two, the jury found Jackson guilty of aggravated murder while committing aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. The jury also found Jackson guilty of the two specifications attached to each count, and the (A)(7) alternatives were listed in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 123} In its sentencing opinion, the trial court noted that the two counts had merged for sentencing purposes and that the state had elected to dismiss count two. The trial court, however, did not err in its opinion by referring to the murder as \u201cpremeditated\u201d and \u201cplotted,\u201d because the jury found in count one that Jackson murdered Fingerhut with prior calculation and design. Additionally, in its review of the jury\u2019s verdict on the specifications attached to the aggravated-murder counts, the trial court referred to the defendant as the principal offender and made no mention of \u201cprior calculation and design.\u201d Although the trial court\u2019s commentary on the aggravated-burglary charge gives the appearance that it improperly weighed both R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) factors, in our independent review, we find that the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 124} In this case, the evidence clearly established that Jackson was the actual killer of Fingerhut. See <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 168. Jackson admitted that he had killed Fingerhut, although he claimed self-defense. There is no merit to Jackson\u2019s contention that the trial court equated \u201cmitigation\u201d with \u201cjustification\u201d in its sentencing opinion. Nothing in the sentencing opinion states this. The trial court specifically defined mitigating factors to the jury as \u201cfactors that while they do not justify or excuse the crimes of aggravated murder * * * shall be considered by you as extenuating lessening, weakening, excusing to some extent or reducing the degree of sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>tence.\u201d Thus, the trial court clearly understood that mitigating factors \u201cdo not justify or excuse\u201d the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\n<em>Appropriateness of the Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 125} In proposition of law VIII, Jackson contends that his death sentence is inappropriate and disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Jackson\u2019s arguments will be considered as part of our independent review of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>Proportionality Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 126} In propositions of law IX and X, Jackson asserts that proportionality review in Ohio is fatally flawed under R.C. 2929.05 because only cases in which the death penalty has been imposed are used for comparison. Neither proposition has merit. Proportionality review needs to entail only those cases in which the death sentence has been imposed. <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 123-124, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383; <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 127} In proposition of law II, Jackson asserts that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires two showings. \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Proving prejudice requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. In no instance, however, does Jackson demonstrate prejudice, \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">{\u00b6 128} <em>Voir Dire. </em>Jackson first argues that defense counsel failed to object to what he characterizes as the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cextraction of guilty verdict and death verdict promises from all twelve impaneled\u201d jurors during voir dire, relying on <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 465, 739 N.E.2d 749. Yet \u201c \u2018[t]he failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 347, 715 N.E.2d 136, quoting <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831. This court will normally defer to defense counsel\u2019s judgment in voir dire and not find ineffective assistance. See <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189. Like the prosecutor in <em>Treesh, </em>the prosecutor here asked potential jurors whether they would return a guilty verdict if the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is nothing wrong with such questions, and <em>Treesh </em>does not hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 129} All of the jurors Jackson mentions indicated that they could return either a death sentence or life sentence depending on whether the state proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt based on evidence presented at trial. Accordingly, we reject Jackson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 130} Next, Jackson contends that counsel were ineffective by failing to object during voir dire to the prosecutor\u2019s use of only mental disease and age as examples of mitigating factors. Jackson asserts that in limiting examples to these two, the prosecution predisposed most jurors who sat on the case to expect those mitigating factors during the penalty phase. Jackson relies on <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 338, 744 N.E.2d 1163, in which this court stated, \u201cDuring voir dire, a trial court is under no obligation to discuss, or to permit the attorneys to discuss, specific mitigating factors.\u201d According to Jackson, <em>Jones </em>stands for the proposition that it is improper to ask prospective jurors to weigh or consider specific mitigating factors during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 131} Jackson\u2019s counsel were not ineffective for failing to object. Jackson misconstrues the <em>Jones </em>holding. <em>Jones </em>reiterated the proposition that a trial court does not err or abuse its discretion in refusing to allow attorneys to ask prospective jurors about specific mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Wilson, </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 386, 659 N.E.2d 292. <em>Jones, </em>however, does not prohibit attorneys from referring to specific mitigating factors as examples of mitigating evidence during voir dire questioning. A trial court does not abuse its discretion in allowing that type of question.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 132} Jackson also does not demonstrate how jurors were predisposed to expect mitigating factors that were not raised or did not apply. Whenever the prosecutor referred to specific mitigating factors during voir dire, he used them solely as a hypothetical and cautioned the individual prospective jurors that the factors being discussed did not necessarily apply to Jackson\u2019s case. Counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of specific mitigating factors in voir dire inquiries did not constitute deficient performance. Therefore, Jackson\u2019s arguments are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 133} Jackson next argues that counsel were ineffective for not objecting to inappropriate statements and misconduct of the prosecutor that prejudiced and predisposed the jury to return guilty and death verdicts. Jackson cites six prosecutorial comments that he claims were inappropriate: (a) \u201cThe first trial deals with the state proving beyond a reasonable doubt, the Defendant committed aggravated murder\u201d; (b) \u201cif you found beyond a reasonable doubt even though there were mitigating factors, you would still, under the law, return a verdict recommending the death penalty, do you understand that?\u201d; (c) \u201cSo we\u2019re dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>with charges where the person committed the crime, the Defendant is alleged of killing a homeowner\u201d; (d) \u201cin this case the aggravating circumstances accuse the Defendant of purposely killing a homeowner in the commission of an aggravated burglary\u201d; (e) \u201cSo that means that you would be able, if you were one of the 12 jurors, to listen to the evidence and decide the Defendant\u2019s guilt based only on the evidence, right?\u201d; and (f) \u201cIn this case, the Defendant is charged with killing a home owner in an aggravated murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 134} None of the foregoing statements constituted prosecutorial misconduct, and counsel were not deficient in failing to object to any of them. Statement (a) is largely accurate, although a more complete statement would have referred to \u201cthe first trial\u201d as the first phase or the guilt phase. Statement (b) was confusing and a misstatement because it was not limited to the situation in which the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). Nevertheless, soon after this misstatement, the prosecutor correctly stated the state\u2019s burden of proof in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 135} Statements (c), (d), and (f) are inaccurate because Fingerhut was not a homeowner, and homeowner status is not an element of any crime or specification that Jackson was charged with committing. Jackson\u2019s claims of prejudice, however, are not persuasive. Statement (e) was not improper in the context of the voir dire questioning concerning pretrial publicity. The prosecutor followed up this alleged prejudicial statement with \u201cAnd that is why we ask the question, because if you come into Court believing the Defendant was guilty from prior publicity, you wouldn\u2019t be fair, right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 136} <em>Guilt phase. </em>Jackson next contends that counsel were deficient in fashioning a defense based on the fact that Roberts owned the house and car and that she had given Jackson permission to enter, thus supposedly negating the burglary and robbery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 137} Defense counsel unsuccessfully sought a jury instruction that would have provided that if the owner \u2014 i.e., Roberts \u2014 had given Jackson permission to enter the property or use the car, then there was no trespass. Jackson asserts that counsel were apparently unaware that such a defense to burglary and robbery was precluded, he claims, by decisions of this court. See <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 115, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, and <em>State v. Rhodes </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 74, 2 OBR 629, 442 N.E.2d 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 138} However, counsel\u2019s decisions in this area were trial strategy. This court ordinarily refrains from second-guessing strategic decisions counsel makes at trial, even when counsel\u2019s trial strategy was questionable. <em>State v. Clayton, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 49, 402 N.E.2d 1189. Given the abundant evidence of Jackson\u2019s guilt, counsel were left with few options in attempting to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. Assuming that the jury could have found merit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>defense claim that Jackson had killed Fingerhut in self-defense, the requested jury instruction would have been consistent with that defense. In any event, we find that counsel\u2019s pursuit of this strategy did not prejudice Jackson or affect the outcome of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">{\u00b6 139} Jackson next asserts ineffective assistance in defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of letters allegedly written by Roberts to Jackson without requiring authentication of her writings as a predicate to admission. In contrast, Jackson points out, his letters to Roberts were admitted only after authentication of his authorship was established by testimony of a handwriting expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 140} Detective Monroe did properly identify the letters pursuant to Evid.R. 901(A). Roberts told Monroe that she had written the letters. They were found in the trunk of Roberts\u2019s car in a bag with Jackson\u2019s name on it. They were signed \u201cDonna Marie.\u201d They had a return address of a post office box registered to Roberts. Counsel were not ineffective in failing to object to the admission of Roberts\u2019s letters to Jackson, for they were properly authenticated, and defense counsel used them as'part of their trial strategy to bolster Jackson\u2019s claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 141} Finally, Jackson asserts that the cumulative effect of errors and omissions by trial counsel infringed his right to effective assistance of counsel. However, Jackson received a fair trial. Accordingly, proposition II is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 142} In proposition of law III, Jackson alleges ten instances of prosecutorial misconduct during trial. Whether improper remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct requires analysis as to (1) whether the remarks were improper and, (2) if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. This court will not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments. <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 464, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 143} <em>Voir Dire. </em>The first three instances cited by Jackson are the same as those he sets forth in proposition II, in which he claims that counsel were ineffective for failing to object. As was discussed under proposition II, we determine that the prosecutor did not improperly extract promises from prospective jurors to find guilt and vote for a death verdict. The prosecutor\u2019s questions during voir dire on life and death were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>{\u00b6 144} Likewise, the prosecutor\u2019s use of two mitigating factors with prospective jurors to illustrate the weighing process was not improper. As we explained under proposition II, those examples were set forth as hypothetical, and the trial court had discretion to allow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 145} In addition, as we noted under proposition II, none of the alleged misstatements constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Even the statements that were not accurate did not prejudice Jackson\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 146} <em>Guilt Phase. </em>In the fourth instance, Jackson complains that the prosecutor expanded his opening statement into argument at the beginning of the guilt phase. The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement was at times argumentative, and the prosecutor conceded at a sidebar conference that he should have prefaced his remarks by stating: \u201cThe evidence is gonna show * * * .\u201d Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. Although the trial court overruled the motion, it immediately gave the jury a curative instruction, stating: \u201c[T]he purpose for opening statements is to present what either side expects to show. * * * It is not proper to get into the realm of opinion on the opening statement. * * * So you should listen to what the State expects to show and disregard anything else that may have been said that might delve into the realm of opinion at this point.\u201d Because we presume that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions, <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 480, 739 N.E.2d 749, prejudice to Jackson is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 147} In the fifth instance, Jackson contends that the prosecutor improperly solicited repetitive hearsay from Detective Monroe. While on direct examination, Monroe sometimes responded beyond the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Defense counsel complained about this behavior in chambers and moved for a mistrial. The court overruled the motion but agreed that defense counsel\u2019s concern was legitimate because Monroe was answering beyond the scope of the questions. The prosecutor was instructed by the court to talk to Monroe and tell him to limit his answers. On his allegation of repetitive hearsay, Jackson does not provide specific instances. He also does not show how the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Monroe prejudiced his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 148} The sixth instance raised by Jackson is the prosecutor\u2019s characterization during guilt-phase closing argument of the defense\u2019s interpretation of evidence as a diversion. However, as we noted under proposition IV, even if it is assumed that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper, prejudice to Jackson is lacking. \u201cNot every intemperate remark by counsel can be a basis for reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 112, 559 N.E.2d 710. Even without the prosecutor\u2019s remark, the jury would have found Jackson guilty, given the overwhelming evidence of guilt. See <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 267, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>{\u00b6 149} Jackson alleges in his seventh instance that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence. He cites these comments of the prosecutor during the closing argument: \u201cShe [Donna Roberts] had the ability to walk out of the relationship with her significant other. There wasn\u2019t a marriage; there was a divorce. And she had legal title to cars, legal title to the home, she had everything. But we will go into when you read and listen to the evidence that she depended on Robert and she was not in a position to financially take on the relationship and have the way of life she had been used to with this guy.\u201d The defense\u2019s objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 150} As we noted under proposition IV, these comments were fair inferences that the jury could adopt based on the evidence and testimony. See, e.g., <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 151} In the eighth instance, Jackson argues that the prosecutor improperly theorized about the evidence during rebuttal guilt-phase closing argument. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 152} \u201cWhat happened? Well, I don\u2019t know for certain, but I think what the evidence is going to disclose is here is what happened. This man and Donna Roberts plotted the murder and what their plan was was to go to the house and when Robert Fingerhut got home pull a gun on Robert Fingerhut, handcuff him and forcibly take him from the house at 254 Fonderlac, take him down to Youngstown and execute him in Youngstown and leave the car there. That was the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 153} The defense\u2019s objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 154} Prosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can be drawn from the evidence. <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 595 N.E.2d 915, overruled on other grounds, <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 402-404, 686 N.E.2d 1112. A prosecutor may state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial. See, e.g., <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 96, 568 N.E.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">{\u00b6 155} We find in Jackson\u2019s case that the prosecutor\u2019s theory was based on the evidence at trial. In his letter to Roberts dated October 30, 2001, Jackson asked Roberts to obtain for him leather gloves, a ski mask, and handcuffs. Detective Monroe found an empty handcuffs box in the trunk of Roberts\u2019s car shortly after the murder. In a recorded phone conversation the day before his release from prison, Jackson assures Roberts, \u201cBaby it ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house man, I promise you. * * * I just need to be in there man. It ain\u2019t gonna happen in the house man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>{\u00b6 156} In our view, the prosecutors\u2019 comments were fair inferences based on the evidence at trial and therefore were not improper. There is also no showing that the comments prejudiced Jackson\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 157} <em>Penalty Phase. </em>In Jackson\u2019s ninth alleged instance, the prosecutor improperly argued during penalty-phase closing argument that Jackson had no mental disease or defect, a mitigating factor not raised by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 158} As we discussed under proposition IV, the prosecutor erred in arguing the absence of a mitigating factor not raised by defendant. Prosecutorial comment is appropriate only about those factors actually offered in mitigation by defendant. See, e.g., <em>State v. Mills, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 373, 582 N.E.2d 972. Nevertheless, the comment was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 159} Jackson claims in the tenth instance that the prosecutor improperly referred to the homicide as a \u201ccold blooded psychopathic killing.\u201d The defense objected, and the trial court sustained the objection, instructing the jury to disregard the comment. In instructing in this way, the trial court ameliorated any error. See <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 199, 204, 59 O.O.2d 220, 283 N.E.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">{\u00b6 160} Last, Jackson\u2019s claim that the cumulative effect of misconduct by the prosecutor during both phases of trial deprived him of a fair trial lacks merit. We believe that Jackson received a fair trial, and any error was either harmless or curable by our independent review of his sentence. \u201cSuch errors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068. Furthermore, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found Jackson guilty even without the alleged improper comments. <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 464, 739 N.E.2d 749. Accordingly, proposition III is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">CONSTITUTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">{\u00b6 161} In propositions of law XI and XII, Jackson challenges Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes on numerous constitutional grounds and concedes that many of his constitutional claims have been rejected by this court in a number of cases. We summarily reject all of Jackson\u2019s constitutional claims. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 700 N.E.2d 596; <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND PROPORTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">{\u00b6 162} Upon our independent assessment, the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances in this case: that Nathaniel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Jackson murdered Robert Fingerhut while committing aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\n<em>Mitigating Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 163} In the penalty phase, Jackson presented five witnesses and gave an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 164} Raymond Dickerson, Jackson\u2019s stepfather, has known Jackson since Jackson was 15 years old. He testified that Jackson was respectful to him and to Jackson\u2019s mother and grandmother. Dickerson noted that he did not see much of Jackson after Jackson turned 17 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 165} Taushia Korneagay, Jackson\u2019s sister, stated that Jackson was kind and treated her well and did a lot for her. Korneagay noted that Jackson helped her in many ways with her four children. She said that she wanted the jury to spare Jackson\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 166} Lorraine Rue, the mother of Jackson\u2019s daughter, Shaylese, and Shaylese herself, a second-grader, appeared on the witness stand together. Rue testified that Jackson had visited Shaylese in the past and had brought her toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 167} Pauline Korneagay, Jackson\u2019s mother, briefly described Jackson\u2019s upbringing and stated that Jackson did \u201cpretty good\u201d in school. She answered \u201cno\u201d when asked whether Jackson had grown up in a rough neighborhood. She did not remember Jackson\u2019s being shot while in school, or that she had written a letter to excuse him from school for that reason. Pauline said that she keeps in touch with Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">{\u00b6 168} Dr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical and forensic psychologist, was the principal mitigation witness. Dr. McPherson interviewed Jackson, reviewed his school and other records, and submitted a report on her findings. She noted that Jackson\u2019s father had little, if any, involvement with his son and that Jackson grew up under the care of his mother and maternal grandmother. According to Dr. McPherson, Jackson exhibited serious behavioral problems from the first grade on, \u201cwhich is fairly unusual.\u201d By third grade, Jackson had already been suspended from school because of his behavioral difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">{\u00b6 169} Dr. McPherson observed that Jackson\u2019s school record reflected an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) characterized by impulsiveness and an inability to stop his behavior. Jackson was never put in any kind of structured program to deal with his ADHD until the eighth grade, the only time Jackson recalled liking school.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">{\u00b6 170} Jackson began using alcohol and drugs early in life, but does not seem to have developed a primary alcohol dependency. He began using marijuana at around age 13 and quickly became dependent on it. He also used cocaine to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>some degree. Jackson never used other serious drugs. Nevertheless, Dr. McPherson noted that Jackson\u2019s repeated involvement in crimes as an adult was mostly related to his drug habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 171} Dr. McPherson said that Jackson had worked very little in his life. His longest period of work was about six months, and he never worked fulltime. Jackson dropped out of school in the 11th grade and decided to live independently of his mother. His idea of independence was to live on the streets. Jackson has been shot at least four times. Even before he dropped out of school, Jackson had been a target of gunfire. Dr. McPherson testified that Jackson\u2019s school records indicate that his mother had once sent a note to school to excuse Jackson because he had been shot at and had to make a police report.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 172} Jackson has fathered two children, but has never been in a position to assume parental responsibilities. One of the children has cerebral palsy, and the mother\u2019s family does not allow Jackson any contact with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 173} Dr. McPherson administered several tests to Jackson. Although Jackson\u2019s IQ had twice been tested at 70 in grade school, a more recent test put him at a full-scale IQ of 84. Dr. McPherson attributed the difference in scores to the fact that Jackson had not been motivated to cooperate when he took the test in school and that he did better under the more structured environment of prison. Taking into account Jackson\u2019s minimal education, Dr. McPherson believes him to be of average ability. She noted that Jackson possesses some artistic talent.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 174} Jackson suffers from an antisocial personality disorder, but has shown the capacity to be loyal to those within his own group. According to Dr. McPherson, Jackson displayed loyalty to Roberts and did not try to avoid responsibility and blame the murder on her. Dr. McPherson testified that Jackson does have the ability to get along with other people and has done well in the structured environment of prison. Dr. McPherson opined that as far as Jackson\u2019s future behavior was concerned, he would function best in a prison environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">{\u00b6 175} Dr. McPherson described Jackson\u2019s relationship with Donna Roberts as \u201cvery destructive.\u201d She stated that Jackson is very insecure and received a certain amount of reassurance in his relationship with Roberts, which made him feel like somebody special. According to Dr. McPherson, Jackson felt that his life would be more stable with Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">{\u00b6 176} Jackson gave an unsworn statement in which he stated: \u201cI would like to apologize for what happened to the victim. I am very sorry for what happened and I know by me saying sorry ain\u2019t going to bring his life back. This is something I have to live with for the rest of my life, and also like for my daughter, to know that she still has a father that is alive and I would like to see her grow up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 177} The nature and circumstances of the offense offer nothing in mitigation. Jackson, with the aid and support of Roberts, planned to murder Fingerhut to get him out of the way and reap the insurance proceeds Roberts would obtain from Fingerhut\u2019s death. In correspondence and phone conversations, Jackson assured Roberts that the murder was something he had to do and that he had it all figured out. Jackson murdered Fingerhut in his home and then fled the scene in Fingerhut\u2019s car. Jackson\u2019s self-defense claim lacks credibility in light of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 178} Jackson\u2019s history, character, and background offer some mitigating features. His father was never part of his life, and he suffered from behavioral problems in school, mostly because of his ADHD. Although Jackson\u2019s mother denied that Jackson had grown up in a rough neighborhood, the school records and evaluation by Dr. McPherson indicate otherwise. Jackson\u2019s drug dependency was fueled by his involvement in crime, which consisted mostly of burglaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 179} Jackson appears to have the love and support of his family. He indicated in his unsworn statement that he cares about his daughter. Dr. McPherson testified that despite his problems, Jackson has also displayed loyalty \u2014 sometimes, as in his relationship to Roberts, to his detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 180} With respect to the statutory mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B), none appear applicable except for \u201cother mitigating factors\u201d under (B)(7). Although Jackson claimed that Fingerhut pulled a gun on him, thus forcing him to kill Fingerhut in self-defense, the factor of victim-inducement under (B)(1) is not implicated because the claim of self-defense lacks any credibility under the evidence. Likewise, there is no credible evidence of the factor of victim provocation under (B)(2). Jackson\u2019s mitigation expert dispelled any claim that he suffers from a mental disease or defect, the factor under (B)(3). Since Jackson was 29 years old at the time of the homicide, the youthful-offender factor under (B)(4) does not apply. There is no mitigation in the factor of a clean record under (B)(5), for Jackson had a history of prior criminal convictions. Finally, since Jackson was the principal offender in the murder, the factor of being an accomplice rather than the principal offender under (B)(6) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 181} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), Jackson\u2019s ADHD and antisocial personality disorder deserve some weight in mitigation, as well as his ability to overcome his ADHD and adaption to the structured setting of prison. See <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">{\u00b6 182} On the other hand, Jackson\u2019s expression of remorse \u201cfor what happened to the victim\u201d deserves little weight in mitigation. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433. \u00b6 226.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Dennis Watkins, Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney, and LuWayne Annos, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiQ\">John P. Laczko and Dennis Day Lager, for appellant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">{\u00b6 183} Upon independent weighing, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson murdered Fingerhut during a burglary and stole his car. These were the aggravating circumstances that merit imposition of the capital penalty. Those were weighed against the mitigating evidence found in the nature and circumstances of the offense, Jackson\u2019s history, character, and background, and the statutory factors of R.C. 2929.04(B). We find that the aggravating circumstances of this case outweigh the minimal mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 184} We further find that the death penalty is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with capital cases also involving aggravated murder during aggravated burglary, see <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 686 N.E.2d 245, and aggravated murder during aggravated robbery, see <em>State v. Burke </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 399, 653 N.E.2d 242; <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 699 N.E.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 185} We therefore affirm the convictions and sentences, including the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
