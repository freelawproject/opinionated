Collier, shared a relationship that produced a daughter, Brittany Renee Collier (born July 28,1997). The two never married, and after Brittany\u2019s birth, Renee Harrold was designated as Brittany\u2019s residential parent. Appellant received supervised visitation with Brittany twice a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">{\u00b6 2} From her birth, Brittany resided with her mother at the home of her maternal grandparents, appellees, Gary and Carol Harrold. Renee Harrold was suffering from cancer, and appellees took care of Renee until her death on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>October 10, 1999. Following Renee\u2019s death, appellees were granted temporary-legal custody of Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant subsequently filed for legal custody of Brittany, and the Wayne County Juvenile Court designated him as Brittany\u2019s residential parent. On July 31, 2002, appellant removed Brittany from appellees\u2019 home, where she had lived for the previous five years, and refused to permit any further visitation between Brittany and appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 4} Appellees filed a motion for grandparent visitation with Brittany. After hearing evidence on the motion, the juvenile, court magistrate issued a decision granting appellees\u2019 motion for visitation. The magistrate expressly noted appellant\u2019s opposition to visitation between Brittany and appellees, but found that appellant\u2019s actions had not been in the best interest of Brittany. The magistrate reasoned that Brittany had been in the custody of appellees for three years following her mother\u2019s death and found that appellees provided an important link to Brittany\u2019s deceased mother. Therefore, the magistrate concluded that grandparent visitation with appellees was in Brittany\u2019s best interest. After conducting an independent review of the magistrate\u2019s findings and decision, the juvenile court judge issued an order granting appellees visitation with Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant objected to the juvenile court\u2019s decision granting appellees\u2019 motion for visitation. In ruling on the objections, the juvenile court found that Brittany\u2019s interest in maintaining her relationship with appellees outweighed appellant\u2019s wishes for no visitation. However, the juvenile court held that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, requires courts to find \u201coverwhelmingly clear circumstances\u201d that support forcing visitation for the benefit of the child over the opposition of the parent. Therefore, the juvenile court ruled that, although the statutory factors seemed to support visitation with appellees over the objection of appellant, there was insufficient proof in the record to find overwhelmingly clear circumstances for overruling the wishes of appellant. Consequently, the juvenile court sustained appellant\u2019s objections and dismissed appellees\u2019 motion for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, the Ninth District Court of Appeals held that the juvenile court erred in its interpretation and application of <em>Troxel </em>to the case. <em>Estate of Harrold v. Collier, </em>Wayne App. No. 03CA0064, 2004-Ohio-4331, 2004 WL 1837186. The appellate court found that the United States Supreme Court reached a narrow holding in <em>Troxel </em>\u2014 namely, that the \u201csweeping overbreadth\u201d of the Washington state nonparental-visitation statute rendered the statute unconstitutional when applied. Id. at \u00b6 14 and 18. Because the Ninth District Court of Appeals found that the Washington state statute in <em>Troxel </em>was distinguishable from Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes, the appellate court ruled that <em>Troxel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>did not invalidate Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes. Accordingly, the court of appeals reversed the juvenile court\u2019s dismissal of appellees\u2019 motion for visitation and remanded the cause to the juvenile court for an assessment of the motion for visitation under the applicable Ohio statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">{\u00b6 7} Upon motion by appellant, the court of appeals found its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Seventh District Court of Appeals in <em>Oliver v. Feldner, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 114, 2002-Ohio-3209, 776 N.E.2d 499, on the following issue: \u201cWhether Ohio Courts are obligated to afford \u2018special weight\u2019 to the wishes of the parents of minor children concerning non-parental visitation as outlined in <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57 [120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49].\u201d The cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists, as well as our acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">CERTIFIED CONFLICT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Troxel, </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed an action arising out of a Washington statute that permitted \u201c[a]ny person\u201d to petition for visitation rights \u201cat any time\u201d and authorized a court to grant such rights whenever the visitation may serve a child\u2019s best interest. Id., 530 U.S. at 60, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, quoting Wash.Rev.Code 26.10.160(3). In the case before the Supreme Court, the Troxels petitioned for visitation with their two granddaughters following the death of their son, the granddaughters\u2019 father. The girls\u2019 mother objected. The trial court granted visitation to the Troxels, finding that visitation was in the girls\u2019 best interests. The Washington Supreme Court held that the Troxels could not obtain visitation with their granddaughters, because the Washington state statute permitting such visitation unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental right of parents to rear their children. Id. at 67, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 9} Upon review, the United States Supreme Court found that the state\u2019s visitation statute unconstitutionally infringed on the mother\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her daughters. In so holding, the court recognized that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d Id. at 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 10} The court found that the Washington trial court placed on the mother, the custodial parent, the burden of disproving that visitation would be in the best interest of her daughters. In so doing, the court ruled, the trial court disregarded the traditional presumption that a fit parent acts in the best interest of his or her child. Id. at 69, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>{\u00b6 11} A plurality of the <em>Troxel </em>court went beyond invalidating the statute to discuss the scope of the parental right and its required protections. The plurality stated that the problem was not that the trial court intervened into the private realm of the family, but that when it did, \u201cit gave no special weight at all\u201d to the mother\u2019s determination of her daughters\u2019 best interests. Id. The plurality stated that if a fit parent\u2019s decision regarding nonparental visitation becomes subject to judicial review, \u201cthe court must accord <em>at least some special weight </em>to the parent\u2019s own determination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 70, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49. However, the plurality explicitly declined to \u201cdefine * * * the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context.\u201d Id. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 12} Therefore, adopting the plurality view in <em>Troxel, </em>we answer the certified-conflict issue in the affirmative. Ohio courts are obligated to afford some special weight to the wishes of parents of minor children when considering petitions for nonparental visitation made pursuant to R.C. 3109.11 or 3109.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">OHIO\u2019S NONPARENTAL-VISITATION STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 13} In his discretionary appeal, appellant argues that Ohio\u2019s nonparentalvisitation statutes, R.C. 3109.11 and 3109.12, unconstitutionally infringe on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of his or her child. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 3109.11 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIf either the father or mother of an unmarried minor child is deceased, the court of common pleas of the county in which the minor child resides may grant the parents and other relatives of the deceased father or mother reasonable companionship or visitation rights with respect to the minor child during the child\u2019s minority if the parent or other relative files a complaint requesting reasonable companionship or visitation rights and if the court determines that the granting of the companionship or visitation rights is in the best interest of the minor child. In determining whether to grant any person reasonable companionship or visitation rights with respect to any child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the factors set forth in division (D) of section 3109.051 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 3109.12 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(A) If a child is born to an unmarried woman, the parents of the woman and \u00e1ny relative of the woman may file a complaint requesting the court of common pleas of the county in which the child resides to grant them reasonable companionship or visitation rights with the child. If a child is born to an unmarried woman and if the father of the child has acknowledged the child and that acknowledgement has become final pursuant to section 2151.232, 3111.25, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>3111.821 of the Revised Code or has been determined in an action under Chapter 3111. of the Revised Code to be the father of the child, the father may file a complaint requesting that the court of appropriate jurisdiction of the county in which the child resides grant him reasonable parenting time rights with the child and the parents of the father and any relative of the father may file a complaint requesting that the court grant them reasonable companionship or visitation rights with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(B) The court may grant the parenting time rights or companionship or visitation rights requested under division (A) of this section, if it determines that the granting of the parenting time rights or companionship or visitation rights is in the best interest of the child. In determining whether to grant reasonable parenting time rights or reasonable companionship or visitation rights with respect to any child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the factors set forth in division (D) of section 3109.051 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 19} The factors in R.C. 3109.051(D) are:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(1) The prior interaction and interrelationships of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, and other persons related by consanguinity or affinity, and with the person who requested companionship or visitation if that person is not a parent, sibling, or relative of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(2) The geographical location of the residence of each parent and the distance between those residences, and if the person is not a parent, the geographical location of that person\u2019s residence and the distance between that person\u2019s residence and the child\u2019s residence;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(3) The child\u2019s and parents\u2019 available time, including, but not limited to, each parent\u2019s employment schedule, the child\u2019s school schedule, and the child\u2019s and the parents\u2019 holiday and vacation schedule;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(4) The age of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(5) The child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(6) If the court has interviewed the child in chambers, pursuant to division (C) of this section, regarding the wishes and concerns of the child as to parenting time by the parent who is not the residential parent or companionship or visitation by the grandparent, relative, or other person who requested companionship or visitation, as to a specific parenting time or visitation schedule, or as to other parenting time or visitation matters, the wishes and concerns of the child, as expressed to the court;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(7) The health and safety of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(8) The amount of time that will be available for the child to spend with siblings;</p>\n<p id=\"ATE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201c(9) The mental and physical health of all parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(10) Each parent\u2019s willingness to reschedule missed parenting time and to facilitate the other parent\u2019s parenting time rights, and with respect to a person who requested companionship or visitation, the willingness of that person to reschedule missed visitation;</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(11) In relation to parenting time, whether either parent previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense involving any act that resulted in a child being an abused child or a neglected child; whether either parent, in a case in which a child has been adjudicated an abused child or a neglected child, previously has been determined to be the perpetrator of the abusive or neglectful act that is the basis of the adjudication; and whether there is reason to believe that either parent has acted in a manner resulting in a child being an abused child or a neglected child;</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(12) In relation to requested companionship or visitation by a person other than a parent, whether the person previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense involving any act that resulted in a child being an abused child or a neglected child; whether the person, in a case in which a child has been adjudicated an abused child or a neglected child, previously has been determined to be the perpetrator of the abusive or neglectful act that is the basis of the adjudication; whether either parent previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of section 2919.25 of the Revised Code involving a victim who at the time of the commission of the offense was a member of the family or household that is the subject of the current proceeding; whether either parent previously has been convicted of an offense involving a victim who at the time of the commission of the offense was a member of the family or household that is the subject of the current proceeding and caused physical harm to the victim in the commission of the offense;

Thompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 560, 664 N.E.2d 926; <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 418-419, 633 N.E.2d 504. The party challenging the statutes bears the burden of proving that the legislation is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Thompkins </em>at 560, 664 N.E.2d 926; <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 38-39, 616 N.E.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 37} A party may challenge a statute as unconstitutional on its face or as applied to a particular set of facts. <em>Belden v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 329, 28 O.O. 295, 55 N.E.2d 629, paragraph four of the syllabus. A facial challenge to a statute is the most difficult to bring successfully because the challenger must establish that there exists no set of circumstances under which the statute would be valid. <em>United States v. Salerno </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697. The fact that a statute might operate unconstitutionally under some plausible set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 38} Further, where statutes are challenged on the ground that they -are unconstitutional as applied to a particular set of facts, the party making the challenge bears the burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence of a presently existing set of facts that make the statutes unconstitutional and void when applied to those facts. <em>Belden, </em>143 Ohio St. 329, 28 O.O. 295, 55 N.E.2d 629, at paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 39} If the challenged legislation impinges upon a fundamental constitutional right, courts must review the statutes under the strict-scrutiny standard. <em>Sorrell, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 423, 633 N.E.2d 504. Under the strict-scrutiny standard, a statute that infringes on a fundamental right is unconstitutional unless the statute is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest. Id.; see, also, <em>Chavez v. Martinez </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 760, 775, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 40} The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Troxel </em>that \u201cit cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d Id., 530 U.S. at 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49. Likewise, this court has recognized that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children. <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 372, 696 N.E.2d 201. Therefore, we must examine Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes under the strict-scrutiny standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 41} Appellant claims that Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes are sufficiently broad to be analogous to the Washington state visitation statute at issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Troxel. </em>However, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the Ohio statutes are more narrowly drawn and capable of a more narrow construction than the Washington statute in <em>Troxel. </em>Unlike the Washington statute that allowed \u201c[a]ny person\u201d to petition the court for visitation rights at \u201cany time,\u201d the Ohio nonparentalvisitation statutes limit the parties who can petition the court for visitation and limit the application of the statutes to cases where there is a specified predicate event or condition. R.C. 3109.11 applies only in cases where the mother or father of the child is deceased and limits the persons who can petition for nonparental visitation to the parents and relatives of the deceased mother or father. Likewise, R.C. 3109.12 applies only when a child is born to an unmarried woman and limits the persons who can petition for nonparental visitation to the parents and relatives of the unmarried mother and to the father and his parents or relatives, if the father has legally acknowledged paternity or a court has declared him to be the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 42} Further, unlike the Washington statute at issue in <em>Troxel, </em>which contained no reference to the parents\u2019 wishes as a factor to be weighed, R.C. 3109.11 and 3109.12 expressly identify the parents\u2019 wishes and concerns regarding visitation as a factor the court must consider in making its determination, by incorporating R.C. 3109.051(D). Although the trial court can consider any factor it considers relevant, consideration of the parents\u2019 wishes and concerns is mandatory. Moreover, in light of <em>Troxel </em>and our above holding on the certifiedconfliet issue, a trial court must give special weight to that factor in making its visitation determination, thus protecting a parent\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 43} Nothing in R.C. 3109.11, 3109.12, or 3109.051(D) prevents the trial court from giving special weight to the parent\u2019s wishes and concerns regarding visitation. In fact, special weight is required by R.C. 3109.051(D)(15), since the statute explicitly identifies the parents\u2019 wishes regarding the requested visitation or companionship as a factor that must be considered when making its \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d evaluation. This requirement is not minimized simply because Ohio has chosen to enumerate 15 other factors that must be considered by the trial court in determining a child\u2019s best interest in the visitation context. Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes not only allow the trial court to afford parental decisions the requisite special weight, but they also allow the court to take into to consideration the best interest of the child and balance that interest against the parent\u2019s desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 44} Further, while <em>Troxel </em>states that there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interest of their children, nothing in <em>Troxel </em>indicates that this presumption is irrefutable. The trial court\u2019s analysis of the best interests of a child need not end once a parent has articulated his or her wishes. By stating in <em>Troxel </em>that a trial court must accord at least some special weight to the parent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>wishes, the United States Supreme Court plurality did not declare that factor to be the sole determinant of the child\u2019s best interest. Moreover, nothing in <em>Troxel </em>suggests that a parent\u2019s wishes should be placed before a child\u2019s best interest. The state has a compelling interest in protecting a child\u2019s best interest, <em>In re T.R. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 6, 18, 556 N.E.2d 439, and Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes are narrowly tailored to serve that compelling interest. They are not, therefore, unconstitutional under <em>Troxel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">{\u00b6 45} In this case, the trial court properly placed on appellees the burden of proving that visitation would be in the best interest of Brittany, thereby honoring the traditional presumption that a fit parent acts in the best interest of his or her child. Further, the trial court expressly weighed appellant\u2019s opposition to visitation between Brittany and appellees as a factor in its decision, thus protecting appellant\u2019s due-process rights. The court ultimately decided that Brittany\u2019s best interests in maintaining her relationship with appellees outweighed appellant\u2019s desire for no visitation. While the trial court did not use the words \u201cspecial weight,\u201d it is clear that the court gave due deference to appellant\u2019s wishes and concerns regarding visitation before determining that it was in Brittany\u2019s best interest to grant appellees\u2019 motion for grandparent visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 46} Unfortunately, the trial court misinterpreted <em>Troxel </em>as requiring courts to find \u201coverwhelmingly clear circumstances\u201d to support forcing visitation for the benefit of the child over the opposition of the parent. <em>Troxel </em>did not articulate such a standard. Rather, the plurality of the court expressly declined to define \u201cthe precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context.\u201d Id., 530 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, we find that Ohio\u2019s nonparental-visitation statutes \u2014 R.C. 3109.11, 3109.12, and 3109.051(D) \u2014 are constitutional as applied to the parties in this case. Further, since there exists a set of circumstances under which the statutes are valid, R.C. 3109.11, 3109.12, and 3109.051(D) are constitutional on their face. See <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 48} There is no reason to remand the cause to the trial court for yet another assessment of appellees\u2019 motion for grandparent visitation under the Ohio statutes. The facts of this case clearly warrant granting grandparent visitation to appellees, especially considering that they raised Brittany for the first five years of her life. The trial court evaluated the statutory factors and protected appellant\u2019s due-process rights by giving special weight to appellant\u2019s objections to the visitation before determining that granting grandparent visitation was warranted under the Revised Code.
