In this case, we affirm the denial of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 2} In 1992, the average weekly wage (\u201cAWW\u201d) of appellant-claimant, Allen E. Segedy, was set at $404.08. Dissatisfied with the amount, Segedy unsuccessfully appealed administratively and turned to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for relief. The court of appeals denied a writ of mandamus, and on July 14, 1994, Segedy\u2019s appeal to this court was dismissed. See <em>State ex rel. Segedy v. Arts Residential Roofing </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 1494, 635 N.E.2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 3} Over the next several years, Segedy submitted to appellee, Industrial Commission of Ohio, several motions to reset his AWW, including one filed on March 28, 2001, that generated this action. A district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) denied the motion on July 11, 2001, after finding the issue to be res judicata as a result of Segedy\u2019s earlier litigation before this court and the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 4} On February 7, 2002, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) granted Segedy\u2019s appeal and vacated the July 11, 2001 DHO order:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer finds that he has jurisdiction to address the average weekly wage pursuant to ORC 4123.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe average weekly wage is adjusted to $785.00. This is based upon the $7065.10 claimant earned divided by the 9 weeks claimant worked in the year prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cRecompute prior awards for only two years prior to the date of claimant\u2019s application. Awards beyond two years are not included per Hearing Officer Manual Ql.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">{\u00b6 8} Segedy again appealed, objecting not to the amount, but to the SHO\u2019s refusal to backdate the AWW to 1992. Further appeal was denied on March 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">{\u00b6 9} Segedy responded with several motions to the commission, seeking to have the new AWW set retroactively to 1992. One of these motions ultimately generated the commission\u2019s May 12, 2003 interlocutory order. Besides setting Segedy\u2019s most recent appeal for a later hearing, the commission sua sponte decided that the SHO\u2019s February 7, 2002 order to increase Segedy\u2019s AWW might merit reopening. The commission expressed concern that, in exercising continuing jurisdiction to reset the AWW, the SHO may have committed a mistake of law. The commission, therefore, ordered a hearing to (1) determine whether it had continuing jurisdiction to reexamine the February 7, 2002 decision and (2) if continuing jurisdiction existed, to reexamine the merits of Segedy\u2019s AWW, including its commencement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">{\u00b6 10} On June 26, 2003, the commission found that it had continuing jurisdiction to reopen the issue of Segedy\u2019s AWW amount. It held that the February 7, 2002 SHO order contained a clear mistake of law because none of the prerequi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>sites for invoking continuing jurisdiction existed. The commission, therefore, reinstated the July 11, 2001 DHO order that established the AWW at $404.08. The balance of Segedy\u2019s requested relief was denied. Reconsideration was also eventually denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 11} Segedy filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging an abuse of discretion by the commission. The commission moved for summary judgment, and Segedy answered with a similar motion of his own. The court of appeals, adopting its magistrate\u2019s decision, granted the commission\u2019s motion. The court of appeals held that the AWW issue became res judicata upon conclusion of Segedy\u2019s 1994 action culminating in the dismissal of his appeal to this court. The SHO, the court found, committed a clear mistake of law in his July 7, 2002 order finding that he had jurisdiction to reopen the matter, which, in turn, authorized the commission to exercise its continuing jurisdiction a year later to correct that mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 12} The cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 13} Summary judgment is proper when the moving party establishes that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact exists, (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the opposing party. <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 524 N.E.2d 881. Upon review, we find that the court of appeals correctly granted summary judgment in the commission\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">{\u00b6 14} The key issue is whether the SHO properly exercised continuing jurisdiction on February 7, 2002, in resetting Segedy\u2019s AWW subsequent to the conclusion of litigation on the same issue in this court. The SHO did not. Continuing jurisdiction can be exercised only if one of the following conditions exists: (1) new and changed circumstances, (2) fraud, (3) clear mistake of fact, (4) clear mistake of law, or (5) error by an inferior tribunal. <em>State ex rel. B &amp; C Machine Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 538, 541-542, 605 N.E.2d 372. In addition, the commission must specifically identify the precondition under which it exercised continuing jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Foster v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 320, 707 N.E.2d 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 15} The February 7, 2002 order did not identify which prerequisite existed that justified the invocation of continuing jurisdiction. The exercise of continuing jurisdiction on February 7, 2002, was, therefore, a clear error of law, and the commission\u2019s later measures to correct that error were indisputably appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 16} The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AJy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Allen E.
