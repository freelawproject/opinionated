I would decide the case on the merits, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand for that court to review the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant-appellee, Tavaris Cummings, pleaded guilty to three counts of robbery. Prior to accepting his guilty plea, the trial court personally addressed the defendant in court in accordance with Crim.R. 11(C)(2). The colloquy included the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe Court: You understand that by entering your pleas of guilt that you are waiving or giving up certain <em>Constitutional rights ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cDefendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe Court: Let me know that you understand those <em>rights </em>by saying yes to the questions I ask you. You understand you have a <em>right to a trial </em>before a jury or before a judge?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cDefendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe Court: You have a <em>right to call witnesses to appear on your behalf?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cDefendant: Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals concluded that the phrase \u201cright to call witnesses to appear on your behalf\u2019 did not comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c) because it failed to advise the defendant of the right to \u201ccompulsory process\u201d for obtaining witnesses. Therefore, the court of appeals reversed the judgment, vacated the plea, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The issue before us is whether the trial court\u2019s statement to the defendant that he was waiving the \u201cright to call witnesses to appear on [his] behalf\u2019 satisfied Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c). A court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest in a felony case without first addressing the defendant and \u201cinforming the defendant and determining that the defendant <em>understands that by the plea the defendant is waiving the rights </em>* * * to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in the defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 12} I believe that the trial court informed the defendant of his right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in terms that a layperson would reasonably understand. The purpose of Crim.R. 11(C) is to convey information to the defendant so that he or she can make a voluntary and intelligent decision on whether to plead-guilty. However, a court need not repeat the rule verbatim to a defendant, but must only explain his or her constitutional rights in a \u201cmanner reasonably intelligible to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Sturm </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 483, 484, 20 O.O.3d 403, 422 N.E.2d 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 13} The United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant rights essential to a fair trial. See <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 284, 294, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.E.2d 297. Those rights, enumerated in Crim.R. 11(C)(2), include the \u201crights * * * to call witnesses on one\u2019s own behalf.\u201d Id. See, also, Section 11, Article VIII, Ohio Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \u201cFew rights are more fundamental than the right of an accused to present witnesses on his behalf.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 649, 652, 597 N.E.2d 510. Cases and statutes use the word \u201cright\u201d to mean a legal guarantee. See <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 107, 564 N.E.2d 474. I believe that when the court used the term \u201cright\u201d in this case, the court conveyed to the defendant that the \u201cright\u201d to call witnesses was a constitutional guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 14} In addition, to \u201ccall\u201d means to \u201csummon.\u201d Garner, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 217. Therefore, I believe that the trial court adequately conveyed the nature of this right to the defendant. In fact, I believe that the trial court\u2019s words conveyed an even clearer message than does a recitation of the right to \u201chave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.\u201d Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c). The words \u201ccompulsory process,\u201d \u201csubpoena,\u201d and \u201ccompel witnesses\u201d have legal significance and implications that a defendant may not know or understand. If the court uses these terms, a defendant may subsequently argue that he did not understand the right he was waiving because he did not know the meaning of \u201ccompulsory process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals places form over substance. It makes no sense to rigidly adhere to the literal words of the rule when ordinary language conveys the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>same message without the use of legal jargon. Therefore, I respectfully dissent. I believe that the trial court sufficiently complied with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c). I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on this issue.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1u\">William D.
