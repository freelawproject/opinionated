Hand, raises 13 propositions of law. We find that none of his propositions of law have merit and affirm Hand\u2019s convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors as to each count and have compared Hand\u2019s sentence of death to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm Hand\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">{\u00b6 2} On March 24, 1976, Hand notified police that he found the strangled body of his wife, 28-year-old Donna Hand, in the basement of their Columbus home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On September 9, 1979, while Hand was out of town, family members found the strangled body of Hand\u2019s second wife, 21-year-old Lori Hand, in the basement of the same home. The murders of Donna and Lori Hand remained unsolved for more than 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 3} Sometime before January 15, 2002, Hand hired Walter \u201cLonnie\u201d Welch, a longtime Mend, to kill his wife, 58-year-old Jill Hand. On the evening of January 15, Hand shot and killed Jill at their Delaware County home and then shot and killed Welch when he arrived there. Subsequent investigation showed that Hand had previously hired Welch to kill Donna and Lori Hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 4} Hand was convicted of the aggravated murders of Jill and Welch and sentenced to death. The evidence established that Hand\u2019s marriage to Jill had soured, Hand had accumulated more than $200,000 in credit card debt, and Hand stood to collect more than $1,000,000 in life insurance and other benefits on Jill\u2019s death. Before his death, Welch had told various friends and family members that Hand hired him to kill Jill and that Hand had previously hired him to kill Donna and Lori. Hand admitted that he had shot Welch, and forensic evidence established that Hand\u2019s claim that he acted in self-defense on the night of the murders was unsupported by the evidence. Forensic evidence established that Welch was shot in the back at close range. Hand also admitted to a cellmate that he had shot Jill and Welch.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\n<em>State\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 5} Murder of Donna Hand. On the evening of March 24, 1976, Hand notified police that his wife had been murdered at their home on South Eureka Avenue in the Hilltop section of Columbus. According to Hand, he returned home after being out with his brother but was unable to open his front door because it was double latched from the inside. Hand entered the house through a side door and found Donna\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 6} The police found Donna\u2019s fully clothed body at the bottom of the basement stairway. She had a bag over her head and it was tied with a spark-plug wire. The police found no sign of forced entry. Drawers in the upstairs bedroom had been removed and turned over, but the room did not appear to have been ransacked. Moreover, no property was missing from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 7} Dr. Robert Zipf, then a Franklin County Deputy Coroner, examined Donna\u2019s body at the scene and found blood around the head where the body was lying. However, no blood spatters or other bloodstains were found on the stairs, which indicated that Donna had not hit her head falling down the steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">{\u00b6 8} During the autopsy, Dr. Zipf found \u201cthree chop wounds to the back of [Donna\u2019s] head\u201d that were caused by \u201csome type of blunt object, maybe a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>thin pipe or a dull hatchet.\u201d However, Dr. Zipf determined that Donna had died from strangulation caused by the spark-plug wire around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 9} During the fall of 1975, Donna told Connie Debord, her sister, that she planned to divorce Hand and move back to their parents\u2019 home. Donna felt that \u201ceverything was over\u201d and \u201cfeared for her life.\u201d About two weeks before she was killed, Donna told Evelyn Latimer, another sister, that she was going to file for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 10} Hand received $67,386 in life insurance following Donna\u2019s death. Hand also filed a claim for reparations after Donna\u2019s death and received $50,000 from the Ohio Victims of Crime Compensation Division of the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 11} During 1975 or 1976, Teresa Fountain overheard Welch talking to Isaac Bell, Fountain\u2019s boyfriend, about \u201cknocking his boss\u2019s wife off to get some insurance money.\u201d Sometime after Donna\u2019s murder, Welch told Fountain, \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t hear anything and * * * you keep your mouth shut, * * * you didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 12} Murder of Lori Hand. Hand married Lori Willis on June 18, 1977, and Welch was the best man at the wedding. Hand and Lori lived in the home on South Eureka Avenue in which Donna had been murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 13} By June 1979, Hand\u2019s marriage to Lori was falling apart. Lori told her friend, Teresa Sizemore, that she was unhappy with her marriage and was making plans to file for a divorce. Sizemore also saw Lori and Hand interact, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t see any warmth there because [Lori] wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">{\u00b6 14} Around 8:30 a.m. on September 9, 1979, Hand and his baby, Robby, left home so that Lori could clean the house for a bridal shower planned for that afternoon. Steven Willis, Lori\u2019s brother, picked up Hand at his house. The three of them then spent the next few hours visiting a flea market, a car show, and Old Man\u2019s Cave in Hocking Hills. They also went go-cart racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">{\u00b6 15} Around 9:30 a.m., Lois Willis, Lori\u2019s mother, arrived at Hand\u2019s home to help Lori prepare for the bridal shower. After Lois knocked and did not get an answer, she left and returned about an hour and half later. Upon returning, Lois noticed that the front door was ajar and entered the house. Alarmed, she called Hand\u2019s family, who found Lori\u2019s body in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">{\u00b6 16} Police discovered Lori\u2019s body on the basement floor with a plastic sheet wrapped around her head. Lori\u2019s pants were unfastened with the zipper down, and her blouse was pulled up against her breast line. Bloodstains and blood spatters were found on the wall near Lori\u2019s body, and a spent lead projectile was found near her body. Lori had been shot twice in the head, but neither gunshot killed her. Dr. Patrick Fardal, a Franklin County Deputy Coroner, determined that strangulation was the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Lori\u2019s vehicle had been stolen from Hand\u2019s garage. Police recovered her vehicle about three blocks from the Hand home.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 18} Police found the first and second floor levels of the house in disarray, with drawers and other items of property dumped on the floor. Nevertheless, the house did not appear to have been burglarized, because there were no signs of forced entry and the rooms were only partially ransacked. Investigators also seized a cash box containing credit card slips, currency, and a .38 caliber handgun from the trunk of Hand\u2019s car parked in the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 19} After he learned of Lori\u2019s death, Hand returned home. Hand told police that he had been out of the house with Steve and his young son when Lori was murdered. Hand said that \u201ceveryone, including * * * his brothers and help at the shop would have known\u201d that he was going to be gone from the house that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 20} Hand told police that he was very possessive of Lori. He admitted having sexual problems with Lori because he \u201cwanted sex at least once a night and she didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d When asked about insurance, Hand said that he had in the past year doubled its value and that it should pay off both of his mortgages. Hand received $126,687.90 from five separate life insurance policies after Lori\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 21} On September 10, 1979, the police recovered a pair of gloves near where Lori\u2019s vehicle was found. The fingers of the gloves were bloody, and the gloves had been turned inside out. Human bloodstains were found on the gloves, and debris from inside the gloves was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 22} On October 9, 1979, the police reinterviewed Hand. Hand provided the names of Welch and others who worked for him and said that he did not trust any of them. He told police that everyone, including all of his neighbors, was aware that he had received $50,000 after his first wife\u2019s murder. Hand also said that his wife was not planning to separate from or divorce him and that they were \u201cextremely in love with each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 23} During the fall of 1979, Welch went to the home of Pete Adams, Welch\u2019s first cousin, and told Adams that he had \u201ckilled Donna and Lori Hand\u201d and had done it for Bob Hand. Adams did not notify police about this conversation until after Welch\u2019s death in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">{\u00b6 24} During 1979 and 1980, Betty Evans, Welch\u2019s sister, observed that Welch had a \u201cwad of money,\u201d cars, and a girlfriend who wore a mink jacket, a diamond necklace, and rings. Around the same time, Welch told Evans that if she \u201cknew anything, not to say anything because him and Bob had a pact and if anything got out, they were going to kill each other\u2019s mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>{\u00b6 25} In the 1980s and 1990s, Welch intermittently worked as a mechanic at Hand\u2019s radiator shop in Columbus. Hand also provided Welch with extra money on a frequent basis and gave him cars and a washer and dryer. In the late 1980s, Welch started using crack cocaine and spent a lot of money on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">{\u00b6 26} Sometime after Lori\u2019s death, Hand met and married Glenna Castle. They were married for seven to eight years and then divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 27} Hand\u2019s marriage to Jill and his financial problems. In October 1992, Hand married Jill Randolph, a widow, and moved into Jill\u2019s home on Walnut Avenue in Galena, Delaware County. Jill was employed at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in Columbus and was financially secure. Hand was the beneficiary of Jill\u2019s state retirement and deferred-compensation accounts in the event of her death, and he was the primary beneficiary under her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 28} By 2000, Hand\u2019s radiator shop had failed, and he was deeply in debt. During the 1990s and early 2000, Hand obtained thousands of dollars by making credit card charges payable to Hand\u2019s Hilltop Radiator. By January 2002, Hand had amassed more than $218,000 in credit card debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 29} At some point, Jill found out about the extent of Hand\u2019s debt. During 2000, she learned that Hand had charged more than $24,000 on a credit card in her name. Jill was upset and told her daughter, Lori Gonzalez, that \u201c[s]he was going to have Bob pay off that amount that he had charged up with the sale from his business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 30} In October 2000, Hand sold his radiator shop and the adjoining buildings. In May 2001, Hand started working as a security guard in Columbus and earned $9.50 an hour. Despite his enormous debt, Hand continued to pay on several credit cards to maintain life insurance coverage on his wife, including payments in December 2001 and January 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 31} Hand and Jill grew increasingly unhappy with one another. During 2001, Hand told William Bowe, a friend of Hand\u2019s, that he was \u201cquite tired of her.\u201d Abel Gonzalez, Jill\u2019s son-in-law, lived at the Hand home from April to June 2001. Abel said that Hand and Jill\u2019s marriage was \u201con the down slope. * * * There was no warmth there. * * * It seemed everything Bob would do would antagonize Jill, and she made it real clear that she was upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">{\u00b6 32} Plans to murder Jill Hand. In July or August 2001, Welch asked Shannon Welch, his older brother, if he had a pistol or could get one. Welch also asked, \u201cDo you know what I do for extra money?\u201d He continued, \u201cWell, I killed Bob\u2019s first wife and * * * I got to kill the present wife and I\u2019ll have a lot of money after that.\u201d Welch said he was going to be well off enough to retire and talked about buying an apartment complex. Thereafter, Welch asked Shannon about a pistol \u201cmaybe once a week, sometimes twice a week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Between December 21, 2001, and January 3, 2002, Welch was in jail for various motor vehicle violations. During that time, Welch told his cellmate, David Jordan Jr., that he planned to \u201ctake somebody out for this guy named Bob\u201d and mentioned that he had \u201cput in work for him before.\u201d Welch said he needed a driver because his eyes were \u201cmessed up.\u201d He asked Jordan if he wanted the job and offered to pay him between $5,000 and $6,000. Welch said this job was supposed to happen in January, and he gave Jordan his phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 34} During December 2001, Shannon asked Hand whether he could provide bond money to get Welch out of jail. Hand said, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t have no contact with Lonnie * * * because we got business\u201d and refused to give him any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 35} On January 14, 2002, Welch told Tezona McKinney, the daughter of Welch\u2019s common-law wife, that he was going to buy a car for her mother. Welch said he \u201cwas going to get the money the next day\u201d and would buy the car \u201cbecause [he] didn\u2019t buy her anything for Christmas because [he] was in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 36} Around 5:00 p.m. on January 15, 2002, Welch attended a family gathering at Evans\u2019s home in Columbus to celebrate Evans\u2019s birthday. Welch told Shannon that he had to \u201cbe ready * * * to see Bob because [he], might be taking care of * * * business tonight.\u201d Before leaving, Welch told Evans that he \u201cwas going to pick up some money and he\u2019d be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 37} Murder of Jill and Welch. Around 6:45 p.m. on January 15, 2002, Hand arrived home from work. At 7:15 p.m., Hand made a 911 call to report that his wife had been shot by an intruder. Hand also reported that he had shot the intruder.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 38} Police found Welch\u2019s body lying face down on Hand\u2019s neighbor\u2019s driveway. Inside Hand\u2019s house, Jill\u2019s body was found lying between the living room and the kitchen. Hand told police that he had shot the intruder but did not know his identity. He also gave police two .38-caliber revolvers that he used to shoot him. On the way to the hospital, Hand saw the intruder\u2019s vehicle and told Mark Schlauder, a paramedic, that \u201cit could have belonged to somebody that worked for\u201d Hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 39} Around 8:00 p.m. on January 15, Detective Dan Otto of the Delaware County Sheriffs Office interviewed Hand at the hospital. Hand said that after arriving home, he had dinner with Jill and then went to the bathroom. Upon exiting, Hand heard Jill scream, \u201cGerald,\u201d heard two gunshots, and saw a man in a red and black flannel shirt at the end of the hallway. Hand then retrieved two .38 caliber revolvers from the master bedroom. Hand started down the hallway firing both guns at the intruder, but had trouble shooting because the guns were \u201cmisfiring\u201d and \u201cmissing every other round.\u201d Hand followed the intruder out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>front door and continued firing at him as he ran toward his car, and then the intruder fell on the neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 40} During the interview, Hand repeated that he did not recognize the gunman, but recognized Welch\u2019s car in the driveway. Hand said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know [Welch] that well; that he did odd jobs around the shop; that he was a thief; that he was a cocaine addict; that he * * * [came] in to the shop area from time to time.\u201d Hand also said that it had been a year since he had had any contact with Welch, and Welch had no reason to be at his home that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 41} Investigators found no sign of forced entry at Hand\u2019s residence. Blood spatters were found inside the front door and on the front-door stoop. The top of the storm door was shattered, and particles of glass extended 13 feet into the front yard. All the glass fragments were found on top of the blood spatters. Police also found a black jacket on the front stoop, a spent bullet and glass fragments on top of the jacket, and a tooth outside the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 42} According to Agent Gary Wilgus, a crime-scene investigator, the blood spatters indicated that the victim was bleeding and \u201cblood was dropping from his body\u201d as he was moving away from the house. A bloody trail led onto the sidewalk and through the front yard and ended where Welch was lying in the driveway. Welch was wearing cloth gloves, and a knit hat with two eyeholes and a mouth hole was next to his head. Police also found a .32-caliber revolver on the front lawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 43} Inside the house, police found glass fragments and bloodstains extending two to three feet from the front door and another tooth just inside the front door. Jill\u2019s body was 12 feet from the front door, her legs pointed towards the front door, and she was wearing a nightgown. Jill had been shot in the middle of her forehead. A second bullet deflected off the floor and was found on the carpet next to Jill\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 44} Investigators found a bullet in the living room ceiling, and a second bullet was found in the living room window frame. While investigators could not determine the exact trajectory of the two bullets, they determined that they most likely originated from gunshots in the hallway area. No evidence of gunplay was found elsewhere in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 45} On January 17, 2002, Detective Otto reinterviewed Hand, and Hand provided a different version of events. Hand stated that after his wife was shot, he retrieved two guns from the master bedroom, went into the hallway, and saw Welch \u201ccoming down the hallway towards the master bedroom at him.\u201d Hand and Welch then began firing at each other in the hallway and were within four feet of each other during the gun battle. Hand repeated that he chased Welch outside the house but \u201ccouldn\u2019t get his guns to fire; that he was missing every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>other round and * * * they weren\u2019t firing.\u201d When asked about the .32-caliber revolver in the front yard, Hand stated that he did not know who owned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">{\u00b6 46} During the second interview, Hand said, \u201cI was misquoted on the first interview at the hospital\u201d about not knowing Welch. Hand said that he had known Welch, a former employee, for over 20 years. However, Hand continued to give the impression that they were not close. When asked about a wedding photo showing Welch as his best man, Hand said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t find anybody else to stand in as [his] best man.\u201d Hand repeated that \u201cthe only thing he saw\u201d on the night of the murder was an unknown person in \u201cred and black flannel,\u201d and he had \u201cno clue who this unknown person was.\u201d Hand also said that \u201cJill had never met Lonnie; Lonnie\u2019s never been to Walnut Avenue; he had no idea why he was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 47} In discussing his financial situation, Hand said he sold his radiator shop in October 2000 and received $300,000, and later received $33,000 from the sale of his share of the business and its inventory, and $140,000 from somewhere else. Hand said he \u201calways needed money, but if he needed money, he could get some; that he had money.\u201d Hand also told police that he was \u201chiding the money and that he was considering filing bankruptcy; that that was against Jill\u2019s wishes.\u201d Later, Hand said that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to file for the bankruptcy * * * and they were going to work it out.\u201d When asked if he had any offices, Hand said that his office was in a bedroom in the house. However, Hand failed to disclose that he kept business records at another location.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 48} On January 19, 2002, the police seized several boxes containing Hand\u2019s business and personal records from the storage area above a hardware store near Hand\u2019s former radiator shop. These records included credit cards, credit-card- and life-insurance-account information, payment receipts, a list of credit card debt prepared by Jill, and other information about Hand\u2019s finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 49} Heather Zollman, a firearms expert, testified that the .32-caliber revolver found in the front yard was loaded with two fired and three unfired .32-caliber Smith and Wesson (\u201cS &amp; W\u201d) Remington-Peters cartridges. Bullet fragments removed from Jill\u2019s skull were consistent with being an S &amp; W .32-ealiber bullet. In testing the .32-caliber revolver, Zollman found that \u201con more than 50 percent of [her] testing, the firearm misfired\u201d as a result of \u201ca malfunction of the firearm.\u201d The stippling pattern shown in Jill\u2019s autopsy photographs indicated that \u201cthe muzzle to target distance was greater than six inches, and less than two feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 50} Zollman tested the two .38-caliber revolvers and found that they were both in proper working order, and neither weapon showed any tendency to misfire. A bullet removed from Welch\u2019s right forearm was \u201cconsistent with the .38 caliber.\u201d Zollman also concluded that the bullet and fragments recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>from Welch\u2019s mouth and his lower back had rifling class characteristics corresponding with the S &amp; W .38-caliber revolver. Further, gunshot residue around the bullet hole on the back of Welch\u2019s shirt revealed a muzzle-to-target distance greater than two feet from the garment but less than five feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 51} Jennifer Duvall, a DNA expert, conducted DNA testing of bloodstains found on the shirt Hand was wearing on the night of the murders. Five of the bloodstains were consistent with the DNA profile of Welch. The odds that DNA from the shirt was from someone other than Welch was \u201cone in more than seventy-nine trillion in the Caucasian population; one in more than forty-four trillion in the African-American population, and one in approximately forty-three trillion in the Hispanic population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 52} Michele Yezzo, a forensic scientist, examined bloodstain patterns on Hand\u2019s shirt. There were more than 75 blood spatters of varying sizes on the shirt. Yezzo concluded that the shirt was \u201cexposed to an impact\u201d that \u201cprimarily registered on the front of the garment.\u201d Yezzo also examined glass fragments collected from Hand\u2019s residence and \u201cfound tiny fragments of clear glass\u201d on Hand\u2019s shirt, trousers, tee-shirt, and pair of socks that he was wearing on the night of the murders. However, she found no glass fragments on Welch\u2019s boots. Yezzo conducted a fiber analysis of the bullet from Welch\u2019s mouth, but found \u201cno fibers suitable for comparison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 53} Ted Manasian, a forensic scientist, found particles of lead and barium on both gloves that Welch was wearing, and these are \u201chighly indicative of gunshot residue.\u201d Manasian could not determine how the gunshot residue got on the glove, just that it was there. Thus, Welch could have fired the gun, or was in the proximity of the gun when it was discharged, or handled an item that had gunshot residue on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 54} Detective Otto testified that $1,006,645.27 in life insurance and state-benefit accounts were in effect at the time of Jill\u2019s death. This amount included $113,700 in Jill\u2019s Ohio Public Employees Retirement System account and $42,345.29 accumulated in the Ohio Public Employees Deferred Compensation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 55} Dr. Keith Norton, a forensic pathologist in the Franklin County Coroner\u2019s office, conducted the autopsy of Jill and Welch. He concluded that Jill died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Dr. Norton found that Welch had been shot five times: in his mouth, left upper chest, left forearm, right shoulder, and lower back. The gunshot wound to Welch\u2019s lower back went into the spinal cord and would have paralyzed his legs. However, the gunshot wound to the chest was the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 56} According to Kenneth Grimes Jr., Hand\u2019s former cellmate in the Delaware County Jail, Hand told him that he \u201ckilled his wife and the man he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>involved with,\u201d Hand said he hired a man and they had \u201cbeen doing business together for years.\u201d Hand said he \u201chired the man to kill his wife and, in turn, the deal went sour. He wanted more money, so he killed two birds with one stone. He got both and didn\u2019t have to pay anything.\u201d Hand said he had agreed to pay $25,000 to have his wife killed, and the man \u201cwanted it doubled.\u201d Hand said he was going to claim self-defense. He also said the evidence against him was \u201ccircumstantial and there were many witnesses that didn\u2019t have * * * any actual, proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 57} Attempted jail escape. Hand was incarcerated in the Delaware County jail beginning on August 8, 2002. On November 26, 2002, correction officers discovered an escape attempt in Hand\u2019s cell block.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 58} An attempt had been made to cut through the lock on the rear emergency exit of the cell block and through a cell bar. Officers searching Michael Beverly\u2019s cell found two saw blades. Police also seized some torn-up tee-shirt material and a pencil with a tee-shirt tied around it from Hand\u2019s belongings in his neighboring cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 59} Michael Beverly and Wedderspoon, another inmate, came up with the idea for the escape. Beverly said that he obtained two hacksaw blades and began cutting through the rear-exit lock and one cell bar. Dennis Boster, another inmate, was the lookout, and once in a while Hand would relay messages to Beverly that a guard was coming. Hand also advised Beverly on how to cut through the metal bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 60} According to Grimes, Beverly and Hand discussed escaping through the front of their cell block. The plan was that while Hand distracted the guards and nurses by requesting his medication, Beverly would apprehend a guard, and they would escape through the front door. Grimes also identified Hand as a lookout.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\n<em>Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 61} Sally Underwood, Hand\u2019s sister, was a bartender in the Columbus Hilltop area from 1992 until 1994. During that time, Welch frequently came into the bar selling televisions, stereos, and other electronic equipment. When asked where he obtained this property, Welch said that he \u201chad just stolen it from a house down the street.\u201d Underwood could tell that Welch was \u201con something\u201d when he entered the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">{\u00b6 62} According to Terry Neal, another inmate in Hand\u2019s cell block, Hand was not involved in the escape attempt. Dennis Boster, who was convicted of escape, also testified that Hand was not involved in the escape attempt and never served as a lookout.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">{\u00b6 63} Hand testified in his own behalf. He said, \u201cI did not kill my wife or have anything to do with the planning of killing my wife, either.\u201d Hand also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>denied conspiring with Welch or anyone else to Mil Donna or Lori. Hand did not remember \u201ctoo much\u201d about the day Donna was Mlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">{\u00b6 64} When Hand married Lori, Welch was the best man at the wedding because his brother backed out at the last minute. Hand said that he had a great sexual relationship with Lori before his son, Robert, was born, but thereafter, they started having sexual problems. However, his business was going well, and his financial condition was \u201cgreat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 65} During his marriage to Lori, Hand took over his father\u2019s radiator shop, purchased the underlying property, and bought some extra lots. Welch worked part-time at the radiator shop and was paid under the table. Around this time, Hand embarked on a credit card scheme. He used personal credit cards, charged them to his business, and used this money to finance his business and purchase real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 66} The wedding shower at his home on September 9, 1979, had been planned weeks in advance. When he learned that Lori had been Mlled, Hand \u201cdidn\u2019t believe it at first\u201d and then went \u201chysterical.\u201d Hand later told police that he suspected that his brother, \u201cJimbo,\u201d had killed Lori because they were not \u201cgetting along that good and he had the keys to [Hand\u2019s] house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 67} Shortly before Hand and Jill were married in 1992, he moved into her Delaware County home. After they had been married for a couple of years, Jill found out about Hand\u2019s credit card scheme. Hand said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t like it; * * * She just didn\u2019t want no part of it.\u201d She also learned about Hand\u2019s debt, which at one point, was close to a million dollars. Jill was also aware that Hand had life insurance on her through his credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 68} In 2000, Jill learned that Hand used her credit card to pay for repairs to one of Hand\u2019s properties. Jill was upset and wanted a \u201ctotal refinance of everything.\u201d Hand then \u201cstarted selling everything * * * and then paying the credit cards and the mortgages and everything down.\u201d In 2001, Hand sold his radiator shop. By May 2001, Hand had sold all his properties, had paid thousands of dollars on his credit card debt, and had gone to work as a security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 69} According to Hand, he arrived home from work around 6:45 p.m. on January 15, 2002. Hand was coming out of the bathroom when he heard Jill shout, \u201cGerald, Gerald.\u201d He then heard a couple of shots and saw a man dressed in red flannel. Hand retrieved two guns from the bedroom dresser, and as he came out of the bedroom, he saw the intruder coming down the hallway. \u25a0 Hand started \u201cfiring, and * * * assumed [the intruder] was firing.\u201d However, Hand thought his guns were \u201cmisfiring because [the intruder] wasn\u2019t going down.\u201d Hand said he chased the intruder out the front door and continued firing at him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>until the intruder fell on the driveway. He then returned to the house and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 70} Hand did not know how many shots he fired. He retrieved the guns and started firing, later explaining, \u201cI wanted to protect myself * * * and shoot him, the son-of-a-bitch that shot my wife.\u201d Hand did not recognize the intruder, but recognized Welch\u2019s car in the driveway. He had no idea why Welch had come to his house that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 71} Hand denied telling Grimes that Welch was already in the house when he came home from work, denied telling him that Welch wanted to renegotiate his fee, and denied telling him that he killed his wife and then killed Welch. As for the escape, Hand said that he tried to stay away from Beverly as much as possible. Beverly asked Hand if he wanted to join in the escape, and Hand told him \u201cno, and just get away.\u201d Hand also claimed that he did not aid Beverly in any way. Finally, he said that the string found in his cell was used for hanging a bag with food items to keep out the ants.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>Indictment and Trial Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 72} The grand jury indicted Hand on two counts of aggravated murder. Count One charged Hand with the aggravated murder of Jill with prior calculation and design. Count Two charged Hand with the aggravated murder of Welch with prior calculation and design. Count One included a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), death-penalty specification. Count Two included six death-penalty specifications: one \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), specification; three specifications of murdering Welch to escape detection for Hand\u2019s complicity in the murders of Donna, Lori, and Jill Hand, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); and two specifications of murdering Welch for the purpose of preventing his testimony as a witness in the murders of Donna and Lori Hand, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Additionally, Hand was charged with conspiracy to commit the aggravated murder of Jill in Counts Three, Four, and Five. Counts One through Five each contained a firearm specification. In Count Six, he was also charged with escape, which encompasses attempted escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 73} Hand pleaded not guilty to all charges. However, the jury found Hand guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 74} Hand now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">\n<em>Trial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">{\u00b6 75} <em>Admissibility of Welch\u2019s statements. </em>In proposition of law I, Hand argues that the trial court erred in admitting Welch\u2019s statements about his complicity with Hand to murder Hand\u2019s wives. Hand argues that the testimony was not admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), forfeiture by wrongdoing, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>other hearsay exception. Additionally, Hand argues that such evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">{\u00b6 76} Over defense objection, the trial court admitted Welch\u2019s statements to various witnesses describing Welch\u2019s complicity with Hand in the murders of Donna, Lori, and Jill. First, Pete Adams, Welch\u2019s cousin, testified that a week or two after Lori\u2019s murder in the fall of 1979, Welch came to his home and told him that he \u201ckilled Donna and Lori Hand\u201d and \u201cdid it for Bob.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 77} Second, Shannon Welch, Welch\u2019s brother, testified that during July or August 2001, Welch asked Shannon \u201cif [he] had a pistol or if [he] could get one.\u201d Welch then asked, \u201cDo you know what I do for extra money?\u201d Welch continued, \u201cWell, I killed Bob\u2019s first wife and * * * I got to kill the present wife and I\u2019ll have a lot of money after that.\u201d About a week and a half before Jill\u2019s and Welch\u2019s murders, Welch told Shannon that he \u201cmight get to take care of his business with Bob tonight.\u201d On January 15, Welch told Shannon, \u201cWell, I got to go take a shower and change clothes and be ready to go to see Bob because I might be taking care of my business tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 78} Third, Barbara McKinney, described in the record as Welch\u2019s common-law wife, testified that Welch told her that he had visited Hand\u2019s home in Delaware and \u201cBob showed him the house.\u201d When Welch was in jail between December 2001 and January 2002, Welch directed Barbara on the phone, \u201cCall my friend and see if he\u2019ll pay my bond to get me out of jail.\u201d Welch identified his friend as Bob Hand and said, \u201c[D]on\u2019t say his name on the phone any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 79} Fourth, Tezona McKinney, Barbara\u2019s daughter, testified that on January 14, 2002, the day before the murders, Welch told her, \u201cWell, if I get this little money * * * tomorrow, I want to buy your mother this car because I didn\u2019t buy her anything for Christmas.\u201d Welch then pointed out the car to Tezona and said, \u201cI want your mother to have that car. And if I can, I\u2019m going to try to make sure I get it for her, if I get this money.\u201d On another occasion, Welch told Tezona that \u201cBob Hand killed his first two wives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 80} Fifth, Betty Evans, Lonnie Welch\u2019s sister, testified that around 1979 or 1980, Welch told her that if she \u201cknew anything, not to say anything because him and Bob had a pact and if anything got out, they were going to kill each other\u2019s mother.\u201d On the evening of the murders, Welch told Evans that \u201che was going to pick up some money and he\u2019d be right back; that he was sorry he didn\u2019t have anything for [her] birthday; that when he comes back, he\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">{\u00b6 81} Sixth, Teresa Fountain, Shannon Welch\u2019s ex-girlfriend, testified that during 1975 or 1976, she overheard Lonnie Welch \u201ctalking to [her boyfriend] Isaac all about insurance money and knocking his boss\u2019s wife off to get some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>insurance money.\u201d Later, Welch told Fountain, \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t hear anything and * * * you keep your mouth shut, * * * you didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 82} Seventh, Anna Hughes, a friend of Lonnie Welch, testified that although Welch often missed work, he was not fired from his job working for Hand. On one occasion, Welch said to her, \u201cI didn\u2019t go to work * * * [but] I got it like that.\u201d Sometime around 1998, Welch mentioned to Hughes that he was \u201cgoing out to Bob\u2019s.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get me a hit and I ain\u2019t got no money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 83} Finally, David Jordan Jr., Welch\u2019s Franklin County Jail cellmate, testified that during December 2001, Welch said that he was \u201cgoing to take somebody out for this guy named Bob\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019ve put in work for him before.\u201d Welch offered Jordan between five and six thousand dollars to be his driver. Welch also said the murder would \u201chappen sometime in January\u201d and gave Jordan his phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 84} Admissibility under Evid.R. 804(B)(6). Under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), a statement offered against a party is not excluded by the hearsay rule \u201cif the unavailability of the witness is due to the wrongdoing of the party for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.\u201d Evid.R. 804(B)(6) was adopted in 2001 and is patterned on Fed.R.Evid. 804(B)(6), which was adopted in 1997. Staff Notes (2001), Evid.R. 804(B)(6). To be admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), the \u201coffering party must show (1) that the party engaged in wrongdoing that resulted in the witness\u2019s unavailability, and (2) that one purpose was to cause the witness to be unavailable at trial.\u201d Id.; see, also, <em>United States v. Houlihan </em>(C.A.1, 1996), 92 F.3d 1271, 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 85} Before admitting Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence. Welch\u2019s cousins, Pete Adams and Phillip Anthony Jr., testified that Welch told them that he had killed Donna and Lori for Hand. Anthony also testified that shortly before Jill\u2019s murder, Welch told him that he needed a gun because Hand wanted him to murder his present wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court also considered the testimony of Hand\u2019s cellmate, Kenneth Grimes, that Hand had admitted killing Welch to eliminate him as a possible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">{\u00b6 86} Based on evidence at the trial and at the evidentiary hearings, the trial court found, \u201c[T]he state has shown, by a <em>preponderance of the evidence </em>under Rule 804, that, number one, the witness, accomplice, victim, Lonnie Welch\u2019s death was caused by the defendant, and it\u2019s obviously by virtue of that to cause his unavailability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then ruled that Welch\u2019s statements were admissible. After conducting further evidentiary hearings with other witnesses, the trial court admitted the remainder of Welch\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>{\u00b6 87} Hand alleges several reasons why the trial court erred in admitting Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6). First, Hand argues that the trial court should have used the clear-and-convincing standard of proof, rather than a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in proving the predicate facts. However, the majority of United States Courts of Appeals applying the federal rule have followed the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in ruling on preliminary determinations of admissibility under Fed.R.Evid. 804(B)(6). See <em>Cotto v. Herbert </em>(C.A.2, 2003), 331 F.3d 217, 235; <em>United States v. Scott </em>(C.A.7, 2002), 284 F.3d 758, 762; <em>United States v. Cherry </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 217 F.3d 811, 820; <em>United States v. Zlatogur </em>(C.A.11, 2001), 271 F.3d 1025, 1028; see, also, <em>Steele v. Taylor </em>(C.A.6, 1982), 684 F.2d 1193, 1202 (preponderance standard in making preliminary findings in waiver-by-misconduct cases); <em>State v. Boyes, </em>Licking App. Nos. 2003CA0050 and 2003CA0051, 2004-Ohio-3528, 2004 WL 1486333, \u00b6 54-56 (applying the preponderance standard in determining whether the foundational requirements for Evid.R. 804(B)(6) were met). Thus, the trial court properly applied the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in ruling on admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 88} Second, Hand argues that the trial court erred in admitting Welch\u2019s statements without first considering Hand\u2019s affirmative defense of self-defense. However, Hand failed to offer any evidence of self-defense during the evidentiary hearing, although the defense had the opportunity to do so. Thus, the trial court made the appropriate ruling based on the evidence before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 89} Third, Hand contends that Welch\u2019s statements were not admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), because the state failed to show that Hand\u2019s purpose in killing Welch was to make him unavailable as a witness. Hand argues that when Welch was killed, there were no pending charges and no evidence that Welch intended to testify against him at trial. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 90} Evid.R. 804(B)(6) \u201cextends to potential witnesses.\u201d Staff Notes (2001), Crim.R. 804(B)(6); <em>United States v. Houlihan, </em>92 F.3d at 1279 (rule applies with \u201cequal force if a defendant intentionally silences a <em>potential </em>witness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Thus, the absence of pending charges against Hand at the time he killed Welch did not preclude the admissibility of Welch\u2019s statements. Moreover, the state need not establish that Hand\u2019s sole motivation was to eliminate Welch as a potential witness; it needed to show only that Hand \u201cwas motivated <em>in part </em>by a desire to silence the witness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 1279; <em>United States v. Dhinsa </em>(C.A.2, 2001), 243 F.3d 635, 654. Hand\u2019s admissions to Grimes clearly established that one of Hand\u2019s purposes was to eliminate Welch as a potential witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">{\u00b6 91} Finally, Hand argues that the trial court erred in admitting Welch\u2019s statements because they were not reliable. Hand claims that the witnesses were not credible because they were Welch\u2019s friends, family members, and a cellmate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Moreover, Hand contends that Welch\u2019s Mends and family members were angry at him for killing Welch.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">{\u00b6 92} Following the evidentiary hearings and before admitting Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), the trial court found that each witness was credible. The decision whether to admit these hearsay statements was within the trial court\u2019s discretion. See <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus (the admission of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court); cf. <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 114, 559 N.E.2d 710 (\u201c[T]he determination of whether corroborating circumstances are sufficient to admit statements against penal interest, as a hearsay exception, generally rests within the discretion of the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 93} No evidence supports Hand\u2019s allegations that Welch\u2019s friends and family members were not telling the truth, and their bias could have been explored on cross-examination. Indeed, courts generally hold that \u201cwhere a declarant makes a statement to someone with whom he has a close personal relationship, such as a spouse, child, or friend, * * * that * * * relationship is a corroborating circumstance <em>supporting </em>the statement\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 53; see, also, <em>United States v. Tocco </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 200 F.3d 401, 416 (declarant\u2019s statements to his son in confidence considered trustworthy); <em>Latine v. Mann </em>(C.A.2, 1994), 25 F.3d 1162, 1166-1167 (reasoning that statements made to a perceived ally rather than to a police officer during an interrogation are trustworthy). Moreover, the testimony of Welch\u2019s friends and family members was corroborated by Jordan, Welch\u2019s cellmate, and Grimes, who testified that Hand admitted hmng Welch to kill Jill.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 94} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 95} Admissibility under other evidentiary rules. We further find that Welch\u2019s statements were admissible as statements against interest (Evid.R. 804(B)(3)), as a statement of intent (Evid.R. 803(3)), and as a co-conspirator\u2019s statement (Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">{\u00b6 96} First, Evid.R. 804(B)(3) provides a hearsay exception where the declarant is unavailable as a witness. This rule states: \u201c(3) <em>Statement against interest. </em>A statement that * * * at the time of its making * * * so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability * * * that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability, whether offered to exculpate or inculpate the accused, is not admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">{\u00b6 97} Welch\u2019s statements admitting his involvement in murdering Hand\u2019s wives qualified for admissibility under Evid.R. 804(B)(3). Welch\u2019s statements to Adams, Shannon, and Jordan implicating Hand in the murders were also admissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 721 N.E.2d 52, paragraphs one and three of the syllabus (out-of-court statements made by an accomplice that incriminate the defendant may be admitted as evidence if the statement contains adequate indicia of reliability); see, also, <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 60, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 116, 134, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117, fn. 5. As in <em>Issa, </em>Welch\u2019s statements were voluntarily made to family and friends. Moreover, in his statements, Welch did not attempt to shift blame from himself, because he admitted his role as the shooter in multiple killings. <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 61, 752 N.E.2d 904. Thus, the circumstances surrounding Welch\u2019s statements did render Welch particularly worthy of belief. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 98} Second, Evid.R. 803(3) creates a hearsay-rule exception for \u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 99} Under Evid.R. 803(3), statements of current intent to take future actions are admissible for the inference that the intended act was performed. See <em>Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 33; <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 182-183, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343; see, generally, <em>Mut. Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Hillmon </em>(1892), 145 U.S. 285, 295, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706. Not all of Welch\u2019s statements were admissible under this rule. However, Welch\u2019s statement to Shannon, \u201cI got to kill the present wife and I\u2019ll have a lot of money after that,\u201d was admissible under Evid.R. 803(3) to prove that Welch later acted in conformity with that intention. Welch\u2019s statement to Shannon, \u201cI got to * * * be ready to go to see Bob because I might be taking care of my business tonight,\u201d was also admissible as evidence of his intention. Similarly, Welch\u2019s statement to Evans on the night of the murders that \u201che was going to pick up some money and he\u2019d be right back\u201d was admissible to help show that Welch intended to meet with Hand and collect money from him for shooting Jill. Finally, Welch\u2019s statement to Jordan that he intended to \u201ctake somebody out, for * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Bob\u201d and planned to do so \u201csometime in January\u201d was admissible to help prove that Welch later went to Hand\u2019s home to carry out this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 100} Third, Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) provides: \u201cA statement is not hearsay if * * * [t]he statement is offered against a party and is * * * a statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy upon independent proof of the conspiracy.\u201d Statements of co-conspirators are not admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) until the proponent of the statement has made a prima facie showing of the existence of the conspiracy by independent proof. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, paragraph three of the syllabus. However, explicit findings of a conspiracy\u2019s existence need not be made on the record. <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 70, 723 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 101} Welch\u2019s statements to Shannon and Jordan were admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e). Hand\u2019s statements to his cellmate, Grimes, provided independent proof of the conspiracy\u2019s existence. See <em>State v. Duerr </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 396, 400, 8 OBR 511, 457 N.E.2d 834 (defendant\u2019s own statements can provide \u201cindependent proof\u2019 of the conspiracy). Hand called Welch a business partner and said he had hired Welch to kill his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 102} The facts show that by July 2001, Hand and Welch had entered into a conspiracy to murder Jill. During that period of time, Welch began asking Shannon whether he had a pistol so that Welch could kill Hand\u2019s wife. Welch\u2019s ongoing requests for a pistol and his conversations with Shannon about murdering Jill were within the scope of the conspiracy. Further, Welch\u2019s December 2000 and January 2001 jailhouse conversations with Jordan about the murder were also within the scope of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 103} Right to Confrontation. Hand contends that the admission of Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6) violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. In making this argument, Hand relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. However, we reject Hand\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">{\u00b6 104} In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that it is a violation of the Confrontation Clause to admit \u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Id. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (overruling <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, which held that statements from an unavailable witness may be admissible without violating the Confrontation Clause if the statements had been found to be reliable).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">{If 105} However, <em>Crawford </em>explicitly preserved the principle that an accused has forfeited his confrontation right where the accused\u2019s own misconduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>responsible for a witness\u2019s unavailability. Id. at 62, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (\u201c[t]he rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means of determining reliability\u201d). See, also, <em>Reynolds v. United States </em>(1879), 98 U.S. 145, 158, 25 L.Ed. 244 (if a witness is unavailable because of the defendant\u2019s own misconduct, \u201che is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 106} The trial court\u2019s preliminary determination that Welch\u2019s statements were admissible included a finding that Hand killed Welch to eliminate him as a potential witness. Indeed, Hand admitted to Grimes that he killed Welch to achieve that purpose (i.e., prevent him from being a witness against him). Thus, Hand forfeited his right to confront Welch because his own misconduct caused Welch\u2019s unavailability. See <em>United States v. Garcia-Meza </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 403 F.3d 364, 369-370 (defendant forfeited his right to confront his wife because his wrongdoing \u2014 i.e., his murder of her \u2014 was responsible for her unavailability).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 107} Finally, the admission of Welch\u2019s statements on the basis of Evid.R. 804(B)(3), Evid.R. 803(3), or Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) would not violate Hand\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, because he killed Welch and thereby made him unavailable to testify. Such waiver by misconduct is consistent with <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Indeed, <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>affirmation of the \u201cessentially equitable grounds\u201d for the rule of forfeiture shows that the rule\u2019s applicability does not hinge on the evidentiary basis for the testimony\u2019s admissibility. Id. at 62, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. See <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370-371; <em>United States v. Thompson </em>(C.A.7, 2002), 286 F.3d 950, 963, citing <em>United States v. Cherry </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 217 F.3d 811, 820 (applying waiver-by-misconduct rule to co-conspirator).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 108} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition of law I.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 109} <em>Other evidentiary issues. </em>In proposition of law II, Hand argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly mentioned evidence of Hand\u2019s fraudulent business practices and improperly presented \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Hand also argues that the trial court failed to provide the jury with adequate limiting instructions. However, except where mentioned, the defense failed to object and waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 110} 1. Mentioning fraudulent business practices during closing argument. Allen Peterson, Hand\u2019s accountant, prepared the corporate income tax returns for Hand\u2019s radiator business and testified that the business suffered financial losses for a number of years before going out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>{\u00b6 111} The defense objected to evidence of Hand\u2019s tax returns as irrelevant and moved to strike Peterson\u2019s entire testimony. In overruling the defense objection, the trial court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: \u201cExhibits that were admitted, being the tax returns from yesterday, those are admitted solely for showing a motive. They are not to be construed * * * in any other way, for any other purpose, such as how record keeping may have taken place, strictly on that sole issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 112} Hand testified in his own behalf and stated that he paid Welch and Adams \u201ccash under the table\u201d to avoid paying withholding taxes and to avoid a paper trail. Hand also admitted that he had not filed a personal federal income tax return for at least 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 113} During the closing argument, the prosecutor reviewed evidence of Hand\u2019s business practices and made the following argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cAnd did you catch his statement * * * about he and his father like to save on their taxes by paying employees under the table in cash? We all know that tax avoidance is common in this country, but what he calls saving on taxes is actually fraud. The fact that he so breezily engaged in that kind of behavior * * * <em>tells us much about his respect for the law and his willingness to lie and deceive. </em>This wasn\u2019t just a rinky-dink, every once in a while practice, that the defendant engaged in during the slow season of his business. Exhibit 275, prepared by Detective Otto, indicates that the defendant billed more than one hundred thousand dollars fraudulently to his own business on his own credit cards. <em>This was fraud on a massive scale, and it exemplifies the way in which this man operates.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">{\u00b6 115} Hand concedes that evidence of his financial situation was proper to prove motive. However, Hand contends that the prosecutor improperly argued that his illegal business practices showed that he did not hesitate to violate the law in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">{\u00b6 116} The prosecution is entitled to significant latitude in its closing remarks. The prosecutor may comment on \u201c \u2018what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293, quoting <em>State v. Stephens </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82, 53 O.O.2d 182, 263 N.E.2d 773. As to defense witnesses, including the defendant, the prosecutor may comment upon their testimony and suggest the conclusions to be drawn therefrom. The prosecutor may state that \u201cthe evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant is not telling the truth, is scheming, or has ulterior motives for not telling the truth.\u201d See <em>State v. Finkes </em>(Mar. 28, 2002), Franklin App. No. 01AP-310, 2002 WL 464998, *9; <em>State v. Draughn </em>(1992), 76 Ohio App.3d 664, 670, 602 N.E.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>{\u00b6 117} Hand\u2019s credibility was at issue because he testified in his own defense. The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Hand\u2019s behavior as fraud and his argument that Hand\u2019s illegal business practices showed his \u201cwillingness to lie and deceive\u201d represented fair comment on Hand\u2019s credibility. However, the argument that Hand committed \u201cfraud on a massive scale, and it exemplifies the way in which this man operates\u201d represented an overly broad comment on Hand\u2019s character. Nevertheless, we find no plain error in view of the overwhelming evidence of Hand\u2019s guilt. Cf. <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 154-155, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">{\u00b6 118} 2. Reaction to wives\u2019 deaths. Hand contends that testimony about his reaction to news about Lori\u2019s and Jill\u2019s murder was improper \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Sam Womeldorf, a now retired Columbus homicide detective, was involved in the murder investigations of Donna and Lori. Womeldorf described Hand\u2019s demeanor after Hand was notified of Lori\u2019s death:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cA: In dealing with Bobby on the * * * death of his first wife, I noticed that Bobby carried on; he was not exactly honest with me * * * in particular things. * * * And I noticed that when Bobby came this time, he was very similar to the first time, he carried on, and * * * stomping and * * * demanding to go in the house and the same thing he did on the other one. And you would think he was crying, however, * * * \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 120} \u201cMr. Sherman: I\u2019m going to object. This is all opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">(\u00b6 121} \u201cThe Court: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 122} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cA: I noticed he wasn\u2019t crying; there were no tears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">{\u00b6 124} Evid.R. 701, which governs opinion testimony by lay witnesses, provides: \u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">{\u00b6 125} Womeldorfs testimony satisfied both requirements of Evid.R. 701. Womeldorf personally observed Hand\u2019s demeanor, and the lack of grief was relevant in showing Hand\u2019s strange reaction after learning that Lori had been killed. See <em>State v. Griffin, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-020084, 2003-Ohio-3196, 2003 WL 21414664, \u00b6 37-38 (testimony that defendant \u201cbegan to cry and sob, but there were no tears\u201d admissible as lay opinion); cf. <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 463, 705 N.E.2d 329 (testimony that witness appeared \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cnot able to think\u201d admissible as lay opinion). We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony. See <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>{If 126} Hand also claims that Abel Gonzalez, Hand\u2019s son-in-law, improperly testified that Hand failed to show remorse following Jill\u2019s death. Two to three weeks after Jill\u2019s death, Abel talked to Hand about Jill\u2019s estate. During his testimony, Abel was asked about Hand\u2019s demeanor:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 127} \u201cQ: What was his demeanor when you had this conversation with him?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cA: It was just a matter of fact. It was more like just a business conversation, let\u2019s say.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cQ: Did he ever say he missed Jill?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 130} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">{\u00b6 131} \u201cQ: Did he act sad about what had happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">{\u00b6 132} \u201cA: I can\u2019t say he was sad; no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">{\u00b6 133} Hand\u2019s emotional reaction two to three weeks after Jill\u2019s death was of questionable relevance. However, we find that Gonzalez\u2019s testimony did not constitute outcome-determinative plain error in view of the compelling evidence of Hand\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">{\u00b6 134} 3. Sex-related testimony. At trial, Womeldorf testified that Hand told him: \u201c[Lori] was cold and he was a horny old man. * * * [He] wanted sex at least once a night and she didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Hand argues that this testimony was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">{\u00b6 135} The admission of Hand\u2019s statement about his sexual relations with Lori was a matter of relevancy. Evid.R. 401 provides: \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d We find that testimony about Hand\u2019s frequent desire for sex and his wife\u2019s lack of that interest was relevant as a possible motive for Lori\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">{\u00b6 136} Hand also argues that testimony that he was infatuated with Barbara McKinney\u2019s daughter was improper other-acts evidence. Barbara\u2019s testimony included the following questioning:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">{\u00b6 137} \u201cQ: Did you ever see Lonnie Welch and Bob Hand get together when you lived at the home on King Edward Avenue?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">{\u00b6 138} \u201cA: Bob Hand used to come to our house and pick Lonnie up frequently. And he also had an infatuation, I guess, for my youngest daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">{\u00b6 139} Barbara\u2019s nonresponsive remark was harmless, and her testimony was not repeated. Given the overwhelming evidence of Hand\u2019s guilt, we find that this isolated remark did not result in outcome-determinative plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-19\">{\u00b6 140} 4. Interest in \u201ctrue crime\u201d stories. Hand also claims that testimony that he read \u201ctrue crime\u201d stories was improperly admitted. William Bowe, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>childhood friend of Hand, testified, \u201c[W]hen we [were] younger,\u201d Hand liked to read about \u201cthe perfect crime and stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">{\u00b6 141} Hand\u2019s childhood interest in crime stories was only marginally relevant in showing that Hand may have used information about police work to manipulate the crime scene at his Delaware home. However, we find that the testimony did not result in outcome-determinative plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 142} 5. Forcing his father out of business and Hand\u2019s obsession with money. Hand contends that the state improperly introduced evidence that he forced his father out of his radiator business and was obsessed with money. Bowe worked for ten years at Hand\u2019s radiator shop. During his testimony, Bowe explained why he left the shop:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 143} \u201cQ: And you said you worked there about ten years, until 1980, I gather?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 144} \u201cA: Yeah; * * * he bought the building\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 145} \u201cQ: You mean\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 146} \u201cA: Bob.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">{\u00b6 147} \u201cQ: Okay; the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">{\u00b6 148} \u201cA: He kicked his dad out of there.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">{\u00b6 149} \u201cQ: What do you mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">{\u00b6 150} \u201cA: Well, I don\u2019t know. They had an argument or something, and the next thing I know, he\u2019s smashing the windows out of the shop and said you got three days to move out of here.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">{\u00b6 151} \u201cQ: Who is he saying that to?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">{\u00b6 152} \u201cA: To his dad.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">{\u00b6 153} \u201cQ: I see.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">{\u00b6 154} \u201cA: So we did move, and I went with his dad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">{\u00b6 155} This evidence established that Hand took over the radiator business and then hired Welch to work for him. Testimony that Hand fired his father and gave him three days to leave the shop was of highly questionable relevance. But we find that the evidence did not result in outcome-determinative plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-19\">{\u00b6 156} Hand also argues that testimony that he was obsessed with money was improperly introduced. Here, Bowe testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-20\">{\u00b6 157} \u201cQ: * * * Do you have any knowledge about the defendant\u2019s views toward money, finances?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-21\">{\u00b6 158} \u201cA: No; everybody knows Bob, and that\u2019s been his big thing in life is how much money he can get in his pocket. He\u2019s a money person.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-22\">{\u00b6 159} \u201cQ: And why do you say that?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 160} \u201cA: Ever since we was kids, * * * his quest in life is money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">{\u00b6 161} We find that Bowe\u2019s opinion testimony was admissible under Evid.R. 701 because it was based upon his lifelong relationship with Hand, and Bowe\u2019s opinion helped to explain Hand\u2019s financial motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 162} 6. Limiting instructions. Hand argues that the trial court erred by not providing limiting instructions on the admissibility <em>of </em>\u201cother acts\u201d evidence. As discussed earlier, the trial court provided the jury with limiting instructions on the consideration of Hand\u2019s tax returns. However, the defense did not request any further limiting instructions at the end of the guilt-phase evidence. Hand\u2019s failure to request such instructions waived all but plain error. In any event, nothing suggests that the jury used other-acts evidence to convict Hand on the theory that he was a bad person. Thus, we find that the trial court\u2019s failure to give further limiting instructions did not constitute plain error. See <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 472, 620 N.E.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 163} Based on the foregoing, proposition of law II is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 164} <em>Joinder of escape charge. </em>In proposition of law III, Hand contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever Count Six, the escape charge, from the rest of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 165} Under Crim.R. 8(A), two or more offenses may be charged together if the offenses \u201care of the same or similar character * * * or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d In fact, \u201c[t]he law favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial under Crim.R. 8(A) if the offenses charged \u2018are of the same or similar character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, citing <em>State v. Torres </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 166} A defendant requesting severance has the \u201cburden of furnishing the trial court with sufficient information so that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. A defendant claiming error in the denial of severance must affirmatively show that his rights were prejudiced and that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing separate trials. Id. Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to sever. Nor was Hand prejudiced by the joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">{\u00b6 167} First, Hand\u2019s participation in the escape attempt was evidence of flight and was admissible as tending to show his consciousness of guilt. Indeed, an accused\u2019s \u201c \u2018flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Eaton </em>(1969), 19 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>St.2d 145, 160, 48 O.O.2d 188, 249 N.E.2d 897, quoting 2 Wigmore on Evidence (3d Ed.1979) 111, Section 276; see, also, 1 Giannelli &amp; Snyder, Evidence (2d Ed.2001) 167-170, Section 401.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 168} The defense did not challenge instructions on evidence of flight at trial. However, Hand now contends that his minimal participation in the escape attempt would not have been admissible as evidence of flight if he had had a separate murder trial. We reject that argument because Hand was actively involved.in the escape attempt. Beverly testified that Hand served as a lookout when Beverly was sawing through the cell bars, Hand provided advice on how to cut through the metal bars, and Hand talked to Beverly about alternative ways of escaping. Moreover, Grimes testified that Hand and Beverly devised a plan to escape through the front of the cell block. Under this plan, Hand would \u201csidetrack the nurses and guards and Mr. Beverly would go and apprehend one of the guards * * * and they would go through the front door, because time was getting near for both of them, and the door wasn\u2019t ready to come through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 169} Hand also argues that joinder was not justified, because more than nine months elapsed between the murders (January 15, 2002) and the escape attempt (October 30, 2002, through November 26, 2002). However, admissibility of evidence of flight does not depend upon how much time passes between the offense and the defendant\u2019s flight. See <em>State v. Alexander </em>(Feb. 26, 1987), Cuyahoga App. No. 51784, 1987 WL 7079, *2. Indeed, flight on the eve of trial can carry the same inference of guilt as flight from the scene. Id. Here, Hand\u2019s escape attempt occurred while pretrial hearings were underway. Thus, this argument also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 170} Finally, the evidence of Hand\u2019s guilt is \u201camply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 344, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. In this case, circumstantial evidence, forensic testimony, Welch\u2019s statements, and Hand\u2019s own statements proved Hand\u2019s guilt of the murders. Additionally, Grimes\u2019s and Beverly\u2019s testimony provided independent evidence of Hand\u2019s guilt of escape. Thus, the strength of the state\u2019s proof \u201cestablishes that the prosecution did not attempt to prove one case simply by questionable evidence of other offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 187, 552 N.E.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 171} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition of law III.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 172} <em>Sufficiency of the evidence of escape. </em>In proposition of law IV, Hand challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction of escape in Count Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 173} In reviewing a claim of\u25a0 insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 174} Hand argues that the evidence of escape was insufficient because there was no evidence that he planned the unsuccessful escape attempt or directly assisted in cutting the locks or hiding the tools. Hand also contends that the testimony that he was acting as a lookout, if true, was insufficient to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 175} The record refutes Hand\u2019s claims. Testimony showed that Hand served as a lookout when Beverly was sawing through the cell bars, provided advice to Beverly on cutting through the cell bars, and helped devise an alternative plan to escape through the front door of the jail. Moreover, circumstantial evidence supported Hand\u2019s guilt. This evidence consisted of some torn-up tee-shirt material and a pencil \"with a piece of tee-shirt tied around it found in Hand\u2019s cell after the aborted escape attempt. According to Delaware County Detective Brian Blair, \u201c[t]hese pieces of cloth are consistent to what was tied to the saw blades and it\u2019s consistent to what inmates do to hide things * * * so they can be easily accessed by pulling on this after tying something to it, i.e., saw blades.\u201d Thus, the evidence established that Hand actively participated in the escape attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">(\u00b6 176} Finally, even assuming that the evidence established only that Hand was acting as a lookout, Hand was an accomplice in the attempted escape. See <em>State v. Lett, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 46, 2005-Ohio-1308, 825 N.E.2d 1158, \u00b6 29, citing <em>State v. Trocodaro </em>(1973), 36 Ohio App.2d 1, 5, 65 O.O.2d 1, 301 N.E.2d 898 (aiding and abetting established by overt acts such as serving as a lookout). Under R.C. 2923.03(F), an accomplice \u201cshall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Bies, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 325, 658 N.E.2d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 177} Based on the foregoing evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that sufficient evidence supports Hand\u2019s conviction for escape. Thus, we overrule proposition of law IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">{\u00b6 178} <em>Amended bill of particulars. </em>In proposition of law V, Hand argues that the trial court erred in permitting the state to amend the bill of particulars at the close of the evidence and to argue that Hand was a complicitor. He also argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on complicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">{\u00b6 179} Before trial, the state provided the defense with a bill of particulars that set forth in Count One that \u201con or about the 15th day of January, 2002, the Defendant did, purposefully and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of Jill J. Hand by means of a firearm.\u201d On May 28, 2003, at the close of the evidence and prior to final instructions, the state provided the defense with an amended bill of particulars. The amendment to Count One stated that Hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>killed Jill \u201cby firing that weapon himself, or by soliciting or procuring Walter \u2018Lonnie\u2019 Welch to commit the offense, and in either case, the defendant acted purposely and with prior calculation and design.\u201d The defense objected to the proposed complicity instructions because of the late notice of complicity in the amended bill of particulars. Thereafter, the trial court instructed the jury on complicity to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">{\u00b6 180} Crim.R. 7(E) states: \u201c[Upon timely request or court order], the prosecuting attorney shall furnish the defendant with a bill of particulars setting up specifically the nature of the offense charge and of the conduct of the defendant alleged to constitute the offense. A bill of particulars may be amended at any time subject to such conditions as justice requires.\u201d Crim.R. 7(D) authorizes the court to amend a bill of particulars \u201cbefore, during, or after a trial,\u201d provided that \u201cno change is made in the name or identity of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 181} Hand argues that because the original bill of particulars indicated that he was the principal offender on Count One, he lacked notice that the trial court would instruct on complicity on that count. However, this claim lacks merit. R.C. 2923.03(F) states: \u201cA charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in terms of the principal offense.\u201d This provision adequately notifies defendants that the jury may be instructed on complicity, even when the charge is drawn in terms of the principal offense. See <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 151, 689 N.E.2d 929, citing <em>Hill v. Perini </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 788 F.2d 406, 407-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 182} Additionally, for the amendment to constitute reversible error, Hand must demonstrate that the amendment hampered his defense or prejudiced him. See <em>State v. Chinn </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 548, 569, 709 N.E.2d 1166. Hand fails to point out how he could have defended himself differently, given notice that complicity would also be an issue as to Count One. From the beginning of the police investigation into Jill\u2019s murder, Hand claimed that he was not involved in Jill\u2019s murder. Hand asserted that Welch was an intruder into his home and that Welch shot Jill. Hand\u2019s denial of involvement in Jill\u2019s murder would not have changed the main thrust of his defense regardless of whether the state proceeded on the theory that Hand was the principal or a complicitor. See <em>State v. Herring </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 251, 762 N.E.2d 940 (rejecting defense claims of prejudice from late notice of the state\u2019s complicity theory). Thus, we find that Hand\u2019s claims of prejudice are speculative and lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 183} Moreover, we reject Hand\u2019s complaint about lack of notice because Hand did not request a continuance upon receiving the amended bill of particulars. Clearly, the defense could have requested a continuance if counsel needed additional time to prepare a defense to the complicity theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>{\u00b6 184} In sum, Hand was not misled or prejudiced by the state\u2019s notification of complicity in the amended bill of particulars. Moreover, the trial court did not err in instructing on complicity. Thus, proposition of law V is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 185} <em>Course-of-conduct instructions. </em>In proposition of law VI, Hand argues that the course-of-conduct instruction was defective in failing to specify the names of the murder victims covered by the specification. He also attacks the course-of-conduct instruction as unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 186} 1. Constitutional challenge. \u201cThe course-of-conduct specification set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) is not void for vagueness under either the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 533 N.E.2d 701, syllabus. Accord <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144; <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 155, 661 N.E.2d 1030. We find no basis to overturn that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 187} 2. Trial court\u2019s course-of-conduct instruction. The bill of particulars specified that the course of conduct set forth in Specification One of Count One and Count Two involved the murders of \u201cJill J. Hand and Walter M. \u2018Lonnie\u2019 Welch, and the course of conduct began and ended on January 15, 2002.\u201d The guilt-phase instructions on course of conduct in Specification One of Count One stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 188} \u201cBefore you can find the defendant guilty of Specification One, under the first count of the indictment, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravated murder of Jill [J.] Hand was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 189} The guilt-phase instructions on course of conduct in Specification One of Count Two stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">{\u00b6 190} \u201cBefore you can find the defendant guilty of Specification One, under the second count of the indictment, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravated murder of Walter Lonnie Welch was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">{\u00b6 191} The defense never objected to either of these instructions and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">{\u00b6 192} First, Hand complains about the lack of guidance for determining whether two or more murders occurred as part of a course of conduct. However, after the completion of briefing in this case, we decided <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, which sets forth a test for course of conduct: \u201cThe statutory phrase \u2018course of conduct\u2019 found in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) requires that the state <em>establish some factual link </em>between the aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>murder with which the defendant is charged and the other murders or attempted murders that are alleged to make up the course of conduct. In order to find that two offenses constitute a single course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), the trier of fact \u2018must * * * discern some connection, common scheme, or some pattern or psychological thread that ties [the offenses] together.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at the syllabus, quoting <em>State v. Cummings </em>(1992), 332 N.C. 487, 510, 442 S.E.2d 692. Moreover, \u201cthe factual link might be one of time, location, murder weapon, or cause of death.\u201d <em>Sapp </em>at \u00b6 52. Ultimately, \u201cwhen two or more offenses are alleged to constitute a course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), all the circumstances of the offenses must be taken into account.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 193} The facts surrounding the murders of Jill and Welch meet Sapp\u2019s criteria for course of conduct. The two murders occurred at the same time and place, and Hand had related motives for the murders. Hand\u2019s motive in murdering Jill was to collect her life insurance and pay off his massive debts. Hand\u2019s motive in murdering Welch was to eliminate the witness against him for Jill\u2019s murder and the murders of his previous two wives. Thus, the two offenses were related by time, place, and motive and establish a single course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 194} Second, Hand contends that the instructions were deficient by failing to specify Jill\u2019s and Welch\u2019s murders as the subject of the course-of-conduct specifications. Hand argues that this lack of specificity resulted in prejudicial error because the jury might have also considered Donna\u2019s and Lori\u2019s murders as part of the course of conduct. The two course-of-conduct specifications accompanied the murder counts for Jill\u2019s and Welch\u2019s murders. However, there were no murder counts for Donna\u2019s and Lori\u2019s murders. Under these circumstances, the jury was not misled and could reasonably find that the course-of-conduct related only to Jill\u2019s and Welch\u2019s murders. Thus, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 195} Moreover, there was no risk that the defense suffered any prejudicial error. During the penalty-phase instructions, the trial court advised the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 196} \u201cThe aggravating circumstance that you shall consider as to Count One of the indictment involving the death of Jill Hand is that this offense was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of Jill J. Hand and Walter Lonnie Welch by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 197} Thus, the penalty-phase instructions clearly stated that Jill\u2019s and Welch\u2019s murders were the subject of the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance. See <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (\u201c[i]t is presumed that the jury will follow the instructions given to it by the judge\u201d). Thus, there was no risk that the jury sentenced Hand to death for the murders of Donna and Lori.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 198} In sum, we find no outcome-determinative plain error, and proposition of law VI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">{\u00b6 199} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In proposition of law VII, Hand raises numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel \u201crequires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 200} 1. Voir dire of Juror Lombardo. Hand claims that his counsel were ineffective for failing to explore the bias of Juror Lombardo, a seated juror, and strike her from the jury. However, \u201c \u2018[t]he conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cornwell, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 568, 715 N.E.2d 1144, quoting <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Moreover, \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 201} Hand contends that his counsel failed to explore Juror Lombardo\u2019s bias after she disclosed that her husband had worked with Jill Hand. Juror Lombardo stated that her husband, an investigator with the Ohio Attorney General, \u201chad worked with [Jill] on and off for about 12 years. She was with DMV [Division of Motor Vehicles] and * * * he had an investigation regarding the DMV.\u201d Thereafter, Juror Lombardo was asked whether she would be able to fairly consider the testimony of witnesses who worked with the Attorney General\u2019s Office. Juror Lombardo stated that she would \u201clisten to their testimony separate from [her] husband\u2019s work, absolutely.\u201d Juror Lombardo also assured counsel that \u201c[i]t would not be difficult at all\u201d to separate what happens at trial from her husband. Thus, counsel did question Juror Lombardo about her bias, and her responses indicated that her husband\u2019s job would not influence her performance as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 202} Hand also argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to inquire further about the death of Juror Lombardo\u2019s daughter. This segment of voir dire occurred as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 203} \u201cMr. Cline: In the course of listening to whatever comments were made, how did you feel about what you were hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 204} \u201cMs. Lombardo: Well, I lost a daughter in the past and I pretty much went through a lot of stuff. I felt very sad, but I really didn\u2019t pursue it. I just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>really have a yearning to know more about it. Of course, I had feelings about it, sadness. I would still need to know more about what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">{\u00b6 205} \u201cMr. Cline: On your questionnaire, the question was asked if you had started to form any opinions and I think you marked, \u2018Not sure.\u2019 Then your next comment was, \u2018Mr. Hand is entitled to a fair and just trial.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 206} \u201cMs. Lombardo: He absolutely is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 207} Hand argues that Ms. Lombardo\u2019s response about her daughter\u2019s death raised issues of potential bias that his counsel was obligated to pursue. However,, Hand\u2019s claim of potential bias is speculative. Juror Lombardo had earlier assured the court that she could decide the case solely upon the evidence and agreed to set aside her personal beliefs and follow the law in deciding the case. Moreover, the follow-up question eliciting Juror Lombardo\u2019s reaffirmation that Hand was entitled to a fair trial diminished the likelihood that her daughter\u2019s death was a potential source of bias. Given these circumstances, we find that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to question Juror Lombardo any further about the loss of her daughter, a very personal issue, was a proper exercise of discretionary judgment. See <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 490, 721 N.E.2d 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 208} Finally, Hand argues that his counsel were deficient in failing to challenge Juror Lombardo for bias after she disclosed that she had witnessed workplace violence. About 30 years earlier, Juror Lombardo had seen her boss confront an intruder where she worked. She later learned that her boss had shot the man. Juror Lombardo was a witness in the subsequent murder trial, and her testimony supported the jury\u2019s decision that her boss had acted in self-defense. During a follow-up question, the trial counsel asked Juror Lombardo, \u201cDo you believe that a person who has been put in danger, or his life is threatened should have the right to defend himself or herself?\u201d Juror Lombardo answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 209} Here, Juror Lombardo\u2019s views about self-defense were favorable to the defense because Hand claimed that he killed Welch in self-defense. Thus, we reject Hand\u2019s claim that his counsel were ineffective by failing to challenge Juror Lombardo for cause or peremptorily because of her prior experience with workplace violence. See <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 54-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 210} 2. Failure to call a defense witness. Hand also argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to call Phillip Anthony, Welch\u2019s cousin, as a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 211} During the evidentiary hearing on the admissibility of Welch\u2019s statements, Anthony testified that sometime during 1986 or 1987, Welch admitted killing Donna and Lori. Welch also told Anthony that he had \u201csnuck into a basement window and that all the doors and windows in the house were sealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and locked, * * * and made the second murder identical to the first.\u201d Retired Police Detective Sam Womeldorf, the investigator of Donna\u2019s death, had earlier testified that the basement \u201cwindows were locked on the inside. It appeared that no entry was made through either of these windows.\u201d Retired Police Lieutenant Robert Britt, who had been an investigator into Lori\u2019s death, also testified that the basement windows were locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 212} The trial court ruled that Anthony\u2019s testimony was admissible, but the state decided not to call Anthony as a witness. However, Hand argues that his counsel were deficient in not calling Anthony as a witness, because Welch\u2019s statements contradicted police testimony that the basement windows were not the entry point for the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 213} \u201cGenerally, counsel\u2019s decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749; <em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 82. Welch\u2019s statement to Anthony that he entered the basement window to kill Donna and Lori appears to contradict police testimony. However, Anthony\u2019s testimony would have also strengthened the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 214} During the evidentiary hearing, Anthony testified that Welch discussed the plans to kill Jill. During the first two weeks of January 2002, Welch asked Anthony to find him a gun. Anthony testified that Welch said he needed a gun, explaining, \u201c \u2018[T]he guy I did that thing for * * * said he wants me to do another one.\u2019 \u201d Welch told him, \u201cI need this [gun] now * * * I can\u2019t wait a week, I can\u2019t wait a day, I really need this now, I\u2019ve got something to do.\u201d On the night before the murders, Welch asked whether Anthony had found him a gun, and Anthony told him no. Welch expressed his unease about meeting Hand and asked Anthony for a ride to Hand\u2019s house to \u201cwatch [his] back a little bit.\u201d Welch indicated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going up there to kill nobody. The deal was * * * they were going up there to iron it out. How much, where, how, when, type of situation.\u201d Thus, Welch was \u201cplanning to go up, talk to Mr. Hand, iron out all the specifics of the murder, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 215} Trial counsel were not deficient by choosing not to call Anthony as a defense witness even though some of his testimony might have helped the defense case. Welch\u2019s comments to Anthony showed a sense of urgency to obtain a weapon to murder Jill that was not otherwise in evidence. Moreover, Welch\u2019s statements show that he did not intend to murder Jill when he went to Hand\u2019s home on the evening of January 15. Anthony\u2019s testimony undermined Hand\u2019s claim that Welch was an intruder who entered his home and murdered his wife. Such testimony would have contradicted Hand\u2019s self-defense theory. Thus, trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>counsel made a legitimate tactical decision to not call Anthony as a defense witness. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 216} 3. Failure to object to Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e). Hand argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to argue that Welch\u2019s statements to friends and family members were not admissible as statements of a co-conspirator until the prosecutor had made a prima facie case showing the existence of the conspiracy by independent proof. However, as we discussed in proposition of law I, Welch\u2019s statements were properly admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(6). Thus, Hand suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 217} 4. Failure to object to other-acts evidence and argument. Hand also argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to object to testimony about Hand\u2019s reaction to Jill\u2019s death, that Hand forced his father out of business, that Hand was obsessed with money, that he enjoyed reading true-crime stories, and that he was infatuated with Barbara McKinney\u2019s daughter. Further, Hand argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument that his illegal business practices showed his propensity to commit the charged offenses. However, as we discussed in proposition of law II, Hand was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to any of this testimony or the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 218} 5. Failure to present evidence of self-defense at evidentiary hearing. Hand contends that his counsel were deficient in failing to present evidence of self-defense during the evidentiary hearings on the admissibility of Welch\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6). Hand argues that such evidence was necessary to show that Welch\u2019s unavailability was not due to Hand\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 219} During the evidentiary hearing, Grimes testified that when Hand first discussed the murders, Hand said that he was \u201cgoing to plead, self-defense.\u201d Subsequently, Hand\u2019s story changed, and he admitted to \u201coffing them both * * * [because] anybody that messed with him would disappear.\u201d Thus, it is highly speculative whether the defense presentation of additional evidence of self-defense would have made any difference in the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of Welch\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 220} Moreover, it is almost certain that Hand would have had to testify to raise the issue of self-defense during the evidentiary hearing. The record does not show whether Hand or his counsel made the decision to forgo Hand\u2019s testimony during the evidentiary hearing. However, if Hand made the decision, he has no grounds to attack his counsel\u2019s effectiveness. If it was counsel\u2019s decision, then counsel made a tactical decision that should not be second-guessed. Indeed, trial counsel could have reasonably decided not to put Hand on the stand so that the prosecutor could not cross-examine Hand and learn details of his defense. Thus, we find that trial counsel made a legitimate tactical decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>not presenting additional evidence of self-defense during the evidentiary hearing. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373; see, also, <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 29-32 (failure to file motion to suppress pretrial statements constituted \u201ctactical judgment\u201d and not ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6221} 6. Failure to request jury instructions. Hand argues that his counsel were deficient in failing to request a limiting instruction regarding \u201cother acts\u201d evidence and by failing to request a jury instruction defining \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d As we discussed in connection with proposition of law II, Hand was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request limiting instructions on \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Similarly, as we discussed in proposition of law VI, Hand was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to submit an instruction defining \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 222} In conclusion, none of Hand\u2019s claims establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and we overrule proposition of law VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>Penalty-phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 223} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In proposition of law VIII, Hand argues that his counsel were ineffective in presenting mitigation evidence and argument through failure to (1) investigate or prepare for mitigation, (2) develop a reasonable mitigation strategy, (3) present adequate mitigating evidence, (4) object to the readmission of guilt-phase evidence, and (5) present a closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">{\u00b6 224} 1. Failure to investigate and prepare for mitigation. Hand contends that his counsel failed to spend sufficient time preparing for the penalty phase of the trial. Hand argues that his counsel\u2019s billing sheets show that counsel spent fewer than 30 hours preparing for mitigation, family members were not. interviewed until the day before the start of the trial\u2019s penalty phase, and his counsel filed an insufficient number of pretrial motions relative to mitigation. However, we find no merit in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">{\u00b6 225} The presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy. <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 530, 684 N.E.2d 47. \u201cMoreover, \u2018strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 189, quoting <em>Wiggins v. Smith </em>(2003), 539 U.S. 510, 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">{\u00b6 226} Here, the defense employed a mitigation specialist, an investigator, and a psychologist. Each of these individuals began working on Hand\u2019s case several months before the penalty phase. The defense reviewed Hand\u2019s military records, his school records, and his medical records prior to the penalty phase. Dr. Davis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the defense psychologist, testified that \u201cone of the attorneys conducted extensive interviews of a variety of individuals who knew Mr. Hand and obtained background information.\u201d Thus, the record shows that the defense thoroughly prepared for the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 227} Hand\u2019s assertion that billing records show that his counsel spent fewer than 30 hours on mitigation appears to be based on billing records between May 30 (the date of the guilty verdict) and June 4 (the start of the mitigation hearing). Hand fails to recognize the time that his counsel, the mitigation specialist, the investigator, and his psychologist spent in preparing for mitigation before the end of the guilt-phase proceedings on May 30. Indeed, \u201cthe finding as to whether counsel was adequately prepared does not revolve solely around the amount of time counsel spends on the case or the numbers of days which he or she spends preparing for mitigation. Instead, this must be a case-by-case analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Lewis </em>(Fla.2002), 838 So.2d 1102, 1114, fn. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 228} Hand provides no evidence supporting his claim that his attorneys did not begin interviewing his family members until the day before the penalty phase. Defense records show that several months before trial Debra Gorrell, the mitigation specialist, contacted Hand\u2019s mother, his two sisters, and his son. Even assuming that his counsel did not interview family members until the day before the penalty phase, Hand fails to show what additional information family members could have provided earlier, or how such testimony could have aided him in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 229} We also reject Hand\u2019s argument that the lack of defense pretrial motions on mitigation shows that his counsel were ineffective. The defense filed pretrial motions to obtain Hand\u2019s childhood records with Franklin County Children Services, his military records, and his records as a Scoutmaster. Hand\u2019s counsel also filed a motion for penalty-phase instructions and proposed instructions on residual doubt. Finally, Hand fails to mention what additional motions his counsel should have submitted that would have made a difference in the outcome of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 230} 2. Failure to form a reasonable trial strategy. Hand claims that his counsel\u2019s trial strategy was ineffective by focusing on his \u201cfuture value behind bars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 231} Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, and reviewing courts should refrain from second-guessing tactical decisions of trial counsel. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 232} The trial counsel\u2019s strategy was to convince the jury that Hand should receive a life sentence by showing that he would be a model prisoner and would have value in prison society. The trial counsel emphasized that Hand\u2019s \u201cgot intelligence; he\u2019s got mechanical ability; he loves children; [and] Bobby can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>continue to be a source of support and guidance to his son, Robby, and his grandchildren.\u201d Trial counsel also pointed out that as a prisoner \u201c[h]e will not be a predator; he will not be a source of violence with respect to other inmates; * * * he has skills; he can work in the prison auto shop; he can teach other inmates mechanical skills, and then they can leave the system with a skill * * Finally, the defense argued that Hand\u2019s life should be spared on the basis of mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 233} In support of the defense strategy, Dr. Davis testified that Hand should do well in prison because he adjusted to the structured setting of the army, he has no prior criminal record, he has no substance-abuse problems, and he is older. Robert, his son, also testified that he would stay in contact with Hand in prison and continue to look to him for guidance. Finally, Hand said in an unsworn statement, \u201cIf allowed to live, I swear to each of you, I will be a model inmate; I will help anyone and everyone that I can help; I would devote my life to my son and his children; I will volunteer for any program to further the cause of man.\u201d The defense theory, although unsuccessful, was coherent and fit into the testimony of the witnesses. Thus, counsel made a \u201cstrategic trial decision\u201d in presenting the defense theory of mitigation, and such decision \u201ccannot be the basis for an ineffectiveness claim.\u201d <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 190; see, also, <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 234} Hand also argues that his counsel failed to form a reasonable mitigation strategy because of his counsel\u2019s unwillingness to spend more time in presenting the defense mitigation case. Hand points to counsel\u2019s remarks during his penalty-phase opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 235} \u201cThe mitigation evidence that we\u2019re about to present to you won\u2019t be very long. We\u2019ll be done in a couple of hours. I don\u2019t want to delay this case more than it needs to be, so I\u2019ve elected to tell you the things that I think you [ought] to think about now, rather than waiting until closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 236} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 237} \u201cNow, I\u2019ve been a lawyer for 30 years. Yes, I have been involved in a number of mitigation hearings. In some of those hearings, I presented evidence how the defendant was raised; if he was abused and neglected, if drugs were involved. But I\u2019m not going to insult you by telling you the events of Bobby\u2019s childhood led him to commit these offenses; that would be intellectually dishonest. I\u2019m not doing that. What we will be telling you and are telling you is that imposing a death sentence on Bobby, you\u2019re going to be saying, he has nothing left to give; he has nothing of value; he\u2019s an empty box with nothing for anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>{\u00b6 238} Trial counsel\u2019s comment about not delaying the case was a means of maintaining the defense\u2019s credibility and focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the mitigating factors supporting a life sentence. Indeed, the trial counsel\u2019s opening statement forcefully pointed out numerous mitigating factors that justified a life sentence. Trial counsel\u2019s remark about not relying on \u201cthe events of Bobby\u2019s childhood\u201d was also aimed at maintaining the defense\u2019s credibility during the penalty phase. We find that counsel\u2019s decision to present this theory of mitigation represented a legitimate \u201ctactical decision.\u201d See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 296, 754 N.E.2d 1150; See, also, <em>State v. Ballew </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 256, 667 N.E.2d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">{\u00b6 239} 3. Failure to adequately present mitigating evidence. Hand contends that his counsel were deficient by failing to present his mother and sister as witnesses, failing to present any witnesses from the army or evidence about his military service, failing to present any witnesses or evidence about his performance in school, and failing to present any witnesses or evidence from Franklin County Children Services. He also claims that his counsel were deficient in presenting his unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 240} However, \u201c[t]he decision to forgo the presentation of additional mitigating evidence does not itself constitute proof of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 536, 684 N.E.2d 47. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[attorneys need not pursue every conceivable avenue; they are entitled to be selective.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765, quoting <em>United States v. Davenport </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 986 F.2d 1047, 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 241} Dr. Davis\u2019s testimony presented information to the jury about Hand\u2019s military, education, and Franklin County Children Services records. Dr. Davis testified that Hand\u2019s father was an alcoholic and his parents were divorced when he was a child. Franklin County Children Services removed Hand from his home, but he was later reunited with his family. Dr. Davis also testified that Hand attended five different elementary schools, but left high school to join the army. He stated that Hand served in Vietnam and received an honorable discharge from the army. Robert Hand, the defendant\u2019s son, also testified in Hand\u2019s behalf. We find that counsel\u2019s decision not to call additional family members as mitigation witnesses was a \u201ctactical choice\u201d and did not result in .ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Ballew, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 256-257, 667 N.E.2d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 242} Finally, Hand argues that his counsel were deficient in presenting his unsworn statement because Hand\u2019s plea for a life sentence focused on his ability to serve as a model inmate. However, \u201cthe decision to give an unsworn statement is a tactical one, a call best made by those at the trial who can judge the tenor of the trial and the mood of the jury. * * * While subject to debate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that decision largely is a matter of style, and is a tactical decision that does not form the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 157, 661 N.E.2d 1030. Here, Hand\u2019s unsworn statement was consistent with the defense strategy to convince the jury that Hand should receive a life sentence because he would be a model prisoner and has future value to his family and prison society. Moreover, Hand fails to indicate any additional matters he might have presented in his unsworn statement and thus failed to show that any alleged deficiencies made any difference in the outcome of the case. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 243} 4. Failure to object to the readmission of guilt-phase evidence. Hand argues that, with the exception of the exhibits involving the escape charge, his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to the reintroduction of all guilt-phase exhibits. Hand does not specify which exhibits he believed prejudiced him. Moreover, counsel were not ineffective by failing to object to this evidence, because the reintroduction of guilt-phase evidence is permitted by R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 244} 5. Failure to make a closing argument. Hand also asserts that his counsel were ineffective by failing to present a penalty-phase closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 245} During his penalty-phase opening statement, counsel informed the jury, \u201cI\u2019ve elected to tell you the things that I think you [ought] to think about now, rather than waiting until closing arguments.\u201d The trial counsel then summarized the mitigating evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 246} \u201cThe evidence * * * will show you that Bobby does know how to live in orderly fashion behind prison walls: he\u2019s got intelligence; he\u2019s got mechanical ability; he loves children; that Bobby can continue to be a source of support and guidance to his son, Robby, and his grandchildren.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 247} - In his opening statement, counsel also made a plea for a life sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">{\u00b6 248} \u201cCollectively, we believe that [the penalty phase] will tell you Bobby is not a commodity, a useless commodity; he\u2019s a human being. Arid, although convicted of heinous crimes, we hope to show you that Bobby still can have value.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">{\u00b6 249} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">{\u00b6 250} \u201cRobby * * * by losing his - mother, he was a victim once and by sentencing his father to death, he would be a victim twice. * * * By a death verdict, not only are you going to be punishing Bobby, but you\u2019re going to be punishing Robby.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">{\u00b6 251} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>{\u00b6 252} \u201cBobby can conform to prison life. He will not be a predator; he will not be a source of violence with respect to other inmates; * * * He can teach other inmates mechanical skills, and then they can leave the system with a skill * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 253} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 254} \u201cI believe that if Bobby is given a life sentence, he would still be in a position to contribute to mankind.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 255} \u201cMr. Yost is right; I am going to be asking you to consider mercy as a mitigating factor because mercy is the dearest privilege that a person on this earth can be, is merciful. * * * I\u2019m asking you to consider mercy and to temper justice with mercy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 256} Here, the trial counsel\u2019s decision to present the defense case and plea for a life sentence during opening statement rather than closing argument represented a \u201ctactical decision\u201d that did not fall below an objective standard of reasonable representation. Moreover, waiving closing argument may have been a \u201ctactical decision\u201d made by the defense counsel to prevent the state from splitting closing argument and staging a strong rebuttal. See <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 47; <em>State v. Burke </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 399, 405, 653 N.E.2d 242. Finally, we find that Hand has failed to prove that a reasonable probability exists that his sentence would have been different had counsel made a closing argument. See <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">{\u00b6 257} For the foregoing reasons, we reject proposition of law VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">{\u00b6 258} <em>Instructions on readmitted evidence. </em>In proposition of law IX, Hand contends that the trial court erred by readmitting the guilt-phase evidence and then advising the jury to consider the \u201cevidence admitted in the trial phase that is relevant to the aggravating circumstance and to any of the mitigating factors.\u201d However, the defense failed to object to these instructions and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Moreover, the defense\u2019s proposed instructions included the language that he now contends was erroneous. Thus, Hand cannot complain, because he invited the error. <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 17, 564 N.E.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">{\u00b6 259} To the extent that the jury may have interpreted the instructions as allowing them to determine relevancy, the trial court erred. <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866. Nevertheless, much of the guilt-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors. Further, properly admitted evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 208. Thus, we find no plain error and reject proposition of law IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>Settled Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 260} <em>Residual doubt. </em>In proposition of law X, Hand contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on residual doubt as a mitigating factor violated his constitutional rights. However, we summarily reject that argument. See <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 160; <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 261} <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>In proposition of law XII, Hand challenges the constitutionality of the instructions on reasonable doubt during both phases of the trial. However, we have repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.05(D). See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163; <em>State v. Goff </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 132, 694 N.E.2d 916. Proposition of law XII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 262} <em>Constitutionality. </em>In proposition of law XIII, Hand attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. However, we also reject this claim. <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 263} Hand also argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international agreements to which the United States is a signatory. However, we have rejected similar arguments. See <em>State v. Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\n<em>Weighing the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">{\u00b6 264} In proposition of law XI, Hand argues that the death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. We shall address this argument during the independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">{\u00b6 265} <em>Aggravating circumstances. </em>The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Hand was properly convicted of a course of conduct in killing two or more people (Jill and Welch), R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), in Count One, and murder for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial or punishment for his complicity in the murders of Donna, Lori, and Jill Hand, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), in Count Two. Under Count Two, the trial court merged the R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>2929.04(A)(5) specification, the three R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specifications, and the two R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specifications into a single R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 266} However, Hand argues, in proposition of law XI, that we should not sentence him to death based on evidence that largely consists of Welch\u2019s hearsay statements. As we discussed in proposition I, Welch\u2019s hearsay statements were admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), and thus entitled to full consideration in weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 267} <em>Mitigation evidence. </em>Hand called three mitigation witnesses, made an unsworn statement, and introduced documentary evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 268} Dr. Daniel Davis, a psychologist, testified that Hand\u2019s \u201cfather was an alcoholic; there was considerable strife and potentially abuse between the husband and wife; * * * his father left the family; there was a divorce when he was a child.\u201d Because his mother was allegedly cohabiting with men in front of her children, Hand was removed from the home and \u201cplaced temporarily in * * * Franklin Village, which was a receiving center for Franklin County Children\u2019s Services. [The children] were * * * placed with an aunt and then returned back to the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">{\u00b6 269} Hand attended five elementary schools and attended high school, but then left school and joined the army. Dr. Davis testified that Hand did well in the army. Hand was trained in electronics, served in Vietnam, and received an honorable discharge. Hand then trained as an auto mechanic, worked at a radiator-repair shop, and later managed his own business on the west side of Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">{\u00b6 270} In the early 1990s, Hand was treated for multiple physical complaints and was deemed to have an anxiety disorder. Dr. Davis\u2019s testing \u201cconfirmed that he\u2019s a person that has a chronic depression and anxiety that shows itself primarily in physical symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">{\u00b6 271} Dr. Davis testified that Hand would function well in a structured environment because Hand has no other criminal record and performed well in the army. Hand is also reasonably intelligent, possesses vocational skills, and has no history of substance-abuse problems. Moreover, \u201cHand has qualities that could be drawn upon in a prison setting. Even in a maximum security setting, they have community service projects that are appropriate * * Hand is unlikely to pose a risk as a violent inmate because of his age, lack of history of assaults, and the absence of substance-abuse problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">{\u00b6 272} Frank Haberfield, past post commander and district commander of a Columbus American Legion post, testified that during the early 1990s, Hand was a Scoutmaster for a Boy Scout troop sponsored by his American Legion post. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Haberfield heard nothing bad about Hand as a Scoutmaster, and Hand seemed to care about the Scouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">{\u00b6 273} Robert Hand, the defendant\u2019s son, testified that Hand is \u201cthe only close family member [he\u2019s] ever had, the only one [he\u2019s] had to look up to, and to take care of [him].\u201d Robert\u2019s mother was Lori. However, Robert said his mother\u2019s family has \u201ckind of pushed [him] away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 274} Robert told the jury, \u201cI don\u2019t want him to die. I don\u2019t. He\u2019s the only thing I have to look up [to] and * * * guide me.\u201d Robert has maintained communication with Hand since he has been in jail. Hand has told Robert to be strong and has helped guide him through the trauma of the murders. Robert said that he and his son would \u201cmost definitely\u201d maintain contact with Hand if he were to receive a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 275} Hand\u2019s unsworn statement. Hand told the jury, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die. Like most men, I fear death. I\u2019ve always wanted my life to have a purpose. * * * The state says my life has no purpose no longer * * * and that I should be killed. I don\u2019t want to be useless even in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 276} Hand also said, \u201cTo kill me would end all that I am or that I could ever be, and to give me a life sentence will punish me in ways you can never imagine, but behind prison walls, I will be a man whose life is not useless. If allowed to live, I swear to each of you, I will be a model inmate; I will help anyone and everyone that I can help; I would devote my life to my son and his children; I will volunteer for any program to further the cause of man. I will do this not only for you, but for me. So that maybe in the eyes of God, I can right the wrong that I was * * * convicted of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\n<em>Sentence evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 277} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offenses to be mitigating. On January 15, 2002, Hand brutally murdered Jill and Welch as part of a course of conduct. Moreover, Hand murdered Welch to eliminate the primary witness against him for Hand\u2019s complicity in murdering Donna, Lori, and Jill Hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 278} Although Hand\u2019s character offers nothing in mitigation, his history and background provide some mitigating features. Hand had a disruptive childhood and appears to have been raised in a dysfunctional family. Hand provided lifelong support to his son, who continues to depend on him for guidance. He also served as his son\u2019s Scoutmaster. Hand has a long work record and served honorably in the military and in Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">{\u00b6 279} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>cation); (B)(3) (mental disease or defect); (B)(4) (youth of the offender; Hand was 52 at the time of the two murders); and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">{\u00b6 280} The R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) factor (lack of a significant criminal record) is entitled to significant weight in mitigation. The record discloses no history of criminal convictions. See <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 236, 690 N.E.2d 522 (absence of criminal record entitled to significant mitigating weight); <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 687, 687 N.E.2d 1358 (lack of substantial criminal record entitled to relatively significant weight). However, this factor is diminished by the evidence presented at trial that he may have committed two other murders, even though he escaped prosecution for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 281} We also give weight to mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). This evidence includes Hand\u2019s long work history, his honorable military service, his work as a Scoutmaster, and Robert\u2019s testimony that Hand has been a supporting and loving father. We also give some weight to evidence that Hand will adapt well to prison. <em>Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 397, 721 N.E.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 282} Finally, we give modest weight to testimony that Hand suffers from chronic depression and anxiety as a mitigating \u201cother factor.\u201d See <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 199 (defendant\u2019s depressive disorder entitled to some weight in mitigation). However, no evidence exists of any significant connection between Hand\u2019s mental disorders and his murders of Jill and Welch. Nor does the evidence suggest any other (B)(7) mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 283} We find that the aggravating circumstance under each count outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. As to Count One, Hand\u2019s course of conduct in killing Jill and Welch is a grave aggravating circumstance. As to Count Two, Hand\u2019s murder of Welch to eliminate the primary witness against him for his complicity in the murders of Donna, Lori, and Jill Hand is a very serious aggravating circumstance. In contrast, Hand offered no substantial mitigation to weigh against the aggravating circumstance in either Count One or Count Two. Thus, we find that the death penalty is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 284} Finally, we find that the death penalty in Count One is proportionate to death sentences approved for other course-of-conduct murders. <em>Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 203; <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 182; <em>State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 130. Furthermore, the death penalty in Count Two is appropriate when compared to death sentences approved for other murders to avoid detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 400-401, 659 N.E.2d 292; <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Ohio St.3d 336, 353, 595 N.E.2d 902; <em>State v.
