The candidates included appellant, Paul D. Harmon, appellee Craig Baldwin, and three other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 3} On November 22, 2004, appellee Licking County Board of Elections certified that Baldwin had received the highest number of votes among the five candidates \u2014 14,409\u2014and that Harmon had received the second highest vote total \u2014 14,198. Because the margin of victory was so small, R.C. 3515.011 required a recount. See R.C. 3515.011 (\u201cIf the number of votes cast in any county or municipal election for the declared winning * * * candidate * * * does not exceed the number of votes cast for the declared defeated * * * candidate * * * by a margin of one-half of one per cent or more of the total vote, the appropriate board of elections shall order a recount which shall be conducted as provided in sections 3515.04 and 3515.05 of the Revised Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 4} The board conducted the recount, and on December 8, 2004, it declared that Baldwin had beaten Harmon by a margin of 214 votes \u2014 14,413 to 14,199.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">{\u00b6 5} On December 15, 2004, Harmon filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Licking County pursuant to R.C. 3515.08 et seq. contesting the election. In his petition, Harmon alleged the following irregularities: (1) ballot-rotation errors, (2) the board\u2019s denial to him of the opportunity to examine ballot pages during the recount, and (3) significant undervotes and unexpectedly high votes for some candidates in some precincts. Harmon claimed that the number of votes affected by these irregularities was sufficient to either change or make uncertain the election result.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">{\u00b6 6} Harmon requested that the court of appeals set a hearing not more than 30 days thereafter, as required by R.C. 3515.10. Consistent with Harmon\u2019s request, the court of appeals set a hearing for January 12, 2005. Baldwin and the board answered the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">{\u00b6 7} Upon the joint motion of Harmon and the board to adjourn the hearing, the court of appeals rescheduled the hearing for February 8 and 9. The court of appeals also issued an agreed order permitting the parties to \u201cinspect the ballot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>pages and test the voting devices used at the polling places in Licking County at the November 2, 2004 general election.\u201d The inspection was to begin on January 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 8} During his opening statement at the beginning of the February 8 hearing on the election contest, Harmon claimed numerous irregularities, including many that were not alleged in his petition. When Baldwin objected to these new allegations, the court of appeals ruled that the evidence would be confined to Harmon\u2019s allegations in his election-contest petition. Harmon later moved to amend his petition to \u201cinclude all of the many irregularities * * * included in [the] opening statement.\u201d Harmon argued that the amendment should be allowed because his previous legal counsel, whom he had dismissed before trial, had drafted the petition, and there would be no surprise to Baldwin or the board of elections by allowing the amendment. Harmon then proffered evidence that he had received from the Secretary of State\u2019s office concerning the number of Votomatics<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> used by the board for the November 2, 2004 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals denied the motion for leave to amend based on the statutory timetable for election contests:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cWe believe we have to stay very close to the timetable and therefore a leave to amend would * * * cause a need for a continuance in order to fully defend against this and therefore we will deny it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 11} On February 11, Harmon moved for an order to compel Mary Jo Long, the former director of the board of elections, to appear at the hearing and testify. On that same date, Harmon moved the court to reconsider his request to allow an amendment of the petition to allege fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 12} On February 14, the court of appeals conducted the final day of the election-contest proceeding. At the hearing, the court of appeals denied Harmon\u2019s motions to compel and amend. The court of appeals also denied Harmon\u2019s oral request at the hearing \u201cto have'someone look at the votomatics to determine if the machines are full of chads and to what extent that may have contributed to an undervote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">{\u00b6 13} On February 17, the court of appeals denied Harmon\u2019s contest. The court of appeals found \u201cno clear and convincing evidence of any election irregularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">{\u00b6 14} This cause is now before the court upon Harmon\u2019s appeal as of right under R.C. 3515.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Procedural Rulings: Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 15} Harmon asserts that the court of appeals erred in several of its procedural rulings. He contends that the court of appeals should not have denied his motions for leave to amend his petition, to continue the case to permit further investigation of chads in the voting machines, and to compel the board\u2019s former director to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 16} The court of appeals \u2014 acting as a trial court in Harmon\u2019s election contest \u2014 had discretion to rule upon these motions, and the court\u2019s rulings will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Askew v. Goldhart </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 608, 610, 665 N.E.2d 200 (leave to amend a pleading); <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, \u00b6 44 (continuance); <em>State ex rel. Denton v. Bedinghaus, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 298, 2003-Ohio-861, 784 N.E.2d 99, \u00b6 31 (discovery matters); <em>Ohio Motor Vehicle Dealers Bd. v. Remlinger </em>(1983), 8 Ohio St.3d 26, 27, 8 OBR 337, 457 N.E.2d 309 (order to compel testimony). \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude.\u201d <em>Maschari v. Tone, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 411, 2004-Ohio-5342, 816 N.E.2d 579, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 17} With this standard governing our review of the court of appeals\u2019 rulings on Harmon\u2019s motions, we now consider these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 18} At trial, Harmon attempted to raise many claims of election irregularities that were not contained in his petition. Harmon\u2019s petition thus failed to fully comply with R.C. 3515.09, which requires that an election-contest petition \u201cset forth the grounds for such contest.\u201d See, also, <em>In re Election Contest of Democratic Primary Election Held May 4, 1999 for Nomination to the Office of Clerk, Youngstown Mun. Court </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 258, 264, 725 N.E.2d 271. Under R.C. 3515.11, however, the court of appeals was vested \u201cwith power to order or permit amendments.\u201d See, also, id.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">{\u00b6 19} For the following reasons, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion under R.C. 3515.11 by denying Harmon\u2019s motion for leave to amend. First, Harmon lacked a justifiable excuse for not raising most of these claims earlier. His specified justification at trial was simply that he had dismissed the attorney who had filed the petition. Because he had the opportunity to raise these claims earlier but did not do so, Harmon failed to exercise the promptness and utmost diligence normally required of persons instituting election cases. <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 477, 2004-Ohio-5532, 817 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 21. Second, election contests must be heard within a specified period of time, and this requirement is jurisdictional. <em>Helms v. Green, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 295, 2004-Ohio-2951, 809 N.E.2d 1141, \u00b6 6-7; R.C. 3515.10. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>court had granted Harmon\u2019s motion, it would have extended the trial so that appellees could properly defend against these newly pleaded claims. Third, although the court of appeals denied the motion to amend, it ultimately did decide the merits of Harmon\u2019s main additional claim, i.e., the alleged discrepancy between the parties\u2019 figures on the number of Votomatics used at the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 20} Consequently, the court of appeals properly denied Harmon\u2019s motion to amend his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 21} On the final day of the hearing, the court of appeals denied Harmon\u2019s request for a continuance to permit further investigation of chads in the voting machines. \u201cIn evaluating a motion for a continuance, \u2018[s]everal factors can be considered: the length of delay requested, prior continuances, inconvenience, the reasons for the delay, whether the defendant contributed to the delay, and other relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, \u00b6 44, quoting <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 115, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 22} Given the time constraints involved in election contests, the delay sought could be considered lengthy. Harmon and appellees had already received a 27-day continuance of the original hearing date. Further, Harmon waited nearly a month after he began examining the voting machines and discovered the alleged problem with chads and until the third and final day of the hearing to request a continuance. Finally, there was evidence that there was no problem with chads jamming the voting machines on election day.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 23} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion by denying Harmon\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Motion to Compel</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals denied Harmon\u2019s motion to compel the testimony of the former director of the board of elections because he did not establish that he ever served her with a subpoena. Under Civ.R. 45(B), \u201c[s]ervice of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person, by reading it to him or her in person, or by leaving it at the person\u2019s usual place of residence, and by tendering to the person upon demand the fees for one day\u2019s attendance and the mileage allowed by law.\u201d The exhibit concerning the subpoena did not indicate that the former director was served in person. And although a copy of the subpoena was left at an Ohio residence, no evidence established that the former director still resided at that residence or anywhere else in Ohio at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">{\u00b6 25} Harmon argues that the court of appeals should nevertheless have compelled the former director to testify under R.C. 3599.37. That statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>inapposite. R.C. 3599.37 merely states that a person \u201chaving been subpoenaed or ordered to appear\u201d to testify regarding a violation of election laws but failing to do so is guilty of a misdemeanor. Further, as noted previously, the former director was never properly subpoenaed or ordered to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 26} Therefore, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Substantive Claims: Election Contest</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 27} Regarding the alleged election irregularities that Harmon either properly pleaded or that the court of appeals considered, Harmon had to establish that \u201cone or more election irregularities occurred and that the irregularity or irregularities affected enough votes to change or make uncertain the result of the * * * election.\u201d <em>Maschari, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 411, 2004-Ohio-5342, 816 N.E.2d 579, \u00b6 21. Harmon had to establish these factors by clear and convincing evidence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Ballot-Rotation Problems</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">{\u00b6 28} Although alleged ballot-rotation irregularities were the primary focus of Harmon\u2019s election-contest petition, he ultimately relied upon only two incidents. The first involved a Votomatic in the Madison C precinct that had an improper rotation page. Testimony established, however, that any irregularity did not affect enough votes to change or make uncertain the election result.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">{\u00b6 29} The second claimed error involved the mislabeling of Votomatics in Hartford Village and Hartford Township. But Harmon eventually stipulated that the problem was corrected and that the votes for the village and township were cast properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Undervotes and Anomalous Vote Totals</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">{\u00b6 30} In his petition, Harmon claimed that undervotes and anomalously high votes for some candidates in certain precincts \u201cmay be the result of rotation errors in the ballot pages.\u201d An undervote occurs when a vote is not cast in a race, e.g., the domestic-relations-judge race. The voter\u2019s intent in an undervote could reasonably be determined as being not to vote in the particular race at issue while voting in other races, e.g., the presidential race.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">{\u00b6 31} We agree with the court of appeals that Harmon failed to establish that the undervotes and the supposedly anomalously high votes constitute election irregularities or that they had any effect on the election result.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">Recount Process: Ballot Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">{\u00b6 32} Harmon alleged in his petition that during the recount, he was denied the right to examine the ballots. His claimed purpose in wanting to examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ballots \u201cwas to verify proper rotation of the candidates\u2019 names from precinct to precinct as required under Ohio law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 3515.04 governs the procedure for recounts and specifies that \u201c[witnesses shall be permitted to see the ballots, but they shall not be permitted to touch them.\u201d Harmon presented testimony that he and his witnesses were not allowed to see the ballot page assemblies and were not afforded a full opportunity to see the ballots, often because officials swept the ballots by at an excessive speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 34} Nevertheless, the record is devoid of any evidence, much less evidence of a clear and convincing nature, that the board\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. 3515.04 had any impact whatsoever on the number of votes for the candidates or the election. In fact, Harmon\u2019s stated purpose in examining the ballots was to verify proper ballot rotation, but he specified only two potential ballot-rotation problems, neither of which satisfies his burden of proof for his election contest. Nor did Harmon attempt.to invoke the recount procedure in R.C. 3515.13.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Recount Process: Electronic Count and Absentee Ballots</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 35} Although Harmon did not raise these issues in his petition, the court of appeals considered his claims questioning the propriety of the board\u2019s electronic recount and the board\u2019s opening of absentee ballots before election day.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 36} Harmon claims that the board of elections failed to follow the recount procedure because when its machine count did not comport with the hand count of the sample of three percent of the total ballots, the board should have ordered a hand count of all the ballots instead of running the machine twice more until the counts matched. Even assuming, however, that the board\u2019s procedure violated the recount procedures promulgated by the Secretary of State, see R.C. 3501.05(B) and (C), Harmon again failed to establish any effect on the final vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">{\u00b6 37} Harmon further asserts that the board erred by opening the absentee ballots two weekends before election day. R.C. 3509.06 provides only that the count of absentee ballots may not be disclosed before the closing of the polling places. The board did begin processing absentee ballots before election day, but ballots were not counted prior to that day. And as the court of appeals concluded, even if the premature ballot opening constituted error, \u201cwe find no evidence to suggest it violated the sanctity of voter privacy or that any voter irregularity affected the outcome of the election.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5F\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Paul D. Harmon, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4J\">Sehaller, Campbell &amp; Untied and David Q. Wigginton, for appellee Craig Baldwin.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">Number of Votomatics</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">{\u00b6 38} The court of appeals also considered Harmon\u2019s unpleaded claim concerning the board\u2019s assertion that 740 Votomatics \u2014 and 745 frames \u2014 were used in the election, which conflicted with information provided by the former director of the board of elections to the Secretary of State that 760 Votomatics were deployed in Licking County for the election. Harmon argues that this discrepancy is an irregularity that affected the election result.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 39} But the evidence on the number of voting machines used at the election was conflicting. At trial, Harmon agreed that the exhibit he relied upon to claim that there were 760 Votomatics used may simply prove what the former board director said. The board chairman\u2019s testimony supported the board\u2019s computation of 740 Votomatics and 745 frames used on election day. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the court of appeals in light of this substantial, conflicting evidence. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Stine v. Brown Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 252, 2004-Ohio-771, 804 N.E.2d 415, \u00b6 20-21 (in election case, court will not substitute its judgment for board of elections if there is conflicting evidence on an issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, the court of appeals properly denied Harmon\u2019s election contest. Harmon failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that any election irregularities affected enough votes to change or make uncertain the election result. \u201c \u2018Our holding is in accordance with the tendency of this court to insist * * * that after an election, unless it is shown that the result was contrary to the will of the electorate, it will not be disturbed.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Election Contest of Dec. 14, 1999 Special Election </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 302, 308, 744 N.E.2d 745, quoting <em>Mehling v. Moorehead </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 395, 408, 11 O.O. 55, 14 N.E.2d 15.
