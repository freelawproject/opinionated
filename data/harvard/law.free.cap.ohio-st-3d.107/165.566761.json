We find that the record supports the determination by the Board of Tax Appeals that it was, and thus we affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">{\u00b6 2} Federated filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990. As Federated prepared to emerge from bankruptcy, it filed its 1993 Ohio corporate franchise tax report indicating that the company\u2019s taxable net worth in Ohio on February 1, 1992, was negative $334,536,641. In that same report, which was filed with the Tax Commissioner in 1993, Federated determined its Ohio franchise tax obligation to be $50 for the 1993 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">{\u00b6 3} The Tax Commissioner audited the 1993 tax report and concluded that Federated\u2019s taxable net worth was actually $430,069,566 on February 1, 1992, and the company therefore owed corporate franchise taxes totaling $2,430,539.87. Federated filed a petition for reassessment with the Tax Commissioner under R.C. 5733.11, but the Tax Commissioner did not change his position in his final determination issued in December 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">{\u00b6 4} Federated appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), which reversed the Commissioner\u2019s decision, finding that Federated had properly reported a negative net worth on its 1993 corporate franchise tax report. The BTA found that the accounting records on which Federated relied in completing that report had been prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the report accurately reflected the company\u2019s net worth as of February 1, 1992. Therefore, the BTA held that Federated had properly reported its net worth and calculated its franchise tax liability for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">{\u00b6 5} The Tax Commissioner appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>{\u00b6 6} In reviewing a BTA decision, this court looks to see whether that decision was reasonable and lawful. <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783. \u201c[W]e will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d we will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. Chapter 5733 describes the corporate franchise tax that Ohio imposes on each corporation \u201cfor the privilege of exercising its franchise during the calendar year.\u201d R.C. 5733.01(A). The tax is based on the \u201cvalue of the issued and outstanding shares of stock\u201d of the company, and that value is to be determined each year on the date that marks the \u201cbeginning of the corporation\u2019s annual accounting period that includes the first day of January of the tax year.\u201d R.C. 5733.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 8} In 1992, Federated maintained its books on a fiscal-year basis, and its fiscal year ended on February 1, 1992. According to Ohio Adm.Code 5703-5-03, however, for franchise-tax purposes, Federated\u2019s fiscal year was deemed to end on January 31. The following day \u2014 February 1,1992 \u2014 marked the \u201cbeginning of the corporation\u2019s annual accounting period\u201d that included January 1, 1993. See R.C. 5733.05. Therefore, February 1, 1992, was the critical date for determining Federated\u2019s net worth on its 1993 corporate franchise tax report.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 9} The taxable net worth of a company should be determined from the company\u2019s books and accounting records. See, e.g., <em>Bush &amp; Cook Leasing, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 87, 91, 679 N.E.2d 1077 (\u201cthe properly recorded value shown on the books of the taxpayer is the value he is to report on the franchise tax return\u201d); <em>Edwards Industries, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 643, 646, 660 N.E.2d 1181 (\u201cthe [tax] commissioner must take taxpayer\u2019s properly prepared books as he finds them\u201d); <em>Gray Horse, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 631, 614 N.E.2d 1038 (when a company keeps its accounting records under a sound and generally recognized and approved accounting system, that company may rightly rely on those records in completing its Ohio corporate franchise tax report); <em>Natl. Tube Co. v. Peck </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 98, 106-107, 50 O.O. 74, 111 N.E.2d 11 (the book value of a company \u201cshould be determined [for franchise-tax purposes] from books which were generally regarded as the accounting records of such corporation and were kept in the ordinary course of business in accordance with any sound and generally recognized and approved accounting system\u201d). In this particular case, however, these decisions do not provide definitive answers, because the financial records relied on by both the Tax Commissioner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Federated appear to have been kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 10} When it emerged from bankruptcy in early February 1992, Federated adopted \u201cfresh-start reporting,\u201d the standard accounting method used by companies emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. See Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code, issued by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (1990) (\u201cSOP 90-7\u201d). Under fresh-start reporting, the negative-equity position of the formerly insolvent entity that filed for Chapter 11 protection is ehminated, and the financial records of the \u201cnew\u201d entity reflect its new assets and liabilities, which are quite distinct from those of the former bankrupt company. As the BTA noted, SOP 90-7 indicates that fresh-start reporting should be adopted by an entity emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy only \u201cwhen all material conditions precedent\u201d to the implementation of the company\u2019s reorganization plan are resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 11} In determining Federated\u2019s franchise tax liability, the Tax Commissioner relied upon Federated\u2019s 1991 annual report and \u201cForm 10-K,\u201d which had been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) in April 1992 and which purported to describe the company\u2019s financial position as of February 1, 1992. These reports expressly state that the company adopted fresh-start reporting on February 1, 1992, and reflect a positive net income and a positive shareholders\u2019 equity for Federated as of February 1,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 12} According to Federated, however, the 1991 annual report was designed to reflect the company\u2019s financial position after it emerged from bankruptcy, even though the company had not yet actually done so on February 1, 1992, when its fiscal year ended. Although the bankruptcy court approved Federated\u2019s reorganization plan on January 10, 1992, the plan did not take effect until February 4, 1992, when all the conditions to its effectiveness were satisfied or waived. Pursuant to SOP 90-7, Federated, therefore, should not have adopted fresh-start reporting until that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 13} Testimony before the BTA established that although the 1991 annual report and Form 10-K stated that Federated adopted fresh-start reporting on February 1, 1992, Federated officials made that statement based on their interpretation of an auditing directive known as \u201cAU Section 560,\u201d issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. According to expert testimony, the adoption of fresh-start reporting and the company\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy on February 4, 1992, were such significant events for investors that they were properly included in the 1991 annual report, even though that report purported to describe the company\u2019s financial position on February 1, 1992, when Federated\u2019s fiscal year ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Testimony before the BTA also established that Federated officials advised the SEC in writing in mid-February 1992 about the company\u2019s plan to prepare its 1991 annual report in the format that was ultimately adopted by the company a few months later. Federated\u2019s senior vice president and its auditor both testified that the SEC gave verbal approval to the proposed format.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 15} Moreover, Federated\u2019s auditor and a professor of accounting at Pepper-dine University both testified that the 1991 annual report prepared by Federated was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, even though that report included information about an event \u2014 the company\u2019s adoption of fresh-start reporting on February 4, 1992 \u2014 that occurred after the close of the fiscal year on February 1, 1992. In addition, financial records presented by Federated before the BTA further support Federated\u2019s claim that the company still had a negative net worth on February 1,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 16} After reviewing the evidence, the BTA found that Federated had emerged from bankruptcy on February 4, 1992, and that Federated had reported that emergence (and simultaneous fresh start) in its 1991 annual report covering a fiscal year that ended on February 1, 1992. According to the BTA, February 4, 1992, was the earliest possible date that Federated could have adopted fresh-start reporting because various material conditions precedent to the implementation of the company\u2019s reorganization plan were not satisfied until then. In the BTA\u2019s view, books and records presented by Federated at the BTA hearing showed that Federated \u201cdid not actually adopt fresh start reporting until its emergence from bankruptcy on February 4, 1992.\u201d The BTA found that those books and records had been \u201cprepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles\u201d and that the 1993 franchise tax report accurately reflected the company\u2019s book value as of February 1,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 17} After reviewing the record before us, we find that the BTA\u2019s conclusion that Federated adopted fresh-start accounting on February 4, 1992, is a lawful and reasonable one that is supported by the evidence. Federated properly reported a negative net worth in its 1993 franchise tax report. We, therefore, affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b258-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b258-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">dissenting.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AhM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Jones Day and Charles M.

It was two tales of one company on one day. February 1, 1992: a date when Federated Department Stores, $334,536,641 in debt (give or take a shilling), was struggling for its very survival. One can imagine the remaining management team in the gruel line in the company cafeteria: \u201cMore, please.\u201d The other February 1, 1992: A shiny new Federated Department Stores, with $430,069,566 under its belt, looks forward with great expectations toward the future. Which story Federated tells depends on the audience. For the Tax Commissioner, it is tragedy. For the shareholders, it is triumph. Either way, it is fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 19} The date we should be focusing on is February 4, 1992. That is the day that the <em>reorganized </em>Federated emerged from bankruptcy. The Federated of February 4, 1992 was not the same Federated that existed on February 1, 1992. As the majority writes, \u201c[u]nder fresh-start reporting, the negative-equity position of the formerly insolvent entity that filed for Chapter 11 protection is eliminated, and the financial records of the \u2018new1 entity reflect its new assets and liabilities, which are quite distinct from those of the former bankrupt company.\u201d Since Federated made a fresh start on February 4, that day marked \u201cthe beginning of the corporation\u2019s annual accounting period that includes the first day of January of the tax year.\u201d R.C. 5733.05. The \u201cfresh start\u201d date marked the beginning of Federated\u2019s fiscal year. Federated\u2019s franchise tax should have been assessed as of that day.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
