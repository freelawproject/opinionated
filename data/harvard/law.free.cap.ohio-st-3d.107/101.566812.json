In this appeal, appellant raises 30 propositions of law. We find that none of his propositions of law have merit and affirm appellant\u2019s convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and have compared appellant\u2019s sentence of death to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm appellant\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\n<em>State\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">{\u00b6 2} During early 2000, Julious lived with his girlfriend, Dana Bostic, at her home in Chillicothe. At the time, appellant was dating Lisa Perkins, who was a friend of Bostic\u2019s. Appellant became acquainted with Julious by visiting Perkins at Bostic\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">{\u00b6 3} On Friday, May 12, 2000, at around 4:00 p.m., Bostic returned home from work and found appellant, Julious, and her daughter in the kitchen. Julious was wearing only boxer shorts. Bostic then left the house with her daughter to pick up her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">{\u00b6 4} When Bostic returned after approximately one hour, appellant and Julious were no longer at the house. Bostic testified, \u201cThe door was unlocked. There was candles still burning, * * * and it was like he just ran out for a minute and he was coming right back.\u201d Moreover, Julious\u2019s belongings, including his clothes, personal hygiene products, and his identification card, were still in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">{\u00b6 5} When Julious did not return home, Bostic called appellant on his pager. Later that night, appellant returned Bostic\u2019s call and put Julious on the phone. Julious told Bostic that \u201che was in Columbus at McKnight\u2019s friend\u2019s house and they were getting ready to go to a OSU block party and he would be home.\u201d Bostic described the conversation as \u201cvery unusual\u201d because Julious \u201cdidn\u2019t let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>[her] ask him anything else\u201d and abruptly ended the conversation. Bostic never saw or talked to Julious again.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 6} In June 2000, appellant and his wife, Kathy McKnight, acquired a trailer in a rural area near Ray, Ohio. Appellant and Kathy moved their belongings into the trailer, but they did not move in. Instead, they moved to the home of Kathy\u2019s mother, in Gambier.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 7} In late September or early October 2000, appellant was hired as a kitchen worker at the Pirate\u2019s Cove restaurant in Gambier. Appellant was friendly with his co-workers, and they would sometimes give him rides to his Gambier home after work.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 8} Emily Murray, a Kenyon College student, was a part-time waitress at the Pirate\u2019s Cove. Murray lived in a Kenyon College dormitory approximately 100 yards from the Pirate\u2019s Cove, and she drove her mother\u2019s Subaru Outback at Kenyon.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 9} On November 2, 2000, Murray quit her job and spent her last evening working at the Pirate\u2019s Cove. Several college friends visited Murray at the Pirate\u2019s Cove to help celebrate her last night at work, but her friends left before Murray finished work.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant also worked at the Pirate\u2019s Cove on the evening of November 2. Time cards showed that Murray finished work at 3:07 a.m. and appellant finished work at 2:59 a.m. on November 3. Nathan Justice, the bartender at the Pirate\u2019s Cove, saw Murray looking for her keys before 3:30 a.m. No one at the Pirate\u2019s Cove recalls seeing Murray and appellant leave together.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">{\u00b6 11} Murray never returned to sleep in her dormitory room, and she failed to appear at a party on the evening of November 3. This absence concerned Murray\u2019s friends because Murray had not left a message regarding her whereabouts and they could not find Murray\u2019s Subaru Outback on campus or in Gambier.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">{\u00b6 12} After an unsuccessful search for Murray, her friends notified Murray\u2019s family and Kenyon College Security. A search of Murray\u2019s dormitory room by Murray\u2019s friend, Abigail Williams, produced Murray\u2019s wallet, which contained her Ohio and New York driver\u2019s licenses, credit cards, and bank card.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">{\u00b6 13} On Sunday evening, November 5, Williams talked to appellant about Murray\u2019s disappearance. Appellant said that he had worked that night but \u201cleft well before she did * * * [and] that he was not there so he could see her leave.\u201d According to Williams, appellant was \u201cvery curt\u201d and \u201c[they] didn\u2019t get any information. He just kind of smirked\u201d at them. A short time after Murray disappeared, appellant told Nate Justice that \u201c[h]e felt that [Murray] was probably dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>{\u00b6 14} On December 9, 2000, Vinton County Sheriffs Chief Deputy Charles Boyer and Deputy Matt Kight went to appellant\u2019s trailer to serve an unrelated indictment on him, but appellant was not there. Deputy Kight ran a license check on a vehicle on the property and learned that the Subaru Outback parked behind the trailer was associated with the disappearance of Emily Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 15} After obtaining a search warrant, law enforcement entered appellant\u2019s trailer and found bloodstains on the carpet near the front door. Police followed a trail of blood down the hallway and discovered Murray\u2019s clothed body wrapped inside a carpet in the spare bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 16} During the search, Special Agent Gary Wilgus, a crime-scene investigator with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, found a copper bullet jacket near the bloodstained carpet in the living room. A bullet hole was found in the area of the bloodstained carpet, but investigators did not find the bullet that went through the floor. Additionally, police found five spent .357 shell casings inside a drawer in the living room, seven nine-millimeter bullets inside a drawer in the master bedroom, and a roll of bloodstained duct tape in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 17} Investigators searching the property found human bones and clothing in the cistern, the root cellar, and in a plastic bag. Police discovered that a fire had been started in the root cellar, and they recovered burned bones and pieces of clothing. The skeletal remains included most of the bones from a single human, but only six skull fragments were found. Dr. Nancy Tatarek, a forensic anthropologist, concluded that the remains were from an African-American male who was 20 to 25 years of age and six feet to six feet, six inches tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 18} The police identified the remains as those of Gregory Julious. Dr. Franklin Wright, a forensic dentist, positively matched the teeth and jaw bone found on appellant\u2019s property with Julious\u2019s dental records. Bostic also identified the remains of boxer shorts found in the cistern as those Julious was wearing the day he disappeared. Kim Zimmerman, appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, had given police a bloodstained backpack that he had taken from the trailer\u2019s living-room closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">{\u00b6 19} Police searched the vehicle that appellant was driving when Julious disappeared, and they discovered bloodstains on the carpet underneath the rear seat. Subsequent DNA analysis showed that the \u201cDNA from the * * * carpet [was] consistent with the DNA profile from Gregory L. Julious.\u201d According to Diane Larson, a DNA serology analyst, the \u201cchance of finding the same DNA profile in the population is * * * approximately 1 in 50 trillion people for the Caucasian population, one in 177 trillion in the African-American population, and 1 in 51 trillion in the Hispanic population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Inside appellant\u2019s Gambier home, police found an empty box of Winchester .357 magnum cartridges underneath the bed in the master bedroom, two .30 caliber bullets in the master-bedroom closet, and four nine-millimeter bullets in the basement. Police also learned that appellant had purchased three handguns from two gun shops before the murders: a Jennings nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol purchased on February 17, 1999, an Intratec nine-millimeter pistol purchased on April 24, 1999, and a Jennings .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol bought on May 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 21} Dr. Dorothy Dean, Deputy Coroner for Franklin County, found that Murray had died from a single \u201cgunshot wound to the head.\u201d Murray was shot with a high-powered weapon, and the gun was \u201cvery, very close or touching her skin\u201d when fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 22} Dr. Tatarek found that the condition of the skull fragments of Julious were \u201cconsistent with an injury by gunshot.\u201d She also found evidence of trauma to the vertebra \u201ccaused by some sort of sharp object penetrating the person\u2019s neck and cutting into the bone.\u201d Moreover, trauma to two hand bones was \u201cconsistent [with] defense wounds.\u201d Dr. Tatarek also found trauma around joints \u201cconsistent with dismemberment of a person.\u201d The condition of the skeletal remains placed the date of death within a three- to six-month time frame that included May 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 23} Diane Larson concluded that the DNA profile from the bullet jacket found in appellant\u2019s trailer was consistent with Murray\u2019s DNA profile. The odds that the DNA from the bullet jacket was from someone other than Murray were one in 646 billion' for the Caucasian population. Larson also found that the bloodstains on the backpack and duct tape matched Julious\u2019s DNA profile. The odds that the DNA from bloodstains on the backpack was from someone other than Julious were one in 64 quadrillion for the African-American population.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 24} Heather Zollman, a firearms expert, compared a bullet taken from a tree behind the trailer and the bullet jacket from inside the house and concluded that they were \u201cfired [from] the same firearm.\u201d Zollman described each as a \u201cRemington brand 180 gram .357 magnum semi-jacketed hollow-point bullet.\u201d She could not determine the caliber of the bullet removed from Murray\u2019s body. Nevertheless, Zollman concluded that the lead was \u201cconsistent with having come from the bullet.\u201d Gunpowder on the surface of the bullet fragment was also \u201cthe same type of style of flattened ball powder that is loaded by Remington in these .357 magnum cartridges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\n<em>Defense\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">{\u00b6 25} The defense called one witness. Donald Doles, a Vinton County neighbor of appellant, testified that twice during the fall of 2000, he had observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>a woman who looked like Emily Murray drive past his house in a Subaru Outback with New York license plates. When she drove past on one occasion, Doles was only ten or 12 feet away from the car when \u201cshe turned around and looked at [him] and smiled and waved.\u201d During cross-examination, Doles did not recognize Murray\u2019s picture, and he said that he was not 100 percent certain that the woman driving past his house was Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"Azb\">\n<em>Indictment and Trial Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">{\u00b6 26} The grand jury indicted appellant on one count of aggravated murder and one count of murder. Count 1 charged appellant with the aggravated murder of Murray while committing a kidnapping, Count 2 charged kidnapping, and Count 3 charged aggravated robbery. Count 6 charged appellant with the murder of Julious. Additionally, appellant was indicted for tampering with evidence in Counts 4 and 7 and gross abuse of a corpse in Counts 5 and 8. Prior to trial, Counts 4, 5, 7, and 8 were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 27} The aggravated-murder count contained four death-penalty specifications: murder to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); murder as a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d in killing two or more people, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); and murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The indictment also contained a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges. The jury found appellant guilty of Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\n<em>Pretrial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 30} <em>Search warrant. </em>In proposition of law V, appellant argues that his trailer was illegally searched because the affidavit supporting the search warrant included false and misleading information.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTo successfully attack the veracity of a facially sufficient search warrant affidavit, a defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either \u2018intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 441, 588 N.E.2d 819, quoting <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667. \u201cReckless disregard\u201d means that the affiant had serious doubts about the truth of an allegation. <em>United States v. Williams </em>(C.A.7, 1984), 737 F.2d 594, 602. Omissions count as a false statement if \u201cdesigned to mislead, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>* * * made in reckless disregard of whether they would mislead, the magistrate.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>United States v. Colkley </em>(C.A.4, 1990), 899 F.2d 297, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 32} On December 9, 2000, Vinton County Sheriffs Deputy Matt Eight observed a Subaru Outback with New York license plates behind appellant\u2019s trailer. A police computer check connected the vehicle to Emily Murray, who was listed as a \u201cmissing endangered person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 33} Later that afternoon, Vinton County Chief Deputy Sheriff Charles Boyer went to appellant\u2019s trailer and verified ownership of the Subaru by checking both the vehicle\u2019s license plate and the vehicle identification number (\u201cVIN\u201d). Boyer also learned through a Knox County police dispatcher that Murray had been missing since November 3 and that Knox County authorities \u201chad done extensive searching, [and] had the F.B.I. involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 34} Boyer listed the following facts and circumstances in the affidavit to obtain a search warrant for the trailer: \u201cEmily Sarah Murray is listed as an endangered missing person by the Knox County, Ohio Sheriffs Office, as of November 3, 2000. Earlier today while attempting to serve an indictment on Gregory McKnight at his residence, I saw a vehicle with New York license plates on it. Mr. McKnight was not at home, neither was anybody else. Prior to leaving, I ran the license plate number. It came back to Cynthia Murray with an alert for Emily Sarah Murray as an endangered and missing person. The vehicle came up missing the same time Emily did. I obtained confirmation from Knox County officials whom are traveling to Vinton County at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 35} Boyer also attached to the affidavit a missing person\u2019s flyer regarding Murray\u2019s disappearance. The affidavit listed \u201cAbduction, R.C. 2905.02; Kidnapping, R.C. 2905.01; ENDANGERED MISSING PERSON\u201d as the provisions of law violated. Later on December 9, Judge Grillo issued the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant claims that the search warrant was invalid because three false statements were included in the affidavit. First, appellant asserts that Eight, rather than Boyer, saw the Subaru behind appellant\u2019s trailer and checked the plates on the police computer. The facts do not support this allegation. After being notified that Murray\u2019s Subaru was found behind appellant\u2019s trailer, Boyer checked the VIN and license-plate number of the Subaru on the police computer in the sheriffs office. Boyer then went to appellant\u2019s trailer, checked the VIN on the Subaru, and verified the vehicle\u2019s ownership. Thus, Boyer correctly stated in the affidavit that he observed the Subaru and verified its ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 37} Second, appellant contends that Boyer\u2019s affidavit falsely states that he contacted the Knox County Sheriffs Office about Murray\u2019s disappearance. We also reject this claim. Boyer\u2019s affidavit does not assert that he personally contacted Knox County officials about Murray\u2019s disappearance. The affidavit states, \u201cI <em>obtained confirmation </em>from Knox County officials.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>This statement encompasses information that Boyer obtained about Murray\u2019s disappearance through the police dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, information about Murray\u2019s disappearance obtained through the police dispatcher was properly included in the affidavit. Courts have recognized that \u201c \u2018effective law enforcement cannot be conducted unless police officers can act on directions and information \u25a0 transmitted by one officer to another and that officers, who must often act swiftly, cannot be expected to cross-examine their fellow officers about the foundation for the transmitted information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maumee v. Weisner </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 295, 297, 720 N.E.2d 507, quoting <em>United States v. Hensley </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 221, 231, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 39} Third, appellant argues that the affidavit improperly listed kidnapping and abduction as the violated laws because Murray was listed only as a missing and endangered person at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 40} Crim.R. 41(C) provides that a search-warrant affidavit \u201cshall name or describe the person to be searched or particularly describe the place to be searched * * * [and] <em>state substantially the offense </em>in relation thereto, and state the factual basis for the affiant\u2019s belief that such property is there located.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See, also, R.C. 2933.23. \u201cCrim.R. 41(C) requires a substantial statement of the offense in relation to the property to be seized and <em>not the specific code number or title of that offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Cleveland v. Becvar </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 163, 166, 578 N.E.2d 489. Moreover, the \u201cfailure to specify the offense to which the evidence is related by name or code section in the affidavit is not constitutionally significant\u201d and does not require suppression of evidence seized pursuant to that warrant. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 41} Probable cause to search does not require proof that a crime was actually committed, merely the fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found at the location described. <em>State v. George </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640, paragraph one of the syllabus. The facts in the affidavit fully supported a finding of probable cause: Murray had been missing for over a month and was considered a missing and endangered person; Murray and her car had disappeared at the same time from Knox County; police then discovered her car behind appellant\u2019s trailer in an isolated part of Vinton County. Based upon these facts, the affidavit properly listed kidnapping and abduction as possible offenses, and that listing did not constitute a false and misleading statement in violation of <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. at 170, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 42} Based on the foregoing, proposition V is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Dismissal of the capital specif\u00edcations. </em>In proposition of law VII, appellant argues that the trial court erred in reinstating the capital specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>{\u00b6 44} In a pretrial motion dated February 7, 2002, appellant\u2019s trial counsel sought to dismiss the capital specifications due to asserted constitutional- and international-law violations. On August 8, 2002, the trial court dismissed the capital specifications, finding \u201cthat the potential impact of financial considerations could compromise the Defendant\u2019s due process rights in a capital murder trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 45} In an August 14, 2002 motion for reconsideration, the state argued that the trial court improperly usurped the state\u2019s authority to prosecute a capital case, that none of appellant\u2019s requests for funding had been denied, and that adequate funding was available to prosecute this capital case. On August 23, 2002, the trial court vacated its earlier ruling. The court later held that \u201cits concern as to financial impact was based upon prospective due process considerations, rather than any actual deprivation of due process.\u201d On September 19, 2002, the trial court held that its August 8, 2002 dismissal was \u201cvoid ab initio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant argues that the trial court erred in reinstating the capital specifications. First, appellant argues that the trial court properly exercised its discretion by dismissing the capital specifications to avoid the risk of imposing an unreliable and arbitrary death sentence and thus erred by reinstating the capital specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 47} However, \u201c[t]he grand jury is the ultimate charging body, and it is within its discretion, based on the evidence presented to it, to determine for which felony an accused shall be charged.\u201d <em>Foston v. Maxwell </em>(1964), 177 Ohio St. 74, 76, 29 O.O.2d 194, 202 N.E.2d 425. \u201cConsequently, the decision whether to prosecute is discretionary and not normally subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197; <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 23, 27, 661 N.E.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 48} The trial court abused its discretion by initially dismissing the capital specifications because of the <em>\u201cpotential </em>impact of financial considerations\u201d on appellant\u2019s due process rights. (Emphasis added.) See <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.o.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144 (\u201cabuse of discretion\u201d defined to mean a decision that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable). The trial court\u2019s concerns about inadequate funding of appellant\u2019s capital trial were speculative and without a factual basis. The defense did not claim in the motion to dismiss that financial considerations threatened appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Moreover, the prosecutor assured the court that funding was available for defense witnesses and counsel fees and that appellant\u2019s due process rights were in no danger of being violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 49} We conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in reinstating the capital specifications upon learning that the underlying premise for its earlier ruling was flawed. Indeed, \u201c[a] court has the \u2018inherent power to regulate the practice before it and protect the integrity of its proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>State v.

Reinstatement of the capital specifications did not violate appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial, and appellant does not argue that the defense was unprepared for trial after the capital specifications were reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">{\u00b6 50} Second, appellant claims that constraints on the trial court\u2019s discretion to dismiss the capital specifications were unfair and arbitrary in view of Crim.R. 11(C)(3), which states, \u201cIf the indictment contains one or more specifications, and a plea of guilty or no contest to the charge is accepted, the court may dismiss the specifications and impose sentence accordingly, in the interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant argues that Crim.R. 11(C)(3) is unconstitutional because it affords a defendant who pleads guilty the benefit of judicial discretion \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d while denying the same to him because he pleaded not guilty and exercised his right to a jury trial. We have rejected similar attacks on Crim.R. 11(C)(3). See <em>State v. Dickerson </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 206, 214, 543 N.E.2d 1250; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 138, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 52} Third, appellant asserts that the prosecutor misled the trial court by claiming that the court\u2019s dismissal \u201ccomes at an unacceptable cost to fair justice required by Ohio\u2019s citizens and the families of Emily Murray and Gregory Julius [sic].\u201d Appellant makes this claim because he asserts that the Murray family did not want appellant to receive the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 53} The prosecutor\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not assert that the Murray family wanted the death penalty. Although Murray family members requested during the penalty phase that appellant receive life in prison rather than the death penalty, the record does not show that the prosecutor was aware of these wishes at the time of this motion. The motion related to dismissing the capital specifications because of financial considerations and had nothing to do with the Murray family\u2019s desires concerning the death penalty. Moreover, the trial court could not have been unduly influenced by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the Murray family. A trial judge is presumed to consider \u201c \u2018only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment unless it affirmatively appears to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 384, 513 N.E.2d 754, quoting <em>State v. White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 146, 151, 44 O.O.2d 132, 239 N.E.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 54} Finally, appellant argues that his due process rights were violated because he waived his right to a speedy trial in exchange for an evidentiary hearing on a motion for reconsideration that was never conducted. The facts do not support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>{\u00b6 55} On April 30, 2001, appellant filed an indefinite waiver of his right to a speedy trial. On August 21, 2002, appellant withdrew this waiver, filed a speedy-trial demand for the murder of Julious, and requested that the trial proceed as scheduled on September 23, 2002. Appellant, however, offered to waive his demand for a speedy trial on all counts if the trial court granted a full evidentiary hearing on the motion for reconsideration of the capital specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">{\u00b6 56} On August 23, 2002, the trial court vacated its earlier ruling, reinstated the capital specifications, and held that the trial would proceed on September 23, 2002. The trial court\u2019s ruling avoided the need for an evidentiary hearing. Moreover, appellant suffered no prejudice, because the trial proceeded on the date that the defense had requested in its speedy-trial demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 57} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 58} <em>Pretrial publicity. </em>In proposition of law VIII, appellant argues that the trial court erred by refusing defense requests for a change of venue and for funding to conduct a scientific jury survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 59} 1. Change of venue. Extensive pretrial publicity surrounded appellant\u2019s case on television and in the newspapers. National media focused on the case after the judge dismissed the capital specifications because of financial considerations and later reinstated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 60} A motion for change of venue is governed by Crim.R. 18(B), which provides that \u201cthe court may transfer an action * * * when it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the court in which the action is pending.\u201d Crim.R. 18(B) does not require a change of venue merely because of extensive pretrial publicity. The decision whether to change venue rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 116, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 61} We have stated that \u201c \u2018a careful and searching <em>voir dire </em>provides the best test of whether prejudicial pretrial publicity has prevented obtaining a fair and impartial jury from the locality.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 117, 559 N.E.2d 710, quoting <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 98, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035. A defendant claiming that pretrial publicity has denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749. \u201cOnly in rare cases may prejudice be presumed.\u201d Id.; see, also, <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304; <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 539, 554-555, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">{\u00b6 62} Our review of the voir dire examination does not support appellant\u2019s claim of prejudicial pretrial publicity. During voir dire, each seated juror was individually questioned about pretrial publicity. Although all of the jurors had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>some knowledge about the case, seven of the jurors had formed no opinion about it. Four other jurors were not asked whether they had formed an opinion about the case, but they agreed to disregard anything that they had heard outside court. The remaining juror stated that he had \u201c[n]ot really formed an opinion, but it leans toward that.\u201d Further questioning showed that this juror knew few details about the case. Finally, all 12 of the jurors agreed to set aside anything that they had heard and decide the case solely upon the evidence presented in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 63} Moreover, the defense did not challenge any of the seated jurors for cause due to pretrial publicity. The absence of defense challenges indicated that the defense, after voir dire was completed, was not particularly troubled by the jury\u2019s exposure to pretrial publicity. <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 52; <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 64} Appellant has not shown that any juror was biased. Under these circumstances, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">{\u00b6 65} 2. Scientific jury survey. The state must provide an indigent criminal defendant with funds to obtain expert assistance \u201conly where the trial court finds, in the exercise of a sound discretion, that the defendant has made a particularized showing (1) of a reasonable probability that the requested expert would aid in his defense, and (2) that denial of the requested expert assistance would result in an unfair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">{\u00b6 66} In his motion for an expert to conduct a scientific jury survey, appellant asserted that a \u201cscientific survey [was] necessary to prove the obvious that because of the publicity a fair trial cannot be had within Vinton County.\u201d Such a generalized assertion does not qualify as the \u201cparticularized showing\u201d required by <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus. Furthermore, comprehensive voir dire examination of the seated jurors about pretrial publicity negated any need for a scientific jury survey of public opinion within Vinton County. Thus, we find that appellant has failed to demonstrate that denial of the requested expert denied him a fair trial. See <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 152, 694 N.E.2d 932 (services of a mass-media expert unnecessary); <em>Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 117, 559 N.E.2d 710 (psychologist for jury selection unnecessary); <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 193, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264 (sociologist to assist voir dire unnecessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">{\u00b6 67} Based on the foregoing, we find that proposition VIII has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">\n<em>Trial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">{\u00b6 68} <em>Sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence. </em>In proposition of law I, appellant challenges the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>his convictions of aggravated felony murder in Count 1, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) kidnapping specification, and the separately charged kidnapping offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">{\u00b6 69} Although both are raised by appellant in one proposition of law, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence differs from a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 70} In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; see, also, <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 71} A claim that a jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence involves a different test. \u201c \u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 72} Appellant argues that the state did not prove that he kidnapped Murray. Appellant argues that no witnesses testified that they saw him remove or restrain Murray, and no evidence was presented about where she was murdered. Appellant uses the same rationale in arguing that his convictions for these offenses are against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 73} We find that appellant\u2019s sufficiency claims lack merit. The state proved that appellant kidnapped Murray by showing that Murray and appellant left work at approximately the same time on the night Murray disappeared, that Murray\u2019s car was found parked behind appellant\u2019s trailer, and that Murray\u2019s murdered body was found rolled in a carpet inside appellant\u2019s trailer. Further, the evidence proved that Murray did not have her wallet, driver\u2019s licenses, and credit cards when she disappeared and that Murray did not tell anyone she was leaving the area, despite her habit of informing friends of her whereabouts. Additionally, appellant lied when Murray\u2019s friend asked about her, and appellant also told a coworker that she was \u201cprobably dead.\u201d Appellant also falsely told Kimberly Zimmerman that the Subaru behind his trailer belonged to his boss or a friend, \u201cand they were down there probably hunting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b6 74} The evidence also established that the location of Murray\u2019s murder was appellant\u2019s trailer. A copper bullet jacket found in the living room of the trailer had Murray\u2019s DNA on it, and a bullet hole was discovered in the bloodstained living-room carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 75} We also reject appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient because there were no eyewitnesses. We have \u201clong held that circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if that evidence would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 238, 553 N.E.2d 1026. Here, circumstantial evidence, forensic testimony, and appellant\u2019s own statements proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant kidnapped and murdered Murray. Forensic evidence showed that the copper bullet jacket and bullets removed from a tree behind appellant\u2019s trailer were \u201cfired from the same firearm.\u201d Moreover, the fact that appellant used a gun for target practice on his property linked him to the weapon that killed Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 76} As to appellant\u2019s manifest-weight challenges, this is not an \u201c \u2018exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. We find that the jury neither lost its way nor created a miscarriage of justice in convicting appellant of aggravated felony murder, the kidnapping-murder specification, or the separate offense of kidnapping. Proposition I is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 77} <em>Evidentiary issues. </em>In proposition of law III, appellant argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his marital infidelity, his reaction to the presence of the police, and the introduction of victim-impact evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 78} 1. \u201cOther acts\u201d evidence Amber Hammers and appellant worked together at Flappers Bar, a Mount Vernon bar and grill then owned by an owner of the Pirate\u2019s Cove. Hammers testified that appellant called and asked her to go dancing with him. Hammers told appellant that she had not talked to her boyfriend about going dancing with another man, and no plans were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">{\u00b6 79} Gloria Ressler and appellant worked together at the Pirate\u2019s Cove. Ressler testified that following Murray\u2019s disappearance, appellant called her on three occasions during November 2000 and asked \u201cif he could come over and hang out, have a party, come out and just have [her] and him * * * out there.\u201d Appellant also approached her at work and said, \u201c[W]e could have a quickie and [your fianc\u00e9] wouldn\u2019t have to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">{\u00b6 80} Lisa Perkins testified that at one point, appellant gave her a ride in his car and along the way, appellant \u201cstopped up on the top of the hill, and * * * he just started talking and touching [her] and [they] had sex up on the hill in the car.\u201d Dana Bostic testified that appellant had spent the night with Perkins at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Bostic\u2019s home. Following Julious\u2019s disappearance, appellant told Bostic that \u201chis plans were * * * to leave his wife [and] * * * come and stay with [Bostic] and Lisa at [Bostic\u2019s] house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 81} Paul Amstutz, a former Pirate\u2019s Cove delivery driver, testified about a conversation with Kathy McKnight about appellant\u2019s whereabouts. During a food delivery to the McKnight home, Kathy indicated to Amstutz that she thought that appellant was working that evening at the Pirate\u2019s Cove. Amstutz knew, however, that appellant was not working that evening and was instead drinking at the Pirate\u2019s Cove bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 82} Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. \u201cIt may, however, be admissible * * * [to show] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d However, \u201c[t]he admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 83} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Hammers\u2019s and Ressler\u2019s testimony. That evidence related to appellant\u2019s modus operandi, or plan. Evidence showing a modus operandi is admissible because \u201c \u2018it provides a behavioral fingerprint which, when compared to the behavioral fingerprints associated with the crime in question, can be used to identify the defendant as the perpetrator.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 104, quoting <em>State v. Lowe </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 531, 634 N.E.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 84} Hammers and Ressler helped to establish appellant\u2019s opportunity, preparation, and plan to acquaint himself and be alone with Murray. Appellant\u2019s phone calls to Hammers and Ressler showed that appellant developed an interest in his co-workers and asked them out. This pattern of behavior showed the likelihood that appellant also developed an interest in Murray. Thus, the jury could reasonably infer from the testimony of Hammers and Ressler that appellant had asked Murray for a ride after work.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 85} We also reject appellant\u2019s argument that his phone calls to Ressler were not admissible because they were made after Murray\u2019s disappearance. \u201c[P]ursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), * * * evidence of subsequent crimes or acts of misconduct is admissible if it is relevant to an issue at trial and its probative value is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Cleveland v. Dillingham </em>(May 11, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67693, 1995 WL 277105, <em>*4. </em>Appellant\u2019s phone calls, though made two or three weeks after Murray\u2019s disappearance, were relevant in establishing appellant\u2019s modus operandi.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">{\u00b6 86} Moreover, the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. The jury was advised: \u201cEvidence was introduced that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the defendant may have committed other acts other than the offenses with which he was charged in this case. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true * * *, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves Gregory McKnight\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent or purpose or plan to commit kidnapping of Emily Murray. The evidence may not be considered for any other purpose. It was not received, and you may not consider it to prove the character of Gregory McKnight in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character.\u201d In view of these instructions and the probative value of the testimony of the two women, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. See <em>State v. Noling, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 87} We also find that the testimony about appellant\u2019s visits to Perkins in Bostic\u2019s home was relevant to show how appellant and Julious knew each other. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">{\u00b6 88} Testimony that appellant and Perkins had sex in appellant\u2019s car and spent the night together at Bostic\u2019s home was not relevant and not admissible under Evid.R. 404(B). Nevertheless, we find that the impact of such testimony was minimal and not prejudicial given other compelling evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. See Noling, 98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 89} 2. Reaction to the police. Two to three weeks before Julious was murdered, appellant, Kathy, Bostic, and Julious drove from Chillicothe to Columbus to go to a reggae club. Over defense objection, Bostic testified that when they \u201cpulled into a parking lot [of the reggae club] * * * there was police sitting in the parking lot.\u201d Bostic testified that appellant said, \u201c\u2018There\u2019s the police.\u2019 And then we turned * * * out of the parking lot and we drove all the way back home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 90} We find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this testimony. Appellant\u2019s reaction to the police occurred before he murdered either Julious or Murray. This evidence did not prove consciousness of guilt, because there was no connection between appellant\u2019s reaction to the police and the charged offenses. Appellant\u2019s reaction to the police, however, was not tied to any other misconduct, and he was not prejudiced by such testimony. Thus, the introduction of this evidence constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">{\u00b6 91} 3. Victim-impact comment and testimony. During his opening statement, the prosecutor stated, \u201cTwo years ago, Emily S. Murray was attending Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. She was in her junior year, and she was 20 years young.\u201d Further, the prosecutor stated, \u201cAt work, Emily was well-liked. She was outgoing, she was helpful, she was a good waitress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">{\u00b6 92} Thomas Murray, the victim\u2019s father, testified that he had a \u201cvery close\u201d relationship with his daughter. He added, \u201cEmily was in touch with her mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>or me or both of us' almost every day.\u201d According to Thomas, Emily \u201cwas very responsible; she was just a very honest kid.\u201d Moreover, Murray returned from a religious retreat about ten days before her disappearance and was \u201creally excited about becoming a priest.\u201d Thomas also testified that when he learned of his daughter\u2019s disappearance, \u201cit was like somebody hit [him] in the stomach with a sledgehammer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 93} Cynthia Murray, the victim\u2019s mother, described a \u201cvery close relationship\u201d with Murray, said Murray was \u201ceasy to love,\u201d and testified that Murray \u201cwanted to become an Episcopal priest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 94} Megan DiCarlo, a college friend, described Murray as \u201cvery outgoing, very social, independent, very open with people, trusting of people. Like she always looked for the best in people.\u201d Kate Murray, another college friend, described Murray as \u201c[v]ery outgoing, had a lot of friends, very friendly.\u201d Kate also testified that Murray was very religious, and the tattoo of a dove on Murray\u2019s back symbolized this interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 95} Michael Corrigan, the general manager of the Pirate\u2019s Cove, stated that Murray was \u201ccourteous and cared for people, and she was a very upbeat person, fun to work with.\u201d On the night she disappeared, Murray was \u201cvery upbeat and happy.\u201d Nathan Justice also testified that Murray was a \u201cvery nice, happy person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 96} During the guilt-phase closing argument, the prosecutor described Murray\u2019s disappearance as \u201cevery parents\u2019 worst nightmare,\u201d repeated Thomas Murray\u2019s statement that \u201cthey felt as if they had been hit in the stomach with a sledgehammer,\u201d and mentioned that \u201cthat pain in their stomach stays with them today.\u201d The prosecutor also argued that Murray was \u201cnice\u201d and \u201ckind-hearted\u201d and might have given appellant a ride on the night she disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">{\u00b6 97} The defense filed a motion in limine to exclude victim-impact evidence. Nevertheless, except where noted, the defense did not renew its objection to the foregoing testimony at trial and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>Gable v. Gates Mills, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 449, 2004-Ohio-5719, 816 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 34 (\u201ca ruling on a motion in limine may not be appealed and * * * objections * * * must be made during the trial to preserve evidentiary rulings for appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">{\u00b6 98} Evidence relating to the facts attendant to the offense is \u201cclearly admissible\u201d during the guilt phase, even though it might be characterized as victim-impact evidence. <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 440, 650 N.E.2d 878. Thus, testimony that Murray was friendly, outgoing, and trusting was admissible in showing the likelihood that Murray provided appellant a ride in her car on the night she disappeared. Moreover, testimony that Murray was a responsible person was admissible in showing that she would not have left campus in her car without taking her wallet and driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>{\u00b6 99} The defense objected to Thomas\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s testimony because of the lack of foundation to prove habit but did not object to the testimony as inappropriate victim-impact evidence. Thomas\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s close personal relationship and frequent contact with their daughter laid the foundation about Murray\u2019s habit of notifying family members as to her whereabouts before making a trip, and this testimony was also admissible. Thomas\u2019s testimony that his daughter\u2019s disappearance was \u201clike somebody hit [him] in the stomach with a sledgehammer\u201d was of questionable relevance; however, such testimony did not constitute outcome-determinative plain error. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 679, 687 N.E.2d 1358; cf. <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 293, 754 N.E.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 100} Testimony about Murray\u2019s upbeat mood before her disappearance, her strong religious beliefs, and her aspirations to become an Episcopal priest was admissible in rebutting arguments that Murray might have committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 101} Kate Murray\u2019s testimony about the tattoo of a dove on Murray\u2019s back was relevant in identifying Murray\u2019s body. See <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 108 (photos of victim\u2019s tattoo admissible to help identify the victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 102} As to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and closing argument, the trial counsel failed to object and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. There was no plain error. The prosecutor\u2019s brief description of Murray in his opening statement simply pointed out her age and that she had attended Kenyon College, which explained why she lived in Gambier. Cf. <em>Noling, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 56 (description of victims\u2019 lives established that the victims had been living persons, an element of the charge of aggravated murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 103} The prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument also did not result in plain error. The prosecutor described Murray as a nice, kind-hearted, and helpful person to point out the likelihood that Murray provided a ride to appellant on the night she disappeared. The prosecutor\u2019s comments about Thomas\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s pain and anguish simply pointed out the obvious feelings that Murray\u2019s parents experienced following their daughter\u2019s death. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in question were very brief and not overly emotional.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">{\u00b6 104} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">{\u00b6 105} <em>Habit evidence. </em>In proposition of law X, appellant argues that the trial court erred by admitting habit testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">{\u00b6 106} Over defense objection, the state presented evidence of Murray\u2019s habit of informing family and friends about her whereabouts before departing on a trip. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Thomas Murray testified that her family and friends maintained close contact with Murray as to her whereabouts following Murray\u2019s suicide attempt in May 2000. Murray exchanged phone calls and e-mails with her parents on an almost daily basis. During the fall of 2000, Murray remained in contact with her parents when she traveled to Japan and made a trip to St. Louis. Following this testimony, the prosecutor asked Thomas:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cQ: Was it common for Emily to tell you where she might be going before she left?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 108} \u201cA: Anything of significance, yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 109} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cQ: Could you restate your answer?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">{\u00b6 111} \u201cA: Emily was in very close touch with us, and also with her friends, so if it was anything significant, we would have known about it, she would have told us, and she certainly would have told her friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">{\u00b6 112} Megan DiCarlo, Murray\u2019s roommate, testified that she and Emily used a dry-erase board to leave a message \u201cif one of [them] went somewhere.\u201d The prosecutor also asked DiCarlo:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cQ: Did Emily use the board when she took a trip, maybe a weekend or two before?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cA: Uh-huh. She had gone to see a friend in Cleveland a couple weeks beforehand * * * and had left a message like filling almost the entire board about where she was going, when she planning on leaving, when she was planning on being back, who she was going to see, and a phone number for that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">{\u00b6 115} \u201cQ: The night that Emily didn\u2019t come back, was there any notes on that board?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cA: No, there weren\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cQ: Were there any notes anywhere else in the dorm room?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cQ: Did you get any phone messages?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">{\u00b6 120} \u201cA: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">{\u00b6 121} Kate Murray, a former roommate, also testified about Murray\u2019s habit of informing her friends about her whereabouts:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">{\u00b6 122} \u201cQ: I\u2019m not talking about guessing what she might do in the future. While you were her roommate, while you knew her, did she ever disappear unaccounted for and then reappear and say, Well, I\u2019m sorry, sorry?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cQ: How do you know that?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>{\u00b6 125} \u201cA: I would \u2014 from personal experience of living with her, it\u2019s a very-small campus, you see people a lot, and if she had disappeared for any amount of time, we would have noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 126} \u201cQ: Did she ever leave * * * unexpectedly?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">{\u00b6 127} \u201cA: Yes, one night she drove up to Cleveland to see a Mend, but then when she did go that time \u2014 and no one knew she was going \u2014 she left us a note saying where she was going.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cQ: Where did she leave the note?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cA: I assume in her room. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">{\u00b6 130} Evid. R. 406 provides: \u201cEvidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice.\u201d Evid.R. 406 is identical to Rule 406 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">{\u00b6 131} Evid.R. 406 does not define habit. \u201cHabit,\u201d however, has been defined as a \u201cperson\u2019s regular practice of meeting .a particular kind of situation with a specific type of conduct.\u201d See Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes, Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates (1973), 56 F.R.D. 183, 223. Although a precise formula does not exist for determining when the behavior may become so consistent as to rise to the level of habit, \u201cadequacy of sampling and uniformity of response are key factors.\u201d Id. at 224; see, also, <em>United States v. Newman </em>(C.A.1, 1992), 982 F.2d 665, 668; <em>Reyes v. Missouri Pacific RR. Co. </em>(C.A.5, 1979), 589 F.2d 791, 795. These factors focus on whether the behavior at issue \u201c \u2018occurred with sufficient regularity making it more probable than not that it would be carried out in every instance or in most instances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newman, </em>982 F.2d at 668, quoting <em>Weil v. Seltzer </em>(C.A.D.C.1989), 873 F.2d 1453, 1460.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">{\u00b6 132} Murray\u2019s father and two of her close friends established Murray\u2019s habit of notifying friends and family members of her whereabouts before departing on a trip. Murray\u2019s daily phone calls and e-mails with her father as to her whereabouts, and her practice of leaving notes as to her whereabouts with her Mends were \u201c \u2018numerous enough to base an inference of systematic conduct,\u2019 \u201d permitting the admissibility of the testimony. <em>Wilson v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc. </em>(C.A.4, 1977), 561 F.2d 494, 511, quoting <em>Strauss v. Douglas Aircraft Co. </em>(C.A.2, 1968), 404 F.2d 1152, 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">{\u00b6 133} We reject appellant\u2019s argument that Murray\u2019s behavior was a volitional act and therefore not admissible as habit evidence. Activities that are \u201csemiautomatic or nearly nonvolitional, can be easily classified as habit.\u201d 1 Giannelli &amp; Snyder, Evidence (2d Ed.2001) 265, Section 406.4. For example, locking the door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>of a house or traveling home from work by the same route are examples of habitual acts that may become semiautomatic and thus tend to prove that one acted in a particular situation in the same manner. Id.; see, also, <em>Cardinal v. Family Foot Care Ctr., Inc. </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 181, 182, 532 N.E.2d 162 (\u201chabitual acts may become semi-automatic and may tend to prove one acted in the particular case in the same manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">{\u00b6 134} Similarly, Murray\u2019s repeated practice of notifying friends and family of her whereabouts before departing on a trip became a semiautomatic form of behavior that was admissible to prove habit. See <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675 (testimony that victim was an immaculate housekeeper was admissible under Evid.R. 406 to show she would likely have wiped the defendant\u2019s fingerprints off her glasses); see, also, <em>Perrin v. Anderson </em>(C.A.10, 1986), 784 F.2d 1040, 1045-1046 (five instances of violent encounters with the police sufficient to establish \u201chabit\u201d of reacting violently to uniformed police officers); <em>Meyer v. United States </em>(C.A.10, 1980), 638 F.2d 155, 156-158 (dentist\u2019s routine to advise patients of potential risks of extractions admissible to show that he acted in conformity with that habit when dealing with the plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 135} We also reject appellant\u2019s argument that habit evidence should not have been admitted because the testimony did not identify a specific manner that Murray used to notify her friends and family of her whereabouts. Testimony established that e-mails, phone calls, and notes were Murray\u2019s specific methods for notifying family and friends as to her whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 136} Finally, sufficient examples of Murray\u2019s conduct \u2022,demonstrated Murray\u2019s habit. Murray exchanged e-mails and phone calls with her parents on almost a daily basis, remained in daily contact with her father as to her whereabouts in Japan, and notified her parents about her trip to St. Louis. Moreover, college friends testified that Murray left notes and information as to her whereabouts on an erase board before departing on trips. Cf. <em>Bollinger, Inc. v. Mayerson </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 702, 715, 689 N.E.2d 62 (testimony about two isolated instances of alleged cheating was not sufficient evidence of habit under Evid.R. 406).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 137} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony about Murray\u2019s habit under Evid.R. 406. Thus, proposition X is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 138} <em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In proposition of law XII, appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome autopsy and crime-scene photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">{\u00b6 139} The defense failed to object to gruesome photographs at trial and has waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 49. The defense motion in limine to exclude crime-scene and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>gruesome photographs did not preserve this issue. <em>Gable v. Gates Mills, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 449, 2004-Ohio-5719, 816 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 140} Nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in capital cases as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 141} 1. Crime-scene photographs. Appellant complains about four crime-scene photographs. State\u2019s exhibits Nos. 47 through 49 depict Murray\u2019s body as it was found in the carpet. State\u2019s exhibit No. 116 depicts Murray\u2019s fully clothed body after the carpet was unrolled. There was no plain error in admitting this evidence. These photos portrayed Murray in relation to the crime scene and illustrated the testimony of Special Agent Wilgus and others who saw the crime scene. See <em>State v. Twyford, </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 358, 763 N.E.2d 122; <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 288, 754 N.E.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 142} 2. Autopsy photographs. Appellant also objects to nine autopsy photographs. State\u2019s exhibit No. 144 is a photograph of the carpet before it was unrolled and contains no image of Murray\u2019s body. State\u2019s exhibit No. 117 is a photograph of Murray\u2019s body from her thighs to beneath her breast line and shows that she is wearing a pair of panties with the word \u201cThursday\u201d on them. That evidence was relevant because Thursday was Murray\u2019s last day of work at the Pirate\u2019s Cove. State\u2019s exhibit No. 112 showed the tattoo of a dove on her back and was a prominent identifying mark on her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 143} State\u2019s exhibits Nos. 119, 148, and 149 depict Murray\u2019s right and left hands. These photographs supported the coroner\u2019s testimony that no blood spatter was found on Murray\u2019s hands or arms, an absence that helped show that Murray was not a suicide victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">{\u00b6 144} State\u2019s exhibit No. 147 is a decidedly gruesome photograph showing the entry gunshot wound in Murray\u2019s head. State\u2019s exhibit No. 146 is another gruesome photograph depicting the exit wound underneath Murray\u2019s ear. State\u2019s exhibit No. 145 is an X-ray of Murray\u2019s skull showing bullet fragments lodged in her head. These photographs supported the coroner\u2019s testimony that Murray suffered \u201cone gunshot wound * * * coming through the brain and the neck and coming out on the left side of the neck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">{\u00b6 145} No plain error occurred in admitting the autopsy photographs. The autopsy photographs depicted the' victim\u2019s wounds, illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony, and helped prove appellant\u2019s intent. See <em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 73; <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 146} We also reject appellant\u2019s complaint about the reintroduction of the photographs during the penalty phase. The defense did not object to their reintroduction at trial, and no plain error occurred by allowing these photographs into evidence. <em>Twyford, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 358, 763 N.E.2d 122; <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 147} Based on the forgoing, we overrule proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 148} <em>Admissibility of Murray\u2019s notebook and notepad. </em>In proposition of law XV, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit all of Murray\u2019s notebooks and notepads into evidence because they rebutted the state\u2019s evidence that she was a happy and upbeat person.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">{\u00b6 149} The police recovered Murray\u2019s notebooks and notepads from her dorm room. During the defense case, trial counsel sought to introduce all of Murray\u2019s writings into evidence. The trial court admitted most of Murray\u2019s composition notebook into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">{\u00b6 150} In reviewing the record, it appears that the documents admitted as defense exhibit H include Murray\u2019s reflections about her suicide attempt on May 5, 2000, her feelings about hospitalization and therapy, her self-analysis, and a drawing of a partial stick figure being hanged. Murray\u2019s letter to a friend dated June 14, 2000, is the latest date on any of the writings.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">{\u00b6 151} The trial court did not admit other parts of defense exhibit H that included undated loose papers, page 12 from the notebook, a legal pad that contained a letter dated January 2, 1999, and other undated writings. These miscellaneous papers contain fictional stories, several drawings, and Murray\u2019s reflections about life that did not mention suicide. The trial court also did not admit Murray\u2019s notebook pad and miscellaneous papers. Defense exhibit G includes fictional stories, letters to friends, and two undated notes that mention a friend\u2019s suicide attempt and discuss Murray\u2019s feelings about dying and suicide. The latest date on writings in defense exhibit G was July 20,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">{\u00b6 152} The notebooks and notepads that the trial court excluded from evidence were neither relevant nor admissible under Evid.R. 401. The evidence at the crime scene \u2014 Murray\u2019s body found rolled in a carpet \u2014 and the coroner\u2019s testimony ruled out suicide as a possible cause of death. Thus, testimony about Murray\u2019s depression and her fixation on death was simply not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">{\u00b6 153} Furthermore, any assertions contained in the excluded evidence were inadmissible hearsay. Evid.R. 803(3), the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, governs the admissibility of Murray\u2019s hearsay statements. Evid.R. 803(3) provides for the admissibility of \u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s <em>then </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>existing </em>state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 154} The excluded evidence was not admissible under Evid.R. 803(3), because the latest date on any of the documents was July 20, 1999, which was more than a year before Murray\u2019s death. The state\u2019s evidence about Murray\u2019s state of mind related to the summer and fall of 2000, just prior to her disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">{\u00b6 155} Moreover, none of Murray\u2019s excluded writings were admissible as statements of present intent to take future action. See <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 183, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343 (declarant\u2019s statement that she intended to \u201cbreak up\u201d with defendant admitted to negate defendant\u2019s contention that declarant was suicidal); <em>Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon </em>(1892), 145 U.S. 285, 295-296, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706. None of Murray\u2019s excluded statements or her other writings that were admitted into evidence indicate that she intended to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">{\u00b6 156} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit all the notebooks and notepads found in Murray\u2019s room. Moreover, appellant suffered no prejudice, because most of the documents from Murray\u2019s notebook and notepad that mentioned suicide were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">{\u00b6 157} Based on the foregoing, proposition XV is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">{\u00b6 158} <em>Course of conduct. </em>In proposition of law II, appellant argues that his conviction for a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d specification is based on insufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant also asserts that R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">{\u00b6 159} 1. Constitutional challenge. \u201cThe course-of-conduct specification set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) is not void for vagueness under either the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 533 N.E.2d 701, syllabus. Accord <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144; <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 155, 661 N.E.2d 1030. We find that no basis exists to overturn that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">{\u00b6 160} 2. Sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant contends that the murders of Murray and Julious were not part of a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Appellant argues that the murders occurred five and one-half months apart and Murray and Julious had no connection with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>{\u00b6 161} Our recent opinion in <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, syllabus, sets forth a test for \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d <em>Sapp </em>states, \u201cThe statutory phrase \u2018course of conduct\u2019 found in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) requires that the <em>state establish some factual link </em>between the aggravated murder with which the defendant is charged and the other murders or attempted murders that are alleged to make up the course of conduct. In order to find that two offenses constitute a single course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), the trier of fact \u2018must * * * discern some connection, common scheme, or some pattern or psychological thread that ties [the offenses] together.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., syllabus, quoting <em>State v. Cummings </em>(1992), 332 N.C. 487, 510, 422 S.E.2d 692. Moreover, \u201cthe factual link might be one of time, location, murder weapon, or cause of death.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52. Ultimately, \u201cwhen two or more offenses are alleged to constitute a course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), all the circumstances of the offense, must be taken into account.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">{\u00b6 162} Significant similarities exist between the two murders. Murray and Julious were both acquaintances of appellant. Appellant was driving alone with both victims before their disappearances. Appellant also shot both victims in the head and disposed of their bodies on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 163} Moreover, the passage of five and one-half months between the two murders does not invalidate appellant\u2019s course-of-conduct specification conviction. Indeed, \u201cmurders taking place at different times \u2018may satisfy the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification so long as the offender\u2019s actions were part of a continuing course of criminal conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 55, quoting <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">{\u00b6 164} In <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 57, \u00b6 61, this court found that murders committed more than a year apart were part of the same course of conduct because of common motive and similarity in the offenses. See, also, <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 444, 650 N.E.2d 878 (five murders over a five-month period represented a course of conduct); <em>Benner, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 320, 533 N.E.2d 701 (two murders and an attempted murder over a five-month period evidenced a course of conduct). In this case, the similarities in the Murray and Julious murders establish a course of conduct despite the lapse of five and one-half months.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">{\u00b6 165} In conclusion, we reject appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for a course-of-conduct specification in the murders of Julious and Murray. The two murders involved similarities in the commission of the offenses, the causes of death, and the disposal of the bodies. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we find that evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of a course-of-conduct specification in the murders of Julious and Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 166} As to appellant\u2019s manifest-weight challenge, we find that this is not \u201c \u2018the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019\u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. The jury neither lost its way nor created a miscarriage of justice in convicting appellant on the course-of-conduct specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">{\u00b6 167} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">{\u00b6 168} <em>Joinder. </em>In proposition of law VI, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever Count 6, the charge for Julious\u2019s murder, from the rest of the charges. Appellant argues that joinder of the charges was improper because the Julious and Murray murders were unrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">{\u00b6 169} \u201cThe law favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial under Crim.R. 8(A) if the offenses charged \u2018are of the same or similar character.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, quoting Crim.R. 8(A). A defendant requesting severance \u201chas the burden of furnishing the trial court with sufficient information so that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Torres </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. A defendant claiming error in the denial of severance must affirmatively show that his rights were prejudiced and that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing separate tri\u00e1is. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">{\u00b6 170} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to sever, and appellant was not prejudiced by joinder. First, evidence of Julious\u2019s murder was necessary to prove the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), course-of-conduct specification. See <em>State v. Hamblin </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 524 N.E.2d 476; see, also, <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 71; <em>Benner, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 306, 533 N.E.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">{\u00b6 171} Moreover, the evidence proving the two murders was interlocking. Indeed, evidence relating to both murders would have been admissible at separate trials to prove appellant\u2019s identity by modus operandi under Evid.R. 404(B). See, generally, <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 185, 552 N.E.2d 180. During each murder, appellant was alone with the victim, drove with the victim somewhere, shot the victim in the head, and disposed of the body at his trailer. See <em>Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">{\u00b6 172} Finally, the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt is \u201camply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 344, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. Circumstantial evidence, forensic testimony, and appellant\u2019s own statements provided strong evidence of his guilt for each murder. The strength of the state\u2019s proof \u201cestablishes that the prosecution did not attempt to prove one case simply by questionable evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>other offenses.\u201d <em>Jamison, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 187, 552 N.E.2d 180. Based on the foregoing, proposition VI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>Juror misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">{\u00b6 173} 1. Sleeping jurors. In proposition of law XI, appellant asserts that sleeping jurors violated his right to a fair trial. The first alleged instance of a juror\u2019s sleeping was raised following Detective Brenneman\u2019s direct examination, when the prosecutor informed the trial court:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">{\u00b6 174} \u201cMr. Gleeson: Your Honor, Mr. Miller requests, he\u2019s noticing some of the jurors are kind of sweltering. Perhaps we should give them ten minutes to walk around, put on the air conditioner. Of course, I think they\u2019re sleeping, and it\u2019s not to cross yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">{\u00b6 175} \u201cThe Court: I agree. I think that\u2019s appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">{\u00b6 176} \u201cMr. Miller: That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">{\u00b6 177} The second alleged instance of a juror\u2019s sleeping was raised by the prosecutor following Heather Zollman\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">{\u00b6 178} \u201cMr. Gleeson: Your Honor, I take full responsibility for this because my presentation was probably not very exciting, but Melissa Trivette, one of our jurors, is like asleep. She\u2019s not now, she\u2019s wide awake. The cross must have been exciting, woke her up. But I would just ask the Court to pay attention to her to see if she is dozing off, and if we need to take any corrective measures because of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">{\u00b6 179} \u201cThe Court: Okay. Well, the Court would note that she doesn\u2019t really look around that much anyway. It\u2019s her position pretty much to just sit there and look straight ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">{\u00b6 180} \u201cMr. Gleeson: Well, she was sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">{\u00b6 181} \u201cThe Court: I\u2019m not doubting that. I\u2019m not doubting that. I\u2019m just saying that she does not look around \u2014 move around like other jurors typically do, or even * * * the other jurors here do. She just pretty much * * * maintains a fixed position, as she has throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">{\u00b6 182} \u201cMr. Canepa: Yeah, Judge. Tim actually said the same thing to me, but I said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s usually true, except she had her eyes closed and her head down.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">{\u00b6 183} \u201cThe Court: The Court will certainly take note of that, and be aware of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-17\">{\u00b6 184} It is well established that \u201c \u2018[t]he trial judge is in the best position to determine the nature of the alleged jury misconduct\u2019 and \u2018the appropriate remedies for any demonstrated misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sherrill </em>(C.A.6, 2004), 388 F.3d 535, 537, quoting <em>United States v. Copeland </em>(C.A.6, 1995), 51 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>611, 613. Moreover, a trial court has \u201c \u2018considerable discretion in deciding how to handle a sleeping juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 253, 750 N.E.2d 90, quoting <em>United States v. Freitag </em>(C.A.7, 2000), 230 F.3d 1019, 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 185} Appellant argues that the trial court should have questioned Juror Trivette to determine whether she was sleeping, or in the alternative, Juror Trivette should have been dismissed and replaced by an alternate juror. The defense did not request either remedy at trial and expressed no dissatisfaction with the trial court\u2019s handling of the matter. Thus, in the absence of plain error, this claim is waived. See <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 186} No plain error occurred. There was only a vague allegation that jurors were sleeping when the issue was first raised with the trial court. Juror Trivette was alleged to have been asleep during a later portion of the trial, but the defense has provided no evidence that this juror was in fact sleeping. Thus, whether Juror Trivette or any other juror was in fact sleeping is speculative. The trial court observed that Juror Trivette did not \u201cmove around like other jurors * * * [and] just [maintained] a fixed position, as she [had] throughout.\u201d The trial court noted counsel\u2019s concern about Juror Trivette\u2019s sleeping, but no further concern about sleeping jurors was raised during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 187} Moreover, appellant has provided no evidence of prejudice. Nothing in the record shows what part of the testimony, if any, jurors actually missed. See <em>Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 253, 750 N.E.2d 90 (affirming conviction where there was no evidence that the juror missed large or critical portions of the trial). Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">{\u00b6 188} 2. Outside conversations. In proposition of law XIII, appellant argues that he was denied a fair trial because one juror discussed the case with a nonjuror during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">{\u00b6 189} During the state\u2019s case, the prosecutor informed the trial court that Amy Warrix reported that her boyfriend, Terry Stewart, a juror, \u201chas been talking to her about the case.\u201d The trial court then called Juror Stewart into chambers for questioning. Juror Stewart denied talking with Warrix about the trial. He stated that he had \u201cnever discussed the case with her at all, nothing about the facts or that deals with the case at all.\u201d Juror Stewart said that Warrix may have made these allegations against him because he had \u201cleft her last night, and she\u2019s a mean, hateful girl.\u201d Juror Stewart said that when Warrix tried to talk to him about the case, he told her, \u201cI\u2019m under oath not to talk about it and not to hear about it.\u201d He also told the court that he had followed those instructions. Juror Stewart also assured the court that he did not acquire any outside information about the case as a result of being around Warrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>{\u00b6 190} Following the completion of Juror Stewart\u2019s questioning, defense counsel stated, \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with his explanation.\u201d Defense counsel indicated that no further inquiry was necessary and declined the opportunity to question Warrix. The trial court then stated, \u201cThe Court is satisfied as well at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 191} In cases involving outside influences on jurors, trial courts are granted \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in dealing with the contact and determining whether to declare a mistrial or to replace an affected juror. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 89, 656 N.E.2d 643. A trial court is permitted to rely on a juror\u2019s testimony in determining that juror\u2019s impartiality. <em>State v. Herring </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 259, 762 N.E.2d 940. Moreover, issues concerning the weight given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Here, the trial court\u2019s ruling reflects that the court believed the juror\u2019s denial that he talked to Warrix about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b6 192} Appellant argues that the trial court was obligated to conduct a <em>Remmer </em>hearing to question Warrix, and possibly other jurors, before making a determination that no improper contact had occurred. See <em>Remmer v. United States </em>(1954), 347 U.S. 227, 229-230, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654. The defense, however, was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the juror\u2019s explanation and indicated that no further inquiry into the allegations was necessary. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. See <em>Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 252, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Henness </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 53, 65, 679 N.E.2d 686 (upholding a trial court\u2019s refusal to question each juror individually).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 193} Appellant has failed to demonstrate that any juror misconduct occurred, and proposition XIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">{\u00b6 194} <em>Courtroom outbursts. </em>In proposition of law XVI, appellant contends that courtroom outbursts deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 195} The first outburst occurred during the defense closing argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">{\u00b6 196} \u201c[Mr. Toy:] Why would [Gregory McKnight] want to kill Emily? * * * Emily liked Greg, according to Abigail Williams. Emily and Greg were considering a relationship, according to Nate Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">{\u00b6 197} \u201cAudience member: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">{\u00b6 198} \u201cMr. Toy: That\u2019s what he testified to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">{\u00b6 199} The trial counsel did not object to the outburst or request corrective action. Trial counsel then completed his closing argument without further disruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">{\u00b6 200} The second outburst occurred following the trial court\u2019s announcement of the death sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>{\u00b6201} \u201c[The Court:] It is, therefore, the judgment of this Court that the aggravating circumstance in Count 1 of this case outweighs the mitigating factors by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant is hereby sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">{\u00b6 202} \u201cAudience member: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">{\u00b6 203} \u201cThe impact of emotional outbursts at trial by witnesses or spectators cannot be judged by an appellate court on a cold record. \u2018Was the jury disturbed, alarmed, shocked or deeply moved? * * * These questions necessarily depend on facts which no record can reflect.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068, quoting <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 38, 40, 32 O.O.2d 21, 209 N.E.2d 215. Thus, a trial court must determine, as a question of fact, whether an emotional outburst deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 44. \u201cIn the absence of clear, affirmative eyidence to the contrary, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 255, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">{\u00b6 204} The record does not show whether the jurors heard the first outburst, and if so, whether it had any effect on them. Further, neither counsel brought the outburst to the trial court\u2019s attention. Thus, it would be speculative to conclude that the one-word outburst was disruptive or prejudicial. Under these circumstances, we find that no \u201cclear, affirmative evidence\u201d exists that the outburst deprived appellant of a fair trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">{\u00b6 205} The jury had been discharged when the second outburst occurred during the announcement of the sentence. Clearly, no prejudice resulted. Accordingly, we find that proposition XVI has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">{\u00b6 206} <em>Defendant\u2019s absence. </em>In proposition of law XIV, appellant argues that his absence during trial proceedings violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">{\u00b6 207} During pretrial proceedings on June 5, 2002, defense counsel informed the trial court that appellant did not object to being absent from conferences in chambers. The trial court then obtained appellant\u2019s consent to his absence during in-chambers proceedings:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">{\u00b6208} \u201cJudge Simmons: * * * Just * * * [so] I\u2019m fully satisfied you\u2019re in agreement, Mr. McKnight, but * * * you just heard what Mr. Carson said about * * * any discussions in chambers with counsel that that would be * * * [the] way those are typically conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">{\u00b6 209} \u201cMr. McKnight: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">{\u00b6 210} \u201cJudge Simmons: And he indicated that you and he were in agreement that that could be done in that way and * * * is that your agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">{\u00b6 211} \u201cMr. McKnight: Yes, I * * * agree with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>{\u00b6 212} Appellant was absent from the in-chambers conference on allegations of juror misconduct. See Proposition XIII. Trial counsel waived appellant\u2019s presence and stated that appellant\u2019s absence was \u201cby agreement or our position, he does not need to be present.\u201d Appellant was also absent from an in-chambers conference on proposed jury instructions. Trial counsel did not expressly waive appellant\u2019s presence at that conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 213} Appellant had a fundamental right to be present at all stages of his criminal trial. Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 43(A). A defendant\u2019s absence, however, does not necessarily result in prejudicial or constitutional error. See <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 371, 738 N.E.2d 1208; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 285-287, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 214} Appellant personally waived his right to be present at in-chambers conferences, and his waiver was valid for the two in-chambers proceedings that he now challenges. Thus, appellant\u2019s absence from the two in-chambers conferences was consistent with his wishes. See <em>Rice v. Wood </em>(C.A.9, 1995), 44 F.3d 1396, 1400 (defendant can waive his right to be present); see,, also, <em>Polizzi v. United States </em>(C.A.2, 1991), 926 F.2d 1311, 1322-1323 (counsel can waive the defendant\u2019s right to be present).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 215} Appellant also fails to demonstrate how his absence prejudiced him. See <em>United States v. Brown </em>(C.A.6, 1978), 571 F.2d 980, 987 (defendant must establish prejudice in absence from in-chambers conference). Appellant\u2019s counsel was present during both conferences and fully participated. Moreover, the conferences mostly involved legal issues within the professional competence of counsel, not issues that appellant must personally decide. See <em>United States v. Gagnon </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 522, 526, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486 (defendant\u2019s absence from an in-camera hearing involving a juror, where counsel was present, did not offend due process); see, also, <em>State v. White </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 26, 693 N.E.2d 772 (defendant\u2019s absence during hearing on proposed jury instructions did not deny him a fair trial). Thus, proposition XIV is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 216} <em>Defendant\u2019s shackling. </em>In proposition of law XVII, appellant contends that he was denied a fair trial when the jury saw him shackled.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 217} After the jury had started guilt-phase deliberations, the jury returned to the courtroom for instructions prior to retiring for the evening. Appellant was placed in handcuffs while the jurors were leaving the courtroom. Although trial counsel acknowledged that the handcuffing was \u201cinadvertent,\u201d the defense requested a mistrial. In overruling the motion for mistrial, the trial court stated that \u201cMr. McKnight has appeared throughout all stages of the proceedings, * * * whenever the jury has been present, * * * he has appeared in street clothing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and he has appeared free of any restraints of any type, at least anything visible to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">{\u00b6 218} Over defense objection, the trial court provided a curative instruction before the jury resumed its deliberations. The trial court advised the jury: \u201cIf you have seen Gregory B. McKnight in any type of restraints at any time during this proceeding, you are hereby instructed to disregard it, as it does not bear on his guilt or innocence in any manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 219} No one should be tried while shackled, absent unusual circumstances. <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even though the jury saw appellant handcuffed on one occasion, appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice. The jury\u2019s view of him was brief and inadvertent. Cf. <em>State v. Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 285-286, 513 N.E.2d 311 (danger of prejudice is slight where a juror\u2019s view of defendant in custody is brief, inadvertent, and outside of the courtroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 220} Moreover, the trial court\u2019s curative instruction removed any prejudice. See <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59, 656 N.E.2d 623 (jury presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s curative instructions). Thus, the fact that the jury observed appellant handcuffed on one occasion did not deprive him of a fair trial. Accordingly, we find that proposition XVII lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>Trial-phase instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 221} 1. Instructions on credibility. In proposition of law IX, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s preliminary instructions on credibility were improper. Trial counsel, however, failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 222} During preliminary guilt-phase instructions, the court advised the jury: \u201cThe testimony of one witness believed by you is sufficient to prove any fact. <em>Also, discrepancies in a ivitness\u2019 testimony, or between his testimony and that of others, if there are any, does not necessarily mean that you should disbelieve the witness, as people commonly forget facts or recollect them erroneously after the passage of time. </em>You are certainly all aware of the fact that two persons who are witnesses to an incident may often see or hear it differently. In considering a discrepancy in witness testimony, you should consider whether such discrepancy concerns an important fact or a trivial one.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These preliminary instructions on credibility were not repeated during the closing instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>{\u00b6 223} Crim.R. 30(B) permits the trial court to give cautionary jury instructions relating to credibility and weight of the evidence. The preliminary instructions clarified the jury\u2019s function in judging credibility and determining the weight to assign the testimony. Moreover, this instruction is virtually identical to instructions approved in <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 51-56. Thus, we find no plain error in these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 224} 2. Duplicative instructions. In proposition of law XVTII, appellant argues that the instructions on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) escaping-detection specification and the separate kidnapping and aggravated-robbery charges were duplicative and violated his right to a unanimous jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 225} Appellant\u2019s failure to object to the allegedly duplicative nature of the instructions waived all but plain error. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Moreover, appellant\u2019s proposed instructions included language that he now contends was erroneous. Thus, appellant invited any error and may not \u201c \u2018take advantage of an error which he himself invited or induced.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 709 N.E.2d 484, quoting <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 17, 564 N.E.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 226} We reject appellant\u2019s claims on the basis of plain error and invited error. Instructions on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification referred to appellant\u2019s committing the murders for \u201cthe purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial or punishment for <em>kidnapping and/or a theft offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Appellant argues that this instruction deprived him of his right to a unanimous jury verdict because some of the jurors may have convicted him of the (A)(3) specification on the basis of kidnapping and others on the basis of aggravated robbery. The jurors did not convict appellant of the (A)(3) specification on alternative theories, because the same jury separately convicted him of <em>both </em>kidnapping and aggravated robbery. Cf. <em>State v. Noling, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 68; <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 664, 693 N.E.2d 246. Thus, the outcome of appellant\u2019s case would not have been different had the instructions been worded differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 227} On the kidnapping charge, the jury was instructed to determine whether \u201cMcKnight, by force, threat or deception, <em>did remove Emily Murray </em>from the place where she was found or <em>restrain Emily Murray </em>of her liberty for the purpose of terrorizing or inflicting serious physical harm on Emily Murray.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On the aggravated-robbery charge, the jury was instructed to determine whether appellant <em>\u201cknowingly obtained </em>or <em>exerted control </em>over the green Subaru Outback without the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent or <em>by threat.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Appellant argues that both sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of instructions deprived him of a unanimous jury verdict because the jury was instructed on alternative means for committing these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 228} Neither the kidnapping nor the aggravated-robbery instructions were improper, because the alternatives were given to the jury disjunctively. <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 30, 752 N.E.2d 859; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 527, 605 N.E.2d 70. Jurors need not agree on a single means for committing these offenses. The United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201c \u2018[Djifferent jurors may be persuaded by different pieces of evidence, even when they agree upon the bottom line. Plainly there is no general requirement that the jury reach agreement on the preliminary factual issues which underlie the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schad v. Arizona </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 624, 631-632, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555, quoting <em>McKoy v. North Carolina </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 433, 449, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 229} Based on the foregoing, proposition XVIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 230} 3. Instructions on release in a \u201csafe place unharmed.\u201d In proposition of law XX, appellant claims that the kidnapping instructions were flawed because of instructions on whether Murray was released \u201cin a safe place unharmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 231} The indictment charging kidnapping included language that \u201cthe said Gregory B. McKnight did not release the said Emily S. Murray in a safe place unharmed.\u201d The trial court\u2019s guilt-phase instructions on kidnapping stated, \u201cIf you find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the offense of kidnapping, your verdict must be guilty. You must then go on to decide whether Emily Murray was or was not released in a safe place unharmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 232} Although the defense did not object at trial, the defense\u2019s proposed instructions on kidnapping omitted the \u201creleased unharmed in a safe place\u201d from its charge. Thus, the defense has preserved this issue. See <em>Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 160, 661 N.E.2d 1030; <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443, paragraph one of the syllabus. Nevertheless, no prejudicial error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 233} Under R.C. 2905.01(C), the offense of kidnapping is generally a first-degree felony but may be reduced to a second-degree felony if \u201cthe offender releases the victim in a safe place unharmed.\u201d This provision, however, is not an element of the offense; rather, the defendant must plead and prove that assertion as an affirmative defense. <em>State v. Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 265, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Cornute </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 199, 18 O.O.3d 152, 412 N.E.2d 416, syllabus. Appellant never argued that Murray was released unharmed in a safe place. Thus, the language was not properly at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 234} Appellant argues that the instruction on release in a \u201csafe place unharmed\u201d was prejudicial, turning a mitigating circumstance into an aggravating element. That assertion, however, is speculative. Moreover, overwhelming evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict on the kidnapping and murder charges. Consequently, appellant suffered no prejudice by the finding of the jury that Murray was not released \u201cin a safe place unharmed.\u201d Thus, we overrule proposition XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 235} <em>Vagueness challenge. </em>In proposition of law XIX, appellant argues that the term \u201cserious physical harm,\u201d as defined by R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e), is unconstitutionally vague on its face and unconstitutional as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 236} The instructions on \u201cserious physical harm\u201d related to the felony-murder charge, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) kidnapping specification, and kidnapping. The trial court used the definition of \u201cserious physical harm\u201d set forth in R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(b), (c), (d), and (e) in instructing the jury on \u201cserious physical harm\u201d: \u201c \u2018Serious physical harm to persons\u2019 means any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death or any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary substantial incapacity, or any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary serious disfigurement or <em>any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 237} Appellant argues that R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e) does not give fair notice to persons of ordinary intelligence that they might be guilty of kidnapping by causing \u201cprolonged or intractable pain\u201d to a victim. Although appellant did not challenge the statute as vague at trial, he argues that the error was not waived, because the defense submitted a set of properly worded jury instructions. See <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443, paragraph one of the syllabus. The defense\u2019s proposed instructions did not define \u201cserious physical harm,\u201d and thus the defense waived this issue absent plain error. <em>Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 44. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 238} To withstand a claim of vagueness, a criminal statute must define a criminal offense with sufficient clarity for ordinary people to understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>Akron v. Rowland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 381, 618 N.E.2d 138, citing <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222; see, also, <em>Papachristou v. Jacksonville </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 239} R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e) is not vague on its face, nor is it unconstitutional as applied to appellant. The statute provides a precisely worded definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201cserious physical harm to persons\u201d that a person of ordinary intelligence can understand. If a person inflicts \u201c[a]ny physical harm that involves acute pain [that results] in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged * * * pain,\u201d that person has committed \u201cserious physical harm.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). Further, the statute does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>State v. Morris </em>(Nov. 13, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 51279, 1986 WL 12861, at *3-4 (ruling that the definition of \u201cserious physical harm\u201d was not constitutionally vague). Thus, we reject proposition XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Penalty-phase issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b6240} <em>Victim testimony for life sentence. </em>In proposition of law XXII, appellant argues that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by refusing to allow Murray\u2019s family members and friends to testify that he should receive a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 241} Before the penalty phase, the defense requested a continuance to develop testimony that Murray\u2019s family members wanted appellant to receive a life sentence. An affidavit from Kathleen Murray, the victim\u2019s sister, requested a life sentence because of the family\u2019s following concerns: a death sentence would result in appeals that would continue to cause pain to the family, Emily would not have wanted appellant to receive the death penalty, and appellant should not receive the death penalty for the sake of his own children. In denying the defense motion, the trial court held that \u201cthe position of the victim\u2019s family as to the death penalty is not a relevant mitigating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">{\u00b6 242} Additional requests that appellant receive a life sentence were submitted to the trial court before sentencing and included a statement from the victim\u2019s parents and letters and e-mails from several of Murray\u2019s friends. The trial court did not consider these statements in sentencing appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">{\u00b6 243} First, appellant argues that proposed testimony from Murray\u2019s family members recommending that he receive a life sentence was linked to his \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cbackground\u201d and therefore admissible under R.C. 2929.04(B). Such testimony had no bearing on appellant\u2019s history, character, or background. Similarly, sentencing recommendations from Murray\u2019s family members did not constitute relevant mitigation under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), which encompasses \u201c[a]ny other factors that are <em>relevant </em>to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">{\u00b6 244} Other jurisdictions that have considered the admissibility of sentencing recommendations opposing the death penalty from a victim\u2019s family members have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Robison v. Maynard </em>(C.A.10, 1991), 943 F.2d 1216, 1217-1218 (opinion of victim\u2019s relative irrelevant to jury\u2019s determination of whether 'death penalty should be imposed); <em>Commonwealth v. Bomar </em>(2003), 573 Pa. 426, 460-461, 826 A.2d 831 (testimony of victim\u2019s mother opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the death penalty irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s character, record, or circumstances of the crime); <em>Ware v. State </em>(2000), 360 Md. 650, 691, 759 A.2d 764 (testimony that victim\u2019s family does not wish death sentence imposed has no bearing on defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or circumstances of the offense); <em>State v. Bowman </em>(1998), 349 N.C. 459, 478, 509 S.E.2d 428 (\u201cconflicting feelings\u201d of victim\u2019s mother regarding death penalty not relevant); <em>State v. Pirtle </em>(1995) 127 Wash.2d 628, 671, 904 P.2d 245 (victim\u2019s essay stating general opposition to death penalty inadmissible because it was not pertinent to extenuating circumstances or defendant\u2019s moral culpability).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">{\u00b6 245} Furthermore, appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the exclusion of testimony from Murray\u2019s family members recommending that appellant receive a life sentence. In <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, a plurality of the court held that a jury should \u201cnot be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973. It noted, however, that \u201c[njothing in this opinion limits the traditional authority of a court to exclude, as irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of his offense.\u201d Id. at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, fn. 12. Here, possible testimony from Murray\u2019s family members recommending a life sentence had no relevance to appellant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 246} Second, appellant contends that the life-sentence recommendations from Murray\u2019s family were admissible as victim-impact testimony. This argument also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 247} In <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 553 N.E.2d 1058, syllabus, this court held, \u201cExpressions of opinion by a witness as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence in a capital case violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have the sentencing decision made by the jury and judge.\u201d Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court held, \u201c[I]f the State chooses to permit the admission of victim impact evidence and prosecutorial argument on that subject, the Eighth Amendment erects no <em>per se </em>bar.\u201d <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, overruling <em>Booth v.

Gathers </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 805, 811, 109 S.Ct. 2207, 104 L.Ed.2d 876 (extending <em>Booth </em>to prohibit prosecutor\u2019s statements regarding personal characteristics of victim). <em>Payne </em>did not reexamine the propriety of victims\u2019 families\u2019 recommendations as to the appropriate sentence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>sanction their admission. See <em>Payne, </em>501 U.S. at 830, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 248} Since <em>Payne, </em>this court has adhered to <em>Huertas </em>and \u201cprohibited the admission of witnesses\u2019 opinions as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.\u201d <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 487, 739 N.E.2d 749; <em>State v.

Thus, the recommendations of the Murray family concerning the appropriate sentence were not admissible as victim-impact testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 249} Finally, we find that the trial court did not err by failing to consider the recommendations from Murray\u2019s family and friends before imposing the death sentence. Cf. <em>Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 88 (sentencing recommendation from victim\u2019s family not reversible error unless the judge actually considered it in sentencing the defendant to death).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 250} Based on the foregoing, proposition XXII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\n<em>Penalty-phase instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 251} 1. Instructions on \u201csuperaggravating\u201d circumstance. In proposition of law XXI, appellant argues that the instructions of the trial court improperly merged aggravating circumstances under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) and 2929.04(A)(5) into one \u201csuperaggravating\u201d circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">{\u00b6 252} During preliminary penalty-phase instructions, the jury was advised that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) kidnapping and aggravated-robbery aggravating circumstances and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance were recounted as a single aggravating circumstance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court later instructed the jury to consider the kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and course-of-conduct specifications as three separate aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">{\u00b6 253} During final instructions, the jury was again instructed that there was a single aggravating circumstance: \u201cIn the first phase of this trial, you found Gregory B. McKnight guilty of one count of aggravated murder during the commission of kidnapping. You also found him guilty of specifications of aggravating circumstances. There were four of them, but to ensure that the weighing process is not influenced by mere numbers, the aggravating circumstances of which you found Gregory B. McKnight guilty have been merged into one aggravating circumstance. It is as follows: The aggravated murder was committed while Gregory B. McKnight was committing or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>aggravated robbery of Emily S. Murray and Gregory B. McKnight was the principal offender, and the aggravated murder was part of a course of conduct by Gregory B. McKnight involving killing two or more persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">{\u00b6 254} R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) specifies that the jury shall recommend a sentence of death \u201c[i]f the trial jury unanimously finds, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d Moreover, \u201c \u2018the \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d against which the mitigating evidence is to be weighed are limited to the specifications of aggravating circumstances set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(1) through (8) that have been alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 360-361, 738 N.E.2d 1208, quoting <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accord <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 544 N.E.2d 895, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 255} We find that the two R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) aggravating circumstances were not duplicative, and they should not have been merged into a single aggravating circumstance, because the jury was obligated to <em>\u201cseparately </em>weigh the aggravating circumstances\u201d of each count against the mitigating factors. (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 96; see, also, <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 532, 684 N.E.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 256} The error, however, was not prejudicial. Grouping the aggravating circumstances did not alter their substance. The trial court advised the jury that the aggravating circumstances were merged into a single aggravating circumstance \u201cto ensure that the weighing process is not influenced by mere numbers.\u201d Cf. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 115, 684 N.E.2d 668. Moreover, we have independently reevaluated the sentence and thereby rectify any error in the merger of the aggravating circumstances. <em>State v. Twyford, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 352, 763 N.E.2d 122; <em>Cook, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 527, 605 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 257} Based on the foregoing, proposition XXI is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 258} 2. Instructions on mitigating factors and readmitted evidence. In proposition of law XXIII, appellant alleges two errors in the penalty-phase instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">{\u00b6 259} First, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it did not have to unanimously find mitigating factors. See <em>Mills v. Maryland </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 367, 383, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (jury may not be instructed that it must unanimously agree on a mitigating factor before that factor may be weighed against an aggravating circumstance). Appellant did not request that the court instruct the jury that it need not unanimously find mitigating circumstances and thus waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 30(A); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Appellant cites no instructional language that \u201ccould reasonably be taken to require unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor.\u201d <em>Coe v. Bell </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 161 F.3d 320, 338. Because the jury was not so instructed, <em>Mills </em>was not violated. See <em>Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 268, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Goff </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 129, 694 N.E.2d 916. Thus, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">{\u00b6 260} Second, appellant contends that the trial court erred by readmitting all the guilt-phase evidence during the penalty phase and then advising the jury to \u201cconsider all of the testimony and evidence relevant to the aggravating circumstance Gregory B. McKnight was found guilty of committing.\u201d Appellant failed to object and waived all but plain error. See <em>Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 261} To the extent that the jury may have interpreted the instructions as allowing them to determine relevancy, the trial court erred. It is \u201cthe trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866. Nevertheless, much of the guilt-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstances, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the mitigating factors. Further, properly admitted evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 208. Thus, we find that the trial court\u2019s misstatement did not result in plain error. Proposition XXIII is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 262} <em>Life-sentence options. </em>In proposition of law XXIV, appellant argues that the penalty-phase instructions and the language of the verdict forms improperly placed the burden of proof on the defense for the life-sentence options.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 263} The defense failed to object to these instructions and verdict forms and waived all but plain error. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Moreover, the defense-proposed jury instructions on the life-sentence options included language almost identical to that on the verdict forms. Appellant cannot complain, because he invited any error. <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 493, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>Seiber, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 17, 564 N.E.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">{\u00b6 264} Additionally, there was no plain error. The trial court instructed the jury: \u201cIf all twelve of you find that the State of Ohio proved beyond a reasonable doubt * * * that the aggravating circumstance * * * is sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors in this case, then it will be your duty to decide that the sentence of death shall be imposed on Gregory B. McKnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">{\u00b6 265} \u201cIf you find that the State of Ohio has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance Gregory B. McKnight was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>guilty of committing is sufficient to outweigh the mitigating facts present in this case, then it will be your duty to decide which of the * * * life sentence alternatives should be imposedf.] * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">{\u00b6 266} \u201cIf the weight of the aggravating circumstance and mitigating factors are equal, then you must proceed to consider the life sentence alternatives. You are not required to unanimously find that the State failed to prove that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors before considering one of the life sentence alternatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 267} The language in the verdict forms tracked these instructions. The three verdict forms presenting life sentence options stated: \u201cWe, the jury, being duly impaneled and sworn, do hereby find that the aggravating circumstance that Gregory B. McKnight was found guilty of committing, does not outweigh the mitigating factors presented in this case by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The verdict forms then provided the jury with the options of life imprisonment with parole, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 30 years, or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 268} The instructions and the language of the verdict forms for the life-sentence options did not place the burden of proof on the defense. When read as a whole, the instructions of the trial court and the language of the verdict forms effectively informed the jury that a death-penalty recommendation could be returned only after a unanimous vote that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 117, 666 N.E.2d 1099. As to the life-sentence options, the instructions and the language of the verdict forms simply instructed the jury that it <em>must </em>decide among the life-sentence options <em>if </em>it found that the state had failed to prove that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 29, 676 N.E.2d 82. We reject proposition XXIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Prosecutorial misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 269} In proposition of law XXVII, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making prejudicial statements during both phases of the trial. The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14-15, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone for analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 270} <em>Victim-impact evidence and argument. </em>Appellant recasts his objections to victim-impact and character evidence into claims of prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, appellant maintains that the prosecutor erred by presenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>testimony about Murray\u2019s character and the impact of her death on friends and family. He also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and final argument commenting on the character and victim-impact evidence constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant failed to object and waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus. As discussed earlier in proposition III, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments and presentation of testimony were not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 271} <em>Other-acts evidence. </em>First, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by eliciting testimony that the police went to appellant\u2019s trailer to serve him with an indictment for burglary. Defense counsel failed to object and waived all but plain error. See <em>Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 272} During direct examination, Vinton County Chief Deputy Sheriff Charles Boyer explained how Murray\u2019s car was found at appellant\u2019s trailer:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 273} \u201cQ: Okay. Now, let\u2019s rewind a minute here. You talked to Matt Kight; you told him to return to a scene. What scene are we talking about?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 274} \u201cA: On Clark Road, the McKnight residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 275} \u201cQ: Okay. And the vehicle that you\u2019re talking about, tell us the circumstances surrounding why you were asking the deputy to go back and recheck this vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">{\u00b6 276} \u201cA: Well, * * * we had the indictment on Mr. McKnight on the burglary, he had made a statement about people from New York being involved\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">{\u00b6 277} \u201cQ: Okay, let me stop you there.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">{\u00b6 278} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">{\u00b6 279} \u201c(Counsel approached the bench and the following proceedings were had out of the hearing of the jury:)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">{\u00b6 280} \u201cMr. Canepa: With the Court\u2019s permission, I\u2019d like to be able to advise Deputy Boyer to not discuss any further the burglary or the indictment. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid it, but obviously \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">{\u00b6 281} \u201cMr. Carson: I didn\u2019t object, because it just draws more attention to it * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">{\u00b6 282} \u201cMr. Canepa: Right. I\u2019m going to advise him to stay away from that. At this juncture, if you can think of a curative instruction, I would not be opposed to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">{\u00b6 283} \u201cMr. Carson: I think I would almost prefer to let it go, because I think it just draws more attention back to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>{\u00b6 284} Boyer then finished testifying without any further reference to an indictment for burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 285} There was no plain error. Boyer\u2019s reference to the uncharged burglary indictment was isolated and of relatively minor significance given the gravity of the offenses for which appellant was being tried. Moreover, the prosecutor took Immediate steps to ensure that Boyer\u2019s inadvertent comments were not repeated. Cf. <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 161, 749 N.E.2d 226 (improper testimony about defendant\u2019s failure to pay child support was not plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 286} Second, appellant argues that the prosecutor misbehaved by introducing testimony about appellant\u2019s marital infidelities and then referring to that testimony during closing argument. As discussed in proposition III, the testimony of appellant\u2019s co-workers Amber Hammers and Gloria Ressler helped establish appellant\u2019s plan by modus operandi evidence under Evid.R. 404(B). Testimony that appellant and Lisa Perkins had had sex in his car and that he spent evenings with Perkins at Dana Bostic\u2019s home was improper. Nevertheless, the error was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 351, 528 N.E.2d 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 287} Finally, appellant correctly points out that the prosecutor improperly introduced evidence of his reaction to the presence of the police. As discussed in proposition of law III, appellant\u2019s reaction to the police occurred <em>before </em>he murdered either Julious or Murray and thus was inadmissible. We find that the testimony was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 288} <em>Guilt-phase argument. </em>Appellant argues that various aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s guilt-phase argument resulted in prosecutorial misconduct. The defense failed to object and waived all but plain error. See <em>Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604-605, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">{\u00b6 289} First, appellant asserts that the prosecutor acted improperly when he speculated about what was in Murray\u2019s mind. Testimony was introduced that Murray returned to her dorm room on the night she disappeared and got her keys. The prosecutor argued that this was for the purpose of \u201cgiving Greg a ride home to Met O Wood Lane in Gambier, not to Vinton County. That\u2019s what was in Emily\u2019s mind.\u201d This argument represented fair comment on the evidence and was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">{\u00b6 290} Second, appellant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal improperly responded to defense arguments. During closing argument, trial counsel discussed the state\u2019s failure to test the DNA of blood found on the .357 Ruger that had belonged to Kimberly Zimmerman, the sister of Kathy McKnight. Counsel argued that even though \u201cthe gun was ruled out as the possible gun used in Emily Murray\u2019s case, why wouldn\u2019t [the police] check it for Julious?\u201d According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>to the defense, the failure to conduct DNA testing was \u201ca colossal blunder, * * * a deliberate act, and it ought to make you sick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 291} In rebuttal, the prosecutor reminded the jury, \u201cThis gun was tested ballistically. This gun was not the murder weapon that was held up to Emily Murray\u2019s head and shot through her skull.\u201d The prosecutor then argued, \u201cHow does this blow the whole case out of the water? It doesn\u2019t, not at all. This gun was at the Zimmermans\u2019 in May. \u2018Now, it wasn\u2019t tested, so that means that Kim Zimmerman did it, ha-ha.\u2019 Guess who else lived with the Zimmermans in May of 2000? This guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 292} The defense \u2022 opened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal. The prosecutor\u2019s comment that the .357 Ruger was not linked to Murray\u2019s murder explained the absence of DNA testing of blood on the weapon. Furthermore, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the failure to conduct DNA testing did not exculpate appellant as to the murder of Julious was not improper. This was fair comment in the face of the defense argument that the state\u2019s failure to conduct DNA testing was a \u201ccolossal blunder\u201d and a \u201cdeliberate act.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[p]rosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668. Thus, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 293} Third, appellant argues that the prosecutor misbehaved during his rebuttal argument by asking the jury, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t [the defense] present any witnesses?\u201d According to appellant, the prosecutor\u2019s comment attempted to shift the burden of proof to the defense. The prosecutor may comment upon the failure of the defense to offer evidence in support of its case. <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 452, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 326, 658 N.E.2d 754. Moreover, \u201c[s]uch comments do not imply that the burden of proof has shifted to the defense, nor do they necessarily constitute a penalty on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\u201d <em>State v. Collins </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 524, 527-528, 733 N.E.2d 1118. Again, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">{\u00b6 294} <em>Penalty-phase opening statement. </em>Appellant argues that the prosecutor improperly informed the jury that the escaping-detection aggravating circumstance was one of the four aggravating circumstances for the jury\u2019s consideration on sentencing, despite the trial judge\u2019s ruling that this aggravating circumstance had merged with the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 295} During penalty-phase opening statement, the prosecutor advised the jury that there were four aggravating circumstances and that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification was one of the aggravating circumstances. Following a defense objection, the trial court informed the parties that the (A)(3) specification was duplicative of the (A)(7) specifications. The trial court then advised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>jury that the (A)(3) specification had been merged. Thereafter, the prosecutor avoided any reference to the (A)(3) specification as part of the aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">{\u00b6 296} Nothing indicates that the prosecutor\u2019s isolated reference to the (A)(3) specification was intentional. See <em>State v. Waddy, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 436, 588 N.E.2d 819, quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 646, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (\u201c \u2018[ijsolated passages of a prosecutor\u2019s argument, billed in advance to the jury as a matter of opinion[,] not of evidence, do not reach\u2019 the level of a due process violation\u201d). Moreover, the trial court subsequently instructed the jury that the (A)(3) specification was merged. Thus there was no prejudicial error as the result of the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 297} <em>Penalty-phase closing argument. </em>Appellant contends that the prosecutor also misbehaved by referring to him as a lying, cheating husband. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument waived all but plain error. See <em>Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604-605, 605 N.E.2d 916. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 298} The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not present the theme that appellant was a lying and cheating husband. The prosecutor argued that appellant had failed to take responsibility for the health and welfare of his two children; however, the defense had opened the door to that argument after Copley testified during mitigation that appellant was \u201ca very caring, loving father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 299} Finally, we also reject appellant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s cumulative misconduct prejudiced him. <em>Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 113, 559 N.E.2d 710. Based on the foregoing, we find that proposition XXVII lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 300} In proposition of law XXVI, appellant raises numerous instances of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during both phases of his trial. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel \u201crequires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 301} First, appellant complains that his counsel conducted inadequate voir dire of a prospective juror. \u201c \u2018The conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 568, 715 N.E.2d 1144, quoting <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>{\u00b6 302} Appellant argues that counsel was deficient in failing to question Juror 1-30 about her opinion regarding appellant\u2019s guilt after Juror 1-30-indicated her belief, in the juror questionnaire, that appellant was guilty of the charged offenses. One question in the juror questionnaire asked, \u201cBased on what you may have heard about this case, do you have an impression or opinion about what happened or who is responsible?\u201d Juror 1-30 answered \u201cyes\u201d and explained, \u201cIn the case of the death of the girl, I believe the body was found on his premises, although this does not mean he did it, it doesn\u2019t look good for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">{\u00b6 303} Juror I-30\u2019s response on the questionnaire did not indicate that she had formed a preconceived belief of appellant\u2019s guilt. Moreover, Juror 1-30 indicated that she had not formed an opinion about \u201cwho or what\u201d caused the death of Julious or Murray in other responses on the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 304} Moreover, during the prosecutor\u2019s voir dire, Juror 1-30 was asked whether she had formed any opinions about the case, and Juror 1-30 answered, \u201cNot necessarily. No.\u201d As noted in <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 572 N.E.2d 97, defense counsel \u201cneed not repeat questions about topics already covered by * * * opposing counsel.\u201d Furthermore, \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765. Thus, the defense counsel was neither remiss nor ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 305} Appellant raises other instances of alleged ineffectiveness of counsel, but none prejudiced him. As discussed in other propositions of law, appellant was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request the removal of an alleged sleeping juror (proposition XI), or by counsel\u2019s failure to request a <em>Remmer </em>hearing to explore allegations that a juror had discussed the case with his girlfriend (XIII). Furthermore, appellant was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request curative instructions following a courtroom outburst (XVI), or by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct (XXVII), gruesome photographs (XII), life-sentence options on the verdict forms (XXIV), or character and impact testimony about Murray (III). Appellant also suffered no prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure to object to various guilt-phase (IX, XVIII, XX, and XXIX) and penalty-phase (XXIII and XXIX) instructions. Moreover, appellant was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request that evidence be stricken that related to appellant\u2019s marital infidelities or his reaction to the police prior to the date of the offenses (III).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 306} We also reject appellant\u2019s argument that his counsel was ineffective by waiving appellant\u2019s presence at in-chambers proceedings without consulting him. Appellant personally waived his presence at in-chambers proceedings, and this waiver was valid for the two in-chambers proceedings that he challenged (XIV).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 307} Finally, appellant argues that the cumulative effect of his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness necessitates reversal. Appellant received a fair trial, and any error was nonprejudicial. See <em>Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 123. None of appellant\u2019s claims establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and proposition XXVI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>Settled Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 308} <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>In proposition of law XXIX, appellant challenges the constitutionality of the instructions on reasonable doubt during both phases of the trial. We have previously rejected similar arguments and summarily overrule them here. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 309} <em>Constitutionality. </em>In proposition of law XXX, appellant attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. This claim has also been resolved. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 310} Appellant also argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international agreements to which the United States is a party. We also reject this argument. <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\n<em>Sentencing Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 311} In proposition of law XXV, appellant asserts that there are numerous flaws in the sentencing opinion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">{\u00b6 312} First, appellant argues that the sentencing opinion of the trial court improperly considered the kidnapping and aggravated-robbery aggravating circumstances, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), as one \u201csuperaggravating\u201d circumstance. As discussed earlier in proposition XXI, the trial court erred by combining the two nonduplicative aggravating circumstances into a single aggravating circumstance. We have independently reevaluated the sentence and rectified this error in our sentencing evaluation. See <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124; <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 170, 555 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">{\u00b6 313} Second, appellant contends that the trial court considered the following nonstatutory aggravating circumstances as aggravating factors: his use of a firearm, his failure to release Murray in a \u201csafe place and unharmed,\u201d and his concealment of Murray\u2019s body \u201csuch that Emily remained missing for 36 days.\u201d We reject this argument because \u201c[u]nder R.C. 2929.03(F), a trial court * * * may rely upon and cite the nature and circumstances of the offense as reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>supporting its finding that the aggravating circumstances were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph one of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Dickerson, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 212, 543 N.E.2d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 314} Third, appellant asserts that the trial court improperly considered the \u201cintentional killing\u201d of Murray during a kidnapping. The trial court could properly refer to the \u201cintentional killing\u201d of Murray in discussing the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) aggravating circumstance because intent is an element of the underlying felony murder. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 345, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 315} Finally, appellant argues that the trial court misconstrued the mitigating factors as evidence offered to reduce his culpability for the crimes. \u201cMitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B) are not necessarily related to a defendant\u2019s culpability but, rather, are those factors that are relevant to the issue of whether an offender convicted under R.C. 2903.01 should be sentenced to death.\u201d <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 527 N.E.2d 831, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 316} The sentencing opinion thoroughly discussed the mitigating evidence in appellant\u2019s case. The trial court also properly stated that the \u201caggravating circumstance must * * * be weighed against the mitigating factors about the individual which would weigh in favor of a decision that a life imprisonment sentence is the appropriate sentence.\u201d Thus, the trial court used the proper standard in weighing the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors. Nevertheless, the trial court improperly concluded that \u201cthe mitigating factors * * * have very little effect in minimizing, lessening or excusing the degree of the Defendant\u2019s murderous conduct.\u201d Again, we have independently reevaluated the sentence and rectified this error in the sentencing opinion. <em>Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 191, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 317} Based on the foregoing, we find that proposition XXV lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\n<em>Cumulative Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">{\u00b6 318} In proposition of law IV, appellant argues that cumulative trial errors deprived him of a fair trial and mandate a reversal of his death sentence. We conclude that appellant received a fair trial and fair sentencing determination and that no significant cumulative error occurred. We reject proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\n<em>Weighing the Evidence and Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">{\u00b6 319} In proposition of law XXVIII, appellant argues that the death penalty^ must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. He also argues that the death penalty is disproportionate when his case is compared to similar cases in which the death penalty has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>imposed. We will consider these arguments during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 320} Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, as required by R.C. 2929.05(A), we now independently review appellant\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was properly convicted of a course of conduct in killing Murray and Julious and murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping and aggravated robbery. R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and (A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 321} Against these aggravating circumstances, we now weigh the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Appellant called two mitigation witnesses but did not make a statement on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 322} Kathy McKnight, the defendant\u2019s wife, testified that she and appellant were married on May 22, 1998. Appellant has supported his family through a variety of jobs \u201cfrom selling cars to being a delivery person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 323} The McKnights have two small children, Kachina and Keena. Appellant has a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with his children and calls them his little prince and little princess. Appellant\u2019s children visited appellant in jail whenever they could. According to Kathy, their daughter \u201cbeams for days after going to see daddy, and every time [they] get into the car, she wants to know if [they\u2019re] going to see daddy again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 324} Emma Copley, the defendant\u2019s mother-in-law, described appellant as \u201ca very caring, loving father\u201d to the children. Appellant \u201cplays with them * * * [and has] taken them to carnivals and that sort of thing, a very loving, trusting father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 325} Appellant and Kathy moved to Gambier to take care of Copley when she was having medical problems. Copley said that appellant was \u201cvery supportive, very helpful, always there.\u201d On one occasion, appellant kissed Copley on the forehead while she was in the hospital for some tests. Copley stated that \u201cthat proves what a caring, loving son-in-law he has been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 326} In proposition of law XXVIII, appellant argues that his \u201csupport for and devotion to family, the love and support of his family members, his age, and his employment history are significant and should be given considerable weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">{\u00b6 327} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offenses to be mitigating. Appellant kidnapped Murray, stole her car, and then brutally murdered Murray inside his trailer. Murray\u2019s murder was part of a course of conduct during which appellant had previously murdered Julious.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 328} Appellant\u2019s history and background provide some mitigating features. Appellant has a loving family. Appellant\u2019s employment history also shows that he held several jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">{\u00b6 329} We find that the following statutory mitigating factors are inapplicable: R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(3) (mental disease or defect); and (B)(6) (not principal offender). Appellant does not assert the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record) mitigating factor, nor is there any evidence that the (B)(5) mitigating factor applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 330} We find that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) mitigating factor (youth of the offender) is applicable but entitled to little weight because appellant was 23 years of age at the time of the offenses. <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 197; <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 306, 754 N.E.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 331} We also conclude that little weight should be given to mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) (other relevant factors). The evidence includes testimony that appellant was a good father and has the support of a loving family. We also give little weight, if any, to appellant\u2019s brief employment history. The evidence does not suggest any other (B)(7) mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 332} The trial court properly merged the (A)(3) aggravating circumstance with the (A)(7) aggravating circumstances prior to sentencing. The trial court erred by merging the two separate (A)(7) aggravating circumstances into a single aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 333} Upon independent weighing, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant\u2019s family history and his brief employment record are entitled to some consideration. These factors, however, are outweighed by the aggravating circumstances of appellant\u2019s course of conduct in killing Murray and Julious and his kidnapping of Murray and the robbery of her car. Therefore, we find that the death sentence in this case is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 334} Finally, we find that the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved in similar cases. For other course-of-conduct murders, see <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 182; <em>State v.

I disagree with the determination of the majority that sufficient evidence exists to convict McKnight for a course-of-conduct specification pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">{\u00b6 337} I agree that the passage of five and one-half months between the two murders does not necessarily invalidate the course-of-conduct conviction. Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018[t]he further apart the acts are temporally, the more incumbent it is upon a court to carefully consider other factors * * * in determining whether the acts * * * are part of a course of conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 56, quoting <em>State v. Cummings </em>(1992), 332 N.C. 487, 510, 422 S.E.2d 692. Because a significant period of time elapsed between the two murders, evidence of \u201cother factors,\u201d such as modus operandi and motive, must exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 338} No distinctive modus operandi linked the murders of Murray and Julious. Both Murray and Julious were shot in the head, and their bodies were disposed of on MeKnight\u2019s remote homesite; however, no other \u201c \u2018pattern or psychological thread * * * ties [the offenses] together.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 52, quoting <em>Cummings, </em>332 N.C. at 510, 422 S.E.2d 692. By way of comparison, in <em>Sapp, </em>each of the victims was raped and left nude from the waist down, and the victims\u2019 pants were cut open in a distinctive way. Id. at \u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">{\u00b6 339} Moreover, no evidence of a common motive links the murders of Murray and Julious. Murray was murdered as part of a kidnapping and robbery. There is no evidence that Julious\u2019s murder was motivated by similar secondary crimes. In contrast, in <em>Sapp, </em>there was a common motive linking the murders. Sapp murdered each victim to gratify his recurring \u201ctaste for blood.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 60. Furthermore, Sapp murdered his victims after he perceived that they had each provoked him. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">{\u00b6 340} Though similarities exist between the two murders, there was no common scheme or pattern that tied the aggravated murders of Julious and Murray together. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of common pleas and vacate McKnight\u2019s conviction for a course-of-conduct specification. I concur in the remainder of the majority opinion, which affirms the convictions for murder and the sentence of death.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-6\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b241-7\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 341} That Gregory McKnight killed Gregory Julious and Emily Murray was proved at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. I concur in upholding both murder convictions. I also join the Chief Justice\u2019s separate opinion, which explains why the two murders were not part of a course of conduct. I write separately because the record does not contain proof beyond a reasonable doubt that McKnight kidnapped Murray or that he committed aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 342} The majority states, \u201cThe state proved that [McKnight] kidnapped Murray by showing that Murray and [McKnight] left work at approximately the same time on the night Murray disappeared, that Murray\u2019s car was found parked behind [McKnight\u2019s] trailer, and that Murray\u2019s murdered body was found rolled in a carpet inside [McKnight\u2019s] trailer.\u201d None of this evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that McKnight \u201cby force, threat, or deception * * * remove[d Murray] from the place where [she was] found or restrained her] liberty.\u201d R.C. 2905.01(A). The majority also states that \u201cthe evidence proved that Murray did not have her wallet, driver\u2019s license, and credit cards when she disappeared and that Murray did not tell anyone she was leaving the area, despite her habit of informing friends of her whereabouts.\u201d But this evidence doesn\u2019t prove \u201cforce, threat, or deception.\u201d Further, this evidence suggests that Murray may have voluntarily given McKnight a ride home, as his co-workers sometimes did. (The record does not indicate that McKnight\u2019s co-workers ever gave him a ride to Vinton County.) As further proof of kidnapping, the majority states that \u201c[McKnight] lied when Murray\u2019s friend asked about her, and [McKnight] also told a co-worker that she was \u2018probably dead.\u2019 \u201d This evidence suggests nothing as to kidnapping; it is certainly damning evidence, but only as to murder. Finally, as further proof of kidnapping, the majority states, \u201c[McKnight] also falsely told Kimberly Zimmerman that the Subaru behind his trailer belonged to his boss or a friend, \u2018and they were down there probably hunting.\u2019 \u201d Again, this evidence suggests nothing as to kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 343} \u201cOther acts\u201d testimony was admitted into evidence to prove McKnight\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent or purpose or plan to commit kidnapping. The evidence established that McKnight often needed a ride home from work and that he had a penchant for seeking extramarital sex. Calling these behavioral patterns a \u201cmodus operandi\u201d is a significant stretch. This evidence should have been excluded because \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A). The evidence offers little to no probative value given the overwhelming evidence of murder and the absence of evidence of kidnapping. Further, the prejudicial effect is significant because of the opprobrium that a jury is likely to feel toward a serial adulterer, instructions to the contrary notwithstanding. That McKnight sought lovers seems a thin reed on which to base a kidnapping conviction.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AIg\">David H. Bodiker, Ohio Public Defender, and Joseph E. Wilhelm, Kelly L.

Lowe, Assistant Public Defenders, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 344} The majority discusses kidnapping only in the context of the sufficiency of the evidence. I agree that there is sufficient evidence to crest that low threshold. Affirming a death specification, however, requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which the record does not contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 345} While it ignores the consequences of the paucity of evidence to support a kidnapping conviction, at least the majority discusses it. The aggravated-robbery death specification was affirmed even though the majority opinion does not discuss any of the evidence on which it relies. Apparently, the mere presence of the Subaru on MeKnight\u2019s property is sufficient evidence to prove that he stole it. In reality, the Subaru\u2019s presence on his property proves nothing more than its presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 346} The majority opinion concludes, \u201c[McKnight] kidnapped Murray, stole her car, and then brutally murdered Murray inside his trailer.\u201d As discussed above, there is no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that McKnight kidnapped Murray or that he stole her car. Based on the evidence in the record, it is as likely that Murray voluntarily drove McKnight home and voluntarily entered his home. Sadly, there is no doubt that McKnight committed a brutal murder. Nevertheless, because of the lack of evidence of the aggravating circumstances, McKnight should not be sentenced to death, and I dissent from the portion of the majority opinion that upholds the death sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
