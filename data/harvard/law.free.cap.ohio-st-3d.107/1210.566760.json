The error made by the appellate court is one that has been repeated in other appellate districts in this state and needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">{\u00b6 4} This case concerns the law of informed consent and how much information a treating physician must give a patient about drugs he is prescribing for the patient\u2019s care. This court spoke clearly as to informed consent in <em>Nickell v. Gonzalez </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 136, 17 OBR 281, 477 N.E.2d 1145, syllabus, setting forth the standard of disclosure for physicians:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe tort of lack of informed consent is established when:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(a) The physician fails to disclose to the patient and discuss the material risks and dangers inherently and potentially involved with respect to the proposed therapy, if any;</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(b) the unrevealed risks and dangers which should have been disclosed by the physician actually materialize and are the proximate cause of the injury to the patient; and</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201c(c) a reasonable person in the position of the patient would have decided against the therapy had the material risks and dangers inherent and incidental to treatment been disclosed to him or her prior to the therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 9} The court below held that to establish the tort of lack of informed consent, \u201cexpert testimony must be presented to prove \u2018what a reasonable medical practitioner of the same school practicing in the same or similar communities under the same or similar circumstances would have disclosed to his patient about the risks incident to a proposed treatment, and [to prove] that the physician departed from that standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Badger v. McGregor, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-167, 2004-Ohio-4036, 2004 WL 1729656, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Pierce v. Goldman </em>(May 17, 1989), Hamilton App. No. C-880320, 1989 WL 50772.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 10} Standard-of-care testimony, however, is absolutely not a part of the <em>Nickell </em>test. The lower court misinterprets the second part of the test, which states that \u201cthe unrevealed risks and dangers <em>which should have been disclosed by the physician </em>actually materialize and are the proximate cause of the injury to the patient.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Nickell, </em>17 Ohio St.3d 136, 17 OBR 281, 477 N.E.2d 1145, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 11} The lower court reads the \u201cshould have been disclosed\u201d language to require expert testimony to determine what a reasonable physician should have disclosed. However, the \u201cshould have\u201d language in the second part of the test in fact reflects the first part of the test, which requires the physician \u201cto disclose to the patient and discuss the material risks and dangers inherently and potentially involved with respect to the proposed therapy.\u201d Id. As to the first prong of the test, the physician is duty bound to disclose the <em>material </em>risks of the proposed therapy. Those material risks are what are referred to in the second prong of the test as \u201cthe unrevealed risks and dangers which <em>should have been </em>disclosed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 12} Materiality is determined through a reasonable-person standard, not through standard-of-care testimony. Id. at 139, 17 OBR 281, 477 N.E.2d 1145. <em>Nickell </em>approved of a jury instruction that stated, \u201c \u2018[A] risk is material when a reasonable person, in what the physician knows or should know to be the patient\u2019s condition, would be likely to attach significance to the risk or cluster of risks in deciding whether or not to forego the proposed treatment.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 13} Proof of deviation from the standard of care is not a part of a tort claim for lack of informed consent. Nor is it relevant to any of the three elements of a successful claim. This court should have made that fact clear in a decision on the merits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-11\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AKz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>Robert M.
