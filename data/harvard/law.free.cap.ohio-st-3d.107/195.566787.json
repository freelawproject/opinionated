Foster, was convicted of two counts of rape, one count of felonious sexual penetration, and one lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition and was sentenced to prison. On appeal, his conviction and sentence were affirmed. <em>State v. Foster </em>(Apr. 12, 1994), Belmont App. No. 91-B-17, 1994 WL 149881.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"An9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Kent C.

Foster requested that the writ issue \u201cto vacate his sentence and records as it is a legal nullity.\u201d Although Foster filed an affidavit of indigency indicating that he could not pay the fee to file his original action, he did not file the statement required by R.C. 2969.25(C)(1) setting forth the balance in his inmate account \u201cfor each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier.\u201d Appellees moved to dismiss. On March 16, 2005, the court of appeals dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before us upon Foster\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Foster essentially seeks release from prison, but habeas corpus, rather than prohibition, is the appropriate action to obtain this type of relief. <em>State ex rel. Nelson v. Griffin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 167, 2004-Ohio-4754, 814 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 5. In addition, Foster\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. 2969.25(C)(1) warranted dismissal. <em>State ex rel. Qualls v.
