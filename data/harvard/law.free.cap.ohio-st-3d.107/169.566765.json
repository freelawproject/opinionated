It found its judgment to be in conflict with the judgments of the Seventh District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Lake, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 378, 2003-Ohio-332, 784 N.E.2d 162, and the Fourth District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Carter </em>(Sept. 26, 2000), Ross App. No. 99CA2479, 2000 WL 1466189, on the following issue: \u201cWhether the introduction into evidence of an unauthenticated copy of a calibration solution affidavit at a suppression hearing constitutes inadmissible hearsay.\u201d We respond to this question by holding that judicial officials at suppression hearings may rely on hearsay and other evidence to determine whether alcohol test results were obtained in compliance with methods approved by the Director of Health, even though that evidence may not be admissible at trial. Evid.R. 101(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">{\u00b6 2} On September 11, 2002, an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper stopped a vehicle driven by appellant, Rebekah Edwards. During the stop, he detected an odor of alcohol coming from Edwards. After conducting field sobriety tests and observing her physical condition, the trooper arrested her. Testing with a BAC DataMaster determined the concentration of alcohol in Edwards\u2019s breath to be .134 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. The trooper charged Edwards with driving under the influence of alcohol (\u201cDUI\u201d) in violation of former R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) and (3), now (A)(1)(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Edwards moved to suppress the results of the BAC DataMaster test, asserting multiple grounds. In addition to claiming that the trooper had no basis to conduct field sobriety tests and that he failed to wait 20 minutes between test attempts, Edwards contended that the \u201csolution calibration documents from the Ohio Department of Health are inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 4} At a hearing on Edwards\u2019s motion in the New Philadelphia Municipal Court, the trooper identified a document as a photocopy of a certificate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of approval by the Director of Health of an alcohol solution used to test the accuracy of the BAC DataMaster.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The director has required that instruments used for breath testing be checked for accuracy no less frequently than once every seven days \u201cusing an instrument check solution containing ethyl alcohol approved by the director of health.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-04(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 5} Edwards asserted that the photocopied test-solution certificate was not authenticated, and she objected to the magistrate\u2019s consideration of it. In response, the prosecutor volunteered to retrieve the original certificate from the local patrol post.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 6} The prosecutor returned with a document he described as the original test-solution certificate, but it too was a photocopy, revealing the images of a handwritten May 28, 2002 date and the apparent signature of the Director of Health. It did not bear the original seal of the Department of Health or a statement certifying the director\u2019s signature as genuine, cf. Evid.R. 902(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or a certification from an authorized person' that the copy was correct, cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Evid.R. 902(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Edwards renewed her objection, arguing that the state needed \u201csomething from the Ohio Department of Health which says this is a true and accurate copy of the original which is on file which would then make that a self-authenticating document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">{\u00b6 7} The magistrate concluded that he could consider the photocopied test-solution certificate. Citing Evid.R. 901,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 902(1), and 1003,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he emphasized that the state had presented testimony that the exhibits were photocopies of documents kept at the local post and found that no genuine issue had been raised regarding the authenticity of the copy. The magistrate denied Edwards\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the results of the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 8} On review of objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the municipal court initially ruled that the test-solution certificate was admissible under the Rules of Evidence. On reconsideration, the court reversed its prior ruling to the extent that it had earlier implied that the test-solution certificate would be admissible at trial. The court characterized that issue as premature. The court did not, however, reverse the magistrate\u2019s decision denying suppression of the breath-test results. Nor did the court criticize the magistrate\u2019s consideration of the test-solution certif\u00edcate at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 9} Edwards pleaded no contest and was convicted. On appeal, she contended that \u201c[t]he breath test should have been suppressed at the suppression hearing due to the calibration solution affidavit not being properly certified.\u201d In a split decision, the court of appeals affirmed Edwards\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 10} DUI offenses are prosecuted within a statutory and regulatory framework. R.C. 4511.19(D)(1) provides that in any criminal DUI prosecution or juvenile court DUI proceeding a court \u201cmay admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol * * * in the defendant\u2019s * * * breath * * * at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance.\u201d The statute, however, further provides: \u201cThe bodily substance withdrawn shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the director of health * * *.\u201d Both the First and Ninth District Courts of Appeals have characterized R.C. 4511.19 as a legislatively created exclusionary rule analogous to the exclusionary rule estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>lished in <em>Weeks v. United States </em>(1914), 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652, and <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081. <em>State v. Halko </em>(July 16, 1986), Hamilton App. No. C-850656, 1986 WL 7855; <em>State v. Earle </em>(Aug. 2, 1989), Summit App. No. 13957, 1989 WL 86321. That rule bars the introduction of evidence that has been seized unconstitutionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 11} Crim.R. 12(C)(3) and Traf.R. 11(B)(2) provide that \u201c[m]otions to suppress evidence * * * on the ground that it was illegally obtained\u201d must be raised before trial. We have expressly held that Crim.R. 12(C)(3) (then (B)(3)) requires a pretrial suppression hearing in a DUI prosecution to determine the admissibility of alcohol-content test results claimed to have been illegally obtained based on noncompliance with the director\u2019s rules governing the maintenance and operation of testing devices. <em>State v. French </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 446, 449, 650 N.E.2d 887. If a defendant does not move for suppression prior to trial, he or she \u201cmay not object to the admissibility of the test results at trial <em>on those grounds. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; Crim.R. 12(H); Traf.R. 11(E). Our decision was consistent with prior rulings that \u201c[a] motion to suppress is a proper pretrial procedure for challenging breathalyzer test results when the defendant is charged with a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(3)\u201d and that \u201c[a] plea of no contest does not waive a defendant\u2019s appeal from an adverse ruling on the motion.\u201d <em>Defiance v. Kretz </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 1, 573 N.E.2d 32, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 12} In summary, a challenge asserting that test results were not obtained in compliance with the director\u2019s rules must be raised by a defendant prior to trial by way of a pretrial motion to suppress. <em>French, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 451, 650 N.E.2d 887. Failure to file such a motion constitutes a waiver, so that a defendant may not force the state to lay a foundation for the admissibility of the test results at trial: issues concerning compliance with the director\u2019s rules may not be raised for the first time at trial to challenge admissibility. Id. Moreover, finality attaches to a ruling on a motion to suppress. Id. at 449, 650 N.E.2d 887. Accordingly, the ruling of substantial compliance by the court at a pretrial suppression hearing prevails at trial, and a defendant may not raise, at trial, a challenge to the admissibility of test results based on the assertion that the state failed to comply with the director\u2019s rules in obtaining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 13} We today expressly reaffirm that an assertion that test results are inadmissible in a criminal trial because the state failed to substantially comply with methods approved by the Director of Health for determining the concentration of alcohol in bodily fluids must be raised through a pretrial motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 14} In this court, Edwards has addressed at length the issue whether the photocopied test-solution certificate considered by the magistrate was authenticated in compliance with Evid.R. 901 and 902. We need not resolve this issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>however, because judicial officials at suppression hearings \u201c \u2018may rely on hearsay and other evidence, even though that evidence would not be admissible at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maumee v. Weisner </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 295, 298, 720 N.E.2d 507, quoting <em>United States v. Raddatz </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 667, 679, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424. See, also, <em>United States v. Matlock </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 164, 173-174, 94 S.Ct. 988, 994, 39 L.Ed.2d 242. This precedent accords with Evid.R. 101(C)(1) and 104.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, the magistrate was not precluded from considering the test-solution certificate in photocopy form at the suppression hearing to determine whether the state\u2019s chemical results complied with the director\u2019s regulations even if the Rules of Evidence governing authentication and hearsay would preclude admission of the certificate at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 16} The municipal court had viewed the magistrate\u2019s recommendation for denying the suppression as a ruling on a motion in limine. Motions in limine may be made prior to the trial of a DUI charge when a defendant asserts a challenge under the Rules of Evidence to evidence that he or she expects the state to introduce at trial. In most cases, either a defendant or a prosecutor may, prior to trial, seek a ruling in limine on evidentiary issues. A court may consider those issues as well as challenges to the state\u2019s compliance with the director\u2019s rules at a single pretrial hearing. Our decisions in <em>Kretz </em>and <em>French </em>do not, however, require that all issues concerning the admissibility of alcohol-content evidence be determined only at a pretrial suppression hearing or that a defendant be precluded from raising for the first time at trial purely <em>evidentiary </em>issues concerning the documentation of test results. The issue in <em>French </em>was \u201cwhether a challenge to the results of a breath alcohol test <em>on the basis of failure to comply with regulations of the Ohio Department of Health\u201d </em>may be raised by a criminal defendant at trial in the absence of a pretrial motion to suppress the test result upon that ground. (Emphasis added.) <em>French, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 448-449, 650 N.E.2d 887. This inquiry differs from a pretrial motion in limine to determine admissibility of evidence under the Rules of Evidence. <em>French.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 17} A ruling on a motion in limine raising a challenge based on the Rules of Evidence differs from a ruling on a motion to suppress based on alleged failure to comply with the director\u2019s rules. Where a court, in its discretion, chooses to rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>on a motion in limine, that ruling is \u201ctentative and precautionary in nature, reflecting the court\u2019s anticipatory treatment of an evidentiary issue at trial. In deciding such motions, the trial court is at liberty to change its ruling on the disputed evidence in its actual context at trial. Finality does not attach when the motion is granted.\u201d <em>Kretz, </em>60 Ohio St.3d at 4, 573 N.E.2d 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 18} In this case, Edwards argued in a written memorandum filed after the suppression hearing but prior to the magistrate\u2019s decision that \u201cadmission of the improperly authenticated solution affidavit is allowing in hearsay which violates the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause\u201d because the state had not produced certificates at the suppression hearing that were properly authenticated under Evid.R. 902(4). But in support of that position, Edwards focused on the technical requirements of the Rules of Evidence \u2014 not due process considerations. The Rules of Evidence, however, are not coextensive with constitutional requirements. Nor did Edwards argue that the test-solution certificate constitutes a testimonial statement as described in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, triggering the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The photocopied certificate proffered by the state at the suppression hearing supported the inference that Batch No. 02010, used to test the BAC DataMaster, was a solution approved by the director. Nothing in the record supports the conclusion that the photocopy had been altered from the original test-solution certificate or was otherwise unreliable. Edwards has not demonstrated that the magistrate abused his discretion or that she was denied due process as a result of his consideration of the photocopied test-solution certificate at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 19} Had the state introduced the certificate over Edwards\u2019s evidentiary objections at trial, its introduction would have been governed by the Rules of Evidence. We observed in <em>French </em>that a defendant retained the right to make an evidentiary challenge at trial as opposed to a substantive challenge to the state\u2019s compliance with the director\u2019s rules: \u201cEvidentiary objections challenging the competency, admissibility, relevancy, authenticity, and credibility of the chemical test results may still be raised\u201d at trial. Id., 72 Ohio St.3d at 452, 650 N.E.2d 887. Thus, a defendant at trial may challenge breath-test results on grounds other than that the results were illegally obtained because they were obtained in noncompliance with the director\u2019s rules. For example a defendant may argue at trial that the particular device failed to operate properly at the time of testing. Cf. <em>Columbus v. Caynor </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 394, 676 N.E.2d 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 20} At the trial regarding an alleged violation of R.C. 4511.19 based on a prohibited breath-alcohol level, the state must introduce evidence of the \u201cconcentration of alcohol * * * in the defendant\u2019s * * * breath * * * at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance.\u201d However, the controlling statutes, the Criminal Rules, and our precedent clearly establish that the issue whether \u201c[t]he bodily substance withdrawn [was] analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the director of health,\u201d R.C. 4511.19(D)(1), is not a jury question and is to be decided by the court prior to trial. The test-solution certificate is relevant only to that issue, and therefore relevant only at the motion-to-suppress stage.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQC\">James A.

Latanich, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">(\u00b6 21} We reaffirm that a failure to comply with the director\u2019s approved methods must be raised in a pretrial motion to suppress and that judicial officials at suppression hearings may rely on hearsay and other evidence to determine whether alcohol test results were obtained in compliance with methods approved by the Director of Health.
