The statutorily authorized Michigan Child Support Formula Manual prohibits the imputation of means-tested public assistance benefits as income. While a trial court may enter an order of support that deviates from the formula, it may not do so without setting forth in writing or on the record why following the formula would be unjust or inappropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, this Court has required the trial court to evaluate a num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ber of factors in determining the actual ability and likelihood of earning the imputed income. <em>Sword v Sword, </em>399 Mich 367; 249 NW2d 88 (1976). The Michigan Child Support Formula Manual also requires the evaluation of certain equitable factors when deciding to impute income. In the instant case, the trial court failed to comply with these requirements. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for a new calculation of the support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Plaintiff James Ghidotti and defendant Brenda Barber are the parents of James Allen Ghidotti, Jr., bom November 30, 1987. The parties were never married. Judge Kingsley of the 37th Circuit Court granted physical custody of James Jr. to his father, the plaintiff, on May 18, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Defendant has custody of two minor daughters, ages fourteen and thirteen, from a previous marriage. The father of the two girls, defendant\u2019s ex-husband, is incarcerated and does not pay child support. At the time this case was before the trial court, defendant and her daughters received $356 a month in Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits. At the same time, plaintiff earned approximately $370 a week from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Pursuant to an order from the trial court, the friend of the court for Calhoun County conducted a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>support review of defendant\u2019s obligation to her noncustodial son, James Jr. The friend of the court prepared two recommendations regarding defendant\u2019s child support obligations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first recommendation, which was based on defendant\u2019s actual income, set the support level at $0.00. When calculating the second recommendation, the friend of the court determined that defendant did not suffer from any condition or restriction that would preclude her from obtaining gainful employment. Accordingly, the friend of the court deemed defendant to be voluntarily unemployed and calculated an imputed income for defendant equaling $170 a week. The imputed income equaled what defendant would earn if she worked at a minimum wage job for forty hours a week. The second recommendation, which was based on defendant\u2019s actual income, plus her imputed income, set defendant\u2019s child support obligation at $33 a week; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>this amount included $22 a week for child support and $11 a week for child care.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On May 16, 1994, the trial court heard testimony regarding the child support review. Defendant argued that, because she was receiving afdc and food stamp support for her other two children, she could not be required to pay child support. The court disagreed and set the level of child support at $33 a week, imputing income to defendant and adopting the second calculation of the friend of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Defendant appealed this ruling, but the Court of Appeals denied leave. This Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals as on leave granted. 449 Mich 861 (1995). The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of child support at the rate of $33 a week, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">the fact that a party receives an afdc grant is irrelevant when determining whether a parent is voluntarily unemployed and the amount of child support that a voluntarily unemployed noncustodial parent will pay for the benefit of the noncustodial child. [222 Mich App 373, 380; 564 NW2d 141 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Defendant appealed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, and this Court granted leave on April 1, 1998. 456 Mich 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">At the time this case was decided, defendant was a recipient of AFDC, which the federal welfare program was called at that time. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, Pub L 104-193, 110 Stat 2105 (codified as 42 USC 601-1788), replaced afdc with Temporary Assistance for Needy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Families (TANF), as part of the federal welfare reform program enacted in 1996. Because the Michigan Family Independence Agency has elected to use TANF funds as afdc funds were used previously, to provide cash assistance to needy families with minor children, the analysis of defendant\u2019s situation remains the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The stated purpose of TANF can be found at 42 USC 601(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">In general. The purpose of this part [42 USC 601 <em>et seq.] </em>is to increase the flexibility of States in operating a program designed to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">(1) provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">(2) end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">(3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">(4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">In order to receive federal funds under the tanf program, a state is required to \u201cestablish guidelines for child support award amounts within the State.\u201d 42 USC 667(a). This statute also requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">[tjhere shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the award of child support, that the amount of the award which would result from the application of such guidelines is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. A written finding or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, as determined under criteria established by the State, shall be suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cient to rebut the presumption in that case. [42 USC 667(b)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The Legislature complied with these requirements when it enacted MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3), stating that \u201cthe court shall order support in an amount determined by application of the child support formula developed by the state friend of the court bureau.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute goes on to state that the court may enter an order of support that varies from that mandated by the guidelines, but only if the court determines from the facts of the case that application of the child support formula would be unjust or inappropriate and sets forth in writing or on the record the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">(a) The support amount determined by application of the child support formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">(b) How the support order deviates from the child support formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">(c) The value of property or other support awarded instead of the payment of child support, if applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(d) The reasons why application of the child support formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the case. [MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The Friend of the Court Bureau has written, distributed, and frequently revised the Michigan Child Sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>port Formula Manual pursuant to this legislative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The relevant language of the manual states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">Imputation is <em>not </em>appropriate where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">1. A payee/payer source of income is a means tested income such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (tanf), Family Independence Payments (fip) (formerly afdc), Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income (ssi), etc. [Michigan Child Support Formula Manual, tenth rev, p 8 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">In reaching its decision in the present case, the Court of Appeals recognized the prohibition contained in the manual against imputation of means-tested public assistance benefits as income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, while acknowledging that defendant had no source of income other than afdc and that this could not be counted as income for the purpose of a child support calculation, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to deem defendant as voluntarily unemployed and thereby able to work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">[The court] apparently viewed [defendant] as it should and does view all unemployed yet employable noncustodial parents who, for one reason or another, have no job and claim an inability to financially support a child. [222 Mich App 377-378.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">The trial court\u2019s decision that defendant was employable was based on the finding of the Calhoun County Friend of the Court\u2019s investigation that she \u201csuffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>from no condition or restriction that would preclude her from obtaining gainful employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Court of Appeals approval of imputation of income to a parent in defendant\u2019s situation is based on a misunderstanding of the applicable statutes and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">According to the applicable statutes, the child support formula \u201cshall be based upon the needs of the child and the actual resources of each parent.\u201d MCL 552.519(3)(a)(vi); MSA 25.176(19)(3)(a)(vi). In applying this mandate, cases have broadened the limits of \u201cactual resources\u201d to include certain payers\u2019 unexercised ability to pay. See, e.g., <em>Rohloff v Rohloff, </em>161 Mich App 766; 411 NW2d 484 (1987) (a trial court may order child support where a party voluntarily reduces income and the trial court concludes the party has the ability to earn an income); <em>Heilman v Heilman, </em>95 Mich App 728; 291 NW2d 183 (1980) (a trial court may properly take into consideration a parent\u2019s ability to work and earn money in setting the appropriate child support award). However, in allowing income imputation to a payer whom the court finds to have an unexercised ability to pay, this Court has required specific findings by the trial court. <em>Sword v Sword, supra </em>(in determining a parent\u2019s ability to pay child support, the court must evaluate a number of factors, such as employment history, education and skills, available work opportunities, diligence in trying to find work, the defendant\u2019s personal history, assets, health and physical ability, and availability for work); <em>Rohloff, supra </em>(refers to <em>Sword </em>criteria for determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tion of ability to pay child support in voluntary reduction of income case).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The requirement that the trial court evaluate criteria such as those listed in <em>Sword </em>is essential to ensure that any imputation of income is based on an actual ability and likelihood of earning the imputed income. Any other rule would be pure speculation and a clear violation of the requirement that child support be based upon the actual resources of the parents. MCL 552.519(3)(a)(vi); MSA 25.176(19)(3)(a)(vi). Moreover, the manual requires that the decision to impute income be based on the evaluation of \u201camong other equitable factors,\u201d the following eight factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">1. Prior employment experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">2. Education level;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">3. Physical and mental disabilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">4.

The prevailing wage rates in the local geographical area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">7. Special skills and training; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">8. Whether there is any evidence that the party in question is able to earn the imputed income. [Manual at 8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">The manual also emphasizes that \u201cimputation is <em>not </em>appropriate where ... [a] payee/payer source of income is a means tested income such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (tanf), Family Independence Payments (fip) (formerly afdc), Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), etc. ...\u201d Manual at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>In its decision to allow imputation of income to defendant, despite the fact that her sole source of income was means-tested public assistance, the trial court gave no consideration, except as to defendant\u2019s medical condition, to any of the factors required by <em>Sword </em>or the manual. The Court of Appeals erroneously approved the trial court\u2019s failure to follow the requirements established by the child support formula for any deviation from the formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The Legislature has determined that Michigan courts \u201cshall order support in an amount determined by application of the child support formula developed by the state Mend of the court bureau.\u201d MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the absence of circumstances that make a determination \u201cunjust or inappropriate,\u201d the court may not deviate from the formula. <em>Id. </em>The formula provides that imputation is not appropriate where the payee/payer source of income is means-tested income. The trial court in this case made no record of any circumstances, nor have the parties stated any, that would lead to the conclusion that the amount of child support as indicated by the manual is \u201cunjust or inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The Court of Appeals, in affirming the trial court\u2019s award of child support in the instant case, largely ignored the mandate of the manual and the state and federal laws that require courts to follow the manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>when setting the amount of child support. See 222 Mich App 378-379. The Court of Appeals noted the manual\u2019s statement that imputation is \u201cnot appropriate where \u2018[a] payee/payer source of income is a means tested income such as Aid for Families with Dependent Children, General Assistance, Food Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378. The Court of Appeals then stated that \u201c[t]his is consistent with the child support guidelines\u2019 statement that means-tested sources of income \u2018should <em>not </em>be considered as income to either parent for the purpose of determining child support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378-379 (emphasis in original). However, the Court of Appeals also found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">although at first glance the language of MCL 400.63; MSA 16.463 and MCL 552.602(c); MSA 25.164(2)(c) may appear to protect defendant from child support obligations because her only income is AFDC, neither statute prohibits imputing wage income to a voluntarily unemployed parent who receives afdc <em>as long as </em>that parent is not required to satisfy the child support order from the afdc grant. [222 Mich App 380 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In fact, the Court of Appeals interpretation is not logically consistent, because imputing fictitious income to a parent receiving afdc would defeat the purpose of ignoring AFDC income in support calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The Court of Appeals found that \u201c[t]he manual contains no substantive right liberating a noncustodial parent who receives afdc from all child support obligations. If this were the case, we would find statutory authorization for this exclusion, but none exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379. This argument cannot be supported. The manual may not contain this \u201csubstantive right,\u201d <em>id., </em>but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>unambiguously prohibits imputation of income to a parent (custodial or otherwise) who receives afdc. Manual at 10-11. Furthermore, the Legislature statutorily delegated the authority to draft the manual to the friend of the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This delegation was pursuant to federal mandate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cAn agency\u2019s authority to adopt rules is typically provided for in the statute creating the agency and vesting it with certain powers,\u201d and that \u201c[r]ulemaking authority may also be inferred from other statutory authority granted to an agency.\u201d Bienenfeld, Michigan Administrative Law (2d ed), ch 4, pp 18-19. This Court has said that \u201cwhat is essential to a valid . . . Michigan \u2018rule\u2019 is: a reasonable exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cise of legislatively delegated power, pursuant to proper procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To say that a rule in the manual needs \u201cstatutory authorization\u201d in order to exist is to defeat the purpose of the legislative delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Court of Appeals then opined that, despite the defendant\u2019s lack of any income other than AFDC and the fact that such income is \u201cabsolutely inalienable\u201d under Michigan law, MCL 400.43(1); MSA 16.463(1), the defendant could be assessed child support. The Court of Appeals held that defendant would not be required to pay the assessed child support while her sole source of income was AFDC, but the unpaid weekly child support would accumulate in arrears.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 222 Mich App 380-384. This view cannot overcome the language of 42 USC 667, MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3), and the manual. These controlling statutes and regulations, read together (as by their terms they must be), prohibit the imputation of income to a parent receiving \u201cmeans tested income\u201d unless the court determines from the facts of the case that application of the child support formula would be unjust or inappropriate and sets forth in writing or on the record the four pieces of information<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> required by MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3).</p>\n<p id=\"Ad0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The relevant state and federal statutes require the trial court, in determining the appropriate amount of child support in a particular case, to follow the guidelines set forth by the state agency with the authority to promulgate such guidelines. In Michigan, that agency is the Friend of the Court Bureau, which has published the Michigan Child Support Formula Manual in accordance with state and federal law. The manual clearly and unequivocally prohibits the imputation of income to a payee or payer parent who is receiving means-tested income such as afdc. When a trial court deviates from this formula, it must set forth in writing why following the formula would be \u201cunjust or inappropriate.\u201d This the trial court did not do.

I would hold that the last provision of subsection I is void, and the categorical preclusion against imputing income to means-tested benefit recipients cannot be given effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>1.

The Court creates a nonexistent dispute regarding whether imputation of income was appropriate as a matter of fact, an argument long ago waived by defendant.

The Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">This appeal involves whether income may be imputed to a means-tested benefit recipient who has been found by the trial court to have a \u201cvoluntary unexercised ability to earn.\u201d Relevant to that inquiry is the Child Support Guidelines Manual, subsection I, which enumerates both the responsibilities for the friend of the court in making the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>whether to impute income and the relevant considerations involved. Subsection I provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">The determination as to the appropriateness of imputation in a particular case is a judicial one. In all cases in which the Friend of the Court investigation shows voluntary reduction of income or where there is voluntary unex-ercised ability to earn, the Friend of the Court <em>shall </em>make two recommendations: one is based on actual income and the other is based on actual plus imputed income. The recommendation should also take into account the possible inclusion of a child care recommendation where imputation would make that issue relevant. The recommendation shall include the basis for imputation and the basis of the amount imputed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">In considering a party\u2019s unexercised ability to earn, the Friend of the Court shall consider among other equitable factors the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">1. Prior employment experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">2. Educational level;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">3. Physical and mental disabilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">4. The presence of children of the marriage in the party\u2019s home and its impact on the earnings of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">5. Availability of employment in the local geographical area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">6. The prevailing wage rates in the local geographical area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">7. Special skills and training; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-15\">8. Whether there is any evidence that the party in question is able to earn the imputed income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-16\">This imputation provision must be applied equally to payers and payees and to men and women. Imputation is <em>not </em>appropriate where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-17\">1. A payee/payer source of income is a means tested income such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (tanf), Family Independence Payments (fip) (formerly afdc), Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income (ssi), etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The obligations of the friend of the court listed in the first paragraph of subsection I are consistent with the friend of the court\u2019s statutory obligation \u201cto investigate <em>all </em>relevant facts\u201d regarding child support. MCL 552.505(l)(e); MSA 25.176(5)(l)(e) (emphasis added). They are likewise consistent with MCL 552.517(3); MSA 25.176(17)(3) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">The office shall use the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19 in calculating the child support award. If the office determines from the facts of the case that application of the child support formula would be unjust or inappropriate, <em>or that income should not be based on actual income earned by the parties, </em>the office shall prepare a written report that includes all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">(a) The support amount, based on actual income earned by the parties, determined by application of the child support formula and all factual assumptions upon which that support amount is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">(b) An alternative support recommendation and all factual assumptions upon which the alternative support recommendation is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">(c) How the alternative support recommendation deviates from the child support formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">(d) The reasons for the alternative support recommendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">(e) All evidence known to the friend of the court that the individual is or is not able to earn the income imputed to him or her. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Thus, under both the guidelines and the statute, in order to impute income to a parent, the friend of the court <em>shall </em>investigate all relevant facts, and, if it finds an unexercised ability to earn an income, <em>shall </em>make one recommendation on the basis of actual income and an alternative recommendation on the basis of actual plus imputed income. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>record must disclose the factors on which the imputation of income is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In this case, the friend of the court and the trial court fully complied with these mandates. As the majority acknowledges, the friend of the court made two recommendations to the trial judge. The first recommendation, based only on \u201cactual income,\u201d was that defendant not be required to pay any child support (because \u201cactual income\u201d was zero).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second recommendation, based on \u201cimputed income\u201d of $170 a week at a minimum wage job, was that defendant should pay $33 a week in support of the child who resided with his father.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The friend of the court based the imputation of income on the fact that it could find no reason why defendant was not capable of working a minimum wage job for forty-hours a week, and that it found defendant\u2019s proffered explanations for failing to gain employment unbelievable. The factual findings of the trial court support this conclusion. As the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Although Ms. Barber has a limited work history, once recovered from her surgery, there appears to be no physical or mental reason preventing her from working full time. Her children are getting older; they are in school full time; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>and if her one daughter had special needs, she is not now receiving any type of therapy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">I believe Ms. Barber has the ability to work; that there are unskilled jobs available at minimum wage or greater; and that she has no compelling personal and/or family needs which would keep her from obtaining some type of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Defendant does not challenge the factual basis for the order of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Notwithstanding the fact that the friend of the court and the trial court followed the specific requirements of the manual and of the relevant statutes in imputing income to defendant, the majority holds that income may not be imputed without <em>deviating </em>from the manual. This conclusion is based on the last provision of subsection I quoted above, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">Imputation is <em>not </em>appropriate where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">1. A payee/payer source of income is a means tested income such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (tanf), Family Independence Payments (fip) (formerly afdc), Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income (ssi), etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The plain reading of this provision is a categorical preclusion against imputing income in all cases in which the defendant is a recipient of means-tested benefits. As the Court of Appeals noted, such a categorical preclusion conflicts with numerous statutory provisions that must be construed in pari materia with the manual, including MCL 722.712(a); MSA 25.492(a), MCL . 552.519(3)(a)(vi); ' MSA 25.176(19)(3)(a)(vi), and with MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The provision of subsection I at issue is, for example, contradictory to the statutory obligation of parents to support their children. MCL 722.712(a); MSA 25.492(a). The mandate of the <em>guidelines </em>is that parents receiving afdc benefits must be excused from their <em>statutory </em>obligation to support their children without consideration of their voluntarily unexercised ability to earn. Upholding such a mandate impermissi-bly grants the Friend of the Court Bureau the power to act in derogation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Likewise, analysis of MCL 552.519(3)(a)(vi); MSA 25.176(19)(3)(a)(vi) demonstrates that the Friend of the Court Bureau has exceeded its legislatively delegated authority in promulgating the categorical preclusion against imputing income to means-tested benefits recipients. This statute is the \u201cenabling\u201d statute that requires the friend of the court to develop and recommend a child support formula. The statute states that \u201cthe formula shall be based upon the needs of the child and the <em>actual resources </em>of each parent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority acknowledges that the term \u201cactual resources\u201d includes \u201ccertain payers\u2019 unexercised ability to pay.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 198. It fails to perceive, however, that the practice of imputing income serves to account for the \u201cactual resources\u201d of those individuals who could presently earn an income, but who do not. Otherwise stated, a parent\u2019s voluntarily unexercised ability to earn, when it exists, is among the \u201cactual resources\u201d of the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In subsection I, the manual recognizes that the award of child support is a judicial determination, but then, in the provision at issue, directs the trial court to ignore defendant\u2019s voluntarily unexercised ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to earn when the defendant receives means-tested benefits. It follows that in that subset of cases in which there is a means-tested benefit recipient, this provision directs the court to base its order of support <em>not </em>on the actual resources of the parents or even the needs of the child, but on the coincidental fact that defendant receives public assistance. Quite simply, a provision of the manual that requires such a result in the absence of deviation from the manual is contrary to \u00a7 519, is therefore without legislative authority, and is void.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For this reason, the categori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>cal preclusion against imputing income to means-tested benefit recipients cannot be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In sum, the manual states that afdc benefits may not be counted as \u201cactual income.\u201d Consistent with statutory directive, however, the manual created by the Friend of the Court Bureau cannot preclude imputation of income on the basis of defendant\u2019s voluntarily unexercised ability to earn, when that unexer-cised ability is among defendant\u2019s actual resources. As contemplated by statute, defendant\u2019s voluntary unexercised ability to earn is the basis for imputation of income in this case. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals that defendant is required to pay child support because she is a voluntarily unemployed individual, and that defendant will not be required to pay support as long as her \u201csole source of income\u201d is afdc, but that the amount will accrue during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">To the extent that the majority transposes, the <em>Sword v Sword </em>factors, or the eight factors contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in the manual<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> into the determination it requires on remand, it must first be observed that the order before us is not an order of contempt. In Sword, Justice Coleman was discussing inability to pay as a defense in a civil contempt proceeding resulting from an \u201corder of the court resulting from a previous trial . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382. The factors cited by the majority were \u201csuggested as] some possible lines of inquiiy\u201d to determine whether an individual should be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the terms of a support order. <em>Id. </em>at 378. The initial order of support and findings of contempt are obviously distinct. Second, the guidelines incorporate virtually all Justice Coleman\u2019s suggestions as considerations in imputing income. Third, the defendant did not assert error on the basis of inadequate ground for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>imputation, and therefore has waived the issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, and most significantly, MCL 552.517(3); MSA 25.176(17)(3) sets forth the factors that must be shown supporting the judicial decision to impute income. The friend of the court\u2019s findings and those adopted by the trial court satisfied these statutory requirements. The manual cannot and does not purport to alter these requirements, because, to the extent it would be claimed to do so, the manual conflicts with legislative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In all events, the majority\u2019s assertion that the \u201ctrial court gave no consideration, except as to defendant\u2019s medical condition, to any of the factors required by <em>Sword </em>or the manual,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 200, is incomprehensible, given the express written findings of the trial court, already noted above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Although Ms. Barber has a limited work history, once recovered from her surgery, there appears to be no physical or mental reason preventing her from working full time. Her children are getting old\u00e9r; they are in school full time; and if her one daughter had special needs, she is not now receiving any type of therapy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>I believe Ms. Barber has the ability to work; that there are unskilled jobs available at minimum wage or greater; and that she has no compelling personal and/or family needs which would keep her from obtaining some type of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The record is clear that both the Mend of the court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the trial courts considered the factors in subsection I before imputing income to defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s decision to remand this case to the Mai court for consideration of the <em>Sword </em>and manual factors is thus both legally incorrect and factually unnecessary. The error in that approach is only compounded by the final conclusion that remand is also necessary to comply with \u201cthe four pieces of information,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 203, required by MCL 722.717(3); MSA 25.497(3). Three of the four are, by the majority\u2019s own view, inapplicable or satisfied. The result is that an order of child support long ago legitimately entered will be delayed until the trial court utters the magic words that apply the manual is unjust and inappropriate. The statute at issue requires only a statement of reasons to impute income, a requirement undoubtedly met by the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">For the reasons stated above, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-7\">Weaver and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\"> Imputation is <em>not </em>appropriate where:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"> 399 Mich 367; 249 NW2d 88 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> In addition to satisfying the mandate of \u00a7 517 and subsection I, this first recommendation also satisfies the initial directive of the manual that requires the exclusion of afdc benefits from the calculation of net income (subsection G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> All parties concede, and correctly so, that this second recommendation was not based even in part on the afdc benefits received by defendant, nor did this recommendation require defendant to satisfy the support obligation by the use of her afdc benefits. Therefore, this second recommendation also comports with subsection g. For the same reasons, the court\u2019s support order in this case is consistent with MCL 400.63(1); MSA 16.463(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\"> The provision of subsection i at issue also conflicts with the obligations of the friend of the court under MCL 552.505; MSA 25.176(5) and with the obligations imposed on the Mend of the court under subsection I described above. To give effect to the provision of subsection I at issue renders these mandatory obligations of the Mend of the court completely meaningless in the subset of cases in which the defendant receives afdc. Even were the Mend of the court to complete its obligations to investigate all relevant facts and to make two separate recommendations, the trial court would be presumptively required to ignore the factual findings of the Mend of the court because of the defendant\u2019s afdc recipient status.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Furthermore, it is clear that the Legislature contemplates situations in which income may be imputed to parents without deviating from the guidelines. MCL 552.517(3); MSA 25.176(17)(3), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">The office shall use the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19 in calculating the child support award. If the office determines from the facts of the case that application of the child support formula would be unjust or inappropriate, <em>or that income should not be based on actual income earned by the parties, </em>the office shall prepare a written report that includes all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">(a) The support amount, based on actual income earned by the parties, determined by application of the child support formula and all factual assumptions upon which that support amount is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">(b) An alternative support recommendation and all factual assumptions upon which the alternative support recommendation is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">(c) How the alternative support recommendation deviates from the child support formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">(d) The reasons for the alternative support recommendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(e) All evidence known to the friend of the court that the individual is or is not able to earn the income imputed to him or her. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">This statutory language clearly distinguishes between cases in which deviation will be appropriate and cases in which imputation of income will be appropriate. Furthermore, there is nothing in this section that suggests that subsection 3 does not apply to cases in which a parent is receiving means-tested benefits. To the contrary, MCL 552.517(3); MSA 25.176(17)(3) clearly contemplates that review will be had under MCL 552.517; MSA 25.176(17) in cases in which \u201ca child is being supported in whole or in part by public assistance-. . . .\u201d The majority\u2019s holding that the courts must <em>deviate </em>from the manual in order to impute income to an afdc recipient is not consistent with legislative intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> The eight factors listed in the manual are found in subsection I, reproduced in relevant part at page 206.

The first was that federal statutes \u201cpreempted\u201d imputation of income to defendant. The second was that the statutes of this state and the guidelines preclude imputation of income. Defense counsel expressly informed the trial court that the amount of the support order was not at issue. He did not claim that income could be imputed only if the trial court\u2019s order expressly referenced the factors contained in subsection i. Likewise, in defendant\u2019s initial application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, defendant raised three points of error \u2014 the two issues of law noted above, and a policy argument regarding imputation of income to afdc recipients. Having failed to raise any issue in respect to the sufficiency of the foundation for the finding of a voluntarily unexercised ability to earn before the trial court or the Court of Appeals, defendant has waived the issue, <em>Arndt v Ball, </em>335 Mich 595, 600; 56 NW2d 394 (1953), and defendant\u2019s two-page attempt to reopen the record before this Court should be unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> The friend of the court referee also noted that defendant had recently moved to an area that defendant contended lacked employment opportunities.
