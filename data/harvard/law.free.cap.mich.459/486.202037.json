Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found that the ordinance violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to free speech. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Defendant operates a home business in Rochester Hills, selling health and beauty products. Her property is zoned for single-family residential use. Rochester Hills Ordinance 200, \u00a7 4.02 allows the operation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>home occupation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on property zoned for residential use, provided that such activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">1. Does not create a nuisance to the surrounding neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">2. Does not become more than an incidental function of the use of the dwelling for residential purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">3. Does not draw truck traffic other than a delivery by a truck no more frequently than an average of once a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">4. Does not employ paid assistants or employees other than those living at the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">5. Does not cause more than a nominal increase of traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">6. <em>Does not cause the erection or maintenance of any signs.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-11\">7. Does not take place outside of the dwelling and/or accessory buildings, so as to be a nuisance or not be in keeping with the residential nature of the surrounding residential area. [Rochester Hills Ordinance 200, \u00a7 4.02(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">Defendant violated the ordinance by attaching a large sign to a tree in her front yard. The sign advertised defendant\u2019s home business as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">Nu Skin and Interior Design Opportunities Available Earn Extra $$$</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">Call (810) 852-5812</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">In February 1995, the city of Rochester Hills issued defendant a ticket for the sign. She filed a motion in the trial court to dismiss the prosecution, arguing that the ordinance unconstitutionally abridged her right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>commercial speech under the First Amendment. The motion was supported by a four-page affidavit stating that the yard sign was an effective advertising tool and that alternative methods of communicating her message had proven ineffective and too expensive. Ultimately the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion, holding that the city has the power to regulate commercial signs, but it does not have the right to ban them.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 224 Mich App 323; 568 NW2d 832 (1997). In particular, it held that the ban on home occupation signs did not directly advance the asserted governmental interest and was more extensive than necessary. We granted leave to appeal. 458 Mich 861 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">\u00dc. THE COMMERCIAL SPEECH DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the government \u201cshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d US Const, Am I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agree that the speech involved in this case is commercial in nature. Such speech is protected by the First Amendment from \u201cunwarranted governmental regulation.\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp v Public Service Comm of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>New York, </em>447 US 557, 561; 100 S Ct 2343; 65 L Ed 2d 341 (1980). However, First Amendment jurisprudence recognizes a distinction between commercial speech and political or expressive speech. This distinction was explained by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bd of Trustees of the State Univ of New York v Fox, </em>492 US 469, 477; 109 S Ct 3028; 106 L Ed 2d 388 (1989), quoting <em>Ohralik v Ohio State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>436 US 447, 456; 98 S Ct 1912; 56 L Ed 2d 444 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201cOur jurisprudence has emphasized that \u2018commercial speech [enjoys] a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values,\u2019 and is subject to \u2018modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Because commercial speech is different in nature than political or expressive speech, the United States Supreme Court has developed a four-part inquiry to determine if a regulation is constitutional that \u201cturns on the nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its regulation.\u201d <em>Central Hudson, </em>447 US 563. That inquiry requires us first to ask: (1) Does the speech concern a lawful activity and is it not misleading, so that it falls within the protections of the First Amendment, and (2) is the government\u2019s restriction justified by a substantial governmental interest? <em>Id. </em>at 566. If those two questions are answered \u201cyes,\u201d then we must go on to ask: (3) Does the regulation directly advance the asserted governmental interest, and (4) is the regulation more exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>sive than necessary to serve the governmental interest? <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">There is no dispute that the speech at issue is both lawful and not misleading. The parties also agree that the government\u2019s interest in regulating commercial signs in a residential area is substantial. In particular, the city implemented the restriction on home occupation signs in order to \u201cprotectf] and maintain[] the nature and character of residential neighborhoods in the City by permitting only minimal, incidental, non-disruptive commercial activity within residential zones.\u201d 224 Mich App 328. Therefore, our inquiry focuses on the last two questions of the <em>Central Hudson </em>inquiry: whether the prohibition on home occupation signs directly advances the asserted governmental interest, and whether the regulation is more extensive than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">A. DOES THE REGULATION DIRECTLY ADVANCE THE ASSERTED GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST?</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The Court of Appeals held that the ban on home occupation signs did not directly advance the city\u2019s interest in protecting the character of residential neighborhoods. In particular, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he banning of home occupation signs does nothing to stem the growth of home businesses; it just prevents homeowmers from posting signs on their property touting their wares and services.\u201d 224 Mich App 328. It also believed that the regulation did not directly advance the city\u2019s interest in aesthetics because the city allowed a variety of other types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>signs to be posted in residential areas that are no more or less aesthetically offensive than home occupation signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">However, we believe that the analysis of the Court of Appeals undervalues the relationship between the city\u2019s goals and the home occupation sign ban. To begin, there is no doubt that signs or billboards on a person\u2019s property, \u201cby their very nature, wherever located and however constructed, can be perceived as an \u2018esthetic harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Members of the City Council of Los Angeles v Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 US 789, 808; 104 S Ct 2118; 80 L Ed 2d 772 (1984), quoting <em>Metromedia, Inc v San Diego, </em>453 US 490, 510; 101 S Ct 2882; 69 L Ed 2d 800 (1981). Indeed, signs often present unique regulatory difficulties for local government.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">While signs are a form of expression protected by the Free Speech Clause, they pose distinctive problems that are subject to municipalities\u2019 police powers. Unlike oral speech, signs take up space and may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. <em>[City of Ladue v Gilleo, </em>512 US 43, 48; 114 S Ct 2038; 129 L Ed 2d 36 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">This is particularly true when the government is concerned not about the content of the message contained on the sign, but rather the appearance of the sign itself. <em>Metromedia, </em>453 US 510.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, \u201cthe substantive evil \u2014 visual blight \u2014 is not merely a possible byproduct of the activity, but is created by the medium of egression itself.\u201d <em>Vincent, </em>466 US 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In this case, the city is not concerned with the content of the message on a home occupation sign; it is concerned about the visual characteristics of the sign. The ordinance in question is designed to preserve the character of residential areas within the city. It attempts to advance this interest by prohibiting commercial signs that are at odds with this residential character. Further, the ordinance is not concerned with the content of the message because it leaves open ample means for a home business to get across its commercial message to customers. For example, defendant could advertise through the local newspaper, phone book, mailings or fliers, or she could erect a sign in an area zoned for commercial use. The ordinance does not prevent defendant from expressing the substance of her commercial speech through any of these other mediums. It only prevents her from expressing her message in a specific and limited way.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Florida Bar v Went For It, Inc, </em>515 US 618, 633-634; 115 S Ct 2371; 132 L Ed 2d 541 (1995) (a thirty-day prohibition against a certain form of legal solicitation was upheld because it left so many other channels of communication open to lawyers).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The Court of Appeals rejected this line of analysis because the city\u2019s regulatory scheme allowed several other types of \u201csigns\u201d in residential areas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we are not persuaded by the Court of Appeals reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ing. First, the city is not required to remove all signs from residential areas in order to further its goal of preserving the character of residential neighborhoods. As the United States Supreme Court has stated in the context of political or expressive speech: \u201c[e]ven if some visual blight remains, a partial, content-neutral ban [on signs] may nevertheless enhance the City\u2019s appearance.\u201d <em>Vincent, </em>466 US 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Second, we agree with the city that the types of signs that are allowed in residential areas are consistent with the character of residential neighborhoods. The permitted signs are of a different nature than home occupation signs because they are either noncommercial in nature, are protected as expressive or political speech, are informational in nature (such as street signs or subdivision signs), or are temporary signs (such as garage sale or real estate signs). Just because the city has concluded that the interest in noncommercial or temporary signs outweighs its municipal interest in preserving the character of residential neighborhoods does not mean that it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>also \u201cgive similar weight to all other commercial advertising.\u201d <em>Metromedia, </em>453 US 512.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In short, we believe that the ban on home occupation signs may directly advance the city\u2019s interest in preserving the character of its residential neighborhoods. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has expressly recognized as much. See <em>Metromedia, </em>453 US 511 (the banning of billboards \u201cis directly related to the stated objectives of traffic safety and esthetics\u201d), and <em>Vincent, </em>466 US 810 (a ban on signs \u201cresponds precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concerns the City\u201d). Thus, the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>is not necessarily unconstitutional under the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">While we agree with the city that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the ordinance in question is unconstitutional under the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, this holding does not alleviate the city\u2019s burden of establishing the validity of its regulation. <em>Cincinnati v Discovery Network, Inc, </em>507 US 410, 416; 113 S Ct 1505; 123 L Ed 2d 99 (1993). In particular, a commercial speech regulation \u201c \u2018may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government\u2019s purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>44 Liquormart, Inc v Rhode Island, </em>517 US 484, 505; 116 S Ct 1495; 134 L Ed 2d 711 (1996). In this case, the complaint against defendant was dismissed before the city had the opportunity to produce testimony or evidence establishing the link between the home occupation sign ban and preserving the residential character of its neighborhoods. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case to the trial court so that the city may have the opportunity to establish the proper factual link between the purpose and the effect of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">B. IS THE REGULATION MORE EXTENSIVE THAN NECESSARY TO SERVE THE GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST?</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Despite its conclusion that the ordinance in question did not meet the third prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, the Court of Appeals also determined that there was not a reasonable fit between the ordinance and the goal of preserving the residential character of neighborhoods because \u201cthe hazards plaintiff seeks to prevent can be easily remedied by restrictions short of a total ban on home occupation signs.\u201d 224 Mich App 331-332. Once again, we are unpersuaded by the Court of Appeals analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The last prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>inquiry requires us to analyze the \u201cfit\u201d between the ban on home occupation signs in this case and the city\u2019s interest in preserving the character of its residential neighborhoods. The United States Supreme Court explained the requirements of this fourth prong as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">What our decisions require is a \u201c \u2018fit\u2019 between the legislature\u2019s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,\u201d \u2014 a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is \u201cin proportion to the interest served,\u201d that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but, as we have put it in the other contexts discussed above, a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective. Within those bounds we leave it to governmental decisionmakers to judge what manner of regulation may best be employed. <em>[Fox, </em>492 US 480 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Thus, the ordinance does not have to be the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d to remedy the asserted governmental interest. The fact that there may be less restrictive means to accomplish the government\u2019s goals will not invalidate an ordinance as long as the ordinance still provides the required \u201creasonable fit.\u201d The question is whether the city\u2019s ban on home occupation signs is a reasonable and narrowly tailored way to preserve the nature and character of residential neighborhoods. Again, we draw guidance from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Metromedia </em>and <em>Vincent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In Metromedia, the Court concluded that a ban on billboards was narrowly tailored to meet the twin goals of traffic safety and aesthetics. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">If the city has a sufficient basis for believing that billboards are traffic hazards and are unattractive, then obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ously the most direct and perhaps the only effective approach to solving the problems they create is to prohibit them. The city has gone no further than necessary in seeking to meet its ends. Indeed, it has stopped short of fully accomplishing its ends: It has not prohibited all billboards, but allows onsite advertising and some other specifically exempted signs. <em>[Metromedia, </em>453 US 508.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In <em>Vincent, </em>the Court concluded the same was true for signs posted on public property. Since <em>Vincent </em>involved noncommercial speech on public property, the Court analyzed the ordinance at issue under the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard. Following the lead of the Court in <em>Metromedia, </em>it upheld the ban on signs on public property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">As recognized in <em>Metromedia, </em>if the city has a sufficient basis for believing that billboards are traffic hazards and are unattractive, \u201cthen obviously the most direct and perhaps the only effective approach to solving the problems they create is to prohibit them.\u201d 453 US at 508. As is true of billboards, the esthetic interests that are implicated by temporary signs are presumptively at work in all parts of the city, including those where appellees posted their signs, and there is no basis in the record in this case upon which to rebut that presumption. These interests are both psychological and economic. The character of the environment affects the quality of life and the value of property in both residential and commercial areas. We hold that on this record these interests are sufficiently substantial to justify this content-neutral, impartially administered prohibition against the posting of appellees\u2019 temporary signs on public property and that such an application of the ordinance does not create an unacceptable threat to the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u201d <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254, 270 [84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686] (1964). <em>[Vincent, </em>466 US 817.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We agree with the United States Supreme Court that, in the present case, one of the most effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ways for the city to protect the character of residential areas may be to prohibit home occupation signs altogether. Stopping short of prohibiting home occupation signs might still allow the blurring of the line between residential and commercial districts, and would not advance the city\u2019s interest as fully as a ban. As noted above, the city still must prove the direct link between the ordinance and the harm sought to be prevented on remand. However, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that the possibility of adopting restrictions short of a ban necessarily makes the ordinance unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">m. conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Rochester Hills Ordinance 200, \u00a7 4.02 is unconstitutional under the four-part <em>Central Hudson </em>analysis. The ordinance may be a legitimate restriction on defendant\u2019s commercial speech rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case to the trial court so that it may proceed in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b799-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Kelly, Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-16\"> \u201cHome Occupation\u201d is defined as \u201can occupation or profession customarily carried on by the occupant of a dwelling unit at the dwelling unit as a secondary use which is clearly subservient to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes.\u201d Rochester Hills Ordinance 200, \u00a7 2.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\"> Similarly, Michigan\u2019s Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">Every person may freely speak, write, express and publish his views on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right; and no law shall be enacted to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.
