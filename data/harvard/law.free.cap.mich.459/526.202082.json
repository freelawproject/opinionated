We affirm. MCR 7.302(F)(1). In doing so, we adopt as our own the following opinion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">In this appeal of right, plaintiffs, elected members of the State Board of Education (hereafter the board), challenge, as being in excess of the authority vested in the Governor by Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2, and as being in derogation of the board\u2019s inherent constitutional prerogatives under Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3, the actions of the Governor in promulgating Executive Orders Nos. 1996-11 and 1996-12. These orders transfer various powers of the board to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Ingham Circuit Court agreed with plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, and, on cross-motions for summary disposition, MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), issued a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction against the implementation of these orders. We reverse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">I. FACTS AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">The facts in this matter are not in dispute. On December 19, 1996, the Governor issued Executive Order No. 1996-11, which transferred \u201call of the administrative statutory powers, duties, functions and responsibilities\u201d of the board to the superintendent by a \u201cType n transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In effect, Executive Order No. 1996-11 made the superintendent, rather than the board, the administrative head of the Department of Education. This order was to become effective March 10, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">Also on December 19, 1996, the Governor issued Executive Order No. 1996-12. Section 1 of this order transferred \u201call of the administrative statutory powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities\u201d of the board, as set forth in approximately one hundred different sections of the Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>gan Compiled Laws, to the superintendent by a \u201cType n transfer.\u201d Section 2 transferred \u201c[a]ll of the statutory rule making powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities\u201d of the board, as set forth in an additional approximately thirty-nine sections of the Michigan Compiled Laws, to the superintendent by a \u201cType n transfer.\u201d Section 3 stated that \u201call the statutory policy making powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities\u201d of the board, as set forth in approximately thirty-six different sections of the Michigan Compiled Laws, \u201cshall remain with the State Board of Education.\u201d Executive Order No. 1996-12 was to become effective July 1, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">Given the nature of the case before us, we must take note of the limits of judicial competence in such matters. We cannot serve as political overseers of the executive or legislative branches, weighing the costs and benefits of competing political ideas or the wisdom of the executive or legislative branches in taking certain actions, but may only determine whether some constitutional provision has been violated by an act (or omission) of the executive or legislative branch. As has been long recognized, when a court confronts a constitutional challenge it must determine the controversy \u201cstripped of all digressive and impertinently heated veneer lest the Court enter \u2014 unnecessarily this time \u2014 -another thorny and trackless bramblebush of politics.\u201d <em>Taylor v Dearborn Twp, </em>370 Mich 47, 50, 51-52; 120 NW2d 737 (1963) (Black, J., joined by T. M. Kavanagh, J.). Indeed, it is clear that issues of motive underlying the contested action are not justiciable. See also <em>Tenney v Brandhove, </em>341 US 367, 37[7]; 71 S Ct 783; 95 L Ed 1019 (1951) (noting that it is \u201cnot consonant with our scheme of government for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators]\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">fi. STANDING'\u00bb<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">As a threshold matter, we address plaintiffs\u2019 standing to maintain this suit and our jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief against the Governor. Plaintiffs represent precisely one-half the membership of the State Board of Education. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Voting as a bloc, plaintiffs have the ability to either determine the result of any matter coming before the board, by convincing one other member to join them, or to create an impasse if all other members of the board seek an opposite outcome. However, under Executive Orders Nos. 1996-11 and 1996-12, plaintiffs\u2019 ability to forestall action by the board in the exercise of statutorily delegated powers is limited because the superintendent may act unilaterally (unless a majority of the board directs otherwise). This arguable diminution in plaintiffs\u2019 <em>collective </em>influence and official power suffices, in our view, to confer standing on them to pursue this challenge. <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 556; 495 NW2d 539 (1993); see also <em>Raines v Byrd, </em>[521] US [811, 822-823]; 117 S Ct 2312, 2319; 138 L Ed 2d 849 (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">We would also note that, because a court at all times is required to question sua sponte its own jurisdiction (whether over a person, the subject matter of an action, or the limits on the relief it may afford), <em>Fox v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>375 Mich 238, 242; 134 NW2d 146 (1965), we have some doubt with respect to the propriety of injunc-tive relief against the Governor. It is clear that separation of powers principles, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, preclude mandatory injunctive relief, mandamus, against the Governor. <em>People ex rel Sutherland v Governor, </em>29 Mich 320; 18 Am Rep 89 (1874). Whether similar reasoning also puts prohibitory injunctive relief beyond the competence of the judiciary appears to be an open question that need not be resolved in this case. We do note that the Supreme Court has recently recognized that declaratory relief normally will suffice to induce the legislative and executive branches, the principal members of which have taken oaths of fealty to the constitution identical to that taken by the judiciary, Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 1, to conform their actions to constitutional requirements or confine them within constitutional limits. <em>Durant v Michigan, </em>456 Mich 175, 205; 566 NW2d 272 (1997). Only when declaratory relief has failed should the courts even begin to consider additional forms of relief in these situations. <em>Id. </em>at 206. The need for utmost delicacy on the part of the judiciary, and respect for the unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>office of Governor, was similarly recognized in <em>People ex rel Johnson v Coffey, </em>237 Mich 591, 602; 213 NW 460 (1927):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">The governor holds an exalted office. To him, and to him alone, a sovereign people has committed the power and the right to determine the facts in the proceeding before us. His decision of disputed question of fact is final. His finding of fact, if it has evidence to support it, is conclusive on this court. It would be unbecoming in us to impugn his motives, and unseemly and unlawful to invade his discretion,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avq\">in. STANDARD OF REVIEW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">This case is before us on cross-motions for summary disposition, MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10). We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition de novo. <em>G &amp; A, Inc v Nahra, </em>204 Mich App 329, 330; 514 NW2d 255 (1994). Indeed, summary disposition under either MCR 2.116(C)(8) or (10) will always present an issue of law for our determination. <em>Nahra, supra </em>at 330.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">IV. ANALYSIS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">When reviewing constitutional provisions, the objective of such review is to effectuate the intent of the people who adopted the constitution. <em>Livingston Co v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Budget, </em>430 Mich 635, 641-642; 425 NW2d 65 (1988). The lodestar principle is that of \u201ccommon understanding,\u201d the sense of the words used that would have been most obvious to those who voted to adopt the constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>House Speaker v Governor, </em>443 Mich 560, 577; 506 NW2d 190 (1993). Where, as here, there is a claim that two different provisions of the constitution collide, we must seek a construction that harmonizes them both. This is so because, both having been adopted simultaneously, neither can logically trump the other. <em>Kunzig v Liquor Control Comm, </em>327 Mich 474, 480-481; 42 NW2d 247 (1950).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The Governor\u2019s power under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2, as has been noted, is nearly plenary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the absence of a legislative veto within sixty days during a regular session (or a full regular session of shorter duration), the Governor, by executive order submitted to the Legislature, may make changes in the organization of the executive branch or in the assignment of functions among its units that the Governor considers necessary for efficient administration. This power includes the authority to delegate, assign, or transfer existing power, responsibility, or authority within, among, or across not more than twenty principal departments. The Governor\u2019s power is limited only by constitutional provisions that would inhibit the Legislature itself. <em>House Speaker v Governor, supra </em>at 578-579; <em>Morris v Governor (On Remand, After Remand), </em>214 Mich App 604, 608; 543 NW2d 363 (1995). Because the Governor\u2019s action has the status of enacted legislation, it is entitled to the same presumption of constitutionality that an equivalent statute would epjoy. Therefore, the judiciary should construe the executive orders as constitutional unless unconstitutionality clearly appears. <em>Mahaffey v Attorney General, </em>222 Mich App 325, 344; 564 NW2d 104 (1997) (statutes should be construed as constitutional unless unconstitutionality is clearly apparent).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The board is a constitutional authority, empowered with \u201c [leadership and general supervision over all public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, except as to institutions of higher education granting baccalaureate degrees.\u201d Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board serves \u201cas the general planning and coordinating body for all public education, including higher education,\u201d and as advisor to \u201cthe legislature as to the financial requirements in connection therewith.\u201d Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3, cl 1. The board consists of eight members nominated by party conventions and elected at large for terms of eight years as prescribed by law. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 3, cl 3. The superintendent is appointed by the board, serves as its chairperson, but without voting rights, and is imbued by the constitution with responsibility for execution of board policies. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 3, cl 2. The Governor serves as an ex-officio member of the board, without the right to vote. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 3, cl 3. As are all such administrative agencies, the board is part of the executive branch of government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Judges of the 74th Judicial Dist v Bay Co, </em>385 Mich 710, 727; 190 NW2d 219 (1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Nonetheless, plaintiffs contend that the board is not part of or within the executive branch. In this regard, we note that Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 provides that the powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. In <em>Federated Publications v Michigan State Univ Bd of Trustees, </em>221 Mich App 103, 113; 561 NW2d 433 (1997),[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] [the Court of Appeals] dealt with a somewhat similar argument, to the effect that the Open Meetings Act, MCL 15.261 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1800(11) <em>et seq., </em>does not apply to public universities that were asserted to be \u201ccoequal branches of government.\u201d [The Court of Appeals] responded unequivocally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">We disagree. In <em>In re 1976 PA 267 </em>[400 Mich 660; 255 NW2d 635 (1977)], the Court noted that the powers of government were divided among <em>three </em>branches of government pursuant to Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2. It further noted that the separation of powers set forth in the constitution was \u201cdesigned to preserve the independence of the three branches of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. Although various cases have stated that public universities are branches of government coequal with the Legislature, the constitution does not contain any provision that elevates them to a fourth branch of government. See <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586, 607; 391 NW2d 2[9]6 (1986). Because autonomous state uni-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>versifies have not achieved that status under the constitution, <em>In re 1976 PA 267 </em>is inapplicable to this case. <em>[Federated Publications, supra </em>at 113-114 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">We apply the same reasoning here. The board is not a fourth branch of government. To so hold would be to directly contravene the plain meaning of Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2. Further, the board is not a part of the legislative or the judicial branch. Rather, the board is part of and within the executive branch, albeit as a constitutionally created entity with five specifically delineated, and therefore constitutionally inviolable, functions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this regard, the constitutional location of the board\u2019s functions within the executive branch is similar to that of the State Transportation Commission, under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 28, the Civil Rights Commission, under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29, and the Civil Service Commission, under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The constitution contains specific requirements relating to the Department of Education. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3, cl 2 specifies that the superintendent \u201cshall be the principal executive officer of a state department of education which shall have powers and duties provided by law.\u201d This must be read as some limitation on the Governor\u2019s generally plenary power under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2, subject to veto by joint legislative resolution, to reorganize state government into not more than twenty principal departments. It may be logically concluded, given the fact that the Department of Education is specifically mentioned in the constitution, that the department is one of the twenty \u201cprincipal departments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">The parties do not suggest that the executive orders at issue engender a violation of the constitutional limitation to twenty principal departments. Similarly, the parties do not suggest that the Governor sought to implement such orders before the expiration of the constitutionally prescribed sixty regular legislative session days or a full regular session of shorter duration. Finally, the parties do not suggest that the Legislature, by concurrent resolution of a majority of the members elected to and serving in each house, disapproved either or both of the executive orders on the basis of a concern about the board\u2019s constitutional prerogatives or authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">The executive orders at issue transfer a variety of statutory powers, both administrative and regulatory, from the board to the superintendent. Both orders explicitly provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">Nothing in this Executive Order should be construed to diminish the constitutional authority of the State Board of Education to provide leadership and general supervision over all public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, except as to institutions of higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>education granting baccalaureate degrees, and its authority to serve as the general planning and coordinating body for all public education including higher education, and to advise the legislature as to the financial requirements in connection therewith. [Executive Order No. 1996-11, \u00b6 2; Executive Order No. 1996-12, \u00b6 5.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">Executive Order No. 1996-12 additionally specifies that the board \u201cshall retain its policy making authority with regard to these statutory provisions by determining the policies, if any, on which the administration of these provisions shall be based.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">The first factor critical to our determination is that the executive orders only address the powers and duties that are conferred upon the board by statute. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the Governor did not transfer <em>constitutionally </em>granted functions from one executive branch agency, board, or entity to another. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3 does not state that the board is to be the head of the Department of Education. Rather, this language is contained in \u00a7 301 of the Executive Organization Act of 1965, MCL 16.401; MSA 3.29(301).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, the functions transferred by Executive Order Nos. 1996-11 and 1996-12 were created by the Legislature through enactment of the relevant statutes, not by the people directly through adoption of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 [3].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Therefore, the board is not <em>constitutionally </em>required, as part of its function of providing leadership and general supervision over all public education, to head the Department of Education. We believe it axiomatic that the Governor may, under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2, cl 2, alter the current scheme and vest that function in the superintendent. Because the Legislature could have delegated such powers to the superintendent <em>ab initio, </em>the Governor is free to redistribute those powers within the Department of Education in any manner in which the Legislature could have assigned such authority originally or by amendment. See <em>House Speaker, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">We note that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at oral argument appeared to concede that the Legislature could constitutionally <em>repeal </em>the sections of the statutes delineating the functions that Executive Order No. 1996-12 transferred. Counsel was unwilling to concede, however, that the Legislature could constitutionally <em>transfer </em>such functions away from the board. Clearly, plaintiffs are standing on unstable ground. Because the Legislature originally enacted these statutory provisions, there can be no constitutional bar to a later repeal. Equally clearly, such a repeal would not impinge upon the board\u2019s constitutional function of leadership and general supervision over public education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">We also believe it clear that the Legislature could constitutionally <em>transfer </em>functions that it had previously vested in the board. Indeed, we see no functional difference between a repeal of such functions and a transfer of such functions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Here, the transfers in question were accomplished by executive order rather than legislative action but, as noted above, under <em>House Speaker, supra, </em>and <em>Morris, supra, </em>when the Legislature allocates a function, the Governor may thereafter change that allocation through the exercise of the Governor\u2019s reorganization powers under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2, cl 2. As <em>House Speaker, supra </em>at 579, specifically held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">The constitution, then, specifically recognizes that, where the Governor feels compelled to make certain changes within the executive branch, he has authority, through the executive order procedure, in effect, to enact laws to carry out those changes. The only way to preclude such changes is through a properly supported legislative veto. <em>In other words, after the initial executive branch organization, the Governor\u2019s reorganization powers are equal to the Legislature\u2019s initial and subsequent reorganization powers. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">Simply put, and as argued by the Governor, if the Legislature can place a <em>statutory </em>function within an executive branch agency, board, or entity, the Governor by executive order may transfer the function to another executive branch agency, board or entity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Plaintiffs also argue that contemporaneous legislative (i.e., the enactment of \u00a7 301 of the Executive Organization Act of 1965) and gubernatorial (i.e., the issuance of Executive Order No. 1965-9) actions constitute \u201cunderstandings\u201d that Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3 should be read as requiring the board to be the head of the Department of Education. We disagree. Rather, we regard these actions not as signaling a contemporaneous understanding that the constitution <em>requires </em>such an outcome but rather as expressing a policy determination that such an outcome was then desirable. Under Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, we do not function as reviewers of such policy determinations, whether they are made by the legislative or executive branch, and we therefore express no opinion with respect to the wisdom, or lack thereof, of making the superintendent the head of the Department of Education. Rather, we hold that the constitution does not <em>require </em>that the board function in this capacity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">By expressly declaring that the board may continue to set policies pursuant to which the superintendent shall carry out these various statutorily created responsibilities, the Governor has merely shifted legislatively delegated authority from the board to the superintendent. In no perceptible way does this facially infringe any of the board\u2019s constitutional powers or prerogatives under Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3. Indeed, Executive Order No. 1996-12 specifically provides that the board shall <em>retain </em>its statutory <em>policy-making </em>powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities. Because the Gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>emor has protected the ultimate authority of the board with apparent fidelity to Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3, no improper transfer of its powers or diminution of its ultimate responsibilities has occurred. See <em>Bays v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>119 Mich App 719, 721-722; 326 NW2d 620 (1982) (no improper delegation of decision-making power of the Civil Service Commission where it retained \u201cultimate power over those decisions with which it is charged\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">Our second major area of analysis concerns whether the Governor\u2019s actions divest the board of \u201ccontrol\u201d over the system of public education in Michigan. We do not believe that the Governor has divested the board of ultimate control or that the Governor\u2019s actions limit that control in violation of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">The party challenging the facial constitutionality of an act \u201cmust establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the [a]ct would be valid. The fact that the . . . [a]ct might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient . . . .\u201d <em>United States v Salerno, </em>481 US 739, 745; 107 S Ct 2095; 95 L Ed 2d 697 (1987). Further, \u201cif any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain [an act], the existence of the state of facts at the time the law [or, here, an executive order] was enacted must be assumed.\u201d 16 Am Jur 2d, Constitutional Law, \u00a7 218, p 642. In addition, \u201c[a] statute [or, here, an executive order] may be constitutional although it lacks provisions which meet constitutional requirements, if it has terms not excluding such requirements, and in this situation the court is justified in holding that the statute was intended to be subject to such requirements, and that those requirements are to be considered as embodied in the statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 225, p 659.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">Here, Executive Order No. 1996-11 states that nothing within it is to be construed to diminish the constitutional authority of the board to provide leadership and general supervision over all public education. Thus, the terms of the executive order specifically <em>include </em>the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3. Additionally, we can easily conceive of a state of facts in which the superintendent exercises the administrative functions of the head of the Department of Education while the board continues to exercise its leadership and general supervision over public education. Indeed, construing Executive Order No. 1996-11 in its entirety, we conclude that this is what the Governor intended. Executive Order No. 1996-11 basically involves the internal organization of the Department of Education and, as such, would have minimal effect on the functioning of the board. It would also appear to be exactly the type of transfer envisioned by Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2 and <em>House Speaker, supra. </em>We do not discount the fact that the superintendent, or his successor(s), could, conceivably and at some time in the future, encroach upon the board\u2019s constitutionally granted functions. However, unless and until such an encroachment actually occurs, the issue is not ripe for adjudication. <em>General Motors Corp v Attorney General, </em>294 Mich 558, 568; 293 NW 751 (1940).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">Similarly, we find no constitutional bar prohibiting the transfer of functions effectuated by Executive Order No. 1996-12. As noted above, this order transfers the <em>\u201cadministrative </em>statutory powers, duties, functions and responsibilities\u201d of the board to the superintendent. Plaintiffs argue that these transfers directly affect the authority of the board and are not \u201cconcerned with the organization and powers of the Department of Education.\u201d However, plaintiffs have not established that there is no set of circumstances under which the transfers would be valid and we note that, as with Executive Order No. 1996-11, Executive Order No. 1996-12 states that nothing within it is to be construed to diminish the constitutional authority of the board to provide leadership and general supervision over all public education. Furthermore, as noted above, Executive Order No. 1996-12 explicitly provides that the board shall retain certain statutory policy-making powers and responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">In this respect, we note that there is no question that the board retains its constitutional authority to appoint the superintendent and to determine the superintendent\u2019s term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>of office and, by implication, this language suggests that the board also retains the power to shorten the term of office of the superintendent. The board also retains its statutory policy-making powers and its ability to provide \u201cleadership and general supervision.\u201d These powers, retained by the board, certainly give the board authority over the superintendent and control over public education. We therefore, under the facts before us, find that <em>ultimate </em>control remains with the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">In conclusion, we do not believe that either Executive Order No. 1996-11 or Executive Order No. 1996-12 facially<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> infringes any of the board\u2019s constitutional powers or prerogatives under Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3. Given that the Governor has protected the board\u2019s ultimate authority over our educational system, we hold that the Governor has made no improper transfer of its powers or responsibilities. We further hold that the executive orders at issue are within the scope of the Governor\u2019s authority under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">We reverse the decision of the circuit court and, pursuant to MCR 7.216(A)(7), grant a judgment of no cause for action in favor of the defendant.

Article 8, \u00a7 3 explicitly vests the Board of Education with \u201c[leadership and general supervision\u201d over public education. It also subordinates the superintendent to the authority of the board, making him responsible for the execution of the board\u2019s mandates.

THE GOVERNOR\u2019S AUTHORITY OVER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the board and the Department of Education are part of the executive branch of government, and, as such, are subject to the Governor\u2019s authority to reorganize the executive branch under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2. <em>House Speaker v </em>Governor, 443 Mich 560, 587; 506 NW2d 190 (1993). The Governor may \u201cenact laws affecting the executive branch, just as the Legislature can.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. However, while the Governor\u2019s power to reorganize the executive branch is extensive, it is not absolute. First, the text of art 5, \u00a7 2 allows the Legislature to \u201cveto\u201d an executive order that it does not agree with. <em>Soap &amp; Detergent Ass\u2019n v Natural Resources </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Comm, </em>415 Mich 728, 752; 330 NW2d 346 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, and relevant to this case, the Governor must work within the confines of the constitution itself. He cannot use his organizational powers to intrude into another constitutional body\u2019s \u201csphere of authority.\u201d <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Service Comm, </em>408 Mich 385, 408; 292 NW2d 442 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The majority relies on the Governor\u2019s argument that he is within his art 5, \u00a7 2 power because the executive orders at issue only involve the transfer of statutory functions. In addition, both of the orders specifically state \u201c[n]othing in this executive order should be construed to diminish the constitutional authority of the State Board of Education to provide leadership and general supervision over all public education . . . .\u201d However, such superficial arguments fail to give weight to the constitutional authority vested in the Board of Education. The Governor cannot reorganize the Department of Education in such a way that infringes the board\u2019s constitutional role, regardless of whether the executive order purports merely to shift \u201cstatutory\u201d functions. <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich 592. If the board\u2019s position as the head of the Department <em>of </em>Education is mandated by the constitution, as argued by plaintiffs, then the prior legislative<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and executive<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pronouncements are merely statements recognizing the structure of the Department of Education that is required by the constitution. Similarly, if the statutory duties placed on the board by the Legislature are mandated by the constitution, then they may not be shifted to another part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the executive branch. Moreover, the inclusion of the language \u201c[njothing in this Executive Order should be construed to diminish the constitutional authority of the State Board of Education\u201d cannot save the executive order if it actually does infringe on the board\u2019s constitutional authority. See <em>Council of Organizations &amp; Others for Ed About Parochiaid, Inc v Governor, </em>455 Mich 557, 570; 566 NW2d 208 (1997) (in construing the constitutionality of a statute, the reviewing court must examine the statute\u2019s requirements rather than the method by which the statute is administered).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In short, determining whether the Governor was acting within his power under art 5, \u00a7 2 requires one to analyze the relationship between the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent established in Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3. If the executive orders in this case violate the respective powers and duties intended under that portion of the constitution, then the executive orders cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">H. CONST 1963, ART 8, \u00a7 3 AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The respective duties of the Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction are provided in Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3. That constitutional provision provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">Leadership and general supervision over all public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, except as to institutions of higher education granting baccalaureate degrees, is vested in a state board of education. It shall serve as the general planning and coordinating body for all public education, including higher education, and shall advise the legislature as to the financial requirements in connection therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The state board of education shall appoint a superintendent of public instruction whose term of office shall be determined by the board. He shall be the chairman of the board without the right to vote, and shall be responsible for the execution of its policies. He shall be the principal executive officer of a state department of education which shall have powers and duties provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The dispute in the present case centers on the meaning of \u201c[\u00a1leadership and general supervision over all public education.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that by vesting the board with \u201c[leadership and general supervision,\u201d the constitution gives the board broad powers to control public education in the state. This power requires that the board head the Department of Education, and the superintendent is designed to serve the board by executing its directives. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that \u201c[leadership and general supervision\u201d gives the board a more remote, policy-making function, while the superintendent is responsible for the day-to-day operation and administration of the Department of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">A. RULES OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">When interpreting the constitution, a reviewing court must first examine the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of its language. <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971). This is because \u201c \u2018[a] constitution is made for the people and by the people.

If the meaning of the words used is clear, then the court need not look any further. <em>Attorney General v State Bd of Assessors, </em>143 Mich 73, 76-77; 106 NW 698 (1906). Where, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>there is no clear common understanding from the language used, the court may also look to \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished\u201d by the provision. <em>Council of Organizations, </em>455 Mich 569; <em>Kearney v Bd of State Auditors, </em>189 Mich 666, 673; 155 NW 510 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">B. TEXT OF CONST 1963, ART 8, \u00a7 3</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The majority gives too little weight to the verbiage used in art 8, \u00a7 3. While the constitution does not specifically state that the Board of Education is to \u201chead\u201d the Department of Education, it does vest the board with \u201c[leadership and general supervision over all public education.\u201d I believe the common understanding of these terms means that the board must be in charge of, direct, and control public education. Justice Black\u2019s concurrence in <em>Welling v Livonia Bd of Ed, </em>382 Mich 620, 625; 171 NW2d 545 (1969), explained that through the adoption of the 1963 Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">[T]he framers proposed and the people adopted a new policy for administration of the system. Now the State board of education, unfettered by those qualifying words \u201cprescribed by law\u201d or \u201cprovided by law,\u201d is armed and charged exclusively with the power and responsibility of administering the public school system which the legislature has set up and now maintains pursuant to section 2 of the eighth article. By section 3 of the same article, the board has been directed \u2014 not by the legislature but by the people \u2014 to lead and superintend the system and become, exclusively, the administrative policy-maker thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">See also <em>Council of Organizations, </em>455 Mich 588 (Cavanagh, J, concurring) (\u201cThe term \u2018control\u2019 is synonymous with the constitutional phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u2018[leadership and general supervision,\u2019 Const 1963, Art 8, \u00a7 3, in the context of public education\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Indeed, the verb \u201clead\u201d is commonly defined as to \u201cdirect the operations, activity, or performance of,\u201d to \u201chave charge of,\u201d or to \u201cgo at the head of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, </em>p 679. Supervise is to \u201csuperintend\u201d or to \u201coversee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1185. To give effect to these terms, the board must be placed in a position to \u201clead\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d public education. To the extent that the Department of Education is the body that is in charge of executing educational programs mandated and funded by the Legislature, the board must maintain a position within that department that allows it to lead and supervise. In other words, the board must act as the head of the Department of Education so that it may carry out its constitutional mandate. Any other structure would undermine the language of art 8, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">This provision also defines the duties of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The superintendent is responsible for the execution of the board\u2019s mandates, and serves as the principal executive officer of the State Department of Education. Significantly, the provision does not place the superintendent as the \u201chead\u201d of the Department of Education, but, rather, as the \u201cprincipal <em>executive </em>officer.\u201d This language tracks that of the previous sentence, which makes the superintendent \u201cresponsible for the <em>execution </em>of [the board\u2019s] policies.\u201d Thus, the language of art 8, \u00a7 3 establishes the superintendent as the executive arm of the board and makes him responsible for implementation of the board\u2019s mandates. It does not contemplate an independent superintendent with authority outside that given by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The language of art 8, \u00a7 3 establishes the Board of Education at the top of the education pyramid in this state. The superintendent follows next, and is charged with executing the mandates of the board. This structure requires the board to \u201clead\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Department of Education, because that is the department charged with executing educational programs throughout the state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">m. CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ADOPTION OF ART 8, \u00a7 3</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The majority also ignores the history and circumstances surrounding the adoption of art 8, \u00a7 3. This history and circumstances evidence a clear intent to establish an hierarchical relationship between the board and the superintendent where the superintendent\u2019s power and authority flow from the board. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Thus, neither the Legislature nor the Governor should be able to alter this relationship by shifting authority for certain responsibilities from the board to the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Before the 1963 Constitution, the Superintendent of Public Instruction was designated to supervise public education in the state. As explained by the Court of Appeals dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">Const 1835, art 10, \u00a7 1 provided for a Superintendent of Public Instruction, to be appointed by the Governor, \u201cwhose duties shall be prescribed by law.\u201d Const 1850, art 8, \u00a7 1 provided for the popular election of a Superintendent of Public Instruction who, under art 13, \u00a7 1, \u201cshall have the general supervision of public instruction, and his duties shall be prescribed by law.\u201d Const 1850, art 13, \u00a7 9 also created an elected board charged with general supervision over the state normal school and other duties \u201cprescribed by law.\u201d Const 1908, art 11, \u00a7 2 also provided for the popular election of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, giving him the responsibility for \u201cgeneral supervision of public instruction in the state\u201d; Const 1908, art 11, \u00a7 6 also continued the limitation on the role of the elected board to supervision of the state normal college and the state normal schools and to such duties \u201cprescribed by law.\u201d [230 Mich App 248-249.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">However, Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3 substantially changed the relationship between the board and the superintendent. First, the board, rather than the superintendent, is responsible for the leadership and general supervision of public education. The superintendent is charged with executing the mandates of the board and is also assigned the position of \u201cprincipal executive officer of a state department of education.\u201d Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Indeed, this shift in power is one of the main themes running through the convention debates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For example, the committee on education stated in support of the proposed constitutional language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">The enlarged state board finally gives Michigan a policy making body on a state level similar to the local boards of education. Michigan is 1 of 3 states that does not have such a board. For many years there have been grave doubts about the advisability of policies and procedures determined by a superintendent of public instruction alone. [1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 1188-1189.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Delegate Romney expounded on the transfer of power in his remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-9\">The present constitution gives the superintendent of public instruction very broad authority over education, but he is not properly equipped either from the standpoint of staff and department or from the standpoint of ability to cover the full field to discharge that function. This contemplates the establishment of this board with these broad functions and, certainly, this provides a more suitable means of discharging these important functions. <em>[Id. </em>at 1190.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Delegate Brake voiced his opinion that the Board of Education should be the dominant force in educational decision making:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-11\">[T]he 8 members of the board should lay down the policy to be followed by this board. They should make the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>sions. They know what the problems are. They should be the dominant force. . . . My first premise is that the board ought to run this show. <em>[Id. </em>at 1193.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Thus, the 1963 Constitution contemplated a marked shift in power from the superintendent to the board. In particular, the power to implement \u201cpolicies and procedures,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1188, formerly determined by the superintendent was transferred to the board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Second, the superintendent is no longer elected, but, rather, appointed by the board. The board also selects the term to be served as superintendent. Through this change, the superintendent is no longer directly accountable to the electorate. Instead, the superintendent\u2019s authority flows from the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Much of the debate at the constitutional convention focused on the change relative to the roles of the board and the superintendent and the source of the superintendent\u2019s authority under the new constitution. In particular, the delegates extensively debated a proposal to have the superintendent elected by the public to a four-year term rather than appointed by the board. <em>Id. </em>at 1212. The delegates supporting an elected superintendent were concerned that the superintendent derived his authority from the board as opposed to the electorate. As explained by the minority report of the education committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">The heart of the question over whether or not the state superintendent of public instruction should be elected by the people or appointed by a state board of education is the question: is Michigan to have a strong superintendent of public instruction who is to be a policymaker by dint of his own strength as the choice of the people, or are we to have a superintendent who is granted his strength and guaranteed his weaknesses by virtue of the whim of a board of education which, even if elected, will by its very nature be more difficult to attune to the public will? <em>[Id. </em>at 1189.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The supporters of the amendment voiced concern over the weakened role of the superintendent. Delegate Douglas, one of the cosponsors of the amendment, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-7\">[I]t is difficult for an appointed official to exert state educational leadership when each major decision must be reviewed and approved by his board. I ask you, with the committee proposal to whom is he responsible? He is not responsible to the people. He is not responsible to the governor. He is a creature of the board, and he is responsible to the board. Every time a major decision has to be made on the administrative board, he has to go back to those people who hired him. <em>[Id. </em>at 1216.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Another cosponsor, Delegate Hart, expressed her belief that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">[i]n our new constitution the superintendent has been demoted. . . . The superintendent, then, is no longer a strong, independent head directly responsible to the people but he is an executive secretary who has no final voice in educational decisionmaking. He is a subservient agent. His position in the governor\u2019s cabinet is weakened because he no longer speaks for himself as a representative of the people. He may speak only for those whom he represents: the 8 members of the state board. [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3147.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">However, the delegates rejected the concerns of Delegates Hart and Douglas by giving the board the power to appoint. The delegates also rejected a similar proposal that would have changed the provision so that the superintendent was appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Board of Education. See 1 Official Record at 1219-1221. In doing so, the delegates reinforced the hierarchical structure presented by the language of art 8, \u00a7 3. The superintendent is the executive arm of the Board of Education, and derives authority from the board. The superintendent does not have independent authority derived from the electorate or the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Third and finally, neither the board nor the superintendent has duties \u201cproscribed by law\u201d as they did in previous constitutions. Instead, the 1963 Constitution recognizes four broad functions of the board: (1) exercising leadership and general supervision over all public education, (2) serving as the general planning and coordinating body for all public education, (3) advising the Legislature regarding the financial requirements in connection with public education, and (4) appointing the superintendent and determining the term of office. The superintendent\u2019s responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>bilities are limited to serving as the executive arm of the board and the Department of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3 does provide that the Department of Education \u201cshall have powers and duties provided by law.\u201d The Legislature, and in some circumstances the Governor, is afforded some authority over the Department of Education through this language.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, that authority may not be used in a manner that undercuts the constitutionally mandated relationship between the board and superintendent. See OAG, 1965-1966, No 4530, pp 300, 307 (June 1, 1966) (The Legislature is \u201cwithout power to prescribe the qualifications for the office of superintendent\u201d because that power is specifically given to the board under art 8, \u00a73).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In sum, the language of the 1963 Constitution, and circumstances surrounding its adoption, evidence an intention to establish an hierarchical relationship between the board and the superintendent. The superintendent, as the executive arm of the board, derives authority from the board, and not from an independent source such as the Governor or the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">IV. APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES TO THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">As explained above, the power of leadership and general supervision vested in the Board of Education necessarily requires that the board also serve as the head of the Department of Education. Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Order 1996-11 effectively undermines the board\u2019s position as the head of the Department of Education. First, it rescinds Executive Order 1965-9, which established the board as the head of the Department of Education. And, second, it transfers all \u201cadministrative statutory powers, duties, functions and responsibilities\u201d from the board to the superintendent. Under the order, the only connection the board has to the Department of Education is through the power to appoint the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">I agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals that Executive Order 1996-11 \u201cwould essentially eliminate the transfer of power voted on by the people when they voted for the 1963 constitution and would render the transfer meaningless.\u201d 230 Mich App 255. Thus, I would find Executive Order 1996-11 to be unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Similarly, the attempted transfer of specific statutory functions from the board to the superintendent within Executive Order 1996-12 is in violation of the hierarchical relationship established between the board and the superintendent in art 8, \u00a7 3. The superintendent, as the executive arm of the board, derives authority from the board. The superintendent\u2019s executive duties within the Department of Education are also subject to the oversight and authority of the board as the head of that department. Thus, the Legislature may proscribe functions for the Department of Education to carry out, but it may not specifically vest the authority over those functions in the superintendent. Likewise, the Governor may not shift those legislatively proscribed functions from the board to the superintendent. Rather, it is for the board to determine which legislatively proscribed functions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>delegate to the superintendent as its executive arm. Therefore, I would also find Executive Order 1996-12 unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<judges id=\"b860-4\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\"> No such legislative veto occurred in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\"> MCL 16.405; MSA 3.29(305).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\"> Executive Order 1965-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\"> Two other provisions of the constitution contemplate the existence of an elected board heading an executive department. Article 5, \u00a7 3 states that \u201c[w]hen a board or commission is at the head of a principal department, <em>unless elected or appointed cts otherwise provided, in this constitution, </em>the members thereof shall be appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The conventional comment accompanying this provision further explains that the Governor generally has the power to appoint boards, except \u201cin the case of <em>elected boards </em>and boards and commissions which have authority to name their executive heads.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Board of Education is the only elected board under the 1963 Constitution. See <em>Viculin v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>386 Mich 375, 385-386, n 11; 192 NW2d 449 (1971). Therefore, art 5, \u00a7 3 seems to refer to the Board of Education as the head of the Department of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Moreover, art 5, \u00a7 9 requires that \u201c[s]ingle executives heading principal departments and <em>the chief executive officers of principal departments headed by boards or commissions </em>shall keep their offices at the seat of government . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section references exactly the structure contemplated by art 8, \u00a7 3 \u2014 the department is headed by the Board of Education, and the superintendent is the principal executive officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\"> One of the most instructive sources for discerning the circumstances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision is the statements of constitutional delegates during the floor debates before passage of the provision. <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich 580-581. While these statements are not decisive with respect to the meaning or intent of the people in ratification, they can provide important background and are particularly helpful when there is \u201c \u2018a recurring thread of explanation binding together the whole of a constitutional concept.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, quoting <em>Regents of the Univ of Michigan v Michigan, </em>395 Mich 52, 60; 235 NW2d 1 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\"> There was also some discussion that this shift in power also necessarily established the Board of Education as the head of the Department of Education. For example, the following colloquy occurred between Delegates Faxon and Bentley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\"><em>Mr. Faxon: . . . The idea will be that the department over which the superintendent will be the executive officer will also be headed by the state board of </em>education? Is that correct, Mr. President and Mr. Bentley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\"><em>Mr. Bentley: </em>Mr. President, we have not entered into this discussion at this time. We are merely saying that we believe the word \u201coffice\u201d should be substituted for the word \u201cdepartment,\u201d since \u201cdepartment\u201d better specifies what it means than \u201coffice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\"><em>Mr. Faxon: </em>Well, the only thing, Mr. President, <em>that I just want to make sure is that the responsibility for the administration of that department, the ultimate responsibility will rest with the state board of education. </em>If that is the intention with the substitution of the word \u201cdepartment,\u201d then I just want to be sure that I understand it, and I\u2019ll go along with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-11\"><em>Mr. Bentley: </em>Mr. President, we are making no change anywhere, except to make it a department instead of an office. [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 2574-2575 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\"> Thus, the board, as head of the Department of Education, may have some \u201cduties provided by law.\u201d These duties are not given to the board directly, but are given to the Department of Education. The board then executes the duties as the head of that department.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
