We find that deputy sheriffs are public officials for purposes of these charges when the allegations supporting them arise from the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"agp-dedup-1\"><em>PEOPLE </em>v <em>COUTU</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Defendants, deputy sheriffs with the Oakland County Sheriffs Department, were charged with multiple counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of misconduct in office and conspiracy to commit misconduct in office. The charges were based on allegations that they afforded work-release inmates preferential treatment in exchange for gifts and favors.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Captain Gerald Reeves was responsible for controlling Oakland County Sheriffs Department prisoners placed outside the main jail facility, including those assigned to the work-release facility. Although Reeves was responsible for its overall functioning, Sergeant James Coutu was responsible for the facility\u2019s day-today operations. Deputies Arthur Kinney and Hollie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Spear were comparatively new employees of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Inmates of the Oakland County work-release facility were permitted to leave the facility for employment for no more than ten hours a day, six days a week. As a condition of the program, inmates paid rent based on a percentage of their income. The facility also housed trustees, who were inmates with responsibilities inside the facility. However, trustees were not required to pay rent or permitted to leave the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Notwithstanding these conditions, defendants allegedly misrecorded work-release hours, allowing inmates to work additional hours, stay out overnight, and travel out-of-state. Defendants also allegedly permitted certain trustees to leave the facility. In some instances, defendants allegedly drafted letters on official letterhead requesting judges to provide favored inmates with early release or work-release status. In exchange, defendants allegedly accepted gifts and favors from inmates. They included money, alcohol, mountain bikes, concert tickets, basketball tickets, cartons of orange juice, extensive home remodeling, automobile repairs, shrink wrapping service, a \u201cno cost\u201d mortgage, and employment for relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">At the conclusion of defendants\u2019 preliminary examination, the trial court concluded that the prosecution had failed to establish the element of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d linking the inmates\u2019 gifts to defendants\u2019 favors. After the district court dismissed the charges against defendants, the circuit court affirmed its ruling. The Court of Appeals affirmed on different grounds. It concluded that the defendant deputy sheriffs held no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>public office, but were mere employees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, as such, were not capable of engaging in the crime of misconduct in office. It declined to address the remainder of the prosecution\u2019s arguments associated with its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE v CARLIN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Defendant, a captain with the Oakland County Sheriffs Department and commander of its Rochester Hills substation, was charged with six counts of misconduct in office. The charges were based on allegations that he misrepresented overtime hours in order to ingratiate himself with Rochester Hills city officials. Although the district court bound over defendant on five counts, the circuit court concluded that defendant was not a public official and dismissed the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In a separate indictment, defendant was charged with fourteen counts of misconduct in office on the basis of allegations that he ordered deputies to chauffeur prominent Oakland County officials to various locations. However, the district court dismissed all fourteen counts, concluding that defendant was not a public official and there was no malfeasance, misfeasance, or corrupt intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Affirming, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals concluded that an Oakland County deputy sheriff is a public employee, not a public official. 225 Mich App 480, 485; 571 NW2d 742 (1997). The majority found the dissent\u2019s distinction between a \u201cpublic officer\u201d and \u201cpublic official\u201d inapposite because the issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>whether defendant held a public office. <em>Id. </em>at 488. Therefore, the majority concluded that the circuit and district courts did not abuse their discretion by dismissing the misconduct in office charges. <em>Id. </em>at 489. After finding that defendant was not a public official, the Court dismissed as moot the remainder of the prosecution\u2019s arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Dissenting, Judge Kelly explained that the district and circuit courts erred by concluding that defendant was not a public officer. <em>Id. </em>at 492. Concluding that the terms \u201cpublic officer\u201d and \u201cpublic official\u201d were not interchangeable, he reasoned that deputy sheriffs, \u201cbeing akin to ordinary foot soldiers, are officers who are public employees but not public \u2018officials.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493-494. Judge Kelly concluded that <em>Schultz v Oakland Co, </em>187 Mich App 96; 466 NW2d 374 (1991), did not extend to defendant because he was a command officer \u201cdescribed by [the] Sheriff ... as the <em>defacto </em>police chief of Rochester Hills.\u201d 225 Mich App 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">n. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that a determination whether defendant is a public officer is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 484. In addition, interpretation and application of statutes is a question of law, also reviewed de novo. <em>People v Webb, </em>458 Mich 265, 274; 580 NW2d 884 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Defendants were charged with the common-law offense of misconduct in office pursuant to the following statutory catchall provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">Any person who shall commit any indictable offense at the common law, for the punishment of which no provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>is expressly made by any statute of this state, shall be guilty of a felony . . . [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>][MCL 750.505; MSA 28.773.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">At common law, misconduct in office constituted \u201ccorrupt behavior by an officer in the exercise of the duties of his office or while acting under color of his office.\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 543. A public officer was distinguished from an employee \u201c \u2018in the greater importance, dignity and independence of his position; in being required to take an official oath, and perhaps to give an official bond.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Freedland, </em>308 Mich 449, 458; 14 NW2d 62 (1944) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">To determine whether a position constituted public office, this Court has examined the following five indispensable elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">(1) It must be created by the Constitution or by the legislature or created by a municipality or other body through authority conferred by the legislature; (2) it must possess a delegation of a portion of the sovereign power of government, to be exercised for the benefit of the public; (3) the powers conferred, and the duties to be discharged, must be defined, directly or impliedly, by the legislature or through legislative authority; (4) the duties must be performed independently and without control of a superior power other than the law, unless they be those of an inferior or subordinate office, created or authorized by the legislature, and by it placed under the general control of a superior officer or body; (5) it must have some permanency and continuity, and not be only temporary or occasional. <em>[Id. </em>at 457-458 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Oath and bond requirements are also of assistance in determining whether a position is a public office. <em>Id. </em>at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Examination of these elements supports the conclusion that a deputy sheriff is a public official for purposes of the common-law offense of misconduct in office. First, the Legislature provided for the creation of deputy sheriffs at MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, as law enforcement personnel, deputy sheriffs exercise sovereign power while engaged in the discretionary discharge of their duties. <em>Tzatzken v Detroit, </em>226 Mich 603, 608; 198 NW 214 (1924). Third, the Legislature defined in part the powers and duties of deputy sheriffs. See MCL 51.75; MSA 5.868,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MCL 51.76(2); MSA 5.868(16)(2), MCL 51.221; MSA 5.881.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Regarding the fourth element, we recognize that deputy sheriffs do not perform their duties independently or without the control of a superior power \u201cother than the law.\u201d <em>Freedland, supra </em>at 458. However, this element also encompasses inferior or subordinate offices authorized by the Legislature that have been placed under the control of such a superior office. <em>Id. </em>Because the Legislature has authorized the appointment of deputy sheriffs, an inferior or subordinate office to that of sheriff, we conclude that this element is satisfied. MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863. Fifth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>deputy sheriffs are generally positions of permanent employment. Finally, deputy sheriffs are required to take an oath before entering upon their duties of office. MCL 51.73; MSA 5.866.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\">Consistent with this analysis, other Michigan courts have recognized that law enforcement personnel are public officers for purposes of wilful neglect charges pursuant to MCL 750.478; MSA 28.746.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>People v Medlyn, </em>215 Mich App 338, 341; 544 NW2d 759 (1996) (deputy sheriff); <em>People v Bommarito, </em>33 Mich App 385, 389; 190 NW2d 359 (1971) (undersheriff). In addition, we have specifically recognized that police officers are public officers for purposes of tort immunity. <em>Tzatzken, supra </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">However, we acknowledge that other courts have rejected the proposition that law enforcement personnel are public officers. In <em>Schultz,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a deputy sheriff was deemed \u201ca public employee rather than a public official\u201d for purposes of determining an effective date of resignation and entitlement to employee benefits. In <em>Burnett v Moore,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an off-duty state trooper was not a state official for purposes of court of claims jurisdiction. Finally, in <em>Solomon v Highland Park Civil Service Comm,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a police officer was not a public officer for purposes of determining whether he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>obligated to mitigate damages related to his wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Although these authorities appear incongruous, their holdings are harmonized by referring to the legal context in which the public official determination arises. Addressing economic issues, courts have consistently concluded that law enforcement personnel are not public officials.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Schultz, supra </em>at 101-102 (resignation, benefits); <em>Burnett, supra </em>at 648-649 (off-duty assault and battery); <em>Solomon, supra </em>at 436-437 (mitigation). Meanwhile, addressing the relationship between law enforcement personnel and the discharge of their duties, courts have consistently concluded they are public officials. See <em>Tzatzken, supra </em>at 608 (tort immunity); <em>Medlyn, supra </em>at 341 (wilful neglect); <em>Bommarito, supra </em>at 389 (wilful neglect).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We find that the determination whether a deputy sheriff is a public official is dependent upon the legal context in which it arises.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, a deputy sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>iff is a public official for purposes of misconduct in office charges when the allegations supporting the charges arise from the performance of that deputy\u2019s official duties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">This conclusion is consistent with that made in other jurisdictions. In <em>State v </em>Bridgers,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a highway patrol officer was considered a public official for purposes of satisfying a statute making it unlawful to threaten public officials with bodily harm. In <em>State v Hess,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a police chief was considered a public official for purposes of misconduct in office charges for accepting money in exchange for revealing police information to organized crime members. In <em>State v Lombardo,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an undersheriff was considered a public official for purposes of misconduct in office charges that he allowed prisoners to leave jail confines in exchange for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Therefore, we find that deputy sheriffs are public officials for purposes of misconduct in office charges when allegations supporting the charges arose from the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">in. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_S\"><em>PEOPLE </em>v <em>COUTU</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">We conclude that defendants are public officials for purposes of their misconduct in office charges because the charges arose from the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>their duties with the Oakland County Sheriffs Department work-release facility. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to it for consideration of the remainder of the prosecution\u2019s arguments associated with its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE v CARLIN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We conclude that defendant Carlin is a public official for purposes of his misconduct in office charges because his charges arose from the performance of his command duties at the Rochester Hills substation. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to it for consideration of the remainder of the prosecution\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Taylor, and.
