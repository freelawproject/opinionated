We likewise affirm. MCR 7.302(F)(1). In doing so, we adopt as our own the following opinion of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">Intervening plaintiff, Auto Club Insurance Association (acia), appeals the October 21, 1994, order of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (wcac), which affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision that ACIA was not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>to reimbursement from defendant\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation insurance carrier because plaintiff\u2019s injury did not arise out of and during the course of her employment. We affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">Plaintiff teaches for defendant school district. Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident in October 1989 when she ran a stop sign on her way to a seminar sponsored by the intermediate school district. She sustained injuries that prevented her from working for the balance of the school year. Plaintiff\u2019s no-fault insurance carrier, inter-venor acia, paid her wage-loss benefits, reimbursed mileage relating to treatment for her injuries, and covered her medical bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">Acia filed a petition for hearing, seeking reimbursement from the school district or its insurer, claiming that plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment within the meaning of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq. </em>At the hearing before the magistrate, plaintiff testified that the seminar was on cooperative learning and lasted three days, for which she was given paid leave by defendant. She testified that she intended to use what she learned for small group problem solving, especially for elementary math classes. She testified that she wished to attend the seminar because she had heard other teachers discuss it favorably. Although plaintiff agreed that she was not required to attend the seminar, she testified that she felt her superiors expected teachers to engage in continuing education and that continuing education was a topic that came up during evaluations. Plaintiff testified that the seminar was held at the intermediate school district office, which was closer to plaintiff\u2019s home than the school at which she taught, although getting there required a different route. However, plaintiff never attended the seminar because the accident occurred on her way to the first session.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s immediate supervisor, principal Robert Badert-scher, testified that attendance at seminars was not required of teachers. He did not request that plaintiff attend the seminar and did not encourage her to do so any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>than he encouraged his teachers generally to avail themselves of such opportunities. He explained that the intermediate school district provided such seminars without cost to teachers in the county, and, so, neither plaintiff nor defendant paid for the privilege of plaintiff\u2019s attendance. He estimated that approximately one-third of the teachers at his school had attended such seminars. Although he testified that attending such seminars did not provide any tangible benefit to the school or the school district, he conceded that a teacher\u2019s participation in seminars might benefit the teacher\u2019s students. He also conceded that attending seminars would be noted in a teacher\u2019s evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">The magistrate denied acia\u2019s request for reimbursement, finding that plaintiff\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of her employment. Acia appealed, and in an opinion and order dated October 21, 1994, the wcac affirmed. [1994 Mich ACO 2376.] The WCAC held that the magistrate properly based her analysis on [the Court of Appeals] opinion in <em>Marcotte v Tamarack City Volunteer Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>120 Mich App 671; 327 NW2d 325 (1982), which quoted with approval from Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on worker\u2019s compensation law and, at 678, summarized the rule as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">The general rule set forth in Larson\u2019s treatise and applied by the wcab [Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board] consists of a two-part test: (1) was the employer directly benefited by the employee\u2019s attendance; and (2) was attendance compulsory or at least definitely urged or expected as opposed to merely encouraged? This rule appears to be consistent with Michigan law. [1994 Mich ACO 2378.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">The wcac found that the magistrate properly applied <em>Marcotte </em>in this case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">In the instant case, the magistrate as factfinder determined that the employer (school district) was not directly benefited by the employee\u2019s attendance at the seminar, based on the testimony of Principal Badertscher, who stated that although the students might benefit from plaintiff\u2019s attendance, the school would not. (Note again the Larson statement that \u201c[i]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>is not enough that the employer would benefit indirectly through the employee\u2019s increased knowledge.\u201d) The magistrate also found, based upon Mr. Badert-scher\u2019s testimony, that plaintiff\u2019s attendance was not compulsory or at least definitely urged or expected, since he stated that he did not require attendance, he did not urge attendance, and that the only reason he asked plaintiff if she was interested in attending the seminar was because of his desire that \u201call employees be the best they could be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">The magistrate\u2019s findings are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record. MCL 418.861a(3) [MSA 17.237(861a)(3)]. Consequently, based on those findings, the standard established in <em>Marcotte, supra, </em>operates to establish that plaintiff\u2019s attendance at the seminar was not an incident of employment. This conclusion is disposi-tive and requires the denial of plaintiff\u2019s claim. [1994 Mich ACO 2379.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">The wcac also affirmed the magistrate\u2019s alternative analysis, that even if attendance at the seminar had been an incident of employment, plaintiff would still not be entitled to benefits because of the general rule that travel to and from work is not compensable and because plaintiff fit none of the exceptions to that rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\"><em>Stark [v L E Myers Co, </em>58 Mich App 439, 443; 228 NW2d 411 (1975)] established four tests, and the magistrate found that none of these tests had been met by plaintiff. As to the first test, the magistrate found, and it was undisputed, that the employer did not pay for or furnish the employee\u2019s transportation. As to the second test, the magistrate found, and it was undisputed, that plaintiff\u2019s working hours would have begun when and if she had arrived at the seminar, and therefore the injury did not occur during or between working hours. As to the third test, the magistrate found that the employer did not derive a special benefit from the employee\u2019s activity at the time of the injury (the fact that plaintiff was in the process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>driving). As to the last test, the magistrate found that plaintiff was not subjected to excessive exposure to traffic risks, because the seminar was being held at a site closer to plaintiff\u2019s home than her normal school building. [1994 Mich ACO 2379-2380.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">[The Court of Appeals] denied acia\u2019s application for leave to appeal in an order dated January 27, 1995 (Docket No. 180297). Acia applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal. In lieu of granting leave, the Supreme Court remanded to [the Court of Appeals] for consideration as on leave granted. 450 Mich 920 (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">The wcac must consider the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact conclusive if they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. This Court\u2019s review of a decision by the wcac is limited. In the absence of fraud, findings of fact made by the wcac acting within its powers shall be conclusive. This Court may review questions of law involved with any final order of the WCAC. MCL 418.861\u00e1(3), (14); MSA 17.237(861a)(3), (14); <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257; 484 NW2d 227 (1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">In <em>Marcotte, supra </em>at 677, [the Court of Appeals] quoted with approval from \u00a7 27.31(c) of Professor Larson\u2019s treatise which now states in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">As to the attending of conventions, institutes, seminars, and trade expositions, compensability similarly turns on whether claimant\u2019s contract of employment contemplated attendance as an incident of his work. It is not enough that the employer would benefit indirectly through the employee\u2019s increased knowledge and experience. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">Employment connection may be supplied by varying degrees of employer encouragement or direction. The clearest case for coverage is that of a teacher who is directed to attend a teacher\u2019s institute. It is also sufficient if attendance, although not compulsory, is \u201cdefinitely urged\u201d or \u201cexpected,\u201d but not if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>is merely \u201cencouraged.\u201d Connection with the employment may also be bolstered by the showing of a specific employer benefit, as distinguished from a vague and general benefit, as when the attendance of an automobile mechanic at an examination given by the manufacturer permitted the dealer to advertise \u201cfactory-trained mechanic.\u201d [1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, pp 5-397 to 5-403.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">We note that in \u00a7 27.31(a) in his treatise Professor Larson summarizes a similar rule in cases when an employee is injured while undertaking educational or training programs to enhance the employee\u2019s own work proficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">We agree with the wcac that the magistrate properly applied the law to the facts as found. Even if defendant was directly benefited by plaintiff\u2019s intent to attend the seminar, substantial evidence supports the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that attendance was neither compulsory nor definitely urged or expected. Instead, it was merely encouraged, and, as such, was not an incident of employment. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s injury did not arise out of and in the course of her employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">We also agree that the magistrate properly denied acia\u2019s petition on the basis of her alternative analysis. The general rule is that injuries that occur while traveling to or coming from work are not compensable. However, a number of exceptions have been recognized where (1) the employee is on a special mission for the employer, (2) the employer derives a special benefit from the employee\u2019s activity at the time of the injury, (3) the employer paid for or furnished the employee transportation as part of the contract of employment, (4) the travel comprised a dual purpose combining the employment-required business needs with the personal activity of the employee, (5) the employment subjected the employee \u201cto excessive exposure to the common risk,\u201d such as traffic risks faced by a truck driver on the way to his rig, and (6) the travel took place as the result of a split-shift working schedule or employment requiring a similar irregular nonfixed working schedule. <em>Bush v Par-menter, Forsythe, Rude &amp; Dethmers, </em>413 Mich 444, 452, n 6; 320 NW2d 858 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Although plaintiff argues that she was on a special mission for her employer, the magistrate\u2019s findings support a contrary conclusion. The magistrate found defendant was not directly benefited by plaintiff\u2019s attendance at the seminar and that the attendance was neither compulsory nor definitely expected. Moreover, even if plaintiff\u2019s attendance at the seminar had been an incident of employment, her injury on the way to the seminar would not be compensa-ble. In <em>Bush, supra </em>at 452, the Supreme Court quoted with approval the following from Professor Larson\u2019s treatise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\">\u201cWhen an employee, having identifiable time and space limits on his employment, makes an off-premises journey which would normally not be covered under the usual going and coming rule, the journey may be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is itself sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself.\u201d 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 16.10, p 4-123.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">In the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s off-premises journey was not an integral portion of the \u201cspecial mission\u201d she is assumed to be on for purposes of this alternative argument. Plaintiff testified that the trip to the seminar was approximately the same length as the trip to her normal worksite, albeit over a different route. Therefore, even if plaintiff\u2019s attendance at the seminar is considered to be the functional equivalent of being at work, plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred while she was on the way to work and therefore is not compensable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> The concurring opinion faults the majority because by adopting the Court of Appeals opinion we deal with this case as turning on the scope of employment issue, in particular whether the event plaintiff was attending was within the scope of her employment. Yet the reason we do so is because, unless plaintiff was within the scope of her employment, then she cannot be engaged in a special mission. Simply stated, a determination of the scope of employment issue is a condition precedent to a determination of the special mission exception. Because plaintiff\u2019s case falters on the scope of employment issue, there is no need to reach the special mission exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The concurring opinion also suggests that we granted leave to appeal in this case solely to consider the special mission exception. We disagree. First, our order granting leave to appeal did not so specify. Second, neither the magistrate, the wcac, the Court of Appeals, nor the parties have treated the special mission exception as the exclusive issue in this case. Finally, it is simply more logical to first analyze the scope of employment issue because, as indicated previously, if the event plaintiff was attending was not in the scope of her employment, then there is no need to consider whether plaintiff was engaged in a special mission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b779-8\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALf\">(concurring). I concur in the result. In this case, appellant requested that this Court answer whether an employee should be granted worker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>compensation benefits when she was injured while on a \u201cspecial mission\u201d for her employer. This was the sole issue on appeal. In our selection process, we chose to grant leave to appeal in this particular case in order to answer that question and to clarify the rule of law in this area. However, the majority has instead opted to carbon copy the Court of Appeals opinion, which fails to provide a thorough analysis of the issue at hand. I write separately to provide such analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">I would hold that this case does not fall within the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception to the general rule that injuries incurred while traveling to and from work are not compensable under Michigan worker\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Whether plaintiff was on a \u201cspecial mission\u201d for her employer while driving to a work-related seminar is a question of law that this Court may resolve without infringing on the fact-finding jurisdiction of the magistrate. MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14); <em>Bush v Parmenter, Forsythe, Rude &amp; Dethmers, </em>413 Mich 444, 460; 320 NW2d 858 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act provides that an employee who receives an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d shall be paid compensation as provided in the act. MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1). The general rule recognized in Michigan is that injuries sustained while going to and from work are not compensable. <em>Thomas v Certified Refrigeration, Inc, </em>392 Mich 623, 631, n 3; 221 NW2d 378 (1974). As noted by the majority, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. One recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>nized exception is the \u201cspecial mission\u201d or \u201cspecial errand\u201d doctrine. Michigan has long recognized the exception,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but has had few occasions to review the doctrine itself. Auto Club asks us to hold that the facts of this case qualify for the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception is judicially created. The theory is that while traveling en route to or from a \u201cspecial mission,\u201d the employee is actually in the performance of duties for the employer. Therefore, an injury then sustained arises \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d employment. The effect is to take an employee on a special mission out of the confines of the general rule. Professor Larson stated that the \u201cspecial errand\u201d or \u201cspecial mission\u201d doctrine provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">When an employee, having identifiable time and space limits on the employment, makes an off-premises journey which would normally not be covered under the usual going and coming rule, the journey may be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is itself sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself. [1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 16.11, pp 4-201 to 4-202.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Implicit in this definition is the notion that the employee must embark on the journey at the request, direction, instruction, or requirement of his employer. An alternative reading would allow recovery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation benefits when an employee is injured on a journey of a wholly personal nature. An overview of Michigan case law, and of other jurisdictions, reveals that this reading is consistent with \u201cspecial mission\u201d jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">This Court has held that the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception applies in a situation where a teacher was \u201cinstructed\u201d to attend an institute and was subjected to \u201chazards of travel.\u201d <em>Stockley v Portage Twp School Dist No 1, </em>231 Mich 523, 530-531; 204 NW 715 (1925). In <em>Le Vasseur v Allen Electric Co, </em>338 Mich 121, 122-123; 61 NW2d 93 (1953), a special mission in the \u201cinterest and at the direction of his employer\u201d was found when an employee was called at home by his employer and \u201crequested\u201d to hook up a cable at the high school. Similarly, the Court of Appeals has held that an employee is on a special mission \u201cat the direction of and for the benefit\u201d of his employer when he is \u201cordered\u201d to report to a different job site. <em>Ream v L E Myers Co, </em>72 Mich App 238, 242-243; 249 NW2d 372 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">On review of other jurisdictions, a common thread appearing is that the employee is usually injured while performing some special act, assignment, mission, or errand <em>at the direction or instruction of the employer</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Professor Larson also provides that \u201c[w]hen any person in authority directs an employee to run some private errand or do some work outside his normal duties for the private benefit of the employer or superior, an injury in the course of that work is compensa-ble.\u201d 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 27.41, p 5-447. The focus of the \u201cspecial mission\u201d inquiry must be on whether the employee was in some way directed to make the journey that is claimed to be a special mission. Thus, when an employee is requested, directed, instructed, or required by the employer to be away from the place of employment, the employee is deemed to be in the course of employment because the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned by the employer. The employee remains within the scope of employment from the moment the employee leaves home or work until he returns either to the regular premises or to the employee\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The majority applied Larson\u2019s definition as an alternative analysis in determining that Ms. Camburn was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>not on a special mission. However, the analysis is incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Although the magistrate did not base her holding on the special mission doctrine, her factual findings axe sufficient for this analysis. The magistrate found that Ms. Cambum\u2019s \u201cattendance was not compulsory or at least definitely urged or expected . . . .\u201d There is nothing more than mere encouragement on the part of the school. Ms. Cambum did not testify that she was requested, directed, instructed, or required to attend the seminar. In addition, the magistrate did not find that Ms. Cambum was compelled in any way to attend. The facts provided that the seminar was available to her if she chose to attend, and that she was encouraged to attend the seminar.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Auto Club relies on <em>Bush v Parmenter, supra, </em>for the proposition that employer encouragement to attend a work-related seminar transforms an ordinary journey into a \u201cspecial mission.\u201d This reliance is misplaced. In <em>Bush, </em>an attorney traveled forty miles to attend a probate seminar in another city. <em>Id. </em>at 446. After the seminar, he went bar hopping and then to a late night dinner before he began his journey home. <em>Id. </em>at 447-448. The attorney was shot and killed while en route home. <em>Id. </em>at 448. The sole issue in <em>Bush </em>was whether the attorney\u2019s deviation was so extensive that the business character of the trip was dissolved. <em>Id. </em>at 450. It was uncontested that the attorney was on a special mission. The opinion discussed the special mission in dicta as a prelude to the discussion of the issue. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Auto Club cannot rely on <em>Bush </em>as a rule of law regarding the special mission exception. Furthermore, the instant case is distinguishable on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>facts.
