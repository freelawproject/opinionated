We agree with the Court of Appeals that the proposed testimony was not excludable under the rape-shield statute, MCL 750.520j; MSA 28.788(10), and was otherwise relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">It is undisputed that the defendant engaged in sexual penetration with complainant Allison Campbell at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the defendant\u2019s apartment on the Michigan State University campus in the early morning hours of August 24, 1994. The issue at trial was whether the complainant consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The complainant testified that on the day in question she was visiting Michigan State University to determine whether she would attend college there. She visited a high school friend, Mary Rachel Stevens, at Stevens\u2019 dormitory room, where she later met the defendant, an acquaintance of Ms. Stevens. They and another person went to defendant\u2019s apartment, where beer was consumed, and later were part of a group that went to a party at another location, where the complainant consumed additional alcohol. Defendant, complainant, Ms. Stevens, and another friend left the party. The complainant testified that she could not remember anything between the time that she was walking toward the defendant\u2019s apartment until she became conscious of the fact that the defendant was on top of her with his penis in her vagina, at which point she told him to stop and cried.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The prosecution\u2019s theory was that the defendant raped the complainant and caused personal injury to her and knew or had reason to know that she was physically incapacitated due to the consumption of alcohol. Defendant was charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As noted, the defense was consent. The defendant testified that he and Ms. Campbell had kissed several times as they walked from the party to his apartment. When they reached the apartment, they continued kissing as they sat in a chair. He asked her if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>wanted to go to the bedroom, to which she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d He testified that they each removed their clothes and got on the bed and had intercourse. At that time the complainant appeared to be laughing. Defendant asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d and realized that she was crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">While there was some evidence to corroborate both defendant\u2019s and complainant\u2019s versions of the events, their testimony was the critical evidence on the central issue of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The issue presently before us concerns the defense efforts to introduce testimony from Ms. Stevens about statements made by complainant. At the preliminary examination, Stevens had testified about a conversation she had with the complainant before they went out that night:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\"><em>Q. </em>Okay. All right. Before you and Allison went out that night, did you have a conversation with her regarding having sex?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\"><em>Q. </em>Please tell us what she said and what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\"><em>Mr. Adams </em>[prosecutor]: Objection on hearsay and rape shield. Unless it has to do with sex with the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019ll take the answer then I\u2019ll just disregard it if [it] doesn\u2019t fall within the . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\"><em>The Witness: </em>We had talked about having sex and she had told me that she had talked to her mom about being on the pill and that she knew she was going to college and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>she \u2014 that she was ready to have sex and she knew that it would probably happen her freshman year at college.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">At trial, the prosecutor moved in limine to exclude the testimony of the conversation between complainant and Ms. Stevens. The circuit judge made a record of the testimony, eliciting comparable testimony from Ms. Stevens. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge ruled that the testimony would not be allowed under the rape-shield statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">I believe it\u2019s absolutely irrelevant and immaterial whether a young woman says that she\u2019s ready to have sex or not in the context of the conversation that has been reported to this Court. It means no more than a similar statement or similar action by a young man who may have purchased and carries with him a condom. This type of testimony is absolutely inadmissible under [MCL] 750.520j [MSA 28.788(10)], which limits admissibility to prior sexual conduct in instances where there has been a prior relationship between the accused and the alleged victim. If this is brought forth as an issue of credibility, it is more prejudicial than it is probative since there are several other conflicts in the testimony of Miss Campbell and other witnesses of which this Court is already aware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">For example, the question of how she came to have bruises on her legs and arms and her neck, where I believe one of the witnesses will testify that he fell on her; and whether or not she was unconscious in bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">For those reasons, the People\u2019s motion in limine to prohibit the testimony both of Mary Rachel Stevens on this topic and the alleged victim is prohibited. Excuse me, the testimony is prohibited. The motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Thereafter, defense counsel made reference to Ms. Stevens\u2019 testimony that the complainant had asked her to \u201cget her a guy\u201d that night, and requested to be able to ask about that. The prosecutor said that no such testimony had yet been elicited,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but that if it were forthcoming the same objection would be made, and that the complainant would deny having made such a request. Defense counsel argued that the testimony would not be covered under the rape-shield statute, but the prosecutor disagreed, and the trial judge excluded the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\"><em>Ms. Vander Voord \u00a1prosecutor]: </em>The term \u201cget me a guy\u201d to most people means get me a guy for something other than just hello, how are you, Your Honor. The inference to the jury is certainly that \u201cget me a guy\u201d means get me a guy to have sex with, and I think that\u2019s a common, everyday connotation of those words. If I asked Your Honor to get me a guy, I would expect that you\u2019d know what I mean. I don\u2019t mean, gee, Judge, I want to have a nice conversation with one of your male friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">I think it\u2019s the wrong connotation to present for this jury. Number one, it would be covered under the same rape-shield law and, number two, the victim denies ever asking Mary Rachel to, quote, \u201cget her a guy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019m going to prohibit this as well. On cross-examination the Prosecutor asked Mary Rachel Stevens whether there was any other conversation about sex that night. Mary Rachel Stevens says there was not. I disagree with the Prosecutor. I don\u2019t think saying \u201cget me a guy\u201d nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>essarily means I want sex, or go get me some guy so I can have a sexual liaison tonight. I think it can be equally interpreted that I don\u2019t want to be the fifth wheel if we\u2019re going out tonight. I don\u2019t want to be the only person there without a date. So, I will grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">At the conclusion of the trial the jury found the defendant guilty of the lesser offense of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. The judge sentenced the defendant to two to fifteen years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of the exclusion of Ms. Stevens\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority found the rape-shield statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> inapplicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">The proffered testimony did not concern the complainant\u2019s past sexual conduct, opinions about her sexual conduct or her reputation regarding sexual conduct. Accordingly, it was not precluded by the rape-shield statute. It concerned statements made by the complainant to her friend showing that she had discussed birth control with her mother in anticipation of going away to college, that she believed that she was \u201cready\u201d for sex, and that she asked her friend to \u201cfind her a guy.\u201d [Slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The Court of Appeals found the evidence relevant, even though it was somewhat removed in time from the alleged assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">Although the statements in this case were somewhat removed from defendant\u2019s alleged act of sexual aggression, we conclude that the statements were \u201cincident\u201d to the alleged sexual conduct because they were made on the evening of the alleged assault and evidenced a state of mind that the complainant <em>may </em>have been contemplating having sex that evening. See <em>[People v Adair, </em>452 Mich 473, 481; 550 NW2d 505 (1996).] We note that these statements are by no means proof that the complainant was \u201cready\u201d for sex on the night in question or that \u201cgetting a guy\u201d meant that she wanted to have sex that night. However, the testimony was relevant in that it had a tendency to make the existence of a fact which was of consequence, i.e., consent, more probable than it would have been without the evidence. MRE 401. [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The prosecutor would have us believe that the Court of Appeals erred in distinguishing between \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201cstatements\u201d in analyzing the proposed testimony under the rape-shield statute. In a prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cspeaking,\u201d \u201cdiscussing,\u201d and \u201cconversing\u201d are all forms of conduct. The case law is replete with examples of \u201cconduct\u201d that have verbal aspects. Further, the prosecutor urges that the policies underlying the rape-shield statute are applicable to the kinds of statements in question here. Conversations with sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ual content carry an equal danger of prejudicing or misleading the jury as testimony about sexual conduct. Similarly, the prosecutor suggests that \u201cthe deterrent to reporting sexual assaults or testifying caused by the embarrassment inherent in having one\u2019s conversations about private matters bared to a jury of strangers is little less than having one\u2019s actions exposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We disagree. The Court of Appeals was clearly correct to find the proposed testimony outside the scope of the rape-shield statute. As we said in <em>People v Adair, supra </em>at 480-481:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">The rape-shield statute was aimed at thwarting the then-existing practice of impeaching the complainant\u2019s testimony with evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior consensual sexual activity, which discouraged victims from testifying \u201cbecause they kn[e]w their private lives [would] be cross-examined.\u2019\u2019 House Legislative Analysis, SB 1207, July 18, 1974.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The proposed testimony by Ms. Stevens does not reveal any prior sexual activity by the complainant. The rape-shield statute acts as a bar to testimony regarding sexual subjects involving the complainant, unless such testimony falls outside the scope of the statute. The statute precludes admission of specified categories of evidence: \u201cevidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct, opinion evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct . . . .\u201d The evidence that the defense sought to introduce did not fall in any of those categories. See <em>People v Hackett, </em>421 Mich 338, 356; 365 NW2d 120 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">This is not to say, however, that no \u201cstatement\u201d would ever be precluded under the rape-shield stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ute. For example, hypothetically, had the complainant\u2019s statement referenced particular acts, i.e., \u201cI\u2019m ready to have sex at college since I had sex with x after our high school graduation party,\u201d that would clearly seem to be inadmissable as evidence of \u201cspecific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct,\u201d despite having some bearing on the victim\u2019s present mental state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Likewise, \u201cstatements\u201d or references to \u201cstatements\u201d made in the course of what is referred to in common parlance as \u201cphone sex\u201d themselves would seem to amount to a prior instance of sexual conduct, and thus be precluded. The important distinction, however, is not so much \u201cstatements\u201d versus \u201cconduct\u201d as whether the statements do or do not <em>amount </em>to or <em>reference </em>specific conduct. Here it is plain that they do neither, and, thus, evidence of the statements would not be barred by rape-shield concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The remaining question is whether the evidence was relevant to the issue of consent. The prosecutor argues that the proposed evidence did not compel a finding that the complainant consented to sex with the defendant on the night in question, suggesting explanations for the statements that could lead a factfinder to reject that conclusion. However, those arguments are misdirected. They are the sort of arguments that one would make to a jury in the face of introduction of such evidence. The arguments do not go to the relevance of the evidence, which is controlled by MRE 401:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The proposed testimony by Stevens has a tendency to make the existence of consent more probable than it would be without the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The prosecutor also briefly argues that the evidence should have been excluded under MRE 403 because the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. However, the prosecutor\u2019s argument makes virtually no effort to show that there was significant danger of unfair prejudice in this case. The prosecutor criticizes the Court of Appeals for selectively mentioning portions of the discussion in the dormitory room and ignoring others. In the prosecutor\u2019s view, this approach by the Court of Appeals majority exemplifies a tendency to take statements with sexual conduct or overtones out of context and use them to imply consent or lack of moral character on the part of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The jury, however, would not have been presented with these statements out of context, but would rather have heard Ms. Stevens\u2019 entire report of the conversations, which would have been subject to cross-examination. The prosecutor could have presented to the jury the explanations made in this Court about why the statements allegedly made by the complainant do not support the defense of consent. Further, on their face, there is nothing particularly inflammatory about the complainant\u2019s statements as reported by Ms. Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Because the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of witness Stevens under the rape-shield statute, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-5\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\"> MCL 750.520d(l)(b); MSA 28.788(4)(l)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> MCL 750.520b(l)(g); MSA 28.788(2)(l)(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\"> Later, the prosecutor withdrew objection to consideration of the testimony for the purpose of the preliminary examination only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-11\"> The prosecution called complainant Campbell at the hearing, and she denied ever having had a conversation with Ms. Stevens about sex.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> Ms. Stevens had not been asked about this at the hearing during trial.

Because I am unpersuaded that the statements come within the general prohibition on character evidence to prove action in conformity with character,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the admission of the two out-of-court statements made by the complainant to Mary Stevens are not precluded by the rape-shield statute. I write separately, however, to address the hearsay issue. At the preliminary examination, the prosecutor objected to the witness\u2019 testimony on the basis of both hearsay and rape shield. On their face, the out-of-court statements are inadmissible hearsay. On remand, after proper objection, the trial court should make a factual determination regarding whether there is a sufficient nexus between the complainant\u2019s statement of future intent and the act at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The statements fall within the purview of the general ban on hearsay evidence because they are extrajudicial statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Unless the contested statements are found to come within one of the enumerated exceptions, the evidence is inadmissible. MRE 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The most likely exception allowing admission of the evidence is MRE 803(3), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Then existing mental, emotional, or physical condition. </em>A statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The defense strategy in this case, and the issue sought to be proved by the hearsay statements, is consent. The state of mind at issue in this case is the complainant\u2019s state of mind at the time the sexual activity took place. I agr\u00e9e with the Court of Appeals dissent that evidence of the complainant\u2019s state of mind at the time the statements were made are not probative of her actual state of mind at the time of the sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Rather, the statements made by the complainant, indicating an intent to engage in sexual activity at an unspecified later date, are being offered to show that she later engaged in conduct consistent with her expressed intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The leading case dealing with the issue of admissibility of statements of intent to show later conduct is <em>Mutual Life Ins Co v Hillmon.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Hillmon, a married man, had taken out three life insurance policies with his wife as beneficiary. In March, 1879, a man was shot. The victim was identified as Hillmon by the man who allegedly shot him. Mrs. Hillmon sued to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the proceeds of the life insurance policies. The identification of the decedent as Hillmon was disputed. The insurance company claimed that the decedent was another man, Frederick Walters, who had disappeared at the same time. Offered as evidence were letters from Walters indicating his intention to leave with \u201ca certain Mr. Hillmon, a sheep trader, for Colorado, or parts unknown to me.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>The letters were excluded as hearsay. The United States Supreme Court held that a declarant\u2019s statement of intention is admissible to prove that the declarant subsequently acted in conformity with that intention where the act is a disputed material fact and that the letters should have been admitted. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">The letters in question were competent not as narratives of facts communicated to the writer by others, nor yet as proof that he actually went away from Wichita, but as evidence that, shortly before the time when other evidence tended to show that he went away, he had the intention of going, and of going with Hillmon, which made it more probable both that he did go and that he went with Hillmon than if there had been no proof of such intention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">However, the admissibility of statements of intention to show later conduct is not without limitation. Where the intention to be proved is only circumstantially relevant to prove the act at issue, there is a nexus requirement between the statement and the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">When the intention to be proved is important only as qualifying an act, its connection with that act must be shown, in order to warrant the admission of declarations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the intention. But whenever the intention is of itself a distinct and material fact in a chain of circumstances, it may be proved by contemporaneous oral or written declarations of the party.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Statements of intent to show later acts \u201cderive [their] reliability and probative value from their nexus to the act itself.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In determining whether there is a sufficient nexus, the trial court considers the contemporaneity between the statement and the act, the opportunity for later reflection, and the relevance of the statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Professor McCormick notes that a common thread running through cases admitting the evidence is that the \u201cintent stated was quite concrete, e.g., to do a specific act at a specific time.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While McCormick acknowledges that specificity is not generally stated as a requirement, he notes that the absence of specificity detracts from the probative value of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Of course, whether there is a sufficient nexus between the complainant\u2019s statements and the act at issue is a preliminary question of fact to be determined by the trial court. MRE 104(a).
