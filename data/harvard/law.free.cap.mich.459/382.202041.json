FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Plaintiff Reynold Tyler began working as a brick mason for the Livonia Public Schools in February, 1978. As a result of a work-related back injury in 1989, he began receiving a PSERA disability pension in May 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In March, 1991, a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate awarded plaintiff worker\u2019s compensation benefits, subject to coordination under \u00a7 354(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. The magistrate concluded that \u00a7 354(1) required coordination of these worker\u2019s compensation benefits with plaintiff\u2019s psera disability pension benefits (which resulted in a decrease in the worker\u2019s compensation payments by the amount of the pension benefits), and that the exception to coordination found in \u00a7 354(14)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not apply to plaintiff\u2019s psera disability pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Plaintiff appealed that portion of the magistrate\u2019s decision calling for the coordination of his benefits to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission, arguing that the magistrate\u2019s order to coordinate benefits was \u201clegally incorrect.\u201d 1993 Mich ACO 1604. The wcac, with one member dissenting, upheld the magistrate\u2019s decision, agreeing that the exception to coordination set forth in \u00a7 354(14) did not apply to psera disability pension payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The WCAC concluded that the purpose of \u00a7 354(14) was to \u201cpermit[] employees to negotiate non-coordination of disability pension plan benefits\u201d with worker\u2019s compensation benefits. 1993 Mich ACO 1608. The WCAC reasoned that, in establishing the right of employers to coordinate benefits, the Legislature was cognizant that existing plans were the result of many years of collective bargaining that did not contemplate coordination. Accordingly, the wcac concluded that the Legislature had enacted \u00a7 354(14) primarily with the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements by the <em>private sector </em>in mind. The commission noted that \u00a7 354(14) uses the terms \u201csame employer,\u201d \u201crenewed,\u201d and \u201centered into\u201d because the section does not contemplate inclusion of \u201cdisability pension plans for public employees, established by mandatory edict of statute.\u201d 1993 Mich ACO 1608.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The Court of Appeals initially denied plaintiffs application for leave to appeal. We remanded for consideration as on leave granted. 447 Mich 970 (1994). On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the wcac in a two-to-one decision, with the majority agreeing that \u00a7 354(14) does not apply to PSERA disability payments. 220 Mich App 697, 702; 561 NW2d 390 (1996). In addition, the Court of Appeals addressed a newly raised constitutional question regarding the validity of this result in light of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, which prohibits an accrued pension benefit provided by the state from being diminished or impaired. The Court stated that the constitutional provision did not apply to disability pensions, \u201cexcept for persons who are already disabled and therefore whose right to such pension has vested (\u2018accrued\u2019).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704. On the basis of this reasoning, the Court concluded that because plaintiff was not disabled on March 31, 1982 (the date \u00a7 354 coordination became effective), he had no right to a disability pension and therefore had no \u201caccrued\u201d disability benefit that could be diminished or impaired in violation of the constitutional section. <em>Id. </em>at 703-704.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Plaintiff filed an application with this Court for leave to appeal, and we granted plaintiffs application. 456 Mich 959 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">n. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">This Court has the power to review questions of law involved in any final order of the WCAC. MCL 418.861; MSA 17.237(861). We review such legal issues de novo, <em>Hagerman v Gencorp Automotive, </em>457 Mich 720, 727; 579 NW2d 347 (1998), according great weight to the administrative inteipretati\u00f3n of the statute unless such inteipretati\u00f3n is clearly wrong. <em>Murphy v Michigan, </em>418 Mich 341, 348-349; 343 NW2d 177 (1984); <em>Schuhknecht v State Plumbing Bd, </em>277 Mich 183, 186-187; 269 NW 136 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">m. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">A. THE WORKER\u2019S DISABILITY COMPENSATION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">In the early 1980\u2019s, the Legislature, after a good deal of public discussion, came to the view that the costs of Michigan\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation system were excessive and therefore a deterrent to the state\u2019s nascent economic recovery from the recession of the late 1970\u2019s. See Senate Analysis Section, SB 573, January 7, 1982. To sense the tenor of the argument of the reformers, it is helpful to recall, as this Court did in <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 655; 375 NW2d 715 (1985), the words of the then Governor William Milliken, who described the system as the \u201c \u2018biggest single liability to Michigan\u2019s job climate today.\u2019 \u201d Having determined to reduce worker\u2019s compensation\u2019s costs, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>passed a series of measures, including legislation limiting attorney fees in worker\u2019s compensation cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> legislation regulating medical fees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and legislation excluding certain fringe benefits from the calculation of worker\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">These bills also included a measure to end the duplicative payment of worker\u2019s compensation benefits to employees who receive other forms of wage-loss benefits, MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354). This reform, described as \u201ccoordination,\u201d meant that the injured party\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation was to be reduced by the amount of the other wage-loss benefits received, such as payments from a disability pension. This approach, which served to reduce disincentives to return to work, was in harmony with the traditional goal of Michigan\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation, which has always been to rehabilitate workers so as to facilitate their return to work. <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 191; 312 NW2d 640 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">To implement coordination, \u00a7 354(1) sweeps broadly. It states in pertinent part that worker\u2019s compensation benefits <em>\u201cshall </em>be reduced by . . . [t]he after-tax amount of the pension . . . payments received or being received pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer from whom [worker\u2019s compensation] benefits . . . are received . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">With this section having established across the board coordination, the Legislature then carved out, in \u00a7 354(14), some narrow exceptions to universal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>coordination. The scope of these exceptions is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The initial sentence of \u00a7 354(14) states that coordination \u201cdoes not apply to any payments received or to be received under a disability pension plan provided by the same employer which plan is in existence on March 31, 1982.\u201d The second sentence of \u00a7 354(14) states: \u201cAny disability pension plan entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982 may provide that the payments under that disability pension plan provided by the employer shall not be coordinated pursuant to this section.\u201d These are essentially \u201copt out\u201d clauses. By their terms, they apply only to disability pension plans that are entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982. These provisions permit plans that are entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982, to be exempted from the general coordination requirement. Said another way, these clauses, if utilized, allow parties to a disability pension plan entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982, to except such plan from the general regime of coordination by specifically so providing in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The scope of this \u201copt out\u201d language is central to the resolution of this dispute. In particular, is the language of \u00a7 354(14) to be read to apply to statutory pensions as well as privately negotiated pensions, or only to the latter? We conclude it applies only to privately negotiated pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">This section of the statute when read in context clearly applies only to private pension plans because of the words used and their meaning in the law. Contextual understanding of statutes is generally grounded in the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis: </em>\u201c[i]t is known from its associates,\u201d see Black\u2019s Law Diction<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ary (6th ed), p 1060. This doctrine stands for the principle that a word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting. <em>State ex el Wayne Co Prosecutor v Diversified Theatrical Corp, </em>396 Mich 244, 249; 240 NW2d 460 (1976), quoting <em>People v Goldman, </em>7 Ill App 3d 253, 255; 287 NE2d 177 (1972).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the second sentence of \u00a7 354(14) enables employers and employees who \u201center[] into\u201d or \u201crenew[]\u201d pension plans to opt out of \u00a7 354(l)\u2019s coordination requirement, we must look to the legal disciplines such words call forth. These words are contractual in nature, terms used by contracting parties when, for example, negotiating a pension plan in conjunction with collective bargaining. On the other hand, pension arrangements pursuant to statute invariably are \u201ccreated\u201d (or \u201cestablished\u201d) and \u201camended\u201d rather than \u201centered into\u201d or \u201crenewed.\u201d This distinction is significant because \u201ccreated\u201d and \u201camended\u201d are not words of contract, but rather are the words of a legislature at work, implying, as they do, unilateral action. The Legislature\u2019s choice of the words \u201centered into\u201d and \u201crenewed\u201d demonstrates that the meaning of the term \u201cplan\u201d in \u00a7 354(14) does not include pensions provided pursuant to statute, but rather only those privately negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In response to this context argument, it was argued that \u00a7 354(14)\u2019s use of the word \u201cplan\u201d must encompass both private and statutory pensions, because \u201cplan\u201d is frequently used in other subsections of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>statute to mean both and thus \u00a7 354(14), by use of an in pari materia argument, must be held to cover both types of pensions. This argument fails, however, because the interpretive aid of the doctrine of in pari materia can only be utilized in a situation where the section of the statute under examination is itself ambiguous. <em>Voorhies v Faust, </em>220 Mich 155, 157; 189 NW 1006 (1922); 2B Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 51.01, p 117; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 791. That not being the case here, in pari materia techniques are inappropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>That the Legislature would feel comfortable treating coordination requirements for privately negotiated pension plans differently than for those pensions created by statute is not hard to understand, as legislatures dealing with labor matters frequently utilize different approaches for public and private employees. This can be seen in the legislative regulation of collective bargaining, labor negotiations, injunctions, arbitrations, and even work stoppages. It seems clear that there is just more legislative reluctance to intervene statutorily in private employment contracts than in public employment contracts. Accordingly, that this legislation would treat this aspect of a labor contract differently, by allowing only parties to privately negotiated pensions to opt out of coordination, is not disharmonious with this pattern, nor should it be viewed with a suspicion that the Legislature might have been unfamiliar with such distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>In fact, that the Michigan Legislature would apply different rules to the two types of pensions is even more explicable when one considers that the roughly parallel federal legislation that dominates this field, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (erisa), 29 USC 1001 <em>et seq., </em>treats pensions maintained by governments differently than those coming from private contractual plans that are subject to the act. 29 USC 1002(32) and 1321(b)(2). This is compelling because federal treatment of matters in other legal fields, such as discrimination, is frequently held to be instructive in explicating our Legislature\u2019s treatment of similar matters.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of this pattern, we are reinforced in our conclusion that \u00a7 354(14), when understood in context, can, and does, apply only to privately negotiated pension plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Moreover, the argument we advance to interpret this statute is such as to give it coherence and rationality, whereas plaintiff\u2019s position, when fully examined, would create a statute that, essentially, has the Legislature acting futilely by marching up the coordination mountain only to about-face and immediately march back to the same spot. Under plaintiff\u2019s reading of the statute, the first clause of \u00a7 354(14) applies to his psera pension, and because the Legislature never, after 1982, \u201crenewed\u201d it or established a new plan, the pre-1982 rule of non-coordination remains to this day in effect for statutory pensions such as his. The problem with this analysis, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>is that if the exception contained in the first clause of \u00a7 354(14) applied not only to privately negotiated pensions, but also to those created by statute, such as the one at issue here, virtually all imaginable pensions (that is, statutory and private) in existence on \u00a7 354\u2019s effective date would be excepted from the broad rule of coordination that was the very purpose of the statute. It would be a circumstance, to use the familiar formulation, where the exception would swallow the rule. Such a construction should be avoided.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is, after all, a well-known principle that \u201c[statutes should be construed so as to prevent absurd results . . . .\u201d <em>McAuley v General Motors Corp, </em>457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998). We should heed this venerable rule that is based on respect for our coequal branch of government, and accordingly on this basis also reject the reading of \u00a7 354(14) tendered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">For all these reasons, we hold that disability pension benefits under the psera are not included in the exception set forth in \u00a7 354(14). Accordingly, psera disability pension benefits are to be coordinated with worker\u2019s compensation benefits as mandated in \u00a7 354(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">B. CONST 1963, ART 9, \u00a7 24</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Plaintiff also asserts that, notwithstanding the merits of any statutory construction argument, to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>strue the statute to require coordination of the psera disability pension payments with worker\u2019s compensation benefits causes the statute to run afoul of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24. This section of the constitution states: \u201cThe accrued financial benefits of each pension plan and retirement system of the state and its political subdivisions shall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or impaired thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Specifically, plaintiff argues that construing \u00a7 354 to require coordination here would diminish or impair an accrued financial benefit under a state pension plan. This position is misbegotten, however, because the statute effects no diminishment or impairment. This section of the Michigan Constitution protects only <em>pension </em>benefits, not <em>worker\u2019s compensation </em>benefits, from diminishment or impairment. This is dispositive, because here it is the worker\u2019s compensation benefits, not the pension benefits, that are being reduced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Coordination has not \u201cdiminished\u201d the value of the pension, because the amount paid as a pension bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>fit does not change. Plaintiff received the same amount each month as a disability pension benefit both before and after coordination. Moreover, there has been no \u201cimpairment\u201d of the disability pension, because coordination has not made the pension less secure, the pensioner has not been required to meet any new conditions or undertake any new responsibilities, and neither the reliability nor collectibility of the payor has been affected. Accordingly, in no sense have plaintiffs pension benefits been \u201cdiminished or impaired\u201d by application of \u00a7 354 coordination to his worker\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We find useful a Court of Appeals case addressing this constitutional issue. In <em>Seitz v Probate Judges Retirement System, </em>189 Mich App 445; 474 NW2d 125 (1991), a statute required that state retirement benefits paid to judges be reduced so that when added to county retirement benefits the total equaled no more than sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the judge\u2019s final salary. The <em>Seitz </em>Court found that any reduction in the amount of state pension benefits did not violate the constitution with respect to the county benefits, which continued to be paid at the same level.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 449-451. Similarly, in this case, any reduction in the amount of plaintiff\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation benefits does not violate the constitution with respect to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>disability pension benefits, which he continues to receive at the same level.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In support of his contention that coordination violates art 9, \u00a7 24, plaintiff cites a footnote in <em>Franks, supra. </em>In the context of our holding that worker\u2019s compensation is an income-maintenance benefit payable under a legislatively mandated social welfare program, and thus is not \u201cproperty\u201d protected by the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we observed in a footnote that art 9, \u00a7 24 of the Michigan Constitution nevertheless protects accrued financial benefits of state pension plans and retirement systems. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 654, n 9. This footnote does not imply that worker\u2019s compensation is protected under \u00a7 24; instead, it was inserted to point out that other legislatively mandated income-maintenance programs, i.e., the pensions of governmental employees, are expressly protected. Plaintiff is correct that his pension is entitled to protection from diminishment or impairment. We hold, however, that by reducing the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits, coordination does not \u201cdiminish or impair\u201d his disability pension benefits. As a result, a reduction in worker\u2019s compensation payments because of coordination with a psera pension under \u00a7 354(1) does not violate art 9, \u00a7 24 of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The Legislature distinguished between privately negotiated and statutorily created pensions in \u00a7 354(14). Only the former fall within the exception to coordination found in \u00a7 354(14). Thus, under \u00a7 354(l)\u2019s broad coordination requirement, pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>benefits paid pursuant to the psera are to be coordinated with worker\u2019s compensation benefits. In addition, any reduction in worker\u2019s compensation resulting from \u00a7 354 coordination does not violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 because the reduction does not diminish or impair a government pension benefit. Accordingly, the reduction of plaintiff\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation benefits because of payments he received under his PSERA disability pension was appropriate under \u00a7 354. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b699-5\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-11\"> MCL 38.1301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.893(111) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> Section 354(1) states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">(1) This section is applicable when either weekly or lump sum payments are made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to section 351, 361, or 835 with respect to the same time period for which . . . payments under ... a disability insurance policy provided by the employer; or <em>pension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the employer, </em>are also received or being received by the employee.

Accordingly, because none of these \u201crenewals\u201d added non-coordination language, the wcac concluded that the psera payments would be subject to coordination even if the psera pension was excepted under the first sentence of \u00a7 354(14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> MCL 418.858; MSA 17.237(858).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\"> MCL 418.315; MSA 17.237(315).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> MCL 418.371; MSA 17.237(371).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has clarified the meaning of this rule by the example he uses in his recent book, <em>A Matter of Interpretation. </em>We repeat it here: \u201cIf you tell me, \u2018I took the boat out on the bay,\u2019 I understand \u2018bay\u2019 to mean one thing; if you tell me, \u2018I put the saddle on the bay,\u2019 I understand it to mean something else.\u201d (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1997), p 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> The dissent has wisely chosen to not deploy this argument but has instead argued the rather remarkable position that no intention to coordinate any pension can be found in the sections of the statute here under discussion. <em>Post </em>at 399, 402. They find support for their conclusion in the fact that the Legislature has provided that \u201cany matter relating to the retirement system\u201d established in the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining under MCL 38.556e; MSA 5.3375(6.5). Why this establishes no interest in coordination in the statute we are focused upon is difficult to discern. Moreover, it is valuable to point out that, assuming arguendo, MCL 38.556e; MSA 5.3375(6.5) includes coordination within the topics of mandatory bargaining, that fact would only be germane to the psera statute, perhaps by analogy, if the psera statute had a comparable section to that referred to in the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act. It does not have such a section, however. Thus, the foray by the dissent into the complications of bargaining under the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act is fruitless because it provides no guidance in our present undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The dissent also argues that the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act and the State Police Retirement Act contain their own coordination provisions. Because these are pensions created by statute, they argue that, somehow, this shows that all such pensions must have similar coordination provisions. This again begs the question, why? It is argued that to not see it as the dissenters do is to not understand that the Legislature \u201cutterly failed to consider the interaction of the psera with the wdca\u2019s coordination provisions.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 400. Yet the Legislature can treat entities differently unless they breach a constitutional protection of one of those entities (which no one asserts has happened here). Furthermore, that the Legislature chose a different coordination system for police officers and fire fighters, if indeed it did do this as the dissenters assert, does not mean that the Legislature \u201cutterly failed\u201d to consider the psera, but rather should be held to show, as legislators are with good reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>understood to know the law, <em>People v Cash, </em>419 Mich 230, 241; 351 NW2d 822 (1984), that the legislators did consider the psera and opted to have the psera, but not the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act and the State Police Retirement Act, be subject to the general rule set forth in \u00a7 354(1). After all, preferential, or at least unique, treatment of public safety officers is not at all unusual in our statutes. One merely needs to consider the singular rules regarding striking and arbitration by public safety officers to be reminded of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">We note that the dissent finally argues that there is a \u201cmore proper way,\u201d i.e., the way provided for in the coordination provision of the State Police Retirement Act, to prevent double recovery for workers with psera pensions than through the legislatively chosen coordination provision of \u00a7 354(1). <em>Post </em>at 401. On the wings of that notion, we are then encouraged to say that no coordination can be held to have been accomplished by the Legislature in enacting \u00a7\u00a7 354(1) and (14). This approach betrays a misunderstanding of our place in the constitutional structure. Our role as members of the judiciary is not to determine whether there is a \u201cmore proper way,\u201d that is, to engage in judicial legislation, but is rather to determine the way that was in fact chosen by the Legislature. It is the Legislature, not we, who are the people\u2019s representatives and authorized to decide public policy matters such as this. To comply with its will, when constitutionally expressed in the statutes, is our duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> See, e.g., <em>Sanchez v Lagoudakis, </em>440 Mich 496, 503-504; 486 NW2d 657 (1992) (finding the federal statute\u2019s intent to include a perception of handicap instructive with respect to whether the Michigan statute included such a perception); <em>Stevens v Inland Waters, Inc, </em>220 Mich App 212, 216-217; 559 NW2d 61 (1996) (using terms from federal disability statutes to define a term in the Michigan statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> Moreover, even if the Legislature had proceeded so puzzlingly, would it not, having done so, immediately have enacted the \u201crenewal\u201d so as to cause coordination?

As this Court has stated, \u201c \u2018The subject matter of workmen\u2019s compensation reposes within the control of the legislature.

Thus, those party to a private pension would have no protected rights in worker\u2019s compensation benefits, and their contract would be subject to changes in the worker\u2019s compensation law. Similarly, plaintiff did not have a protected right to worker\u2019s compensation benefits, and thus his pension, although statutory, is a contract subject to changes in the worker\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\"> It is thus not necessary to determine whether plaintiffs disability pension benefit had \u201caccrued.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> The Court did state that if the amount of the state pension were actually reduced, it may be a violation of \u00a7 24, because both state and county benefits are protected under \u00a7 24. <em>Seitz, supra </em>at 451.

I disagree with the majority that plaintiff\u2019s disability pension payments under the Public School Employees Retirement Act (psera)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are not excepted from coordination with worker\u2019s compensation payments under the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (wdca).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, because the Legislature has failed to express an intention that coordination occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The Court of Appeals opinion relied on the fact that the Legislature chose the phrase \u201cplan or program\u201d in \u00a7 354(1) and the term \u201cplan\u201d in \u00a7 354(14). It used the distinction to support its position that all publicly created pension plans are subject to coordination, while some privately negotiated pensions may not be subject to coordination. The majority in this Court has wisely declined to rely on the plan/program distinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>tion. It nonetheless perpetuates it in its distorted reading of \u00a7 354(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The majority maintains that the Legislature\u2019s choice of \u201ccreated\u201d and \u201camended\u201d in \u00a7 354(14) evidences a legislative intent that only pension plans established through collective bargaining be free of coordination. It fails to recognize that even statutorily created pension plans are subject to contractual negotiation and, in some cases, the Legislature has made them mandatory bargaining subjects. For example, MCL 38.556e; MSA 5.3375(6.5) provides that the pension system sections of the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act are a mandatory subject of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In light of this fact, I disagree that the Legislature intended the distinction the majority draws between statutorily and privately created pension plans. Had the Legislature wished to draw a line between privately and publicly created systems in \u00a7 354(14), it easily could have, and most likely would have, done so in a far less confusing manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">I conclude, that the better view is that the Legislature utterly failed to consider the interaction of the psera with the wdca\u2019s coordination provisions. I note that, while the psera does not, the State Police Retirement Act (spra)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does contain its own coordination provision. Specifically, under its disability retirement section, the SPRA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">The retirement allowance payable under this section, when added to the statutory worker\u2019s compensation benefits applicable in the case, shall not exceed the average annual salary paid to the member for the 2 years immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ately before the duty disability retirement allowance effective date. [MCL 38.1626(4); MSA 5.4002(26)(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> also contains its own specific provision requiring coordination of disability benefits with worker\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Had the Legislature intended to include such a provision in the psera, it could easily have done so. The lack of such a provision, coupled with the ambiguous language of \u00a7 354(1) and \u00a7 354(14), shows that the Legislature did not consider the effect of those sections on the psera.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Even if the Legislature had addressed coordination in the context of the instant case with the intent of preventing double recovery, the majority\u2019s decision does not comport with such an intent. The majority assumes that coordination requires that plaintiffs worker\u2019s compensation payments be decreased by the amount of the pension benefits received under the psera. As indicated under MCL 38.1626(4); MSA 5.4002(26)(4), there is a more proper way to prevent double recovery. It is to reduce the total benefits only enough to ensure that the psera allowance, added to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation benefits, does not exceed the average annual salary paid before disability. Requiring offset of wdca benefits in the full amount of PSERA benefits does not comport with the goal that worker\u2019s compensation benefits should \u201c \u2018restore wage-earning capacity lost in on-the-job accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 654-655; 375 NW2d 715 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Where the Legislature has ambiguously expressed itself, we may be called on to inteipret its intent. However, as my colleagues in the majority have frequently pointed out in other contexts, it is improper for us to engage in result-oriented judicial legislation. If the Legislature wishes to amend \u00a7 354(1), \u00a7 354(14), or the language in the psera to cause coordination of benefits, it knows how to accomplish that. Rather than awaiting legislative amendment of the statute, the majority elects to do it itself through a tortured reading of \u00a7 354(1) and \u00a7 354(14). I decline to join in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\"> MCL 38.1301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.893(111) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"> MCL 418.354(14); MSA 17.237(354)(14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> MCL 38.1601 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 5.4002(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> MCL 38.551 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3375(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> The Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Act specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">Amounts paid under Act No. 317 of the Public Acts of 1969 [MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.] </em>to a retired member shall be offset against and payable in place of benefits provided under this act.
