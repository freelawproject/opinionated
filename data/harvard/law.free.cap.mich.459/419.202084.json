FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Defendant, Patrick Law, pleaded guilty of desertion and abandonment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> admitting that he failed to pay support for his minor child from January 1, 1990, through July 27, 1992. The trial court sentenced defendant to two to three years in prison and ordered him to pay restitution under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act. At an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of restitution, it was established that, pursuant to defendant\u2019s divorce judgment of May 14, 1979, defendant was to pay $43 a week in child support plus all.his children\u2019s necessary hospital and other associated medical costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found that defendant had never paid any child support and had failed to pay $41,732.34 in medical costs arising out of injuries suffered by his daughter in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">On September 28, 1994, the judge ordered restitution equal to the amount of (1) unpaid weekly child support from the May 14, 1979, date of divorce to the July 19, 1994, date of sentencing, (2) the unpaid medical costs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) interest on these amounts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>came due after July 6, 1987.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">Defendant appealed in the Court of Appeals, which agreed with defendant that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay interest on the restitution award. 223 Mich App 585, 593; 568 NW2d 90 (1997). The Court of Appeals reasoned that the cvra does not authorize the imposition of interest and that the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Langford v Langford, </em>196 Mich App 297; 492 NW2d 524 (1992), was mistaken because <em>Langford </em>only concerned civil damages and the instant case involved restitution under a criminal statute. In addition, the Court of Appeals, relying primarily on its opinion in <em>People v Grant, </em>210 Mich App 467; 534 NW2d 149 (1995), rev\u2019d 455 Mich 221, 233; 565 NW2d 389 (1997), found that the trial court did not properly address the factors related to defendant\u2019s financial situation as required by the CVRA, and thus remanded the case to the trial court on this ground.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Plaintiff appealed to this Court, and we granted leave in order to determine whether the trial court had the authority to award interest on the unpaid support as part of restitution pursuant to the CVRA. 457 Mich 853 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In deciding this issue, we must interpret the cvra. An issue of statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>People v Webb, </em>458 Mich 265, 274-275; 580 NW2d 884 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">m. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ajh-dedup-0\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The trial judge ordered defendant to pay restitution pursuant to subsection 16(2) of the cvra that at the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing stated \u201cthe court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of a crime, shall order . . . that the defendant make full or partial restitution to any victim of the defendant\u2019s course of conduct . . . .\u201d 1993 PA 341.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 17 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>CVRA states that \u201c[i]n determining the amount of restitution to order under section 16, the court shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense.\u201d MCL 780.767(1); MSA 28.1287(767)(1). Thus, this case turns on whether the amount of the loss sustained by the victim includes interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The quoted language of \u00a7 17 requires a court to focus on the loss sustained by the victim. This Court has held in the past that \u201cmoney has a \u2018use value\u2019 and interest is a legitimate element of damages\u201d used to compensate a party for the lost use of its funds. <em>Gordon Sel-Way Inc v Spence Bros, Inc, </em>438 Mich 488, 499; 475 NW2d 704 (1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This situation is not distinguishable, and, accordingly, because a monetary loss includes the use value of money, i.e., interest, \u00a7 17\u2019s focus on \u201cthe loss sustained by any victim\u201d indicates that interest is a legitimate element of monetary restitution under the CVRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Moreover, in addition to the language of \u00a7 17, the Legislature\u2019s use of a legally understood term such as \u201crestitution\u201d bears on whether interest is allowed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The term restitution is understood in Michigan to include interest, and this can be seen in <em>Langley v Kirker, </em>247 Mich 443; 225 NW 931 (1929), and <em>Grievance Administrator v Floyd, </em>447 Mich 422; 523 NW2d 227 (1994).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In accord with Michigan\u2019s view is the Restatement Second on Restitution (tentative draft), \u00a7 28, p 216, which states that \u201c[a] judgment or order for restitution will, at the claimant\u2019s instance, include an award of an amount as interest required to prevent unjust enrichment of the defendant.\u201d Accord Restatement Restitution, \u00a7 156, p 618. These authorities demonstrate that the term restitution should be understood with a meaning that includes interest, and thus the use of this term in the CVRA demonstrates that interest is to be included in restitution orders thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Federal decisions interpreting the federal statute on this topic, the Victim and Witness Protection Act (vwpa), also shed light on this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The vwpa, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the cvra, uses the term \u201crestitution\u201d and states that the judge must order restitution in an amount equal to the \u201cvictim\u2019s losses.\u201d This Court has interpreted the vwpa and the cvra in a similar manner when they use similar language. See, e.g., <em>People v </em>Grant, 455 Mich 243, n 30, <em>supra. </em>Federal courts of appeal have upheld restitution orders that included interest. For example, in <em>United States v Patty, </em>992 F2d 1045, 1050 (CA 10, 1993), the Tenth Circuit upheld prejudgment interest on a restitution obligation stating that \u201c[p] rejudgment interest reflects the victim\u2019s loss due to his inability to use the money for a productive purpose, and is therefore necessary to make the victim whole.\u201d See also <em>United States v Rochester, </em>898 F2d 971, 983 (CA 5, 1990). In <em>United States v Smith, </em>944 F2d 618, 626 (CA 9, 1991), the Ninth Circuit similarly upheld an interest award and noted \u201c[foregone interest is one aspect of the victim\u2019s actual loss, and thus may be part of the victim\u2019s compensation.\u201d In <em>Virgin Islands v Davis, </em>43 F3d 41, 47 (CA 3, 1994), the Third Circuit stated prejudgment interest \u201cis an aspect of the victim\u2019s actual loss which must be accounted for in the calculation of restitution in order to effect full compensation.\u201d All these decisions that have interpreted the vwpa, a statute that is a federal analogy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the CVRA, indicate that interest is properly included in criminal restitution orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The decisions of several state courts also indicate that interest is properly included in restitution orders. For example, state courts in Alaska and Colorado have upheld criminal restitution orders that included interest in the restitution amount. In both these states, the relevant sentencing statutes are similar to the CVRA in that they use the term \u201crestitution\u201d and define the appropriate amount of restitution in a manner comparable to the CVRA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Dorris v State, </em>656 P2d 578, 584 (Alas App, 1982), the Alaska Court of Appeals found interest appropriate under that state\u2019s criminal restitution statute, stating \u201cthe purpose of the restitution statute is to make the victim whole . . . .\u201d Similarly, in <em>Valenzuela v People, </em>893 P2d 97, 99 (Colo, 1995), the Colorado Supreme Court held that interest could be charged to a defendant as part of restitution stating \u201c[a]warding interest is compensation for actual, pecuniary damage suffered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the victim incidental to the defendant\u2019s crime . . . These decisions from sister states that have found interest appropriate under statutes that use language similar to the cvra reinforce our finding that interest is a legitimate element of a restitution order under the cvra.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Having determined that interest is allowed under the cvra, the question becomes how to properly calculate the restitution amount to include the appropriate amount of interest. To be clear, it must be understood that under the approach we have just discussed and adopted foregone interest is one aspect of the victim\u2019s actual loss and the court must first determine it and add it to the underlying amount to establish the corpus, or principal, of the restitution. It would only be at that point that, assuming the version of the cvra in effect at the time of sentencing allowed it, the court could consider the factors the Legislature articulated (defendant\u2019s income, financial needs, dependents, etc., as set forth in footnote 5) to determine if a reduction of the restitution amount was appropriate. This is, of coruse, a very different understanding of interest than lawyers and judges are familiar with in civil cases, where interest is usually thought of as an \u201cadd-on\u201d to the adjudicated damages. Thus, care should be taken to avoid confusion when dealing with interest in this less familiar criminal law context. Moreover, in this case it is necessary in the calculating of the corpus to do so for two periods. The first (May 14, 1979-July 6, 1987) is the period when the Legislature had not spoken regarding the support arrearage interest, and thus a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>interest rate was discretionary with the court. The second (July 6, 1987-July 19, 1994) is the period when the Legislature had fixed the interest rate in such cases by statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">During this first period, the establishment of the interest component of the restitution amount was to be based on the judge\u2019s exercise of his discretion. That process being completed, it was then necessary for the court, under the statute then in effect, to determine whether to award either full or partial restitution, after consideration of the statutory factors relevant to that decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 1993 PA 341, \u00a7 45. Thus in determining the amount of restitution for the first period, the trial judge had discretion not only regarding a reasonable interest rate on the unpaid amounts, but also, using the factors in the statute, whether there should be full or partial restitution of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The trial court did not order interest, however, for the period from May 14, 1979, to July 6, 1987. The court stated that it was not including interest for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>amounts due before July 6, 1987, because the trial judge in <em>defendant\u2019s divorce action </em>had not awarded interest on defendant\u2019s <em>support order. </em>This was error because, as outlined earlier, the trial judge had authority to award interest under the CVRA, regardless of whether the judge in defendant\u2019s divorce action ordered interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The second period requires a different restitution calculation. The reason is that in the 1987 amendment, MCL 552.603(6)(a); MSA 25.164(3)(6)(a), the Legislature changed the Support and Visitation Enforcement Act to provide that support orders were to be considered judgments with the \u201cfull force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of this state . . . .\u201d Simply stated, this meant that interest is mandatory with respect to support arrearages at the statutory rate, just as it had traditionally been with other civil judgments. Indeed, the Court of Appeals had so found in <em>Langford, supra </em>at 299-300, and in this case the judge utilized this holding. This was proper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge also specifically stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>was ordering full, as opposed to partial, restitution. The amount on which he based this decision, however, included not only the correctly calculated amount of unpaid support plus interest from the second period, but also the incorrectly calculated amount from the first period.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">It is for these reasons that we remand this case to the trial court for a recalculation of the restitution order. In accordance with this opinion, the judge must initially determine a reasonable interest rate for the first period. Following this determination, he must then recalculate the total amount of full restitution, which will be comprised of the amount of unpaid support plus interest for both the first and second periods. Finally, with regard to this new aggregate amount, the judge must exercise his discretion regarding whether to order full or partial restitution after considering the relevant statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">On remand, defendant shall have the opportunity to present argument or evidence regarding both the appropriate interest rate for the first period and the statutory factors the judge must consider in his decision to award full or partial restitution. This is consistent with our holding in <em>People v Grant, </em>455 Mich 243, that if the defendant disputes the type or amount of restitution, the dispute must be resolved by a preponderance of the evidence. Because defendant in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>case did dispute the inclusion of interest in the amount of restitution, a new hearing to determine the amount of restitution is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In sum, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that a court has the authority to award interest on unpaid support under the CVRA. Accordingly, we vacate the restitution order and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b732-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b732-8\">Cavanagh, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b732-9\">Kelly, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> MCL 750.161; MSA 28.358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> Under MCL 552.602; MSA 25.164(2),support is defined as both the amount of the child support and the amount of the medical bills ordered to be paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\"> Total unpaid child support plus unpaid medical costs came to $89,083.91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\"> For the period from May 14, 1979, to July 6, 1987, the trial court did not award interest because the judge reasoned that interest for this period should not be included in the amount of restitution because before July 6, 1987, interest on an arrearage in a divorce action was left to the discretion of the trial judge, and the trial judge in defendant\u2019s divorce action had not ordered defendant to pay interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">July 6, 1987 was apparently a referent for the judge because of his reading of <em>Langford v Langford, </em>196 Mich App 297; 492 NW2d 524 (1992). In <em>Langford, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the plain language of an amendment to the Support and Visitation Enforcement Act (sva), MCL 552.601 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.164(1) <em>et seq., </em>effective July 6, 1987, meant that the arrearage on a support order is a judgment amount from the date that the amount falls due, and interest is to run on that amount as it would any other civil judgment under \u00a7 6013 of the Revised Judicature Act, MCL 600.6013; MSA27A.6013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\"> At the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing, the cvra stated that \u201c[t]he court . . . shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources and earning ability of the defendant, the financial needs of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>dents, and such other factors as the court considers appropriate.\u201d 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.767(1); MSA 28.1287(767)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\"> We note that restitution is also one of the rights accorded to crime victims under the Michigan Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-12\">(1) Crime victims, as defined by law, shall have the following rights, as provided by law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-13\">The right to be treated with fairness and respect for their dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-14\">The right to timely disposition of the case following arrest of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-15\">The right to be reasonably protected from the accused throughout the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The right to notification of court proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">The right to attend trial and all other court proceedings the accused has the right to attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">The right to confer with the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">The right to make a statement to the court at sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">\n<em>The right to restitution.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">The right to information about the conviction, sentence, imprisonment, and release of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-12\">(2) The legislature may provide by law for the enforcement of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-13\">(3) The legislature may provide for an assessment against convicted defendants to pay for crime victims\u2019 rights.

We stated in <em>People v Grant, </em>455 Mich 233, that \u201c[t]he statute involves two separate inquiries: first, a determination of the amount of the victim\u2019s loss and, second, an evaluation of the factors that would affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\"> The Court of Appeals in this case stated that the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Langford, </em>a civil matter, was misplaced because the instant case was a criminal matter. 223 Mich App 593.

Rather, it merely gives guidance regarding what the Legislature has stated is the compensation for the use value of money, i.e., interest, when dealing with the payment of civil child support arrear-ages. The authority in the criminal matter to award interest comes from the cvra itself where it describes the calculation of restitution in terms of the \u201camount of the loss sustained by any victim . . . .\u201d MCL 780.767(1); MSA 28.1287(767)(1).

Accordingly, in an adjudication after the effective date of the amendment (January 1,1996), the restitution calculation should be based on the 8 percent \u201csurcharge\u201d on amounts accruing after January 1, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
