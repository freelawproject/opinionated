In support of this contention he relies upon section 1205 of the Penal Code as amended March 19, 1891. (Stats. 1891, p. 52.) That section, as originally incorporated into the code, provided that the judgment should specify the extent of imprisonment, \u201cwhich could not exceed one day for every two dollars of the fine.\u201d Section 1446 of the Penal Code, relating to proceedings in justice\u2019s and police courts, provided that a judgment that the defendant pay a fine might also direct that he be imprisoned until the fine is satisfied, in the proportion of one day\u2019s imprisonment for every two dollars of the fine. Both of these sections were amended in 1874 by inserting the words \u201c one dollar \u201d in lieu of the words \u201c two dollars,\u201d as used in each section. Section 1446 has remained the same as thus amended. The amendment to section 1205, approved March 10, 1891, provides that the imprisonment \u201cmust not exceed one day for every two dollars of the fine, nor extend in any case beyond the term for which the defendant might be sentenced to imprisonment for the offense of which he has been convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In my judgment, the recent amendment to section 1205 in no way affected the operation of section 1446. I fliink that the legislature intended that the justice\u2019s and police courts should remain clothed with the discretion which they have exercised under section 1446 ever since its adoption. The amendment to section 1205 is a limitation upon the powers of the superior courts, which alone have jurisdiction of misdemeanors \u25a0\u2014with one or two exceptions (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 115) \u2014for which the punishment may be greater than six months\u2019 imprisonment, or five hundred dollars fine, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>both. In certain cases the superior court may impose as a penalty for a misdemeanor several years\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail, or five thousand dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment. It is altogether likely that the members of the legislature had observed in. some instances an abuse of discretion in the exercise of' this authority by the superior courts under the provisions of the statute, and desired to limit their power-in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">I do not think there is any merit in the point made-by counsel for petitioner, that the \u201cpunishment must be the same in all courts for the same offense.\u201d As was said in <em>Ex parte Soto, 88 </em>Cal. 627: \u201c Section 1446 of the Penal Code does not imperatively require that the direction for imprisonment in case of non-payment of a fine shall be at the rate or in the proportion of one day for one dollar. It is, in terms, permissive; the discretion of the magistrate is absolute whether or not to impose- any imprisonment whatever.\u201d The justice\u2019s and police courts having this discretion, and the court being limited in the exercise thereof to the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed as a penalty or part of the penalty, there is very little danger of petty offenders being subjected to a harsher or more burdensome rule than the one which is applied to more serious offenders;. It is true, a person charged with a felony may be convicted of a misdemeanor of which the justice\u2019s and police-courts have jurisdiction, and be sentenced by the superior court to a greater term of imprisonment than he would have received if he had been tried before a justice of the peace for the same offense. Such a thing is possible; but that fact does not invalidate the law. The various superior and justice\u2019s courts throughout the state are constantly trying criminal cases of the same nature, and imposing different sentences. It is impossible to lay down any fixed rule by which the judges may determine the exact penalty to be imposed in each cas\u00f3, and the fact that criminals are subjected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>to different degrees of punishment for the same offense in different courts does not affect the validity of the law, <em>(Scrinegrour </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Chand. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The petitioner is remanded to the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
