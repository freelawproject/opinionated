B. Graham,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-20\">\u201c Attorney for Plaintiff and Defendants to Cross-complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>On March 21, 1892, the defendants in the cross-complaint served upon Glenn and filed in the court a notice of their intention to move for a new trial of the action, stating that the motion would be made upon a statement of the case to be settled and allowed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Subsequently, the moving parties presented to the court their statement of the case, and asked that it be settled and allowed; but the defendant, Glenn, appeared by his attorney and objected to the settlement and allowance, upon the sole ground that the notice of intention to move for a new trial was not served in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The motion was submitted upon the above-mentioned notices, and the court, after hearing the arguments of counsel, \u201c found that the said statement of the case and bill of exceptions was in all respects true and correct, but that the notice of intention to move for a new trial was not served in time, and thereupon, and for that reason, denied the motion of said defendants to said cross-complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">From the order thus entered, this appeal is prosecuted by all of the defendants to the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The.code provides that the party intending to move for a new trial must, within ten days after qotice of the decision of the court, file with the clerk and serve upon the adverse party a notice of his intention. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 659.) It is, however, argued for the appellants \u2014 and this is the only point made \u2014 that the notice-of decision served here, when properly construed, was a notice to the plaintiff and <em>his </em>attorney alone, and that \" no notice of the rendition of the decision was ever given to the defendants in the cross-complaint.\u201d We do not think the notice can be thus limited, particularly in view of the acceptance of service which was indorsed upon it. In our opinion, it must be treated as a notice to and accepted by all of the losing parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The case does not fall within the rule declared in <em>Stonesifer </em>v. Kilburn, 94 Cal. 33. There it was held that the settlement of a bill of exceptions was a <em>\u201c </em>pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ceeding \u201d in an action, within the meaning of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the court had power to relieve against the objection that the bill was not served in time, when it appeared that the default in the service resulted solely from excusable mistake or neglect. Here no claim for relief, under the section of the code cited in that case, was made, and we fail to see how any such claim could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Searls, C., and Vanclief, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Paterson, J., Harrison, J., Garoutte, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
