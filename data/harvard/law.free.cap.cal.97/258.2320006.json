That section only provides that where, upon the settlement of a bill of exceptions or statement, the judge refuses to allow an exception, the party may petition this court to prove said exception. But in this case petitioners merely show that they presented quite a lengthy statement on motion for new trial to the judge of the superior court, and that he refused to sign it, or any other bill of exceptions. In such case, the judge can be compelled by <em>mandamus </em>to settle the bill or statement; but this court has not the power, nor is it its duty, to tgke the place of the judge of the lower court and perform the duty of settling the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
