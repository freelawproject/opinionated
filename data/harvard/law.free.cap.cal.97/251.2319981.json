E. P.

There is appropriated the sum of five thousand dollars out of any moneys in the general fund not otherwise appropriated, to be paid to the board of supervisors of San Diego County, to be by said board held in trust and paid out for the benefit of the sufferers from the Tia Juana floods, occurring on the twenty-second day of February, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, in San Diego County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The act is clearly in violation of the provisions of section 31, article IV., of the constitution, which provides that the legislature shall have no power \u201cto make any gift, or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual.\u201d The object of this provision is stated in <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Colgan, </em>91 Cal. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">An act directing the controller to draw his warrant in favor of an individual cannot be impeached by evidence <em>aliunde (Rankin </em>v. <em>Colgan, </em>92 Cal. 606); but here the facts which show the invalidity of the appropriation appear upon the face of the act, and the application ought to have been denied. <em>(Bourn </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>93 Cal. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The judgment is reversed, with directions to the court below to dismiss the proceeding and enter judgment in favor of defendant for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Garoutte, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
