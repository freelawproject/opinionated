It is, however, alleged in the complaint, as we construe it, that plaintiff did voluntarily submit his claim against defendant to the decision of the tribunals--of the order of which he became a member when he joined the defendant lodge, and that such tribunals \u201c adjudged and determined\u201d that he was not entitled to the payment of the benefits now claimed, or to any part thereof. The question therefore is, What effect, has this determination upon the right of plaintiff to maintain the action? It does not appear that plaintiff made, any express agreement to be bound by the determination of the tribunals referred to, but we think that when he voluntarily submitted to them for decision the differences which existed between himself and defendant-, there was an implied agreement upon his part to be bound by their judgment or award, in the absence of any fraud or mistake or other cause which in equity would entitle him to avoid the same. \u201cWhere a matter is submitted to arbitrators, it is not necessary that there should be any express agreement to abide by the award when made, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>law implies such an agreement from the very fact of submission.\u201d <em>(Valentine </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>2 Barb. Ch. 430.) It would seem, from the allegations of the complaint, that 4he tribunals whose jurisdiction plaintiff invoked are established for the purpose of settling all matters of difference which may arise between a subordinate lodge and any of its members, growing out of a refusal upon \u25a0the part of the lodge to pay benefits claimed, if the member consents to submit such matter to them for settlement; and it seems clear to us that plaintiff\u2019s voluntary submission of his claim for benefits to their decision was in the nature of a submission to arbitration, and their decision in the nature of an award, and should be considered equally conclusive. It is not alleged that there was any misconduct upon the part of those to whom he submitted the justice of his claims, or that there was any .fraud or mistake in the award itself, or that for any reason the matters in difference between .himself and defendant were not fully and fairly tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Sharpstein, J., and McFarland, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
