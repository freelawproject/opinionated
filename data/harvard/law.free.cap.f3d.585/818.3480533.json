Because the BIA did not explain why Nken\u2019s new evidence failed to demonstrate a change of country conditions, we grant the petition and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In 2001, Nken applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, alleging that he had suffered persecution in his home country of Cameroon and feared further persecution should he return. An immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) held a hearing on Nken\u2019s application, at which Nken testified. Highlighting inconsistencies in Nken\u2019s testimony, the IJ denied relief and ordered him deported to Cameroon. Nken appealed to the BIA, which remanded the case, noting that although the IJ apparently had relied on credibility judgments to justify her order, she had not made a specific adverse credibility finding. On remand in 2005, the IJ made such a finding, which, over a year later, the BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Over the next two years, Nken filed two unsuccessful motions to reopen his removal proceedings. On May 7, 2008, Nken filed a third motion to reopen based on changed country conditions in Cameroon.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> With his motion, Nken presented, for the first time (1) a handwritten letter, dated March 18, 2008, from his brother in Cameroon, describing the danger Nken would face if he returned there; (2) photographs of Nken at a political demonstration outside the Cameroon Embassy in Washington; and (3) news articles about increased authoritarianism in Cameroon.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">The handwritten letter from Nken\u2019s brother, translated from French, includes the following statements in support of Nken\u2019s claim of changed country conditions in Cameroon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-12\">We wish you were here, but the recent events that have hit our country and the repressions which followed, pushed me to ask you not to come back home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-13\">Even myself I was arrested and I was brought to the lake, where the gendarmes were listing all the students from the 1990s and those who were members of the demonstrations. I wouldn\u2019t be released if my name was on those lists. This is why I <em>am begging you not to come back to the country, because it is really dangerous for you being one of those with problems from the past.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-14\">[Militants like you and those who know a lot about the political problems from the past are the ones getting attention. Therefore, <em>there is no question that if you are coming in the country with any pretext your life will be in a real danger.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">The BIA denied Nken\u2019s motion to reopen. In its short order, the BIA noted the existence of the photos, the news articles, and the letter from Nken\u2019s brother, and then offered three paragraphs of anal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ysis of this evidence. In two of those paragraphs, the BIA dismissed the photographs as immaterial and the news articles as unrelated to Nken\u2019s claim. The third paragraph reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">On review, we find that the respondent has not presented sufficient facts or evidence to establish that his motion falls within the \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d exception to the time limitation for motions to reopen set forth at section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. Notably, the respondent has failed to submit his own statement or asylum application articulating his persecution claim based on recent reports of civil unrest in Cameroon. The respondent\u2019s failure to set forth his asylum claim based on recent events in Cameroon is significant in this case where the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination remains undisturbed. Also, it is well established that tragic and widespread savage violence resulting from civil war or military strife is not persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">(citation omitted). The BIA then concluded, stating that \u201c[t]he respondent\u2019s motion for reopening based on changed country conditions is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Nken petitioned for review in this court and moved for a stay of removal pending the outcome of his appeal. Following circuit precedent, <em>Teshome-Gebreegziabher v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 330 (4th Cir.2008), we denied Nken\u2019s motion for a stay in an unpublished order. Nken then applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of removal pending resolution of his petition for review, and asked, alternatively, that the Court grant certiorari to resolve a circuit split as to the appropriate standard governing such stays. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated our order, agreeing with Nken that the correct standard for obtaining a stay of removal is the \u201ctraditional\u201d four-factor test that balances the applicant\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits, the injury to the applicant if the stay is denied, the injury to the government if the stay is granted, and the public interest. <em>Nken v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 1760-62, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009). The Supreme Court remanded the case to us \u201cfor application of the traditional criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1754.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">At oral argument before us, the Government represented that it would not remove Nken from the country before the resolution of this appeal, including the entry of our mandate. This representation, Nken agrees, renders moot the question of whether the \u201ctraditional criteria\u201d entitle Nken to a stay. Accordingly, the only issue remaining is whether we should grant Nken\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Courts review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, and grant a petition for review only if the BIA decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. <em>Massis v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 631, 636 (4th Cir.2008). We give such BIA decisions \u201cextreme deference.\u201d <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006). Even so, as we recently explained, the BIA \u201cabuses its discretion when it fails to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision, distorts or disregards important aspects of the alien\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Hussain v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 153, 155 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">In <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), the Supreme Court established that \u201cthe process of review requires that the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained.\u201d The Court thus held that \u201can administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted ... were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 63 S.Ct. 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">In recent years, the Supreme Court has specifically applied the <em>Chenery </em>rule to petitions seeking review of BIA orders. Thus the Court has explained that when a BIA order does not demonstrate that the agency has considered an issue, \u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is so because a \u201c \u2018judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chenery, </em>318 U.S. at 88, 63 S.Ct. 454); <em>see also Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186-87, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (holding that remand to the BIA is the appropriate remedy). As we recently explained in following <em>Chenery </em>to remand a similar case to the BIA for further proceedings, \u201cwe cannot review the BIA\u2019s decision [when] the BIA has given us nothing to review.\u201d <em>Li Fang Lin v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 685, 693-94 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In denying Nken\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA held that Nken had \u201cnot presented sufficient facts or evidence to establish that his motion falls within the \u2018changed country conditions\u2019 exception.\u201d Although the BIA acknowledged receipt of the new letter from Nken\u2019s brother, it offered no explanation as to why that letter \u2014 Nken\u2019s strongest new evidence \u2014 provided insufficient justification for reopening the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The Government maintains that, given the IJ\u2019s previous adverse credibility determination, the BIA\u2019s acknowledgement of Nken\u2019s brother\u2019s letter provides a sufficient basis for us to affirm. That argument fails because although the BIA did mention the IJ\u2019s <em>2005 </em>adverse credibility determination as <em>to Nken, </em>it did not tie that determination to the <em>2008 </em>letter <em>from his brother. </em>Specifically, the BIA did not explain how the prior adverse credibility determination with respect to Nken himself rendered the recent letter from Nken\u2019s brother unbelievable. Nor did the BIA explain why its adverse credibility determination as to Nken means that the facts set forth in his brother\u2019s letter do not justify reopening the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Of course, it is possible, as the Government argues, that the BIA thought the letter from Nken\u2019s brother unworthy of belief. But it is also possible, as Nken maintains, that the BIA arbitrarily refused to give the contents of that letter any weight, or that the BIA found the letter credible but misread it as including only general statements about unrest, and not particular threats to Nken. From the text of the BIA order, we simply do not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">In such circumstances, a reviewing court must remand to the administrative agency. Established precedent dictates that a court may not guess at what an agency meant to say, but must instead restrict itself to what the agency actually did say. The Supreme Court established this rule in <em>Chenery, </em>and specifically applied it to BIA orders in <em>Ventura </em>and <em>Thomas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">As we did in <em>Lin, </em>517 F.3d at 693, our sister circuits have consistently followed this guidance and applied the <em>Chenery </em>rule in BIA cases similar to that at hand. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number><em>e.g., Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an applicant moves to reopen his case based on worsened country conditions, and introduces previously unavailable reports that materially support his original application, the BIA has a duty to consider these reports and issue a reasoned decision based thereon, whether or not these reports are clearly determinative.\u201d (emphasis omitted)); <em>Vente v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 296, 302 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen deficiencies in the BIA\u2019s decision make it impossible for us to meaningfully review its decision, we must vacate that decision and remand so that the BIA can further explain its reasoning.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe think it goes without saying that IJs and the BIA are not free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner.\u201d); <em>Mengistu v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1044, 1047 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]s we tirelessly repeat, an agency opinion that fails to build a rational bridge between the record and the agency\u2019s legal conclusion cannot survive judicial review.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Accordingly, because it is not apparent from the BIA order that it considered the crux of Nken\u2019s argument, we grant Nken\u2019s petition for review and remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\"> Generally, applicants can file only one motion to reopen, and must file that motion within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) (2006). However, the statute offers an exception for motions, like Nken\u2019s third motion, which allege conditions in the applicant's country have changed. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
