(mother) appeals the juvenile court\u2019s order terminat-</p>\n<p id=\"A9G\">ing her parental rights to Y.R., age eight, and Daniel R., age five. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26; all further unlabeled statutory citations are to this code.) Mother contends the juvenile court erred in concluding the children were likely to be adopted and she asserts the court should have sua sponte evaluated a maternal aunt in Arizona for placement. We conclude substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s adoptability finding and the court had no independent duty to evaluate the maternal aunt for placement after the aunt ceased contact with Orange County Social Services Agency (SSA). We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) in Los Angeles removed Y. and Daniel at ages five and three, respectively, from mother\u2019s Long Beach apartment in September 2004 after reports of domestic violence between mother and the children\u2019s stepgrandmother. DCFS\u2019s earlier intervention efforts had failed, and mother\u2019s methamphetamine abuse remained unresolved. The Los Angeles County Superior Court sustained jurisdiction over both children (\u00a7 300, subd. (b)), and transferred the case to the Orange County Superior Court (\u00a7 375) because mother had moved to Buena Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Mother made little progress on her case plan by the six-month review hearing in March 2005. She missed her scheduled drug tests, failed to participate in counseling, and skipped half of her parenting classes. Vicente R. (father) remained incarcerated in Oklahoma, with an expected release date in May 2005. A maternal aunt in Arizona, Susan C., expressed interest in the children provided she would receive financial assistance and mother would not live with them. SS\u00c1 initiated a referral under the Interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Compact for Placement of Children (ICPC) with the Arizona social services agency to evaluate Susan\u2019s suitability to care for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Meanwhile, Y.\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s annual physicals showed them to be healthy and \u201con target\u201d developmentally and cognitively. SSA had moved the children to a new foster placement, where Y.\u2019s behavior improved. She had masturbated in public for a month, used profanity, and acted aggressively towards Daniel and her peers in her prior placement, but these tendencies dissipated in the new home, where she and Daniel adjusted well and were affectionate with their caretakers. Y.\u2019s kindergarten teacher described her as a \u201cnice girl,\u201d but expressed concern she performed \u201csignificantly below grade-level.\u201d SSA subsequently authorized a tutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Father reentered the children\u2019s lives upon his release from jail. Although the social worker commended his love for the children, he proved to be a destabilizing influence. He tested positive for illicit substances several times, admitted a history of drug dealing, and suffered a drug overdose during the reunification period. Y, who had seen father arrested previously, feared the park police would throw him to the ground on their outdoor visits. Father insisted on bringing his girlfriend to visits, though she faced incarceration for a probation violation and the children reacted poorly to her. The juvenile court had ordered that the children have no contact with the maternal stepgrandmother due to her violent outbursts, but father created scenes in front of the monitor and the children by arranging for the grandparents to show up at visits. He also violated a court order by discussing the court proceedings with Y, bringing her to tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Mother fared no better in her reunification efforts. She bit Daniel on the arm to discipline him for biting Y; mother\u2019s bite resulted in a red and purple bruise three to four inches in diameter. After SSA sought to impose a monitor on mother\u2019s visits, she ceased visiting for months at a time. Y. and Daniel were bewildered and hurt by her absence. Mother continually called father on his cell phone during <em>his </em>visits, heightening the children\u2019s anxiety. Mother and father fought verbally and exchanged epithets on a three-way telephone call with Y. on her birthday, driving her to tears. The child blamed herself for the conflicts between the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Y. and Daniel responded by acting out in their placement. Their foster caretaker described \u201cdifficult behaviors such as tantrums (i.e.[,] kicking, yelling, stomping feet and slamming doors) when they are angry or do not get their way.\u201d The caregiver observed that \u201cthe children are quick to apologize and say they love[d her],\u201d but she had a house full of other foster children and requested a new placement for Y. and Daniel. The caregiver noted Y. would walk in on older girls while they were showering and attempt to touch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>their breasts. The social worker referred Y. to counseling, where she expressed feelings of anger and abandonment toward her parents, stating \u201cthey are liars\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t care.\u201d SSA placed Y. and Daniel in an interim sibling assessment facility for three months, where they adjusted and improved their behavior gradually. They continued to miss mother, who never visited. SSA moved the children to a new placement in December 2005 when a foster home that could accommodate siblings became available, and no further incidents of misbehavior were reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Just before the children commenced this latest, ultimately final, foster placement, the juvenile court conducted the 12-month review hearing. In the previous six months, mother had borne a child by her 16-year-old consort, admitted drug use while pregnant, misled the social worker about her housing, skipped scheduled drug tests, and failed to visit Y. and Daniel. Father proved unable to extricate himself from his dependence on drugs, nor could he provide a stable residence for the children. The juvenile court terminated reunification services for the parents and set a permanent plan selection and implementation hearing (.26 hearing) for March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In the interim, the social worker reviewed SSA\u2019s attempts to place Y. and Daniel with their maternal aunt Susan. Arizona social services had approved Susan for placement in August 2005, but mother and father objected to out-of-state placement. When reunification prospects dimmed, the court postponed the 12-month review hearing so SSA again could explore placement with the aunt by having the Arizona authorities conduct a home study on Susan\u2019s new apartment. Then, in November 2005, Susan informed SSA <em>she </em>was moving to California to reside with her former in-laws due to difficulties parenting her \u201cout of control\u201d adolescent daughter, and she could not take responsibility for Y. and Daniel. But at mother\u2019s urging, SSA recontacted Susan, who claimed she had \u201cexaggerated\u201d her daughter\u2019s difficulties and the pair would remain in Arizona. Upon learning Susan planned a trip to California over the Christmas holiday, the social worker offered to make arrangements for a visit with Y. and Daniel. The worker also requested Susan contact SSA if she wanted the children placed with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Susan never contacted the worker about a Christmas visit or placement of the children. Mother informed the worker that she no longer had contact with Susan. The ICPC referral for placement of the children in Arizona expired in February 2006, but the social worker remained open to initiating a new referral if Susan expressed interest in the children and her stability improved. On the eve of the .26 hearing scheduled for March 2006, mother stipulated that SSA had undertaken \u201creasonable efforts ... to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child[ren].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The permanency planning assessment SSA prepared for the March hearing described Y. as an attractive, affectionate, and talkative seven-year-old girl who shared a close relationship with her brother Daniel. Her doctor reported she was overweight but otherwise in good health. Y. faced \u201cdefinite academic deficits.\u201d Enrolled in second grade, she performed at kindergarten level but school district bylaws prohibited holding her back consecutive years. Y. underwent psychological testing to determine if she qualified for' special education services. Daniel, an affectionate and intelligent four year old, awaited an opening in a Head Start program.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">At the .26 hearing held on March 22, 2006, the juvenile court delayed selecting and implementing a permanent plan for Y. and Daniel. Proceeding under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3), the court concluded termination of parental rights would not be detrimental for the children, but found only \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption because Y. and Daniel were \u201cdifficult to place for adoption\u201d within the meaning of the statute and no prospective adoptive parent had been identified. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(3).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the juvenile court entered an order continuing the matter for 180 days for SSA \u201cto locate an appropriate adoptive family for the minor[s].\u201d The order included the court\u2019s finding that SSA had provided reasonable services to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Within a month, Donald and Brenda M. approached SSA about adopting two children. The couple had been married 10 years and wanted to start a family together. SSA placed Y. and Daniel with the M.\u2019s in June 2006. After the new parents struggled initially with unspecified \u201cbehavioral problems\u201d involving Y, they redoubled their efforts and soon concluded they could \u201cnot imagine not having the children in [their] home.\u201d They recognized the challenges parenting posed, and in particular that Y.\u2019s problems might resurface, but they were committed to adopting both Y. and Daniel. Over the next several months, the family bonds melded, the children referred to the prospective adoptive parents as \u201cmom\u201d and \u201cdad,\u201d and Donald and Brenda reciprocated the children\u2019s desire to stay with them \u201cforever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">A social worker prepared a new permanency planning assessment for the rescheduled .26 hearing, now set for October 2006. The worker described Y, who had just turned eight years old, as an affectionate, talkative, pretty child with big brown eyes and long hair. The worker observed: \u201cY. ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>cooperative, is very clean and neat, and likes to assist with simple household chores. She is able to play appropriately and cooperatively with children her own age and likes Barbie dolls, Brat dolls, swimming and riding her bicycle. The child is healthy and there are no medical concerns.\u201d The worker noted the structure and routine in Donald and Brenda\u2019s home \u201chelped to settle the child\u2019s past acting out behaviors,\u201d and the extra time the prospective adoptive parents spent with Y. was \u201cpaying off in relation to the child\u2019s schoolwork.\u201d Y. continued to experience \u201cacademic deficits\u201d but was \u201cdoing much better\u201d and Brenda worked closely with Y.\u2019s teachers to ensure her progress. Y. had already received a \u201cStudent of the Day\u201d award twice by October and, unlike her past placements, she made friends in class and in the neighborhood. The social worker presented a similarly positive assessment for five-year-old Daniel, a \u201cvery healthy,\u201d intelligent, well-behaved kindergartener.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The juvenile court held the .26 hearing on October 6, 2006. Father did not appear. The court admitted SSA\u2019s reports for the previous review period, and mother declined to cross-examine the social worker. Mother also stipulated that Donald and Brenda would testify they were \u201cfully committed to adopting the children, . . . desire to complete the adoption and . . . love the children and want them to remain with them forever as their own.\u201d The court also admitted several exhibits introduced by mother, including Y.\u2019s individualized education plan prepared by her teacher and an early e-mail Brenda sent SSA concerning difficulties with Y.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Mother contested Y.\u2019s adoptability based on the child\u2019s past behavioral problems. Mother also noted the prospective adoptive parents\u2019 initial hesitation might recur, in which case mother contended adoption was unlikely for Y, and similarly unlikely for Daniel as part of a sibling set. The juvenile court disagreed, concluded the children were likely to be adopted, and terminated parental rights. Mother now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">A. <em>Mother May Challenge the Juvenile Court\u2019s Adoptability Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">At the hearing on March 22, 2006, the juvenile court found the statutory conditions necessary for continuing the .26 hearing existed, namely that (1) terminating parental rights \u201cwould not be detrimental to the child[ren]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and (2) the children had \u201ca probability for adoption\u201d but were \u201cdifficult to place for adoption\u201d and there was \u201cno identified or available prospective adoptive parent . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(3).) Mother did not oppose the continuance; indeed, it afforded her more time to attempt to reunify with Y. and Daniel. Consequently, she did not appeal the court\u2019s order continuing the hearing for 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The county contends mother\u2019s failure to appeal the March 2006 order forecloses her present appeal from the .26 hearing held in October 2006. The county relies on the rule that because postdispositional dependency orders are generally appealable, a party in dependency proceedings may not challenge prior orders where the 60-day time limit for filing an appeal has passed. <em>(In re Cassandra B. </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 199, 208-209 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 686]; see also <em>In re Meranda P. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1143, 1150-1151 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 913] [applying waiver rule to prevent collateral attack on unappealed earlier orders].) The unstated premise of the county\u2019s position is that the juvenile court determined back at the March 2006 hearing that Y. and Daniel were likely to be adopted, precluding a belated attack on that issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The county\u2019s premise is faulty. Simply put, a finding that there exists, under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3), \u201ca probability\u201d a child may be adopted is not the same as finding, under subdivision (c)(1), that it is \u201clikely\u201d adoption will occur. As we explained in <em>In re Jacob S. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1011 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 654] <em>(Jacob S.), </em>by continuing the .26 hearing under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3), the juvenile court in that case <em>\u201cdid not find that [the child] is likely to be adopted, </em>but only determined that adoption was [a] probability] and that [the child] is difficult to place because of his disability.\u201d <em>(Jacob S., </em>at p. 1019, italics added.) The same is true here: in concluding at the March 2006 hearing that there was \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption and continuing the matter 180 days, the juvenile court did not thereby conclude the children were \u201clikely\u201d to be adopted. Plainly, the juvenile court\u2019s identification of <em>obstacles </em>to adoption at the March hearing does not amount to a conclusion the children were likely to be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">True, the distinction between \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption and the conclusion adoption is \u201clikely\u201d is subtle, but the ordinary meaning of these words differs, and the Legislature\u2019s use of different words in portions of section 366.26 that have different consequences persuades us the distinction is real.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Our Supreme Court has observed that the ordinary meaning of \u201clikely\u201d is \u201c ' \u201cmore probable than not\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Ghilotti) </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 918 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 44 P.3d 949].) In contrast, \u201ca probability\u201d generally does <em>not </em>mean \u201c \u2018more likely than not, but merely a <em>reasonable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>chance, </em>more than an <em>abstract </em>possibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cassim </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 800 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 374, 94 P.3d 513], original italics; see <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) Of course, in loose parlance, \u201ca probability\u201d an event will take place may be understood to mean the event is \u201cprobable,\u201d and a synonym for \u201cprobable\u201d is \u201clikely.\u201d But the different outcomes prescribed in section 366.26, depending on whether adoption is \u201clikely\u201d or only \u201ca probability,\u201d counsels against interpreting these terms synonymously.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We review issues of statutory construction de novo. <em>(Amdahl Corp. v. County of Santa Clara </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 604, 611 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 486].) \u201cPursuant to established principles, our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided. The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.] Where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1), when the juvenile court concludes the child is \u201clikely\u201d to be adopted the court <em>must </em>terminate parental rights so the child can be placed for adoption and \u201cget on with the task of growing up . . . .\u201d <em>{In re Lukas B. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1156 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 693] <em>{Lukas B.); </em>see \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1) [\u201cIf ... it is likely the child will be adopted, the court <em>shall </em>terminate parental rights and order the child placed for adoption\u201d (italics added)].) In contrast, under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3), the court may continue the matter 180 days if there are obstacles making the child \u201cdifficult to place for adoption\u201d and therefore there exists only \u201ca probability\u201d the child will be adopted. If the Legislature intended \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption to mean the same as \u201clikely\u201d to be adopted, the mandatory \u201cshall terminate\u201d language in subdivision (c)(1) would compel the court to terminate parental rights upon making the \u201cprobability\u201d finding, thereby rendering subdivision (c)(3) and its 180-day provision empty legislation that could never be invoked. We decline to adopt an interpretation that nullifies the option of a 180-day continuance expressly provided for by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Moreover, we note the distinction the Legislature has made between adoption as \u201clikely\u201d versus \u201ca probability\u201d serves the best interests of dependent children. The low standard of \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption, which warrants a 180-day continuance, offers children who are \u201cdifficult to place\u201d the opportunity to attain the permanency, stability, and other benefits of adoption, which is the Legislature\u2019s preferred permanent plan. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (b).) Although difficult to place initially, the child\u2019s odds for adoption may improve to \u201clikely\u201d by the end of the 180-period, especially if \u201can adoptive family has been found . . . .\u201d <em>{Jacob S., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Unfortunately, it may also happen that no prospective adoptive parent steps forward. Or, in the face of the factors that make the child difficult to place for adoption, or for innumerable other reasons unique to each family and child, a prospective adoptive parent who has shown interest in the child may have a change of heart. In these circumstances, it would make little sense to render the child a legal orphan by terminating parental rights. This undesirable result, however, would follow if the court\u2019s earlier finding of \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption were tantamount to finding it \u201clikely\u201d the child would be adopted, since section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1) <em>requires </em>termination of parental rights where adoption is likely. In light of the Legislature\u2019s use of different terms in subdivision (c)(1) and (3) of section 366.26, the different outcomes provided for in those provisions and the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child utilized throughout the dependency statutes, we conclude the Legislature did not intend \u201ca probability for adoption\u201d to be synonymous with a finding the child is \u201clikely\u201d to be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The doctrine of issue preclusion prevents relitigation of issues already argued and decided. <em>{Rodgers v. Sargent Controls &amp; Aerospace </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 82, 89 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 528].) Among other requirements, the doctrine only applies where the identical issue was decided previously, and the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a \u201c \u2018 \u201cfull and fair\u201d \u2019 \u201d opportunity to litigate the issue. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 90; see <em>Roos v. Red </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 870, 880 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 446].) Because the issue considered at the March 2006 hearing of whether the children had \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption is different from the juvenile court\u2019s determination in October 2006 they were \u201clikely\u201d to be adopted, there is no reason to preclude mother from raising the latter issue because she did not appeal earlier. This is mother\u2019s first opportunity to challenge the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion the children were likely to be adopted. We therefore conclude she did not waive the issue by failing to appeal from the March 2006 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Our conclusion the dependency waiver rule does not apply here is consistent with <em>Jacob S., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1011, <em>In re Cody C. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1297 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 928] <em>(Cody C.), </em>and developments since those cases. In <em>Jacob S. </em>and <em>Cody C., </em>we determined each parent prematurely appealed from the respective juvenile court orders continuing the .26 hearing 180 days. We reasoned that neither parent\u2019s attack had ripened to a justiciable issue because neither raised claims showing she was aggrieved by the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Two later decisions by other courts suggest that subsequent statutory changes undercut the rationale of <em>Jacob S. </em>and <em>Cody C. </em>(See <em>In re Ramone R. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1339, 1349-1351 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 344] <em>{Ramone R.); In re Gabriel G. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1438 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 847] <em>(Gabriel </em>G.).) These decisions hold that a parent must appeal a juvenile court\u2019s order finding only \u201ca probability\u201d of adoption to preserve the option of long-term foster care for the child. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>Ramone R. </em>and <em>Gabriel G. </em>interpreted changes to section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3), as removing the option of long-term foster care as a placement option <em>if and only if </em>the juvenile court continues the .26 hearing 180 days. We find this interpretation puzzling for it is plain in section 366.3 that long-term foster care remains the de facto placement for children who are not freed for adoption or placed with a guardian. (See \u00a7 366.3, subds. (d) &amp; (g).) For these children, SSA and the juvenile court must continue efforts to obtain more permanent placement in the form of adoption or a guardianship. <em>{Ibid.) </em>But that does not mean the children cannot remain in foster care in the interim, or that placement there for months or years is any less \u201clong term.\u201d In any event, whether a 180-day continuance order under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3), is not appealable for lack of injury to the parent\u2019s interests <em>{Jacob S.; Cody C.) </em>or is reviewable as an integral part of a juvenile court order that may affect the child\u2019s interests <em>{Ramone R.; Gabriel </em>G.), the juvenile court\u2019s adoption \u201cprobability\u201d finding has no preclusive effect on the subsequent issue of whether the child is \u201clikely\u201d to be adopted. That is the extent of our holding in the present case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Having rejected the county\u2019s waiver argument, we turn to the merits of mother\u2019s claim that no substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion in its October 2006 order that Y. and Daniel were likely to be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">B. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Juvenile Court\u2019s Adoptability Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Mother challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion Y. and Daniel were likely to be adopted. \u201cTo terminate parental rights and order adoption, the trial court must find by clear and convincing evidence \u2018it is likely the child will be adopted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jeremy S. </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 514, 523 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 280] <em>(Jeremy S.), </em>disapproved on another ground in <em>In re Zeth S. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 396, 413-414 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 73 P.3d 541].) The juvenile court\u2019s inquiry at the .26 hearing focuses on whether the child\u2019s age, physical condition, or emotional state make it unlikely anyone will adopt the child within a reasonable time. <em>(In re Carl R. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1061 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 612].) \u201c[T]he fact that a prospective adoptive parent has expressed interest in adopting the minor is evidence that the minor\u2019s age, physical condition, mental state, and other matters relating to the child are not likely to dissuade individuals from adopting the minor. In other words, a prospective adoptive, parent\u2019s willingness to adopt generally indicates the minor is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time either by the prospective adoptive parent <em>or by some other family.\u201d (In re Sarah M. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1642, 1649-1650 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 82] <em>(Sarah M.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We review the juvenile court\u2019s adoptability determination for substantial evidence. <em>(In re Gregory A. </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1561-1562 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 134].) Our circumscribed role on appeal and limited vantage point require that we draw all inferences and resolve any evidentiary conflicts in fayor of the juvenile court\u2019s order. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Mother concedes her challenge to Daniel\u2019s adoptability stems only from his membership in a sibling set with Y. Mother\u2019s challenge based on Y.\u2019s past behavioral problems fails to account for Y.\u2019s marked and sustained improvement. The record discloses Y. exhibited no behavioral problems after she moved from SSA\u2019s sibling assessment facility to her second foster home in December 2005, save the understandable adjustment accompanying the children\u2019s transition to their prospective adoptive home. (See <em>Jeremy S., supra, </em>89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 524 [behavioral improvement supports adoptability finding].) Notably, moreover, Y.\u2019s earlier problems generally occurred when father or mother or other destabilizing factors intruded into her life, and mother should not reap any benefit from her disruptive influence. (Ibid.; <em>Lukas B., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 1154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion Y. was adoptable. By the October .26 hearing, she had largely put her behavioral problems behind her, and she improved dramatically at school. No evidence showed her lingering academic deficits resulted from a diagnosed mental handicap that would make her difficult to place for adoption. (See \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(3). In addition to her behavioral and academic gains, Y. proved to be, according to the social worker\u2019s uncontested account, an open, playful, and attractive child who played appropriately and cooperatively with other children and also enjoyed the attention of adults\u2014all attributes of an adoptable child. (See <em>Sarah M., supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 1651.) Additionally, Donald and Brenda\u2019s reaffirmed commitment to adopting Y. and Daniel constitutes substantial evidence they would likely adopt the children. Their example demonstrated any challenges the children presented were not likely to dissuade others from adopting them. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1649-1650.) Consequently, mother\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s adoptability finding is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Mother contends that in reaching its conclusion the children were likely to be adopted, the juvenile court was unduly swayed by its earlier \u201cprobability\u201d of adoption finding at the March 2006 hearing. Mother concedes, however, the court entered the requisite findings at the October hearing that the children were likely to be adopted, and our review of juvenile court proceedings, like any trial matter, extends to results, not reasons. (See <em>People v. Gibson </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 841, 853 [241 Cal.Rptr. 126]; see generally 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 340, p. 382.) As discussed, substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion Y. and Daniel were likely to be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">C. <em>Evaluation of Placement with Maternal Aun</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The juvenile court\u2019s order terminating parental rights is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">O\u2019Leary, Acting P.
