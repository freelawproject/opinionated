J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADa\">Cesar Velasquez appeals from the judgment entered after a jury convicted him of 10 offenses ranging from petty theft to attempted murder that was willful, deliberate and premeditated. In our original nonpublished opinion, filed February 16, 2005, we affirmed Velasquez\u2019s convictions on all counts but reversed the sentence imposed on count 3 for assault with a firearm and the enhancement related to that count and remanded for resentencing consistent with our understanding of the constitutional requirements for trial by jury articulated in <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531] <em>{Blakely). </em>We also directed the trial court on remand to strike the firearm enhancements under Penal Code section 12021.5, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed on counts 5, 10 and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">On June 8, 2005 the California Supreme Court granted the People\u2019s petition for review (SI32402, petn. for review filed Mar. 21, 2005) and deferred further action in the matter pending consideration and disposition of a related issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Black </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1238 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d 534] <em>{Black) </em>and <em>People v. Towne, </em>review granted July 14, 2004, S125677. On September 7, 2005 the Supreme Court transferred the' matter to this court pursuant to California Rules of Court, former rule 29.3(d) (now rule 8.528(d)) with directions to vacate our prior decision and to reconsider the cause in light of <em>Black. </em>Accordingly, on October 18, 2005, we filed a new opinion in which we modified Velasquez\u2019s sentence by striking the firearm enhancements under section 12021.5, subdivision (a), imposed on counts 5, 10 and 12 and, as modified, affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">On February 20, 2007 the United States Supreme Court, after granting Velasquez\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment and remanded the matter to us for further consideration in light of <em>Cunningham v. California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856] <em>{Cunningham). </em>We requested and received supplemental briefing from the parties on the effect, if any, of <em>Cunningham </em>on Velasquez\u2019s sentence. Although for reasons somewhat different from those contained in our October 18, 2005 opinion, we again conclude that imposition of the upper term sentence on count 3 for assault with a firearm and the enhancement related to that count did not violate Velasquez\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Accordingly, we modify Velasquez\u2019s sentence by striking the firearm enhancements under section 12021.5, subdivision (a), imposed on counts 5, 10 and 12 and, as modified, affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">1. <em>The Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Velasquez was charged with multiple crimes arising from his participation in four separate incidents: (1) two counts of attempted second degree robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 664) (counts 1 and 2); (2) two counts of assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) (counts 3 and 4); (3) two counts of possession of a short-barreled shotgun (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)) (counts 5 and 6); (4) three counts of possession of a firearm by a felon (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)) (counts 7, 8 and 12); (5) attempted murder that was willful, deliberate and premeditated (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664, subd. (a)) (count 9); (6) second degree robbery (\u00a7 211) (count 10); and (7) petty theft (\u00a7 484, subd. (a)) (count 11). The information specially alleged firearm enhancements as to counts 1, 2, 3 and 9 and in addition a great-bodily-injury enhancement as to count 9. As to all counts except the petty theft charge in count 11, the information specially alleged the offenses were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of and in association with a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). As to counts 7, 8 and 12 the information specially alleged Velasquez carried a firearm on his person during the commission of a street gang crime (\u00a7 12021.5, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">2. <em>Summary of the Evidence at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">a. <em>Petty theft (count 11)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">On or about August 20, 2002 Velasquez, a member of the 18th Street gang, and some of his fellow gang members were at Thudo Billiards on West Sixth Street in Los Angeles, territory claimed by the 18th Street gang. Velasquez was caught on videotape taking something from the cash register drawer at the pool hall while the manager, Chuc Tran, was distracted by one of Velasquez\u2019s associates. Tran discovered between $60 and $70 missing from the drawer. Tran identified Velasquez from a photographic lineup as the person who had removed something from the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">b. <em>Robbery (count 10)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">A few weeks later, on or about September 13, 2002, Velasquez was shooting pool at Thudo Billiards when Tran requested he come to the counter and pay for his table time. In response Velasquez grabbed Tran by the shirt and punched him in the face. Velasquez then took money from the cash register and asked Tran where he kept additional money. After Tran showed Velasquez that he hid money in a refrigerator in the back of the pool hall, Velasquez took that money as well. Velasquez took a total of approximately $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>c. \u25a0 <em>Attempted murder (count 9); firearm possession by a felon (count 12)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Concerned about these episodes, Tran hired Hazeem Ismail to work as a security guard. Velasquez approached Ismail on his second day of work, September 29, 2002, and asked if Ismail was a police officer. Ismail responded, \u201cI am not a police officer. I am security for this area.\u201d Velasquez then said, \u201cI \u00e1m a gang member. Watch out.\u201d Later that evening Tran went to the table where Velasquez and his friends were shooting pool and asked them to pay for their beer and table time. Tran was ignored. Ismail then asked for payment, but Velasquez and his friends refused. Tran \u00e1nd Ismail then went to the table together to ask for payment. Velasquez told Tran to leave him alone and said he would pay later. Tran became angry, threw a pool cue and told Velasquez and his friends to either pay or leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Tran and Ismail then went back to the counter, and Ismail called his supervisor at the security company. One of Velasquez\u2019s friends asked Ismail if he was calling the police. Ismail responded, \u201cYes I am talking to my manager.\u201d Suddenly, Ismail saw Velasquez coming toward him and heard someone yell, \u201cShoot him. Shoot him.\u201d Velasquez shot Ismail several times from approximately nine feet away, wounding him in the stomach, thigh, arm and finger. The bullets lacerated Ismail\u2019s liver and a major vein in his intestine and shattered one of his kidneys. Ismail identified Velasquez in a photographic lineup as the person who had shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">d. <em>Attempted second degree robbery (counts 1 and 2); assault with a firearm (counts 3 and 4); possession of a short-barreled shotgun (counts 5 and 6); firearm possession by a felon (counts 7 and 8)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Several months later, on or about January 3, 2003, Velasquez and two other men entered Read\u2019s Liquor on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, also 18th Street gang territory. One of the men pointed a gun at Meeja Ahn, one of the store\u2019s owners. The man said, \u201cGive me the money,\u201d and motioned toward the cash register with the gun. In the meantime Velasquez went behind the counter with a shotgun and pointed it at Yho Ahn, Meeja Ahn\u2019s husband and co-owner of the store. Yho Ahn grabbed his own gun from under the counter and shot Velasquez, wounding him in the head. Velasquez and the two other men fled on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">When police arrived at the scene, they followed a trail of blood beginning behind the counter of the liquor store that led them to Velasquez, who was sitting on the curb in front of his apartment building less than a block away. Velasquez had suffered a gunshot wound to his head. The police arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>Velasquez and transported him to a hospital. Velasquez told a detective he had just been injured in a driveby, gang-related shooting while standing in front of his apartment building. Velasquez, however, immediately changed his story, telling the detective he had gone to Read\u2019s Liquor to buy beer and had been mistakenly shot by the owner when two other men wearing masks tried to rob the store. A shotgun was found in Velasquez\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The parties stipulated Velasquez had previously been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">e. <em>Expert testimony on gang activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">In addition to evidence of the substantive offenses, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Jonathan Pultz testified as an expert on the 18th Street gang. According to Officer Pultz, the primary activities of the 18th Street gang, one of the largest in the nation with more than 30,000 members, are robbery, murder, carjacking, burglary, extortion and narcotics sales. Gang members are identifiable by hand signs, symbols and tattoos. Within two years prior to the crimes charged against Velasquez, 18th Street gang members had been convicted of attempted robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Velasquez had 18th Street gang paraphernalia in his apartment when he was arrested and 18th Street gang tattoos on his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">Officer Pultz opined the offenses at Thudo Billiards on September 13, 2002 and September 29, 2002 and the crimes at Read\u2019s Liquor on January 3, 2003 were committed for the benefit of the 18th Street gang. The robbery of Tran on September 13, 2002 at the pool hall enhanced the reputation of the gang by sending a message that one should not \u201cmess with\u201d its members. The shooting of Ismail on September 29, 2002 demonstrated the gang, not law enforcement, was in control of its turf. The ruthless and violent manner in which the shooting occurred helped the gang rule its turf by intimidating people in the community who might try to turn to law enforcement for protection against the gang. Regarding the January 3, 2003 robbery at Read\u2019s Liquor, Pultz testified that robbery benefits the gang because the money obtained is frequently used to bail gang members out of jail or otherwise help them and that the display of the shotgun enhanced the gang\u2019s reputation for dangerousness and promoted its ability to intimidate. Moreover, having three gang members undertake the robbery benefited the gang by showing other members the importance of teamwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">f. <em>Defense theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">Velasquez did not present any evidence in his defense but argued the People had not proved the intent-to-kill element for the attempted murder of Ismail in count 9 and reasonable doubt existed as to whether it was indeed Velasquez who had committed the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1510\">*1510</page-number>3. <em>The Jury\u2019s Verdict and Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">The jury found Velasquez guilty on counts 1 and 2 for attempted second degree robbery, counts 3 and 4 for assault with a firearm, count 5 for possession of a short-barreled shotgun, counts 7 and 12 for possession of a firearm by a felon, count 9 for attempted murder that was willful, deliberate and premeditated, count 10 for second degree robbery and count 11 for petty theft. The jury found Velasquez not guilty on count 6 for possession of a short-barreled shotgun and on count 8 for possession of a firearm by a felon. The jury found true the special allegations regarding firearm use with respect to counts 1, 2, 3 and 9 and the special allegation that Velasquez had inflicted great bodily injury on the victim in committing the attempted murder in count 9. The jury also found true the special allegation that Velasquez had committed all offenses (except the petty theft charge in count 11) for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal street gang. The jury did not make findings on the firearm enhancement under section 12021.5, subdivision (a), alleged with respect to counts 7 and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">The trial court sentenced Velasquez to a principal term of 24 years on count 3 for assault with a firearm (the upper term of four years, plus the upper term of 10 years for the firearm enhancement under section 12022.5, subdivision (a), and 10 years for the criminal street gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)), plus a consecutive life term on count 9 for attempted murder, with a minimum parole eligibility date of 15 years under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d). The court imposed concurrent terms on all other counts; and the sentences on counts 1, 4 and 7 were stayed pursuant to section 654. The court struck all remaining special allegations pursuant to section 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Velasquez contends the trial court erred by denying his motion to bifurcate the trial of the substantive offenses from the trial of the criminal street gang enhancement because the introduction of evidence on the 18th Street gang prejudiced his case. He also contends the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the crimes for which he was convicted (except the petty theft offense) were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal street gang. With respect to sentencing, Velasquez asserts: (1) the imposition of upper terms on his sentence on count 3 for assault with a firearm and on the related firearm enhancement is improper because the trial court failed to state on the record its reasons for imposing upper terms and, additionally, violated his right to a jury trial under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Cunningham,-, </em>(2) his sentences on counts 5 and 12 should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>stayed under section 654; and (3) firearm enhancements under section 12021.5, subdivision (a), should not have been imposed on counts 5, 10 and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">1., 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">3. <em>No Reversible Sentencing Error Occurred in Imposing Upper Terms on the Conviction for Assault with a Firearm and the Related Firearm Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">a. <em>Velasquez forfeited his claim the upper terms are improper because the trial court failed to state on the record its reasons for imposing those terms</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Velasquez contends the imposition of upper terms on count 3 for assault with a firearm and the firearm enhancement related to that count is improper because the trial court failed to state on the record its reasons for imposing the upper terms. (See former \u00a7 1170, subd. (b); Stats. 2004, ch. 747, \u00a7 1 [\u201ccourt shall set forth on the record the facts and reasons for imposing the upper or lower term\u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He, however, made no objection when the trial court failed to state reasons for imposing the upper terms. The record is clear that Velasquez\u2019s counsel was well aware of the court\u2019s sentencing choices and had a meaningful opportunity to object. Indeed, counsel did object to the court\u2019s use of an aggravating factor in ordering the sentence on count 3 to run consecutively with the sentence for attempted murder on count 9. Thus, by failing to object, Velasquez has forfeited his claim the upper terms are improper because the trial court did not state its reasons for selecting those terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 353 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040] [\u201cwaiver doctrine should apply to claims involving the trial court\u2019s failure to properly make or articulate its discretionary sentencing choices\u201d]; <em>People v.

As discussed, in selecting the upper terms the trial court failed to articulate on the record its reasons for doing so; and Velasquez failed at that time to object. However, in deciding to impose the sentence on count 3 consecutively with the sentence on count 9 (attempted murder), the trial court stated on the record five aggravating circumstances: (1) the crimes involved great violence, great bodily injury or threat of great bodily injury (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(a)(1));<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) the victims were particularly vulnerable (rule 4.421(a)(3)); (3) Velasquez was armed with a firearm during the commission of some of the crimes (rule 4.421(a)(2));<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (4) Velasquez has engaged in a pattern of violent conduct, which presents a danger to society (rule 4.421(b)(1)); and (5) Velasquez had served a prior prison term (rule 4.421(b)(3)). The probation report provided to the court prior to sentencing identified some of the same aggravating factors mentioned by the trial court and also that Velasquez\u2019s prior convictions as an adult or adjudication of commission of crimes as a juvenile were numerous or of increasing seriousness (rule 4.421(b)(2)). In their sentencing memorandum the People identified additional factors they believed applicable to the case: (1) Velasquez induced others to participate in the commission of the crime or occupied a position of leadership or dominance of other participants in its commission (rule 4.421(a)(4)); and (2) the manner in which the crime was carried out indicates planning, sophistication or professionalism (rule 4.421(a)(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">As he did in his supplemental opening brief filed shortly after <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296, was decided in late June 2004, in his letter brief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>remand from the United States Supreme Court for reconsideration of this case in light of <em>Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. 270 [127 S.Ct. 856], Velasquez contends imposition of the upper term sentences for assault and the related firearm use enhancement based on factual determinations made by the court, not the jury, violated his right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">In <em>Cunningham </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466 [120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435] <em>{Apprendi), Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296, and <em>United States v.

[Aggravating circumstances depend on facts found discretely and solely by the judge. In accord with <em>Blakely, </em>therefore, the middle term prescribed in California\u2019s statutes, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum. <em>{Blakely, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number><em>supra,] </em>542 U.S., at 303 (\u2018The \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the </em>defendant.\u2019 (emphasis in original)). Because circumstances in aggravation are found by the judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt [citation], the DSL violates Apprendi\u2019s bright-line rule: Except for a prior conviction, \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._[127 S.Ct. at p. 868].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Although <em>Cunningham </em>invalidated a significant part of the DSL and generally precludes the trial judge from finding facts or circumstances in aggravation that expose a defendant to an elevated or upper term sentence, the Supreme Court also reaffirmed its prior holdings that the trial court may increase the penalty for a crime based upon the defendant\u2019s prior convictions without submitting that question to a jury. <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._[127 S.Ct. at p. 868]; see <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>(1998) 523 U.S. 224 [140 L.Ed.2d 350, 118 S.Ct. 1219]; <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. at p. 301; <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 488, 490.) Prior to the decision in <em>Cunningham </em>(and before the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Black, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th 1238), this prior conviction exception to <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>was construed broadly by California appellate courts to apply not only to the fact of the prior convictions but also to other issues relating to the defendant\u2019s recidivism, including the defendant\u2019s status as a probationer or parolee at the time the current offense was committed and the existence of \u201cnumerous\u201d or increasingly serious prior convictions. <em>{People v.

Here, however, despite the severity of the assault with a firearm, which also involved an attempted robbery of the liquor store during which Velasquez went behind the counter and pointed a shotgun at one of the store\u2019s owners, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt the jury would have made the findings necessary to support any of the remaining aggravating factors, although the evidence is certainly sufficient to sustain such findings if they had been made by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1254-6\"> The same fact cannot be used to impose an upper term on a base count and an upper term for an enhancement. <em>(People v.

Indeed, because the trial court failed to put its findings on the record, we have to speculate whether it would have made those findings and also whether it would have considered them worthy of mention to say nothing of determinative of its decision to impose the high term sentences on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">For purposes of this dissent, I accept the test the California Supreme Court announced in <em>People v. Avalos.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That is, in reviewing a sentence based on both proper and improper aggravating factors we \u201cmust . . . reverse where [we] cannot determine whether the improper factor was <em>determinative for the sentencing </em>court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>It is not what <em>could </em>have been determinative if the trial court had known some of the factors it used would turn out to have been improper. Rather, it is what the sentencing court <em>did </em>use that <em>\u201cwas </em>determinative\u201d in fixing the sentence the trial court actually meted out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Here we have only speculation to guide us in seeking to divine which factors the trial court used at all and which of those factors were determinative in raising the sentences on these counts to the upper term. From the majority opinion itself, we do know most of the available aggravating factors were ones only a jury not a judge could properly find true under <em>Cunningham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">The majority opinion cites a passage from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Osband</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to the effect \u201c[o]nly a single aggravating factor is required to impose the upper term.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But this <em>pr&amp;-Apprendi </em>case has little relevance to the case before this court. After upholding the death sentence Osband received for a rape-murder, the court turned to the determinate prison sentences the trial court imposed for other offenses occurring during the crime. Finding the trial court violated the \u201cdual use\u201d prohibition by using one of the aggravating factors to both make the sentences consecutive and to impose the high term on one of those offenses, the court had to decide whether the high term could be affirmed on the basis of other aggravating factors. \u201c \u2018Improper dual use of the same fact for imposition of both an upper term and a consecutive term or other enhancement does not necessitate resentencing if \u201c[i]t is <em>not reasonably probable </em>that a more favorable sentence would have been imposed in the absence of the error.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] .... In this case, the court could have selected disparate facts from among those it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>recited to justify the imposition of both a consecutive sentence and the upper term, and on this record we discern <em>no reasonable probability </em>that it would not have done so.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\"><em>Osband </em>and its statement saying a single aggravating factor will suffice is readily distinguishable. In that case, only <em>Watson </em>error was involved\u2014dual use of an aggravating factor in violation of a statutory prohibition. Thus, the reviewing court only remands for resentencing if it finds a \u201creasonable probability\u201d the trial court would <em>not </em>have imposed the. high term had the improper factor been unavailable. Furthermore, in <em>Osband </em>only one of several strong aggravating factors had been found improper. It was as if in the case before this court somehow only the trial court\u2019s finding of victim vulnerability had violated <em>Cunningham </em>and its predecessors, while any of the several other aggravating factors relating to violence, appellant\u2019s leadership position, and the planning, sophistication or professionalism of the crime had remained available to upgrade the sentences on these offenses. While it is true even a single legitimate aggravating factor <em>can </em>support an upper term, that is true only if the trial court indeed found that single legitimate factor sufficient by itself to impose the upper term sentence it did\u2014or definitely would have if it were the only aggravating factor in the case. The mere presence of a legitimate aggravating factor does not justify upholding an upper term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">In the case before this court, in contrast to <em>Osband, </em>the nonrecidivist factors the trial court, rather than the jury, found to be true were not just improper, but constitutionally improper. Consequently, the <em>Chapman </em>standard<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applies and we must remand for resentencing unless we can determine <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>the improper factor or factors were <em>not </em>determinative in the sense of tipping the scale toward the upper term. Here we have nothing but speculation about what the judge might have done to make that evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">The majority suggests the presence of <em>any </em>prior conviction in a defendant\u2019s past effectively negates Apprendi-Blakely-Cunningham. In this case, as long as the trial court had before it a prior conviction or some other recidivist factor which it <em>might </em>have used to elevate defendant\u2019s punishment defendant is to be considered \u201cexposed\u201d to that aggravated term and thus it does not violate <em>Cunningham </em>and its predecessors. Furthermore, because appellant was \u201cexposed\u201d to the high term by the mere presence of a prior in his record (even though that prior may not have been <em>determinative </em>in the trial court\u2019s imposition of the high term) the trial court was free to itself find and use other aggravating factors the jury otherwise would be required to find when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>the court was making the court\u2019s decision whether or not in fact to elevate the sentence from the midterm to the high term. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1514.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">According to this line of reasoning, a conviction or other recidivist factor a trial court did not consider serious enough by itself to warrant an upper term nonetheless trumps <em>Cunningham </em>and its predecessors. The mere presence of that prior conviction in a defendant\u2019s record permits a trial judge rather than the jury to find the factors the court deems the true reason for raising the sentence beyond that permitted by the findings the jury made. The result? <em>Apprendi-Blakely-Cunningham </em>would only apply when trial courts are sentencing defendants who have <em>no </em>prior convictions. Even a single prior conviction, or a single juvenile adjudication many years in the past, would be enough to disable the requirement aggravating factors be decided by a jury not the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">In my view, this position represents the sort of narrow reading of <em>Apprendi </em>which would force the United States Supreme Court to once again emphasize it meant what it said in that opinion, as it did in <em>Blakely </em>and now in <em>Cunningham. </em>I find nothing in <em>Apprendi, Blakely </em>or <em>Cunningham </em>to suggest the requirement of jury findings as to aggravating factors other than prior convictions is disabled in any and all cases where the defendant had a prior conviction. Yes, a prior conviction can be used to elevate a sentence without a jury finding. Yes, a trial judge can use a prior conviction alone as the sole grounds for elevating a sentence\u2014at least when that is appropriate. But this does not mean the prior conviction can serve as a smokescreen behind which the trial judge in fact employs other factors as the true reasons for determining the higher term is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Perhaps it will be helpful to clarify the limited point of this dissent in the context of the case before this court. I am not saying remand would necessarily be required had the trial judge expressly said he would elevate the sentence to the upper term based <em>solely </em>on the prior convictions and related behavior. (Such a statement would compel a reviewing court to determine whether this represented an abuse of discretion, however, something I need not address here.) Had the judge made this clear during the sentencing hearing, reversal might not be required even though he had gone on to say he also found the other aggravating factors to be enough by themselves to impose the high term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">But the trial judge here did something entirely different. He imposed the upper terms without stating why he was doing so, and without even making any findings as to any of those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>Accordingly, I would remand for resentencing. At that hearing, without any further findings, the trial court could impose the midterm on any or all of the offenses on which it previously imposed the high term. As to any of the offenses on which it proposes to impose the high term once again, however, the trial court would be required to ignore the factors it improperly found true and determine whether it would still elevate the sentence to the high term as to that offense based solely on (1) the elements of the offense charged and found true beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, and (2) appellant\u2019s prior convictions for which no jury finding is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 17, 2007, S155357.
