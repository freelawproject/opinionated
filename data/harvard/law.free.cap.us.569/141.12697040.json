The question presented here is whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases. We conclude that it does not, and we hold, consistent with general Fourth Amendment principles, that exigency in this context must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While on highway patrol at approximately 2:08 a.m., a Missouri police officer stopped Tyler McNeely's truck after observing it exceed the posted speed limit and repeatedly cross the centerline. The officer noticed several signs that McNeely was intoxicated, including McNeely's bloodshot eyes, his slurred speech, and the smell of alcohol on his breath. McNeely acknowledged to the officer that he had consumed \"a couple of beers\" at a bar, App. 20, and he appeared unsteady on his feet when he exited the truck. After McNeely performed poorly on a battery of\n   field-sobriety tests and declined to use a portable breath-test device to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC), the officer placed him under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officer began to transport McNeely to the station house. But when McNeely indicated that he would again refuse to provide a breath sample, the officer changed course\n   and took McNeely to a nearby hospital for blood testing. The officer did not attempt to secure a warrant. Upon arrival at the hospital, the officer asked McNeely whether he would consent to a blood test. Reading from a standard implied consent form, the officer explained to McNeely that under state law refusal to submit voluntarily to the test would lead to the immediate revocation of his driver's license for one year and could be used against him in a future prosecution. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Ann.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20577.020.1\">\n    Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 577.020.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577.041 (West 2011). McNeely nonetheless refused. The officer then directed a hospital lab technician to take a blood sample, and the sample was secured at approximately 2:35 a.m. Subsequent laboratory testing measured McNeely's BAC at 0.154 percent, which was well above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. See \u00a7 577.012.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McNeely was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), in violation of \u00a7 577.010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He moved to suppress the results of the blood test, arguing in relevant part that, under the circumstances, taking his blood for chemical testing without first obtaining a search warrant violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. The trial court agreed. It concluded that the exigency exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because, apart from the fact that \"[a]s in all cases involving intoxication, [McNeely's] blood alcohol was being metabolized by his liver,\" there were no circumstances suggesting the officer faced an emergency in which he could not practicably obtain a warrant.

The court further concluded that\n   <em>\n    Schmerber\n   </em>\n   \"requires more than the mere dissipation of blood-alcohol evidence to support a warrantless blood draw in an alcohol-related case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315484\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/65/\">\n    358 S.W.3d, at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the court, exigency depends heavily on the existence of additional \" 'special facts,' \" such as whether an officer was delayed by the need to investigate an accident and transport an injured suspect to the hospital, as had been the case in\n   <em>\n    Schmerber\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315484\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/65/\">\n    358 S.W.3d, at 70, 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding that this was \"unquestionably a routine DWI case\" in which no factors other than the natural dissipation of blood-alcohol suggested that there was an emergency, the court held that the nonconsensual warrantless blood draw violated McNeely's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches of his person.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315484\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/65/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315484\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/65/\">\n    at 74-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on the question whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream establishes a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   exigency that suffices on its own to justify an exception to the warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See 567 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20S.%20Ct.%2098\">\n    133 S.Ct. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20737\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

The State contends that whenever an officer has probable cause to believe an individual has been driving under the influence of alcohol, exigent circumstances will necessarily exist because BAC evidence is inherently evanescent.

Testimony before the trial court in this case indicated that the percentage of alcohol in an individual's blood typically decreases by approximately 0.015 percent to 0.02 percent per hour once the alcohol has been fully absorbed. App. 47. More precise calculations of the rate at which alcohol dissipates depend on various individual characteristics (such as weight, gender, and alcohol tolerance) and the circumstances in which the alcohol was consumed. See Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol Analysis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 437-441 (L. Kobilinsky ed.2012). Regardless of the exact elimination rate, it is sufficient for our\n   purposes to note that because an individual's alcohol level gradually declines soon after he stops drinking, a significant delay in testing will negatively affect the probative value of the results. This fact was essential to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Schmerber,\n   </em>\n   as we recognized that, under the circumstances, further delay in order to secure a warrant after the time spent investigating the scene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect to the hospital to receive treatment would have threatened the destruction of evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n    384 U.S., at 770-771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But it does not follow that we should depart from careful case-by-case assessment of exigency and adopt the categorical rule proposed by the State and its\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   . In those drunk-driving investigations where police officers can reasonably obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so.

Moreover, because a police officer must typically transport a drunk-driving suspect to a medical facility and obtain the assistance of someone with appropriate medical training before conducting a blood test, some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and the time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether police officers are required to obtain a warrant. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

This reality undermines the force of the State's contention, endorsed by the dissent, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1575 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), that we should recognize a categorical exception to the warrant requirement because BAC evidence \"is actively being destroyed with every minute that passes.\" Brief for Petitioner 27. Consider, for example, a situation in which the warrant process will not significantly increase the delay before the blood test is conducted because an officer can take steps to secure a warrant while the suspect is being transported to a medical facility by another officer. In such a circumstance, there would\n   be no plausible justification for an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State's proposed\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule also fails to account for advances in the 47 years since\n   <em>\n    Schmerber\n   </em>\n   was decided that allow for the more expeditious processing of warrant applications, particularly in contexts like drunk-driving investigations where the evidence offered to establish\n   probable cause is simple. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were amended in 1977 to permit federal magistrate judges to issue a warrant based on sworn testimony communicated by telephone. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Stat.%20319\">\n    91 Stat. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As amended, the law now allows a federal magistrate judge to consider \"information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means.\" Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 4.1. States have also innovated. Well over a majority of States allow police officers or prosecutors to apply for search warrants remotely through various means, including telephonic or radio communication, electronic communication such as e-mail, and video conferencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in addition to technology-based developments, jurisdictions have found other ways to streamline the warrant process, such as by using standard-form warrant applications for drunk-driving investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We by no means claim that telecommunications innovations have, will, or should eliminate all delay from the warrant-application process. Warrants inevitably take some time for police officers or prosecutors to complete and for magistrate judges to review. Telephonic and electronic warrants may still require officers to follow time-consuming formalities designed to create an adequate record, such as preparing a duplicate warrant before calling the magistrate judge. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 4.1(b)(3). And improvements in communications technology do not guarantee that a magistrate judge will be available when an officer needs a warrant after making a late-night arrest. But technological developments that enable police officers to secure warrants more quickly, and do so without undermining the neutral magistrate judge's essential\n   role as a check on police discretion, are relevant to an assessment of exigency. That is particularly so in this context, where BAC evidence is lost gradually and relatively predictably.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of course, there are important countervailing concerns. While experts can work backwards from the BAC at the time the sample was taken to determine the BAC at the time of the alleged offense, longer intervals may raise questions about the accuracy of the calculation. For that reason, exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless blood sample may arise in the regular course of law enforcement due to delays from the warrant application process. But adopting the State's\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   approach would improperly ignore the current and future technological developments in warrant procedures, and might well diminish the incentive for jurisdictions \"to pursue progressive approaches to warrant acquisition that preserve the protections afforded by the warrant while meeting the legitimate interests of law enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Rodriguez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327055\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/156/771/\">\n    2007 UT 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327055\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/156/771/\">\n    156 P.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In short, while the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may support a finding of exigency in a specific case, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Schmerber,\n   </em>\n   it does not do so categorically. Whether a warrantless blood test of a drunk-driving suspect is reasonable must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, THE CHIEF JUSTICE agrees that the State's proposed\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule is overbroad because \"[f]or exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search ... there must ... be 'no time to secure a warrant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1572 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tyler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/#p509\">\n    436 U.S., at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/#p509\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But THE CHIEF JUSTICE then goes on to suggest his own categorical rule under which a warrantless blood draw is permissible if the officer could not secure a warrant (or reasonably believed he could not secure a warrant) in the\n   time it takes to transport the suspect to a hospital or similar facility and obtain medical assistance.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1572 - 1574. Although we agree that delay inherent to the blood-testing process is relevant to evaluating exigency, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1561, we decline to substitute THE CHIEF JUSTICE's modified\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule for our traditional totality of the circumstances analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For one thing, making exigency completely dependent on the window of time between an arrest and a blood test produces odd consequences. Under THE CHIEF JUSTICE's rule, if a police officer serendipitously stops a suspect near an emergency room, the officer may conduct a nonconsensual warrantless blood draw even if all agree that a warrant could be obtained with very little delay under the circumstances (perhaps with far less delay than an average ride to the hospital in the jurisdiction). The rule would also distort law enforcement incentives. As with the State's\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule, THE CHIEF JUSTICE's rule might discourage efforts to expedite the warrant process because it categorically authorizes warrantless blood draws so long as it takes more time to\n   secure a warrant than to obtain medical assistance. On the flip side, making the requirement of independent judicial oversight turn exclusively on the amount of time that elapses between an arrest and BAC testing could induce police departments and individual officers to minimize testing delay to the detriment of other values. THE CHIEF JUSTICE correctly observes that \"[t]his case involves medical personnel drawing blood at a medical facility, not police officers doing so by the side of the road.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1572, n. 2. But THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not say that roadside blood draws are necessarily unreasonable, and if we accepted THE CHIEF JUSTICE's approach, they would become a more attractive option for the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The remaining arguments advanced in support of a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   exigency rule are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The State and several of its\n   <em>\n    amici,\n   </em>\n   including the United States, express concern that a case-by-case approach to exigency will not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers deciding whether to conduct a blood test of a drunk-driving suspect without a warrant. THE CHIEF JUSTICE and the dissent also raise this concern. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1569, 1573 - 1574 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.);\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1576 - 1578 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). While the desire for a bright-line rule is understandable, the Fourth Amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical approach that would dilute the warrant requirement in a context where significant privacy interests are at stake. Moreover, a case-by-case approach is hardly unique within our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Numerous police actions are judged based on fact-intensive, totality of the circumstances analyses rather than according to categorical rules, including in situations that are more likely to require police officers to make difficult split-second judgments.

In petitioning for certiorari to this Court, the State challenged only the first holding; it did not separately contend that the warrantless blood test was reasonable regardless of whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in a suspect's blood categorically justifies dispensing with the warrant requirement. See Pet. for Cert. i.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Here and in its own courts the State based its case on an insistence that a driver who declines to submit to testing after being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol is always subject to a nonconsensual blood test without any precondition for a warrant. That is incorrect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Although the Missouri Supreme Court referred to this case as \"unquestionably a routine DWI case,\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315484\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/65/\">\n     358 S.W.3d, at 74\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the fact that a particular drunk-driving stop is \"routine\" in the sense that it does not involve \" 'special facts,' \"\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    such as the need for the police to attend to a car accident, does not mean a warrant is required. Other factors present in an ordinary traffic stop, such as the procedures in place for obtaining a warrant or the availability of a magistrate judge, may affect whether the police can obtain a warrant in an expeditious way and therefore may establish an exigency that permits a warrantless search. The relevant factors in determining whether a warrantless search is reasonable, including the practical problems of obtaining a warrant within a timeframe that still preserves the opportunity to obtain reliable evidence, will no doubt vary depending upon the circumstances in the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Because this case was argued on the broad proposition that drunk-driving cases present a\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    exigency, the arguments and the record do not provide the Court with an adequate analytic framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of acting without a warrant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a warrant is required. No doubt, given the large number of arrests for this offense in different jurisdictions nationwide, cases will arise when anticipated delays in obtaining a warrant will justify a blood test without judicial authorization, for in every case the law must be concerned that evidence is being destroyed. But that inquiry ought not to be pursued here where the question is not properly before this Court. Having rejected the sole argument presented to us challenging the Missouri Supreme Court's decision, we affirm its judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    We hold that in drunk-driving investigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     It is so ordered.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Justice KENNEDY, concurring in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    I join Parts I, II-A, II-B, and IV of the opinion for the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    For the reasons stated below this case does not call for the Court to consider in detail the issue discussed in Part II-C and the separate opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As to Part III, much that is noted with respect to the statistical and survey data will be of relevance when this\n    issue is explored in later cases. The repeated insistence in Part III that every case be determined by its own circumstances is\n    correct, of course, as a general proposition; yet it ought not to be interpreted to indicate this question is not susceptible of rules and guidelines that can give important, practical instruction to arresting officers, instruction that in any number of instances would allow a warrantless blood test in order to preserve the critical evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    States and other governmental entities which enforce the driving laws can adopt rules, procedures, and protocols that meet the reasonableness requirements of the Fourth Amendment and give helpful guidance to law enforcement officials. And this Court, in due course, may find it appropriate and necessary to consider a case permitting it to provide more guidance than it undertakes to give today.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    As the opinion of the Court is correct to note, the instant case, by reason of the way in which it was presented and decided in the state courts, does not provide a framework where it is prudent to hold any more than that always dispensing with a warrant for a blood test when a driver is arrested for being under the influence of alcohol is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice BREYER and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    A police officer reading this Court's opinion would have no idea-no idea-what the Fourth Amendment requires of him, once he decides to obtain a blood sample from a drunk driving suspect who has refused a breathalyzer test. I have no quarrel with the Court's \"totality of the circumstances\" approach as a general matter; that is what our cases require. But the circumstances in drunk driving cases are often typical, and the Court should be able to offer guidance on how police should handle cases like the one before us.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In my view, the proper rule is straightforward. Our cases establish that there is an exigent circumstances exception\n    to the warrant requirement. That exception applies when there is a compelling need to prevent the imminent destruction of important evidence, and there is no time to obtain a warrant. The natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream constitutes not only the imminent but ongoing destruction of critical evidence. That would qualify as an exigent circumstance, except that there may be time to secure a warrant before blood can be drawn. If there is, an officer must seek a warrant. If an officer could reasonably conclude that there is not, the exigent circumstances exception applies by its terms, and the blood may be drawn without a warrant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Fourth Amendment provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    That language does not state that warrants are required prior to searches, but this Court has long held that warrants must generally be obtained.

Here, in fact, there is not simply a belief that any alcohol in the bloodstream will be destroyed; it is a biological certainty. Alcohol dissipates from the bloodstream at a rate of 0.01 percent to 0.025 percent per hour. Stripp, Forensic\n    and Clinical Issues in Alcohol Analysis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 440 (L. Kobilinsky ed.2012). Evidence is literally disappearing by the minute. That certainty makes this case an even stronger one than usual for application of the exigent circumstances exception.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    And that evidence is important. A serious and deadly crime is at issue. According to the Department of Transportation, in 2011, one person died every 53 minutes due to drinking and driving. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. (NHTSA), Traffic Safety Facts, 2011 Data 1 (No. 811700, Dec. 2012). No surprise then that drinking and driving is punished severely, including with jail time. See generally Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, L. Maruschak, Special Report, DWI Offenders under Correctional Supervision (1999). McNeely, for instance, faces up to four years in prison. See App. 22-23 (citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Ann.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20558.011\">\n     Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 558.011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 577.010, 577.023 (West 2011) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Evidence of a driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is crucial to obtain convictions for such crimes. All 50\n    States and the District of Columbia have laws providing that it is\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08 percent or higher. Most States also have laws establishing additional penalties for drivers who drive with a \"high BAC,\" often defined as 0.15 percent or above. NHTSA, Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws, pp. vii, x-xviii (No. 811673, Oct. 2012). BAC evidence clearly matters. And when drivers refuse breathalyzers, as McNeely did here, a blood draw becomes necessary to obtain that evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The need to prevent the imminent destruction of BAC evidence is no less compelling because the incriminating alcohol dissipates over a limited period of time, rather than all at once. As noted, the concentration of alcohol can make a difference not only between guilt and innocence, but between different crimes and different degrees of punishment. The officer is unlikely to know precisely when the suspect consumed alcohol or how much; all he knows is that critical evidence is being steadily lost. Fire can spread gradually, but that does not lessen the need and right of the officers to respond immediately. See\n    <em>\n     Tyler,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/#p509\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    McNeely contends that there is no compelling need for a warrantless blood draw, because if there is some alcohol left in the blood by the time a warrant is obtained, the State can use math and science to work backwards and identify a defendant's BAC at the time he was driving. See Brief for Respondent 44-46. But that's not good enough. We have indicated that exigent circumstances justify warrantless entry when drugs are about to be flushed down the toilet. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     King,\n    </em>\n    563 U.S., at ---- - ----, 131 S.Ct., at 1857-1858. We have not said that, because there could well be drug paraphernalia elsewhere in the home, or because a defendant's co-conspirator might testify to the amount of drugs involved, the drugs themselves are not crucial and there is no compelling need for warrantless entry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The same approach should govern here. There is a compelling need to search because alcohol-the nearly conclusive evidence of a serious crime-is dissipating from the bloodstream. The need is no less compelling because the police might be able to acquire second-best evidence some other way.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    For exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search, however, there must also be \"no time to secure a warrant.\"\n    <em>\n     Tyler,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/#p509\">\n     436 U.S., at 509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490288\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/499/#p509\">\n     98 S.Ct. 1942\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     Schmerber,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n     384 U.S., at 771\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n     86 S.Ct. 1826\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (warrantless search legal when \"there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant\"). In this respect, obtaining a blood sample from a suspected drunk driver differs from other exigent circumstances cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Importantly, there is typically delay between the moment a drunk driver is stopped and the time his blood can be drawn. Drunk drivers often end up in an emergency room, but they are not usually pulled over in front of one. In most exigent circumstances situations, police are just outside the door to a home. Inside, evidence is about to be destroyed, a person is about to be injured, or a fire has broken out. Police can enter promptly and must do so to respond effectively to the emergency. But when police pull a person over on suspicion of drinking and driving, they cannot test his blood right away.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    There is a time-consuming obstacle to\n    their search, in the form of a trip to the hospital and perhaps a wait to see a medical professional. In this case, for example, approximately 25 minutes elapsed between the time the police stopped McNeely and the time his blood was drawn. App. 36, 38.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    As noted, the fact that alcohol dissipates gradually from the bloodstream does not diminish the compelling need for a search-critical evidence is still disappearing. But the fact that the dissipation persists for some time means that the police-although they may not be able to do anything about it right away-may still be able to respond to the ongoing destruction of evidence later on.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    There might, therefore, be time to obtain a warrant in many cases. As the Court explains, police can often request warrants rather quickly these days. At least 30 States provide for electronic warrant applications. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1561 - 1563, and n. 4. In many States, a police officer can call a judge, convey the necessary information, and be authorized to affix the judge's signature to a warrant. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Ala.

If an officer could reasonably conclude that there is not sufficient time to seek and receive a warrant, or he applies for one but does not receive a response before blood can be drawn, a warrantless blood draw may ensue.

We have already held that forced blood draws can be constitutional-that such searches can be reasonable-but that does not change the fact that they are significant bodily intrusions.

Requiring a warrant whenever practicable helps ensure that when blood draws occur, they are indeed justified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    At the same time, permitting the police to act without a warrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence is well established in Fourth Amendment law. There is no reason to preclude application of that exception in drunk driving cases simply because it may take the police some time to be able to respond to the undoubted destruction of evidence, or because the destruction occurs continuously over an uncertain period.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    And that is so even in situations where police have requested a warrant but do not receive a timely response. An officer who reasonably concluded there was no time to secure a warrant may have blood drawn\n    from a suspect upon arrival at a medical facility.

See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1567 - 1568. It does not. The question presented is whether a warrantless blood draw is permissible under the Fourth Amendment \"based upon the natural dissipation\n    of alcohol in the bloodstream.\" Pet. for Cert. i. The majority answers \"It depends,\" and so do I. The difference is that the majority offers no additional guidance, merely instructing courts and police officers to consider the totality of the circumstances. I believe more meaningful guidance can be provided about how to handle the typical cases, and nothing about the question presented prohibits affording that guidance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    A plurality of the Court also expresses concern that my approach will discourage state and local efforts to expedite the warrant application process. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1563. That is not plausible: Police and prosecutors need warrants in a wide variety of situations, and often need them quickly. They certainly would not prefer a slower process, just because that might obviate the need to ask for a warrant in the occasional drunk driving case in which a blood draw is necessary. The plurality's suggestion also overlooks the interest of law enforcement in the protection a warrant provides.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The Court is correct when it says that every case must be considered on its particular facts. But the pertinent facts in drunk driving cases are often the same, and the police should know how to act in recurring factual situations. Simply put, when a drunk driving suspect fails field sobriety tests and refuses a breathalyzer, whether a warrant is required for a blood draw should come down to whether there is time to secure one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     Schmerber\n    </em>\n    itself provides support for such an analysis. The Court there made much of the fact that \"there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n     384 U.S., at 771\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/\">\n     86 S.Ct. 1826\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In\n    <em>\n     Cupp,\n    </em>\n    officers questioning a murder suspect observed a spot on the suspect's finger that they believed might be dried blood.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n     at 292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n     93 S.Ct. 2000\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . After the suspect began making obvious efforts to remove the spots from his hands, the officers took samples without obtaining either his consent or a warrant.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n     at 296\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n     93 S.Ct. 2000\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Following a Fourth Amendment challenge to this search, the Court held that the \"ready destructibility of the evidence\" and the suspect's observed efforts to destroy it \"justified the police in subjecting him to the very limited search necessary to preserve the highly evanescent evidence they found under his fingernails.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172131\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/291/#p296\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    In this case, a similar exigency is present. Just as the suspect's efforts to destroy \"highly evanescent evidence\" gave rise to the exigency in\n    <em>\n     Cupp,\n    </em>\n    the natural metabolization of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) creates an exigency once police have probable cause to believe the driver is drunk. It naturally follows that police may conduct a search in these circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    A hypothetical involving classic exigent circumstances further illustrates the point. Officers are watching a warehouse and observe a worker carrying bundles from the warehouse to a large bonfire and throwing them into the blaze. The officers have probable cause to believe the bundles contain marijuana. Because there is only one person carrying the bundles, the officers believe it will take hours to completely destroy the drugs. During that time the officers likely could obtain a warrant. But it is clear that the officers need not sit idly by and watch the destruction of evidence\n    while they wait for a warrant. The fact that it will take time for the evidence to be destroyed and that\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    evidence may remain by the time the officers secure a warrant are not relevant to the exigency. However, the ever-diminishing quantity of drugs may have an impact on the severity of the crime and the length of the sentence. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(D) (lower penalties for less than 50 kilograms of marijuana); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1(c) (Nov.2012) (drug quantity table tying base offense level to drug amounts). Conducting a warrantless search of the warehouse in this situation would be entirely reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The same obtains in the drunk-driving context. Just because it will take time for the evidence to be completely destroyed does not mean there is no exigency. Congress has conditioned federal highway grants on states' adoption of laws penalizing the operation of a motor vehicle \"with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or greater.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20163\">\n     23 U.S.C. \u00a7 163\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

Moreover, as of 2005, 32 States and the District of Columbia imposed additional penalties for BAC levels of 0.15 percent or higher. NHTSA State Review 175. Missouri is one such State. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Mo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 577.010(3)-(4), 577.012(4)-(5) (suspended sentence unavailable even for first offenders with BAC above 0.15 percent unless they complete drug treatment; mandatory jail time if treatment is not completed). As a result, the level of intoxication\n    directly bears on enforcement of these laws. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment requires officers to allow evidence essential to enforcement of drunk-driving laws to be destroyed while they wait for a warrant to issue.\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    In today's decision, the Court elides the certainty of evidence destruction in drunk-driving cases and focuses primarily on the time necessary for destruction. In doing so, it turns the exigency inquiry into a question about the amount of evidentiary destruction police must permit before they may act without a warrant. That inquiry is inconsistent with the actual exigency at issue: the uncontested destruction of evidence due to metabolization of alcohol. See Part I,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . Moreover, the Court's facts-and-circumstances analysis will be difficult to administer, a particularly important concern in the Fourth Amendment context.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The Court's judgment reflects nothing more than a vague notion that everything will come out right most of the time so long as the delay is not too lengthy.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1562 (justifying delays in part because \"BAC evidence is lost gradually and relatively predictably\");\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1561 (same, quoting Brief for Petitioner 27). But hard percentage lines have meaningful legal consequences in the drunk-driving context. The fact that police will be able to retrieve\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    evidence before it is all destroyed is simply not relevant to the exigency inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The majority believes that, absent special facts and circumstances, some destruction of evidence is acceptable. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1561 (\"sufficient for our purposes to note that ...\n    <em>\n     significant\n    </em>\n    delay in testing will negatively affect the probative value\" (emphasis added)). This belief must rest on the assumption that whatever evidence remains once a warrant is obtained will be sufficient to prosecute the suspect. But that assumption is clearly wrong. Suspects' initial levels of intoxication and the time necessary to obtain warranted blood draws will vary widely from case to case. Even a slight delay may significantly affect probative value in borderline cases of suspects who are moderately intoxicated or suspects whose BAC is near a statutory threshold that triggers a more serious offense. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1576 - 1577 (discussing\n    laws penalizing heightened BAC levels). Similarly, the time to obtain a warrant can be expected to vary, and there is no reason to believe it will do so in a predictable fashion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Further, the Court nowhere explains how an officer in the field is to apply the facts-and-circumstances test it adopts. First, officers do not have the facts needed to assess how much time can pass before too little evidence remains. They will never know how intoxicated a suspect is at the time of arrest. Otherwise, there would be no need for testing. Second, they will not know how long it will take to roust a magistrate from his bed, reach the hospital, or obtain a blood sample once there. As the Minnesota Supreme Court recognized in rejecting arguments like those adopted by the Court today:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    \"[T]he officer has no control over how long it would take to travel to a judge or the judge's availability. The officer also may not know the time of the suspect's last drink, the amount of alcohol consumed, or the rate at which the suspect will metabolize alcohol. Finally, an officer cannot know how long it will take to obtain the blood sample once the suspect is brought to the hospital. Under a totality of the circumstances test, an officer would be called upon to speculate on each of these considerations and predict how long the most probative evidence\n    of the defendant's blood-alcohol level would continue to exist before a blood sample was no longer reliable.\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Shriner,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215265\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/751/538/#p554\">\n     751 N.W.2d 538\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 549 (2008) (footnote omitted).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Court should not adopt a rule that requires police to guess whether they will be able to obtain a warrant before \"too much\" evidence is destroyed, for the police lack reliable information concerning the relevant variables.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    This case demonstrates the uncertainty officers face with regard to the delay caused by obtaining a warrant. The arresting officer clearly had probable cause to believe respondent was drunk, but there was no way for the officer to quantify the level of intoxication to determine how quickly he needed to act in order to obtain probative evidence. Another officer testified at respondent's trial that it typically took 1 \u00bd; to 2 hours to obtain a drunk-driving warrant at night in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri. See App. 53-54. Respondent submitted an exhibit summarizing six late afternoon and nighttime drunk-driving search warrants that suggests the time may be shorter. Brief for Respondent 56; App. 70. Ultimately this factual tiff is beside the point; the spotty evidence regarding timing itself illustrates the fact that delays in obtaining warrants are unpredictable and potentially lengthy. A rule that requires officers (and ultimately courts) to balance transportation delays, hospital availability, and access to magistrates is not a workable rule for cases where natural processes inevitably destroy the evidence with every passing minute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The availability of telephonic warrant applications is not an answer to this conundrum. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1561 - 1563, and n. 4. For one thing, Missouri still requires written warrant applications and affidavits,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Ann.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20542.276.2\">\n     Mo.

But even if telephonic applications were available in Missouri, the same difficulties would arise. As the majority correctly recognizes, \"[w]arrants inevitably take some time\n    for police officers or prosecutors to complete and for magistrate judges to review.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1562. During that time, evidence is destroyed, and police who have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed should not have to guess how long it will take to secure a warrant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-140\">\n     And that second-best evidence may prove useless.
