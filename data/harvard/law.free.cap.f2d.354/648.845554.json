The amended complaint alleged that on December 12, 1963, the Secretary of Defense of the United States issued his order that the Naval Repair Facility of the United States Naval Station at San Diego, California, be closed. At that time and prior thereto, appellant was employed as a service electrician at the Repair Facility, and he alleged that his suit was a \u201cclass action\u201d brought by him on behalf of all employees affected by the Secretary\u2019s order. Named as defendants in the suit to enjoin the closure were the United States of America, its Secretary of Defense, its Secretary of the Navy, and the Commanding Officer of the Naval Repair Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>In our court, the appellant makes two contentions: (1) That \u00a7 125 of Title 10 U.S.C.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the authority under which the Secretary of Defense made the challenged order, is unconstitutional in that it unlawfully delegates legislative powers; (2) That if the section is not unconstitutional, the Secretary\u2019s order is invalid because of his failure to comply with the requirements of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We are convinced that the District Court made the proper determination and affirm its judgment for the reasons stated in its reported opinion. Armstrong v. United States, 233 F.Supp. 188 (S.D.Cal.1964). It is true that the Secretary did not report \u201cdetails * * * to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives\u201d before he directed the closing of the facility, as the section requires him to do before he transfers, reassigns, consolidates, or abolishes \u201ca function, power, or duty vested\u201d in his Department. In the light of the legislative history of the section,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we do not believe that a fair interpretation of its terms enables us to classify a Naval Repair Facility as \u201ca function, power, or duty\u201d. If, by torture or ordinary meaning, a naval repair facility could be defined as a \u201cfunction\u201d, it would be a \u201cfunction\u201d which might be supervised by the Secretary, but it would not be \u201cvested\u201d in him or his Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">. \u201c(a) * * *, [T]he Secretary of Defense shall take appropriate action (including the transfer, reassignment, consolidation, or abolition of any <em>function, </em>power, or duty) to provide more effectice, efficient, and economical administration and operation, and to eliminate duplication, in the Department of Defense. However, * * *, a <em>function, </em>power, or duty vested in the Department of Defense, or an officer, official, or agency thereof, by law may not be substantially transferred, reassigned, consolidated, or abolished unless the Secretary reports the details * * * to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives. The transfer, reassignment, consolidation, or abolition concerned takes effect on the first day after the expiration of the first 30 days that Congress is in continuous session after the Secretary so reports, * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ARTF\">. See 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3277-3278, 3283-3285 (1958). In 1958 the precursor statute to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 125 was amended so as to bring it to what is substantially its present form. It is this legislature history that is most relevant to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
