Gr\u00fcnewald, for damages sustained to five lots of \u201cfat-backs\u201d on an ocean voyage from New York to Bremen, Germany, in June 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\"> The shipper, since it has superior access to information as to the condition of goods when delivered to the carrier, has the burden of proving good condition at the time of delivery. See Hecht, Levis &amp; Kahn, Inc. v. The S.S. President Buchanan, 236 F.2d 627, 631 (2d Cir. 1956); The Niel Maersk, 91 F.2d 932, 934-935 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 753, 58 S.Ct. 281, 82 L.Ed. 582 (1937). The district judge found that appellant failed to sustain that burden. Neither the certification of the \u201cfat-backs\u201d by the Department of Agriculture nor the recitation in appellee\u2019s bill of lading establishes the good order of the cargo, since both refer only to the external condition of the cargo and do not reveal the possibility of inherent defects. See Hecht, Levis &amp; Kahn, Inc. v. The S.S. President Buchanan, 236 F.2d 627, 631 (2d Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">On this record, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
