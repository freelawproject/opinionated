Any inference which the jury might have drawn as to appellant\u2019s conduct unrelated to this offense would arise from testimony that was relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>for some purpose in connection with appellant\u2019s identity, knowledge of the stolen character of the automobile, interstate transportation or possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">We find no prejudicial error in the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">The court expresses its appreciation t\u00a9 counsel, serving without compensation on this court\u2019s appointment, for the able and conscientious service performed for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
