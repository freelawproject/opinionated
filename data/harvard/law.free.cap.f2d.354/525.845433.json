The Board found that respondent violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by discharging employees Gentry and Flygare because of their union activities. The Board further found that respondent violated 8 (a) (1) of the Act by telling the employees they might be discharged for attending a union meeting, and by prohibiting union solicitations by employees during nonworking time.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-26\">Testimony which the Board credited, supported a finding of the following basic facts: In May, 1963, Gentry and Flygare met with some of the company\u2019s employees to discuss unionization of the plant. Gentry made a contact with Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 54, with whom he made arrangements for organization of the employees. He talked to \u201cthirty to forty\u201d of the sixty to sixty-five employees in the plant about signing union cards. Among those he asked to sign were Supervisors Rutledge and McNatt. Flygare assisted by asking a number of employees to sign cards. Flygare testified that \u201cwe had as many as thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>guys at my house at one time and Rutledge was one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Gentry arranged for the union to distribute pamphlets on the street in front of respondent\u2019s plant on the evening of June 4. On June 5, supervisory employee Gussman asked Gentry if he had \u201canother of those pamphlets,\u201d stating that he would like to see it. Gentry replied that he did not have another pamphlet. The following morning Gentry was discharged. When Gentry asked his foreman, Evans why he was being discharged, the latter replied, \u201cWell, your work is not up to standard.\u201d There was no overt act coincidental with the discharge that had given rise to any criticism of Gentry\u2019s work, although the record discloses that in the past he had not been an entirely satisfactory employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On June 15, the union again distributed handbills in front of the company\u2019s plant. Flygare had taken one of the union handbills back to his work bench. He drew a map on the reverse side of this handbill which, he testified, he did in order to show a fellow employee, Davis, how to reach his home to inspect a car Flygare was selling. In the exchange, which the undisputed testimony established took not more than thirty seconds, Flygare handed the handbill map to Davis as the latter approached the drinking fountain saying, \u201cHere\u2019s a map how to get to my place to pick up the car.\u201d The witnesses do not recall whether Davis replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">Almost immediately thereafter, the company president came to Flygare\u2019s machine and, according to Flygare\u2019s testimony, \u201cHe said he caught me talking union * * * he said he knew what our rights were and he knew what his rights were and he says that I was a fool if I didn\u2019t think he would do what he could, you know, to stop us.\u201d A few minutes later Foreman Evans came up to Flygare and discharged him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">Although President Leasure told Flygare\u2019s friend, Arthur May, that Flygare had been discharged for a number of reasons, Evans told May that the discharge had been \u201cfor passing out union literature.\u201d Also, another supervisor named Gibson who was away from the plant at the time of the discharge, testified that Mr. Leasure had told him that Flygare \u201cwas fired for passing out union literature on Company time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-19\">On the same day on which Flygare was discharged, Supervisor McNatt and Foreman Don Evans discussed a union meeting scheduled for that evening and McNatt asked Evans \u201cwould we get fired if we went over there?\u201d Evans answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Immediately after this conversation, according to McNatt\u2019s testimony, he went out \u201cand there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>about eight or nine of the men standing outside, and I told them to use their judgment about going, that they might get fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On June 20, after some discussion with Labor Board representatives,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> respondent posted the following notice in the plant:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\u201cTO ALL EMPLOYEES:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">It has been the policy of the Company since its inception that no solicitation of any kind, whether for such organizations as United Fund, Insurance groups or any charitable or noncharitable promotional groups, has been permitted on the Company\u2019s premises. No exception has been made to this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Accordingly, this notice will reaffirm the Company\u2019s non-solicitation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Your strict adherence to this policy is requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">W. C. Leasure President\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">There had previously been no broad solicitation rule in effect in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">The respondent contends that there is no substantial evidence on the record as a whole to sustain the charges of discriminatory firing or of the 8(a) (1) violation by threats or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">We deal first with the latter of the two points. From our recent opinion in NLRB v. Southwire Company, 5 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 346, November 1, 1965, it is clear that a No Solicitation rule that absolutely prohibits union solicitation on the company\u2019s property when employees are off duty in the absence of such special circumstances, as are discussed in NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 351 U.S. 105, 112, 113, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed. 975, is too broad, and such a published rule, under the circumstances here present, is violative of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act. See Republic Aviation Corporation v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372; NLRB v. Walton Manufacturing Co., 5 Cir., 289 F.2d 177, 180; NLRB v. Linda Joe Shoe Co., 5 Cir., 307 F.2d 355, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">Dealing next with the charges of discriminatory discharges, we conclude, first, that there is no merit in respondent\u2019s contention that there was no proof that respondent knew of the activities of Gentry and Flygare. It was not disputed that they discussed their activities with at least two supervisors directly. Moreover, credited testimony gives the fact of their activities as the reason for the discharge of one of the two men. In light of Gentry\u2019s position of leadership in the organization of the employees, and in light of the timing of his discharge, which was coincident with the passing out of union literature but not coincident with any overt act of poor workmanship or inefficiency, and not coincident with the pay period, we think it clear that the Board could draw the inference that the true motive for firing Gentry was his union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">So, too, must we conclude that the testimony to the effect that the company\u2019s president said that Flygare was discharged for union activity, both at the time of the discharge and subsequent thereto, was sufficient to warrant the conclusion by the Examiner and the Board that his discharge was motivated by a desire to stifle the union activity. As we have stated repeatedly, this Court \u201c \u2018may [not] displace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views\u2019 and inferences, \u2018even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d </em>NLRB v. Coats &amp; Clarke, Inc., 5 Cir., 231 F.2d 567, 572. Here there was sufficient evidence on the record as a whole to warrant the Board\u2019s drawing the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ference that the discharges had been illegally made.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The Order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. Testimony concerning this firing was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">\u201cQ. What occurred next? A. About fifteen minutes later, Don Evans walked up to me and let me go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\u201cQ. When Mr. Evans walked up to you, tell us what Mr. Evans said to you and what you said to him. A. He said he was going to have to let me go, for me to go home, pick up my uniforms and come back and pick up my check, and I did that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\u201cQ. When you got your uniforms, you came back to the plant, is that it? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">\u201cQ. Who did you see at that time? A. I talked to Don Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">\u201cQ. What did you say to him? A. I asked him why \u2014 I asked him if Bill Leasure told him to fire me. I asked him why. He said for passing out union literature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anl\">\u201cQ. All right. What did you say to him? A. I asked him how Bill Leasure figured he could get away with an excuse like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUj\">\u201cQ. Did you tell Mr. Evans about the map? A. Yes, I did. I told him that there was a map written on the back of that handbill and that it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the union at all. He said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s too late now.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApP\">I called Lynn Davis who was working on a machine about twenty feet away, and I asked him what was on that sheet of paper I gave him this morning. He said, \u2018It was a map how to get over to your car.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmA\">\u201cQ. Was this in the presence of Mr. Evans? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARY\">\u201cQ. And Mr. Evans told you that, \u2018It\u2019s too late now,\u2019 is that it?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-14\">. Although respondent says the company\u2019s representatives talked with Board lawyers before posting the No Solicitation rule, it is not contended that the Board or any of its representatives approved, or even saw, the rule as it was published. Respondent seems to say that the Board should have guided respondent more carefully or have sent respondent to a lawyer for advice. Obviously this occurrence cannot give any added validity to the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b620-5\">HUTCHESON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AOk\">(dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I am in agreement with the majority's disposition of the Section 8(a) (1) violation; I cannot, however, agree that the discharges of Gentry and Flygare were unlawful under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">This court, before the amendment of the National Labor Relations Act, held without varying that association with or membership in a labor union is not a guarantee against discharge; that when real grounds for discharge exist, management may not be prevented from discharging; and that opposition to union organization, even to the point of restraint, coercion, and interference in violation of Section 8(a) (1), is not enough, without more, to make the discharge unlawful.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus \u201c [m] anagement can discharge for good cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all. It has, as the master of its own business affairs, complete freedom with but one specific, definite qualification: it may not discharge when the real motivating purpose is to do that which Section 8(a) (3) forbids.\u201d NLRB v. McGahey, 233 F.2d 406, 413 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Congress has made abundantly clear its concurrence; Section 10(c) of the Act now reads, in pertinent part, \u201c[n]o order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause.\u201d This amendment \u201cwas intended to, and did, give legislative approval to these views and corresponding disapproval to the practices of examiners and board to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> NLRB v. Fulton Bag &amp; Cotton Mills, 175 F.2d 675, 677 (5th Cir. 1949). Accord, NLRB v. Ray Smith Transp. Co., 193 F.2d 142, 146 (5th Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">In the present case Respondent assigned a valid cause for the discharge of both Gentry and Flygare. The Board refused to accept the cause assigned and found that Gentry and Flygare were discharged because of their union activities. It must be remembered that \u201c[a]n unlawful purpose is not lightly to be inferred.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> NLRB v. McGahey, supra. With due deference to my colleagues of the majority, in my opinion the record before us \u201cconsidered as a whole\u201d does not present a substantial basis of believable evidence pointing toward an unlawful motive for the discharge, but rather indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>cates that the Board based its finding on the Respondent\u2019s general animosity toward the union <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This in my opinion is contrary to the Congressional intent, and therefore I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">.
