The conviction was affirmed, McDowell v. United States, 6 Cir., 283 F.2d 867, cert. den. 366 U.S. 937, 81 S.Ct. 1664, 6 L.Ed.2d 848, and an order denying relief under \u00a7 2255 was affirmed, 305 F.2d 12, cert. den. 371 U.S. 927, 83 S.Ct. 296, 9 L.Ed.2d 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-23\">Petitioner now seeks relief by habeas corpus claiming that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective. The matters of which he now complains have either been conclusively litigated in the Circuit of his conviction, or they are yet cognizable there. The remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply because the petitioner did not succeed thereunder or even though it was erroneously withheld. See Wallace v. Willingham, September 1965 Term, 10 Cir., 351 F.2d 299; Carte v. Taylor, 10 Cir., 347 F.2d 364. This appeal was, therefore, improvidently granted, and is dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
