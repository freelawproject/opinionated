Kenner was a certified public accountant who prepared income tax returns for his clients and represented these clients when their returns were audited by the'Service. His criminal activities, as pictured by the government\u2019s evidence, all followed a single pattern with only slight variations in individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Kenner would suggest to an auditor in the office audit division of the Internal Revenue Service in New York that he, the auditor, \u201cpull\u201d for audit X\u2019s tax return, X being one of Kenner\u2019s clients. This procedure was in itself irregular, since returns were ordinarily assigned to the individual auditors by the group supervisor. Kenner would then propose to the auditor an amount of deduction for business expenses, travel, entertainment, medical expenses or the like which should be disallowed. The auditor, without examining the merits of the proposed amount (or the substantiation for the amounts claimed) would make up his report disallowing the amount which Kenner had suggested. Kenner would then by prearrangement meet the auditor at some place outside the audit division\u2019s offices and, usually in a surreptitious manner, give him fifty or seventy-five dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Appellant advances a number of claims of error in the proceedings of the district court. Finding that there was no error sufficiently prejudicial to call for reversal of the conviction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">We shall examine appellant\u2019s contentions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">1. <em>The Allen charge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">After deliberating for three hours and forty-five minutes the jury sent out a message stating that it was \u201chopelessly deadlocked.\u201d The judge thereupon, over defendant\u2019s objection, read to the jury a passage, slightly modified, from the opinion in Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501-502, 17 S.Ct. 154, 157, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">This court has in the past approved the Allen charge in certain circumstances. United States v. Tolub, 309 F.2d 286 (2d Cir. 1962); United States v. Curcio, 279 F.2d 681 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 824, 81 S.Ct. 59, 5 L.Ed.2d 52 (1960); United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 484 n. 18 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, Corallo v. United States, 375 U.S. 835 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed.2d 65 (1963). However, in all of these cases, as well as in United States v. Thomas, 282 F.2d 191 (2d Cir. 1960), which is also cited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>government, the effect of reading to the jury that part of the Allen opinion which Judge Murphy read, was mitigated by the assurance in some form that a juror was not expected, in deference to the other jurors, to abandon his conscientious convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In United States v. Tolub, which the government says quoted exactly that portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion quoted by Judge Murphy, the Judge added immediately after the quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeA\">\u201cRemember at all times that no jur- or is expected to yield a conscientious conviction he or she may have as to the weight or effect of evidence, but remember also that after full deliberation and consideration of all the evidence, it is your duty to agree upon the verdict, if you can do so, without violating your individual judgment and conscience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In United States v. Kahaner, supra, 317 F.2d at 483-484, Judge Friendly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-7\">\u201c[The trial judge said in his charge] \u2018It is desirable if a verdict can be reached that this be done both from the viewpoint of the defendants and the Government\u2019, but that this was true only if the verdict \u2018reflects the conscientious judgment of each jur- or and under no circumstance must any juror yield his conscientious judgment.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\">\u2018It has been a long trial and a trial, as I say, where I am satisfied each side prefers finality of judgment if it can be obtained on the basis of a conscientious reflection of each jur- or\u2019s final vote.\u2019 Exceptions of defense counsel were overruled and a motion for a mistrial denied; however, the judge recalled the jury and again emphasized, in a variety of ways, that \u2018if any individual juror still retains a conscientious view that differs from that of other jurors, * * * you are not to yield your judgment\u2019; \u2018you are not to yield your judgment simply because you may be outnumbered or outweighed,\u2019 etc. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-11\">This recital of the facts suffices- almost without more to dispose of the characterization, made by one of the appellants, that \u2018The jury was being coerced by being subjected, in these circumstances, on two separate occasions to the \u201cdynamite\u201d Allen charge.\u2019 On the contrary, if the charge is to be given at all, we do not see how this could be done with less tendency to coercion or more emphasis on the need for conscientious individual agreement than in the way Judge Weinfeld did it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">In United States v. Curcio, the trial court read to the jury that part of the Allen opinion which states \u201cthat it was their duty to decide the case if they could conscientiously do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">In United States v. Thomas, the judge said in his charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-14\">\u201cYour verdict, of course, must be the verdict of each individual juror and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his fellows. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4_\">\u201cIt is your duty to decide the case, if you can do so conscientiously.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">In the present case the only thing the judge added to the part of the Allen opinion which he read to the jury was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-16\">\u201cI am going to suggest that you think about that and go back and try again. You know, what we all try to achieve is unanimity in these cases. I hope that you can do it. I don\u2019t mean by reading this charge to coerce some juror who feels that he or she is of this opinion or that but certainly the advice of the Supreme Court should be heeded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-17\">It may be that you can agree on some of the counts and not on others, but whatever is the ultimate decision we will accept it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-18\">I am going to ask you to go back and try again, and if you can\u2019t agree, that is it, we have to quit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-19\">So will you please go back and try again ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-20\">We have had grave doubt as to whether the charge thus given was not unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>coercive. We have concluded that the case is saved from reversal by the barest margin, the margin provided in these circumstances and in this context by the judge\u2019s disclaimer of intention to \u201ccoerce\u201d and by his expression of willingness to accept \u201cthe ultimate decision,\u201d whatever it might be.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"> 2. <em>The Jencks Act material.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">When summations were about to begin on the morning of the day after both sides had rested, defense counsel asked permission to examine one of the government\u2019s witnesses to ascertain whether there was material in addition to that already provided, to which defendant would be entitled under the Jencks Act (18 U. S.C. \u00a7 3500). The court denied the application. After verdict appellant renewed his application, and it was again denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether or not to permit the case to be reopened for further proceedings was within the discretion of the court. The facts here show no abuse of discretion. See United States v. Sheba Bracelets, Inc., 248 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 904, 78 S.Ct. 330, 2 L.Ed.2d 259 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">3. <em>Concurrent sentences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The remaining contentions of defendant involve 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f), which is relevant to two of the counts, and 26 U. S.C. \u00a7 7214(a)(2), which applies to the other five counts on which the appellant was convicted. Since the appellant was sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment on each of the seven counts, all sentences to run concurrently, this court must affirm if it finds that conviction was warranted on any one count. Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 359, 362, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); United States v. Houlihan, 332 F.2d 8, 13-14 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 828, 85 S.Ct. 56, 13 L.Ed.2d 37 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">4. <em>18 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>201(f).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Appellant claims that Section 201 (f) is \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d The section has recently been upheld by this Court against an attack on the ground of vagueness. United States v. Irwin, 354 F.2d 192 (2d Cir.1965). It is sufficient to say here that the statute is entirely clear as applied to the conduct with which appellant was charged, whatever its ambit with respect to other matters not involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">\u201c[0]ne to whom application- of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.\u201d United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 522, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence failed to establish that the money given to the auditor by appellant was given \u201cfor or because of\u201d an official act borders on the frivolous. After arranging for the phony audits, appellant told the auditor that he would contact him. When he did so he surreptitiously delivered an amount which would equal fifty dollars for each such audit. Far from being insufficient the evidence leaves no room for any other conclusion than that the payments were made for the pretended audits. See United States v. Lev, 258 F.2d 9 (2d Cir.), aff\u2019d by an equally divided Court, 360 U.S. 470, 79 S.Ct. 1431, 3 L.Ed.2d 1531, petition for rehearing denied, 361 U.S. 856, 80 S.Ct. 41, 4 L.Ed. 2d 95 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number> Appellant contends that it was error for the judge to fail to charge that in order to convict under Section 201(f) corrupt intent to influence must be found. Examination of Section 201 shows that, although proof of corrupt intent is required for conviction under Subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e), for violation of which the prescribed penalties are much more severe, conviction under Subsection (f) requires only proof that the payment was made \u201cfor or because of\u201d the performance of an official act. In any event the appellant is not in any position to raise the point since in the trial court he failed to object to the charge on this ground. United States v. Rinaldi, 301 F.2d 576, 578 (2d Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">5. <em>26 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>72U(a) (2).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Appellant was found guilty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 by aiding and abetting certain other defendants in violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214 (a) (2). He argues that this was error because the acts which he was charged with aiding and abetting were not violations of \u00a7 7214(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument is based, first, upon the language of \u00a7 7214(a) (2) which prohibits the receipt by an officer or employee of a \u201cfee, compensation, or reward, except as by law prescribed, for the performance of any duty.\u201d The sums which appellant was charged with paying were not, he says, a fee, compensation or reward, but a \u201cgratuity.\u201d We hold that the language of \u00a7 7214(a)(2) is sufficiently broad to include the payments made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 7214(a) (2) is \u201ca historical vestige, reenacted through apparent oversight\u201d is negatived by the fact that when Section 7214(a) was reenacted in 1954 its language \u201cany officer or agent appointed or acting under the authority of any revenue law of the United States,\u201d was broadened to cover \u201c[a]ny officer or employee of the United States acting in connection with any revenue law of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The presence in \u00a7 7214(a) (2) of penalty provisions which would be inappropriate in their application to defendant (e.g. dismissal from office) does not preclude the applicability to that Section of the aiding and abetting statute. The legislative history of the 1951 amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 shows that Congress intended that statute to apply to situations in which the \u201cprincipal\u201d is, for example, an officer or employee of the United States and therefore subject to penalties, such as removal from office, which would be irrelevant to the situation of the person charged with aiding and abetting. See 1951 U. S. Cong, and Adm. Serv. 2583.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, a payor of a bribe can be an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. May v. United States, 84 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 175 F.2d 994 cert. denied, 338 U.S. 830, 70 S.Ct. 58, 94 L.Ed. 505 (1949). See United States v. Johnson, 337 F.2d 180, 196 (4th Cir.1964), cert. granted, 379 U.S. 988, 85 S.Ct. 703, 13 L.Ed.2d 609 (1965); United States v. Fromen, 265 F.2d 702, 705 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 909, 79 S.Ct. 1295, 3 L.Ed.2d 1260 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Appellant claims that the charges contained in two of the counts on which he was convicted were barred by the running of the statute of limitations. Appellant first raised this defense after trial by a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The defense of the statute of limitations must be raised before or during the trial. \u201cIf this is not done and a verdict of guilty is rendered, sentence may be lawfully imposed.\u201d Askins v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 251 F.2d 909, 913 (1958). See also United States v. Taylor, 207 F.2d 437 (2d Cir.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">We find no error which requires reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-10\">.

The very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments among the jurors themselves. It certainly cannot be the law that each juror should not listen with deference to arguments and with a distrust of his own view, his own judgment, if he finds a large majority of the jury taking a different view of the case from what he does himself. It cannot be that each juror should go to the jury-room with a blind determination that the verdict shall represent his opinion of the case at that moment; or, that he should close his ears to the arguments of men who are equally honest and equally intelligent as himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">.
