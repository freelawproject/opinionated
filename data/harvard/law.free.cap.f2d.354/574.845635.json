Heide alleged infringement of its registered trademark \u201cJujyfruits\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and unfair competition by Ziegler through the latter\u2019s use of the term \u201cFruit Ju Jus\u201d in connection with the sale of soft gum candies. After Ziegler had discontinued using \u201cFruit Ju Jus\u201d and began using \u201cJu Ju Bits,\u201d the complaint was amended by adding a second count alleging infringement of another of Heide\u2019s trademarks, \u201cJujubes,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> used to identify its hard gum candies. Ziegler subsequently filed a counterclaim alleging fraud in the procurement of the \u201cJujubes\u201d registration and unfair competition in the use of the mark so obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">The district court held that the \u201cJujyfruits\u201d registration was valid and that Ziegler\u2019s use of \u201cFruit Ju Jus\u201d infringed the registration and constituted unfair competition. Further use of \u201cFruit Ju Jus\u201d was enjoined and Heide\u2019s damages were set at $7,241.84 by stipulation of the parties. The court dismissed the second count of Heide\u2019s complaint, however, holding the registration for \u201cJujubes\u201d invalid because of the generic nature of the term. The court further concluded that the use of \u201cJujubes\u201d in connection with the marketing of hard gum candies was \u201cdeceptively misdescriptive.\u201d Finally, the district judge held that the registration for \u201cJujubes\u201d had been obtained in good faith and dismissed Ziegler\u2019s claim of fraudulent registration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">The issue presented with respect to the trademark registration for \u201cJujubes\u201d is whether the district court erred in concluding that \u201cjujubes\u201d is a generic term and as such incapable of valid registration. Heide, the owner of the mark, contends that the evidence is insufficient to establish that \u201cjujubes\u201d is a generic term when used in reference to candy. It further contends that even if it were to concede that \u201cjujubes\u201d has been and is now used generically at the manufacturing level to describe a class of soft, starch gum candies, such use is unknown to the consuming public, which associates the term only with the hard, genuine gum candy manufactured and sold by Henry Heide, Inc. To support this latter contention, Heide points to its extensive consumer-level advertising and sale of its product, and to a survey purporting to establish that seventy-four per cent of the consuming public identifies \u201cJujubes\u201d as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">Ziegler, on the other hand, asserts that the record is replete with evidence pointing to the generic use of \u201cjujubes\u201d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>both the manufacturing and consumer levels. Ziegler also maintains that proof of generic use at any trade level is sufficient and that a generic term cannot acquire a secondary meaning such as would permit exclusive appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">We have concluded that the record does contain ample support for the finding that \u201cjujubes\u201d is a generic term, and hold that the acquisition of trademark rights in such term is proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The evidence introduced below overwhelmingly established that candy manufacturers for several decades have used in the trade the term \u201cjujubes\u201d to define a class of gum candy. Indeed, Heide conceded as much at the trial, \u201cin the interest of saving time.\u201d We need not decide, however, whether such use among manufacturers and wholesalers of itself precludes exclusive appropriation at the retail level. The generic use of the term \u201cjujube\u201d has clearly not been restricted to those possessing special experience in the candy industry. Such use in consumer advertising and in consumer package labeling was quite extensive at-one time. For example, Heide\u2019s competitor, Wallace &amp; Co., packaged and sold \u201c \u2018Sa-Yo\u2019 mint jujubes\u201d until sometime late in the 1920\u2019s. Further, several recipe books evidencing the generic nature of \u201cjujubes\u201d were introduced, at least a few of which are directed to the consuming public. In addition, definitions of \u201cjujube\u201d contained in several English language dictionaries of general use were presented. Many of these publications secondarily define \u201cjujube\u201d in terms of a lozenge flavored to resemble the jujube fruit, while others secondarily define \u201cjujube\u201d merely as a fruit-flavored lozenge or gum drop.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This documentation clearly supports the conclusion that \u201cjujubes\u201d is a generic word defining a type of gum candy at both wholesale and retail levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Heide urges this court to respect the presumption of validity which attaches to trademark registration. But such presumption may, of course, be overcome by establishing the generic meaning of a registered mark. Flexitized, Inc. v. National Flexitized Corp., 335 F.2d 774, 779 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 913, 85 S.Ct. 899, 13 L.Ed.2d 799 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Heide also contends that in view of the fact that much of the evidence related to the generic meaning of \u201cjujubes\u201d is somewhat dated, and since its consumer-level use of the term has been exclusive for many years, a secondary meaning worthy of protection has evolved. We note initially, as Ziegler argues, that consumer packaging in the late 1920\u2019s may well be of sufficiently recent use to preclude exclusive appropriation of even a descriptive term for secondary meaning purposes. But more importantly, a generic term in circumstances such as those before us may not be exclusively appropriated as a trademark, regardless of the length of time it may have been used by a single distributor at the consumer level and despite whatever promotional effort he may have expended to exploit it. Application of Limestone Prods. Corp., 312 F.2d 825, 50 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1000, (1963); Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel &amp; Specialty Co., 290 F.2d 845, 48 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1004 (1961); Schulmerich Electronics, Inc. v. J. C. Deagan, Inc., 202 F.2d 772, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 857, (1953). Heide\u2019s consumer survey i. similarly unpersuasive in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Because of our disposition of the issue above, we do not reach the district court\u2019s further conclusion that Heide's \u201cJujubes\u201d mark was \u201cdeceptively misdescriptive.\u201d Ziegler did not request such a finding at the trial. There was no occasion for the district court to decide the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">In its cross-appeal Ziegler contends that it is undisputed that \u201cfruit ju jus\u201d has the generic meaning of gum candy in fruit shapes and flavors and that un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>der the applicable rule of law, embodied in section 33(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a manufacturer has the right to use a generically descriptive term to describe his product fairly and in good faith for the benefit of purchasers. It is then argued that since the district judge found \u201cno convincing evidence * * * that Ziegler used the mark Fruit Ju Jus with a fraudulent intent,\u201d it follows that \u201cfruit ju jus\u201d .cannot infringe Heide\u2019s rights in \u201cJujyfruits\u201d irrespective of its validity as a trademark and regardless of any similarity between \u201cJujyfruits\u201d and \u201cfruit ju jus.\u201d In effect, Ziegler concedes that Heide\u2019s registered trademark \u201cJujyfruits\u201d is valid and that \u201cconfusion, mistake, or deception\u201d is likely to occur if Ziegler continues to use \u201cfruit ju jus\u201d on its candies. This concession points up the sole question presented by Ziegler in its cross-appeal: whether \u201cfruit ju jus\u201d is merely a generically descriptive term and was fairly used as such rather than as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Contrary to Ziegler\u2019s assertion, we think that the district judge did make a finding with respect to the manner in which Ziegler used the term \u201cfruit ju jus.\u201d A fair reading of his opinion indicates that the judge found that Ziegler employed the term as a trademark. The evidence sustains the finding. Moreover, we are convinced that the district judge correctly concluded that the word \u201cju jus\u201d is not a generically descriptive term. For these reasons, Ziegler did not establish its defense under the provisions of section 33(b) of the Trademark Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-12\">.
