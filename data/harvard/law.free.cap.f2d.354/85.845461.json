He is a converter or wholesaler of blankets who either buys cloth and remnants and cuts them into blankets, or buys blankets directly from manufacturers for resale. Petitioner\u2019s blankets all bear his label when sold. Sometimes the labels are attached by petitioner\u2019s employees at his warehouse; on other occasions, petitioner sends his labels directly to manufacturers who attach them and \u201cdrop ship\u201d the blankets to the purchaser. Petitioner has been in business for approximately eight years. His volume of business was $725,000 in 1962, and $650,000 in 1963; he sold between 300,000 and 325,000 blankets in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Petitioner is charged with misbranding blankets in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 4(a) (1) and (2) of the Wool Products Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 68b(a) (1) and (2), which read in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">\u2014\u201c(a) A wool product shall be misbranded\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-16\">(1) If it is falsely or deceptively stamped, tagged, labeled, or otherwise identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-17\">(2) If a stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, or substitute therefor under section 68c of this title, is not on or affixed to the wool product and does not show\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-18\">(A) the percentage of the total fiber weight of the wool product, exclusive of ornamentation not exceeding 5 per centum of said total fiber weight, of (1) wool; (2) reprocessed wool; (3) reused wool; (4) each fiber other than wool if said percentage by weight of such fiber is 5 per centum or more; and (5) the aggregate of all other fibers * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">Four blankets, all purchased between May and July 1964, were received in evidence as proof of misbranding. The first blanket, Commission Exhibit #8, bore a Stanton Blanket Company label setting forth the fiber content as \u201c70% wool, 30% rayon.\u201d Tests showed the content to be 79.0% wool, 5.9% nylon, 1.0% viscose, 10.1% orlon and 3.5% other fibers. Two other blankets, Exhibits #17 and #22, bearing petitioner\u2019s labels setting forth their content as \u201c90% wool, 10% nylon\u201d were shown to contain 89.9% wool, 3.8% nylon, 0.5% viscose, 5.0% orlon (Exhibit #17) and 93.7% wool, 2.0% nylon, 4.3% other fibers (Exhibit #22), respectively. The label of the fourth blanket, Exhibit #29, bore petitioner\u2019s Wool Products Labeling Number and stated a fiber content of \u201c100% all wool.\u201d Subsequent tests showed the presence of 14.2% to 14.3% residue other than wool.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">A fifth blanket, Exhibit #35, was purchased on March 4, 1964, after the issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>anee of the complaint, as evidence of a \u201ccontinued violation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This blanket bore petitioner\u2019s label showing the fiber content to be \u201c100% all wool.\u201d Tests showed that the blanket was approximately 94.9% wool; it was conceded that this calculation \u201ccould be off in one area as much as two percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Thus, two of the blankets contained more wool than petitioner claimed. For reasons which will be developed later, we hold that understatement of the amount of wool was not a violation of the Wool Products Labeling Act. Two other blankets had less wool than was indicated on the label, but in both cases the variation was minimal. We hold that such minor variations fall within the purview of \u00a7 4(a) (2) (A) of the Act, which excuses \u201cunavoidable variations in manufacture.\u201d Therefore, only in the case of one blanket, Exhibit #29, did the overstatement of wool content represent a meaningful variation. Petitioner sold over one million blankets during the period under investigation. A deficiency in one of five blankets tested does not constitute substantial evidence of misbranding.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We also reject the Commission\u2019s argument that failure to indicate in exactly correct proportions the character of all non-wool fibers is a violation of the Wool Products Labeling Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The Commission also found that petitioner had engaged in false invoicing in violation of \u00a7 5(a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a) (1). The only evidence presented concerning the alleged violation was an invoice issued in connection with the sale of the first blanket, Exhibit #8. The invoice read \u201c70% wool, 30% nylon\u201d; petitioner\u2019s enclosed labels read \u201c70% wool, 30% rayon.\u201d The test results, already produced above, showed the blanket to be 79% wool, 5.9% nylon, 1.0% viscose, 10.1% orlon and 3.5% other fibers. We find that the single invoice upon which the alleged violation is predicated constitutes neither substantial evidence of misrepresentation nor satisfactory proof that the public interest has been adversely affected. We therefore set aside the order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">The purpose of the Wool Products Labeling Act is stated in its preamble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">\u201cAn Act to protect producers, manufacturers, distributors, and consumers from the <em>unrevealed presence of substitutes and mixtures </em>in spun, woven, knitted, felted, or <em>otherwise manufactured wool products </em>and for other purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">The legislative history makes it clear that, in passing this Act, Congress intended to protect consumers against the concealment of substitutes for wool in products claimed to be made wholly or partially of wool.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">Senator Wheeler of Montana, Chairman of the Senate Conference Committee on the bill, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-17\"><em>\u201cThe object of this bill is to protect the consumer as well as the producer of wool. </em>It is to protect the producer of wool, the sheepman and the producers of these other things (novelty fibers) <em>from the fraud that is perpetrated upon the consumer when he buys something that is marked \u2018all wool\u2019 or \u2018wool\u2019 when in effect, it is not wool, </em>because it has been chopped up into what in common parlance among manufacturers, is called shoddy.\u201d 86 Cong.Rec. 18174-75 (1941). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">Senator Thomas of Oklahoma, a major critic of the legislation, complained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-19\"><em>\u201c[W]e are now dealing with the subject of wool. </em>The purpose of the bill is to raise the price of wool. * * * I maintain that the bill is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>an anticotton bill. If the bill increases the demand for wool, it decreases the demand for products such as cotton, silk, rayon, nylon, and other substitutes for wool.\u201d 86 Cong.Rec. 12907, 12908 (1940). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">He was answered by Senator Chavez of New Mexico, who argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">\u201cI do not think Congress would be doing too much for the wool grower if it should pass a bill providing, in effect, that <em>if one asks for a wool blanket it shall be a wool blanket. That is all there is to the bill.\u201d </em>86 Cong.Rec. 12908 (1940).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Respondent contends that: (1) the Wool Products Labeling Act requires an accurate statement concerning <em>all </em>constituent fibers, not just wool, and (2) that an \u201cunderstatement of woolen content must violate the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">To substantiate its first contention, respondent points to \u00a7 4(a) (2) (A) of the Wool Products Labeling Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which declares a wool product to be misbranded when the label fails to disclose the percentage of total fiber weight of \u201ceach fiber other than wool\u201d that constitutes five percent or more of the total fiber weight of the product. But Congress could not have intended to encompass within the purview of this clause a situation in which wool, a superior fiber, is substituted for an inferior fiber. Congress by passing the Wool Products Labeling Act intended to protect the public against inferior wool substitutes; there is no hint in the legislative history that Congress wished to \u201cprotect\u201d the public against superior wool products. Clearly, the labeling requirement for inferior fibers is not applicable where the percentage of wool is underestimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">Similarly, if the percentage of wool is correctly stated, the Act is not concerned with the accuracy of statements about other constituent fibers. The Commission apparently concedes that designating all other fibers simply as \u201cman made fibers\u201d would be a sufficient compliance with the Act. Congress in passing the Act was not interested in labeling <em>per se, </em>its focus was on wool.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">Respondent argues that the understatement of wool content is itself a mislabeling within the meaning of the Act. But Congress clearly intended no such result. Where the amount of wool has been underestimated \u00a7\u00a7 4(a) (1) and (2) are inapplicable. As Bruckner, a Commission witness who has had eighteen years of experience in the trade,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> testified \u201ca high wool content is a mark of a better product in blankets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The wool content was overestimated by .1% in Exhibit #17, and by as low as 3.1% and a test average of 5.1% in Exhibit #35. Masterson, an expert witness for the Commission who had tested Exhibit #35, answered \u201cyes\u201d to a question about whether \u201cit could have had ninety-five percent wool,\u201d and testified that \u201c[Y]ou could be off in one area as much as two percent.\u201d Petitioner contends that there were \u201cunavoidable variations\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4(a) (2) (A) of the Wool Products Labeling Act, 15 U.S. C. \u00a7 68b(a) (2) (A). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Section 4(a) (2) (A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHh-\">\u201c[Djeviation of the fiber contents of the wool product from percentages stated on the stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, <em>shall not be misbranding </em>under this section if the person charged with misbranding proves <em>such deviation resulted from unavoidable variations in manufacture </em>and despite the exercise of due care to make accurate the statements on such stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Congress in passing this provision recognized that some reasonable tolerance would have to be allowed in the manufacturing process and wished to protect manufacturers and wholesalers against the imposition of impossible burdens. See Beacon Manufacturing Company, 46 F.T.C. 1073 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The Commission argues that 5% is the maximum variance contemplated by this section, and that a showing of due care is necessary before the section can become applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Even if we assume that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4(a) (2) (A) is correct, petitioner\u2019s defense of \u201cunavoidable variation\u201d must be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Exhibit #17 is within the assumed maximum variation, and, we believe, the uncertainty as to the exact percentage of variance in Exhibit #35 must be resolved in favor of a finding that that blanket is also within the \u201cmaximum.\u201d Petitioner has shown due care by spot checking about 10% of his products and by performing extra tests when he believes his purchases to be mislabeled. Those blankets that are \u201cdrop shipped,\u201d and consequently never seen by petitioner, are purchased from large, reputable manufacturers in the United States. As to these, petitioner testified \u201cgreat care is taken so that whatever the manufacturer\u2019s label says, that\u2019s what our label says\u201d (R. 7). The Commission made no attempt to refute the testimony as to the care used in the labeling of wool.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Petitioner sold between 300,000 and 325,000 blankets in 1963, and over 1,000,-000 blankets during the period under investigation. The Commission\u2019s original blanket sample was small. In the case of only one of the five blankets tested, Exhibit #29, did the petitioner\u2019s overestimation of wool content violate the statute. This does not constitute substantial evidence of misbranding.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">The only evidence introduced in support of the Commission\u2019s allegations concerning violations of \u00a7 5(a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S. C. \u00a7 45(a) (1), was a single invoice, involving one transaction. The invoice contained statements representing petitioner\u2019s blankets to be \u201c70% wool, 30% nylon.\u201d Petitioner testified that the invoice had read \u201c30% nylon\u201d instead of \u201c30% rayon\u201d due to a typographical error by his secretary. This testimony was corroborated both by the fact that the consumer, Medical Service Company, had ordered \u201c30% rayon\u201d blankets and by petitioner\u2019s labels, attached to each blanket, stating \u201c70% wool, 30% rayon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">We have already decided the variations shown in the composition of Exhibit #8, the blanket described in the invoice, do not violate the Wool Products Labeling Act. For the same reasons, we find that the variations between the content of Exhibit #8 as described in the invoice and as found after testing do not constitute satisfactory proof that the present proceeding is in \u201cthe interest of the public\u201d as required by \u00a7 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the single invoice does not provide substantial evidence of \u201cdeceptive acts or practices.\u201d- \u00a7 5(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Since there is no indication that additional evidence would be available to the Commission on remand, we set aside the order. See Rayex Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm., 317 F.2d 290, 295 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In view of our disposition of the case, we need not pass upon the other points raised by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Order set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">. Commission investigator Posniek testified to the purchase of a sixth blanket, on March 10, 1965, for the purpose of showing continued violation. However, preliminary tests on this blanket, labeled \u201c100% all wool,\u201d showed no misbranding and the blanket was never introduced into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-11\">. Senator Johnson of Colorado, a leading proponent of the bill and a member of both the Committee on Interstate Commerce, which reported out the bill, and the Senate Conference Committee, summarized the bill as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">\u201cIn general the purposes of the Wool Products Labeling Act are to minimize or prevent the concealing of adulterants and inferior substitutes in cloth and wearing apparel, and to give consumers of such articles an opportunity to know what they are buying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At-\">* * * The honest manufacturer of fabrics must and does meet the price of his unethical competitors. If they sell a cheap substitute for the real thing at a low price he must be realistic and match that price. This legislation will protect the honest manufacturer who wants to put out quality goods. No longer will he have to meet the unfair competition of the fellow who sells shoddy wool for pure wool. * * * When he (the consumer) buys a pure wool suit he wants it to be wool and not shoddy or some other substitutes for wool. That is the basis for the so-called wool products labeling bill. * * * This bill merely stops the racket of selling such inferior substitutes as virgin wool.\u201d 86 Appendix to the Cong.Rec. 6053-54 (1940).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-23\">.
