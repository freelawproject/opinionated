In its answer, the Board petitions for enforcement. The Board found, as did the Trial Examiner, that the Company violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by discharging Alice Davis because of her union activities. It also found that the Company violated Section (8) (1) by coercively interrogating employees Davis, and Rosalie Sublett.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">Alice Davis began working as a Clerk in the Company\u2019s Freeport, Texas store in 1956. A few weeks later she was made: Head Cashier, a position which she held' for seven years. In April of 1963, the Company laid off a checker and advised! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Davis that because of a decline in business, Store Manager Roddy would assume her duties as head cashier, and she would work exclusively as a checker. On May 20, 1963, Lawrence Smallwood replaced Roddy as the Manager of the store, and Smallwood gave the job of cashier to his wife. Subsequently, when asked to help Mrs. Smallwood with her duties as cashier, employee Davis informed Smallwood that she would cooperate in every way possible, but that she might not be in Texas much longer, and that she might like to transfer to Mississippi, her home state, at some future date. The next day (May 21st) when Davis told two employees of a nearby unionized store (Neisner\u2019s) that they were having difficulties with their new manager, one of these employees suggested that A &amp; P store needed a union. Davis inquired as to how this could be accomplished and was advised that all that was needed was to get the employees to sign authorization cards for the union. Store Manager Smallwood observed this conversation from 10 to 15 feet distance. After her conversation with the two Neisner\u2019s employees, Davis began \u201ctalking union\u201d with various of the A &amp; P employees. Sometime between May 21st and June 1st, Davis discussed the subject with Assistant Store Manager Munson.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">On May 29th, while Davis was checking groceries, Lindsey, Matthews and Vaughn \u2014 all employees of Neisner\u2019s\u2014 took their purchases to her station. When Lindsey asked Davis what the A &amp; P employees had done about the union, Davis said she was waiting for the authorization cards and would distribute them if Lindsey brought them in. Shortly afterwards, Smallwood, who had been standing about four feet away at another checkout counter, approached Davis and asked her what she had decided about a transfer. Davis explained to him that there was a good chance that her husband, who previously had been laid off by Dow Chemical, might be recalled and that \u201cwe don\u2019t know what we are going to do yet.\u201d She further stated that if they should decide upon a transfer \u201cI will give you a two-week notice before I ask for a transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">On May 31, 1963, the Company area supervisor, Read, came to Freeport and spoke to Smallwood. Sometime later Read approached Davis, who was price-marking some cigarettes, and inquired of her \u201chow she felt about union labor.\u201d Davis told Read that she was \u201cfor union labor one hundred percent. If it wasn\u2019t for the unions, everybody would be working for chicken feed and eating with the chickens.\u201d Read turned around, went back to the meat counter and continued his conversation with Smallwood. Employee Ethel Smith, who was working in the meat department, was only ten feet away from Read and Smallwood when they engaged in this conversation. Smith overheard one of the participants in the conversation mention something \u201cabout the union\u201d and \u201cabout Mississippishe then heard one of them say \u201cget rid of her.\u201d Smith deliberately attempted to overhear this conversation when she heard the word \u201cunion\u201d mentioned because she \u201cknew there was talk in the store of organizing a' union.\u201d The next day, June 1st, Davis went to the office to have her cash register checked. After sacking her money, Smallwood placed a termination notice on her tray. When Davis inquired \u201cwhat on earth is going on\u201d Smallwood told her to read the notice. Davis read the back of the notice which contained the following handwritten entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">\u201cOn the 5-20-63 this clerk informed me that she would not be working for us in Freeport, Texas, much longer. She stated that she planned to move to Mississippi. I believe it best to replace her while I have an experienced checker available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">After reading this notice, Davis told Smallwood that she had never told him she was quitting or that she wanted to transfer yet. Smallwood replied that she was \u201cfree to transfer now.\u201d She requested a copy of her termination notice but Smallwood refused to give her one. Davis then signed her time card and left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>On August 12,1963, about six weeks after Davis was discharged, she met Mun-son for coffee. During this meeting, Davis asked Munson, among other things, the reason for her discharge. Munson at first avoided the question, but as they were leaving Munson told her that she had been terminated \u201cbecause she was talking union talk in the store and was talking about moving back to Mississippi.\u201d Mrs. Preston Miller was present during this conversation and testified that Munson told Davis not once, but twice, that \u201che told him that he terminated her because she was talking union talk in the store and was talking about moving back to Mississippi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Employee Rosalie Sublett replaced Davis as a checker after her discharge on June 1st. During the latter part of July, Sublett was approached by Smallwood who inquired \u201cwhat the union talk was about and what was going on:\u201d Sublett replied that she did not know, and when Smallwood asked her who had talked to her about the union, Sublett refused to give him any names.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The Board\u2019s order requires the Company to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found, and from, in any like or related manner, interfering with its employee\u2019s rights under the Act. Affirmatively, the Board\u2019s order requires the Company to offer reinstatement to Davis, to make her whole for any loss of pay she may have suffered, and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">It would be little, if any, benefit to discuss the numerous cases cited by the litigants. This is so because each decision turns upon its particular facts. In our recitation of the facts here, it should be pointed out that the Company\u2019s witnesses denied almost every fact upon which the Board\u2019s decision was based and related a substantially different account of the events leading up to Davis\u2019 discharge. In earlier decisions, we characterized \u201creinstatement with back pay\u201d as being in the nature of a penalty, and have said, in essence, that in reinstatement cases the Board should accept the employer\u2019s explanation, if the evidence gives equal support to it, because the employer is under oath and knows the real cause of discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The Supreme Court, in N.L.R.B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., 1962, 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829, eliminated any residual doubt from these decisions by holding categorically that \u201cthere is no place in the statutory scheme for one test of the substantiality of evidence in reinstatement cases and another test in other cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> The only issue here is whether the findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. We cannot disturb the Board\u2019s choice if there is a fair conflict between the employer\u2019s testimony and a reasonable inference of discrimination. N.L.R.B. v. Florida Citrus Canners\u2019 Co-op., 5 Cir. 1963, 311 F.2d 541; N.L.R.B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., 5 Cir. 1963, 322 F.2d 187. The Board is not compelled to accept the employer\u2019s statement when there is reasonable cause for believing that the ground put forward by the employer was not the true one, and that the real reason was the employer\u2019s dissatisfaction with the employee\u2019s union activity. N.L.R.B. v. Texas Bolt Co., 5 Cir., 313 F.2d 761. When faced with a review of findings, pegged on witness credibility, courts have generally held that a determination of credibility by the N.L.R.B. is not to be reversed unless there is uncontrovertible evidence to the contrary. N.L.R.B. v. Dixie Gas Co., 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 433; N.L.R.B. v. Camco, Inc., 5 Cir. 1965, 340 F.2d 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Our conclusion is that the findings of the Board are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-27\">.
