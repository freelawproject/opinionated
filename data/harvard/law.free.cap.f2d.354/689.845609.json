His petition asserted, among other things, that he had been deprived of federal constitutional rights by being denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of a refusal of continuance at the time of his state trial on a robbery armed charge. He alleged that his privately retained counsel was forced to try his case the same day that he was hired, and within ten minutes thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The District Judge denied the petition without hearing saying, \u201cThe facts stated in support of this contention are not sufficient to establish it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">This court\u2019s review of this record indicates that the petition claims a constitutional violation which merits a hearing as to the facts alleged.
