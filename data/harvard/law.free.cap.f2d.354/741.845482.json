The evidence on this issue was ample to support the jury\u2019s verdict and if this were all there was to the case it would be unnecessary for us to consider it further. But during rhe same period appellant also received payments for certain days of service as an Air Force reserve officer. The judge charged the jury that they should convict the appellant if they found that he had made false statements with respect to <em>either </em>the payments made to him by National Exhaust <em>or </em>by the Air Force. If the two issues had been submitted to the jury separately, as, of course, they could have been, see Rule 49, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there would now be no difficulty with the verdict. But since the two issues were presented in the alternative, it is impossible to ascertain the exact basis for appellant\u2019s conviction. The jury may have found him guilty only with respect to the Air Force payments. In order to uphold the result in the lower court we must find, therefore, that the conviction is supportable on the ground that appellant\u2019s statements with respect to the Air Force payments were violative of the statute. Stromberg v. People of State of California, 283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Appellant lived in Yonkers, New York and filed his claims for unemployment compensation with the Yonkers office of the New York State Department of Labor. Payments were made, however, and eligibility determined by the State of Connecticut where appellant had been most recently employed at the time he applied for unemployment compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claim forms that appellant filled out and submitted were forwarded to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The first issue that we must consider is whether the jury could properly find that appellant\u2019s periods of military service were \u201cwork\u201d and the payments received by reason of such service were \u201cwages\u201d earned within the meaning of Question 9 on the claim forms. The meaning of these terms is not, for the purposes of this case, to be found in a dictionary definition or in any technical or legal usage. What we are interested in is the meaning that Robbins was justified in attaching to them. \u201cTo work\u201d is, in general usage, to have employment, to have a job. But no one, we believe, would be likely to reply affirmatively to the question whether he was employed or had a job if his only \u201cwork\u201d consisted of a few hours a month of reserve duty. In everyday speech \u201cwages\u201d are earned by reason of employment. One is paid wages if he \u201cworks\u201d and has a \u201cjob.\u201d Robbins might well not have considered payments received for reserve service as wages earned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The vagueness or ambiguity of the question makes it impossible, in our opinion, to hold that Robbins\u2019 answers were knowingly false.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">As a matter of fact it appears that in Connecticut (as well as in New York) there is a serious question as to whether payments for service in the reserves would have made appellant ineligible for unemployment compensation. We cannot say, on the basis of the material available to us, that they would have. If such payments would not have made appellant ineligible, then his negative answer to Question 9 is not material as far as payments for reserve service are concerned. Therefore, by failing to establish that revealing the payments for reserve service would have resulted in ineligibility, the government has failed to establish one of the express requirements for a finding of violation of the statute under which conviction was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Moreover, if the assumption adopted in the last paragraph is mistaken and if Connecticut would have held appellant ineligible for unemployment compensation by reason of the payments he received for reserve service, appellant\u2019s answer to Question 9 still could not be held to be knowingly false. Even the authorities available to us leave us completely in doubt as to the position Connecticut would take. If the question be read, as it should be read, to ask whether the claimant had done any work or earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>any wages which would change his eligibility for unemployment compensation, the government has failed to establish that appellant\u2019s answers are knowingly false with respect to reserve service and payments therefor, because appellant could not know or ascertain whether payments of this type would make him ineligible, nor could the jury, on the testimony submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In view of our disposition of the case, we need not pass upon the other points raised by appellant. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\">. Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400m (c) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">\u201c[T]he terms and conditions of the State law * * * under which an individual most recently exhausted his rights shall apply to his claim for temporary extended unemployment compensation and to the payment thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">. My dissenting colleague relies extensively on the words \u201cother payments in any form\u201d in the phrase \u201cany BOARD and ROOM, TIPS, or any OTHER PAYMENTS in any form.\u201d The language used suggests to me that \u201cother payments in any form\u201d is intended, like board and room and tips, to refer to goods or services received in lieu of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">The testimony of Dwyer, to which my dissenting colleague refers, is in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aor\">\u201cThe Witness: * * * I asked him why he hadn\u2019t come in to submit his claim the week before, and he said that he had traveled to Robins Air Force Base in Georgia to get back on active duty \u2014 this is as I recall it \u2014 as an Air Force colonel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIs\">He explained that he was a colonel in the Air Force, he was trying to get on active duty, and that was the reason he didn\u2019t come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtT\">In the course of the interview I asked him if he received pay, military pay for this service, and he said no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An2\">It seems to me quite clear that the witness asked Robbins whether he was paid for traveling to the Air Force base in Georgia and back. It is practically certain that Robbins\u2019 answer to this question was truthful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b836-7\">MEDINA, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AtD\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">I concur but solely on the ground that, in the context of legislation providing benefits for the unemployed, the performance of military reserve service is not \u201cwork\u201d and the payments received by reason of such service are not \u201cwages of any kind.\u201d Therefore, the answers were not \u201cfalse statements\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C., Section 1400s(a). This remains true, in my opinion, even if a New York or Connecticut administrative agency ruled that an applicant was or was not to be disqualified from receiving benefits if he had received, during the period in question, sums of money for the performance of reserve military service. I see no distinction between jury service and the performance of military reserve service. Serving on juries, again in the context of legislation providing benefits for the unemployed, is not \u201cwork\u201d nor are jury fees \u201cwages of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Moreover, a conviction for having made a false statement that turns out not to be false cannot stand, even if the person convicted thought the statement was false when he made it.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b836-10\">KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AEKk\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">When Robbins applied for unemployment compensation, he was given an information booklet which he admitted reading. In part, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">Each time you report to file a claim you MUST inform the clerk of any EARNINGS which you had during the week or weeks for which you are claiming benefits. This includes <em>in addition to wages, </em>any BOARD and ROOM, TIPS, or <em>any OTHER PAYMENTS in any form </em>which you receive for having worked. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">In response to Question 9 on the information form: \u201cDuring the week claimed * * * did you work or earn wages of any kind?\u201d; he answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-16\">Robbins answered Question 9 falsely within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400s (a). Robbins was aware from the question asked and the information he had been given that the authorities were seeking to determine if he had sufficient other income to disqualify him from receiving unemployment compensation. While I agree that there is no dictionary to tell us if military reserve compensation is paid for \u201cwork,\u201d it seems to me that given the broad disclosure purpose of the question asked of Robbins, he must have understood that with the exception of very limited exemptions, he was directed to report <em>all </em>of his income other than gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-17\">Furthermore, Robbins\u2019 negative response to Question 9 was not merely false, it was materially false. Under the applicable Connecticut law, it is unclear whether reserve duty payments disqualify the recipient from unemployment compensation. It may well be that it would be preferable for the Connecticut authorities to determine this with finality; but, Robbins\u2019 false statement eliminated this issue from consideration when his application was processed. Robbins\u2019 misstatement was therefore material; it deprived the Connecticut Department of Labor of the opportunity to decide, in assessing his eligibility, whether military payments disqualify an applicant from obtaining unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Moreover, when we view the government\u2019s evidence in its most favorable light, as we must on appeal, United States v. Robbins, 340 F.2d 684 (2d Cir. 1965); United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 836, 84 S.Ct. 74, 11 L.Ed.2d 65 (1963), the pattern of Robbins\u2019 evasiveness takes on real meaning. It is relevant, therefore, to note that Dwyer, an unemployment insurance claims examiner in the Yonkers office of the New York State Department of Labor, testified that, <em>\u201cIn </em>the course of the interview I asked him [Robbins] if he received pay, military pay for this service, <em>and he said no.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This negative response to Dwyer\u2019s question demonstrates Robbins\u2019 firm determination to conceal these payments despite the fact that Dwyer considered them so pertinent as to merit specific inquiry. In addition, at trial, the government shattered what appears to be a flagrant attempt at deception. Despite the testimony on direct examination of an employee of National Exhaust Purifier Company that payments to Robbins were not wages but made in satisfaction of a \u201cloan,\u201d on cross, she acknowledged typing minutes of a Board of Director\u2019s meeting containing the resolution that \u201cColonel G. B. Robbins * * * be put on the payroll of the corporation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In light of this evidence, I believe it is unfortunate but not fatal in this case that the jury was charged to determine Robbins\u2019 guilt on the basis of two failures to report earnings without being required to specify whether he lied as to both or only as to one. The jury could have properly convicted Robbins on either ground. There is abundant evidence demonstrating his effort to conceal in excess of $3,000 in salary at a time when he was also receiving the less than insignificant sum of over $400 for active and inactive reserve duty. These facts confirm the existence of a preconceived, deliberate and common plan to perpetrate this not insubstantial fraud upon the Connecticut Department of Labor by withholding any income or payments, no matter what their source. We are not dealing with a case of the casual omission of a \u201cjury fee.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
