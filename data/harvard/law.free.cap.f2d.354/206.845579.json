He is charged, inter alia, with having conspired to smuggle heroin into the United States from various other nations. The indictment alleges some 54 overt acts committed by various persons in furtherance of the conspiracy, two of which are alleged to have been committed by Miller in Connecticut. One of the principal such overt acts was that of a fellow-conspirator who entered the Southern District at Laredo from the Republic of Mexico with 76 pounds of the narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Miller filed numerous motions in the District Court, one of which was a motion to transfer the proceedings against him to the District Court for .the District of Connecticut. The Honorable Ben C. Connally denied said motion, and Miller has now petitioned this Court for a Writ of Mandamus and/or Prohibition directing the transfer. His petition is based on the following grounds: (1) Under Article III, Section 2, Clause 3 and the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution he has a right to be tried in Connecticut, since the indictment indicates that he committed the offense there. (2) Since 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 is basically a \u201ctax statute,\u201d and he resides in Connecticut, the provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3237(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>require that he be tried there. (3) In view of the allegations that part of the alleged conspiracy took place outside of the United States, and the fact that he was arrested in Connecticut, he has a right under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3238<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to be tried in Connecticut. (4) The trial judge grossly abused the discretion vested in him by Rule 21 F.R.Crim.P.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in refusing to transfer the case, because of (a) the burdensome inconvenience and expense of his having to come from Connecticut to be tried in Texas; and (b) alleged adverse publicity created by the previous convictions of fellow-conspirators there.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Writs of Mandamus and Prohibition are granted sparingly. Such writs are \u201creserved for really extraordinary causes,\u201d Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 260, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041, 2043 (1947), and should be issued only when the right to such relief is \u201cclear and undisputable.\u201d United States ex rel. Bernards v. Du ell, 172 U.S. 576, 582,19 S.Ct. 286, 43 L.Ed. 559, 561 (1899). To some extent they are supervisory in nature and are used \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, 319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 941, 87 L.Ed. 1185, 1190 (1943). They are not to be used as a substitute for an appeal, or to \u201ccontrol the decision of the trial court\u201d in discretionary matters. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379, 383, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106, 111 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">We conclude that the Writ of Mandamus or Prohibition should not issue, and the petition therefor is hereby denied. The trial judge has not exceeded his jurisdiction or refused to exercise his authority in circumstances requiring him to do so. No unusual or extraordinary circumstances are present which otherwise require the issuance of the Writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">As a general proposition, petitioner has the constitutional right to be tried in the state where the offense was committed. However, it has long been held that a conspiracy may be prosecuted in any district where an overt act was committed. Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 32 S.Ct. 793, 56 L.Ed. 1114; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Downing v. United States (5 Cir. 1965) 348 F.2d 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that Sections 3237(b) and 3238 of Title 18 U.S. C.A. give him the right to be tried within the District of Connecticut borders on frivolity. Even if the offense charged be considered as \u201can offense described in section 7201 or 7206(1), (2), or (5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 * * the indictment mentions absolutely nothing concerning \u201cthe use of the mails,\u201d as required by Section 3237(b). Nor is it an offense \u201ccommitted upon the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular State * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The petitioner\u2019s contention that the trial judge so abused his discretion as to require the issuance of the Writs is answered by the recent decision in Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240, 245, 84 S.Ct. 769, 11 L.Ed. 2d 674, 679 (1964), where the Court expressly disapproved a \u201cde novo\u201d examination of the record or exercise of the power of discretion by the Court of Appeals itself in mandamus proceedings. It is our opinion that a review of the correct standards used in considering transfer under Rule 21 is a matter ordinarily and more properly to be considered on direct appeal. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, supra. In any event, the burden of proving the allegations of the indictment is on the Government and any errors committed during the trial are subject to review upon direct appeal. We find no merit in any of the contentions of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-17\">.

The following is from the memorandum ruling of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">\u201cMiller\u2019s motion to transfer to Connecticut is based upon \u00a7\u00a7 3237 and 3238 of Title 18, U.S.C.A. He contends that 3237 (b) is controlling and that the present offense is one which \u2018involves use of the mails and is an offense described in Section 7201 * <em>* </em>* of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954\u2019; or that under 3238 it is an offense \u2018begun or committed upon the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or District,\u2019. The short answer to this contention is that the indictment does not allege an offense involving use of the mails or one described in Section 7201 of Title 18 [sic] (Title 26), U.S.C.A.; nor is it one begun or committed upon the high seas, etc. Rather, it is an offense as described in 3237 (a) of Title 18 \u2018continued, or completed\u2019 in this District, where one of the overt acts is alleged to have transpired. E.g.r United States v. Sea-graves, 265 F.2d 876 (3rd Cir. 1959); Kott v. United States, 163 F.2d 984 (5th Cir. 1947). Such motion to transfer is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
