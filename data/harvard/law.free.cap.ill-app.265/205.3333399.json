The action is based upon a policy of insurance issued by defendant, dated March 23, 1928, and headed \u201cUniversal Standard Workmen\u2019s Compensation Policy. \u2019 \u2019 There was a jury trial during March, 1931, resulting in a verdict and judgment against defendant for $3,499.61, and the present appeal followed. .</p> <p id=\"b232-11\" pgmap=\"232(49) 233(321)\">Plaintiff\u2019s declaration consisted of one special count, to which defendant filed a plea of the general issue.

No evidence was introduced by plaintiff showing that any attempt ever was made to commence proceedings before the industrial commission or to have an award made by it. And the only attempt made by plaintiff to show damages sustained by her was by the witness Dan Wilson, who then was, and had been since 1915, the chief clerk of the Illinois Industrial Commission. He testified that he had had 15 years\u2019 experience \u201cin computing lump sum, settlements\u201d in connection with his other general- duties, and that he had with him \u201ccertain tables,\u201d which give information \u201cas to the value of the dollar for a certain number of weeks based upon 3 per cent interest, with annual rests.\u201d He then was asked the following questions:</p> <blockquote id=\"b244-5\" pgmap=\"244\">\u201cQ. Assume a death award based on earnings in excess of $2,500, a dependent widow, no children, and the death occurring on January 18, 1929, can you compute for us the amount of an award based upon those conditions?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b244-6\" pgmap=\"244\">\u201cQ. Assume' that the award under such circumstances would be $3,750, can you compute for us how many weeks\u2019 instalments at $14 per week would have been due on May 25, 1929, \u2014 the date the present suit was started?\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b244-7\" pgmap=\"244\">The court (properly in our opinion) sustained objections to both questions. Thereupon, with the court\u2019s permission and in the presence and hearing of the jury, plaintiff\u2019s attorney made the following offer, also objected to by defendant\u2019s attorney:</p> <blockquote id=\"b244-8\" pgmap=\"244\">\u201cI offer to prove by this witness that, based upon an award of $3,750, there would be on May 25, 1929, 18 weeks\u2019 compensation due at $14 per week, making a total sum of $252. Further, that the present value as of that date, computed on the basis of interest at 3 per cent per annum, would have been $3,484; that the measure of plaintiff\u2019s damages in this suit would have been that sum, plus $252, ... or a total of $3,736.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b244-9\" pgmap=\"244\">\u201cQ. What is-that figure, Mr. Wilson?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b244-10\" pgmap=\"244\">\u201cA. $3,499.61; .' . . that takes into consideration the discount: . . . -</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b245-3\" pgmap=\"245\">\u201cQ.

The discount amounts to $236.39.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b245-5\" pgmap=\"245\">It will be noticed that the net figure given by Mr. Wilson during the refused offer of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, $3,499.61, is the exact amount of the verdict, as subsequently returned by the jury, and upon which the court entered the judgment appealed from.</p> <p id=\"b245-6\" pgmap=\"245(259) 246(349) 247(112)\">The main contention here urged by defendant\u2019s counsel is that the superior court, in proceedings upon a workmen\u2019s compensation policy of insurance, has no jurisdiction to determine any question arising under the Illinois Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and that the judgment appealed from cannot stand. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the other hand, contend in substance that plaintiff\u2019s action is in assumpsit and predicated upon a policy of accident insurance, and that the fact (viz., that the policy includes by reference the provisions of the Illinois Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act) does not make the present action a proceeding under that act. And counsel argue in their brief that \u201cthe effect of the indorsement\u201d on the policy sued upon (viz., that the policy be extended to injuries and/or death suffered by Morris) \u201cwas nothing more or less than to make the policy in question, as far as Morris was concerned, purely an accident policy covering him against \u00e1ccidental injuries and/or death arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d After considering the provisions of the policy sued upon, including said indorsement and the other indorsements, and the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, we cannot agree with plaintiff\u2019s counsels\u2019 contention or argument. It appears that about the time the indorsements were made on the policy sued upon, another workmen\u2019s compensation policy was issued to the Lime Co. for whom Morris worked as a hired truck owner for the hauling of its materials'. By the indorsements on the policy sued upon we think it is clear that it was the intention of both Morris and the defendant that Morris should be considered as an employee and, if injured, while delivering materials in his own truck, entitled to recover compensation under and in accordance with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. And we are of the opinion, considering the evidence and the policy sued upon and the provision of said act, that defendant\u2019s counsels\u2019 main contention has substantial merit. In Mehay v. Industrial Commission, 316 111. 97, 103, it is said: \u201cWhether the claimant has sustained accidental injuries and whether a disability of the claimant is the result of an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment are questions of fact to be determined in the first instance by the Industrial Commission. ...\u201d In Peters Mach. Co. v. Industrial Commission, 346 Ill. 403, 407, similar language is used, and it is also said: \u201cWhere the decision of the \u2022 Industrial Commission is clearly against the manifest weight of the evidence, or where it is based upon incompetent evidence, the court should set aside the award.\u201d In Kudla v. Industrial Commission, 336 Ill. 279, 281, it is said: \u201cThe writ of certiorari au-. thorized by this section (paragraph f of section 19 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act) is the only method provided for the review of decisions of the Industrial Commission. . . . The writ of certiorari, by which the circuit court is given power to review the award of the Industrial Commission in cases under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, is wholly statutory, and in the exercise of the special statutory jurisdiction conferred upon circuit courts in such case's, they act not by virtue of their general jurisdiction but as courts of special and limited jurisdiction, and their, powers are limited by the provisions of the statute. - Their authority to make any order must be found in the terms of the statute.\u201d In view of these holdings of our Su-, preme Court and the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, particularly sections 6, 7, 18, 19, 26 and 28 as above outlined, and holding as we do that the policy sued upon is a workmen\u2019s compensation policy, we think it clear that the Industrial Commission alone had jurisdiction in the 'first instance to pass upon plaintiff\u2019s claim as stated in her declaration. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel also argue in their brief that \u201cthe Industrial Commission had no jurisdiction to construe the contract in question and to determine whether or not the widow of Morris (plaintiff) had or had not anything coming by reason of said contract.\u201d We think that counsel misconstrue the act, or fail to realize the intent and force thereof, particularly the sections last above mentioned.</p> <p id=\"b247-4\" pgmap=\"247\">Defendant\u2019s counsel also contend (1) that plaintiff did not show by competent evidence that Morris \u2019 death was caused by accidental injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment; (2) that the court committed prejudicial error in admitting over objection certain medical testimony; and (3) that there is no basis in the evidence for the amount of the damages awarded by the jury. In view of our holdings and decision on counsels\u2019 main contention it is unnecessary for us to discuss these other contentions.</p> <p id=\"b247-5\" pgmap=\"247\">Our conclusion is that the superior court was without jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon plaintiff\u2019s claim and erred in entering the judgment appealed from. Accordingly the judgment is reversed without remandment of the cause.</p> <p id=\"b247-6\" pgmap=\"247\">Reversed.</p> <p id=\"b247-7\" pgmap=\"247\">Keener, J., concurs.</p> <p id=\"b247-8\" pgmap=\"247\">Scanlan, J., dissents.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b247-9\" pgmap=\"247\">Mr. Justice Scanlan</author> <p id=\"AI_W\" pgmap=\"247(52) 248(338) 249(274)\">dissenting: As I read the record the opinion of the majority of this court does not fully state the position of the - defendant. When the plaintiff, in the trial court, offered the policy in evidence, the following occurred: \u201cMr. Potter (attorney for defendant): I am not objecting to the authenticity of the document or its execution. I object to it as immaterial, irrelevant and incompetent in that by reason of uncertainty it is a void contract and because the Court has no jurisdiction of the remedy and by reason of the uncertainty of amount involved there could1 be no judgment upon it.\u201d In its argument that the superior court was without jurisdiction to pass upon the claim involved in the instant suit, the defendant does not concede that the plaintiff could have obtained relief in a proceeding before the Industrial Commission. On the contrary, it boldly states, \u201cThat anything is due to the plaintiff under that law (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law) is disputed.\u201d The defendant strenuously contends that even if the plaintiff had treated the policy as a workmen\u25a0\u2019s compensation policy of insurance and had pursued her remedy before the Industrial Commission, nevertheless, she could not have recovered under the policy, for the reason that the deceased was an employer and therefore he could not occupy the position of an employee within the contemplation of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The defendant argues that \u201cany attempt of the parties to the contract to provide for the payment of compensation to the person named in the policy as an employer upon the theory that he was his own employee, not only \u2018borders on the ridiculous, \u2019 but is a palpable attempt to extend the terms and application of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which, in the language of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, cannot be so \u2018enlarged, restricted or modified, \u2019 \u201d and in the oral argument before us the defendant contended that the policy was void because in contravention of the statute. In support of this contention it cited Lyle v. H. R. Lyle Cider &amp; Vinegar Co., 243 N. Y. 257 (decided July, 1926); Porter v. Industrial Commission, 173 Wis. 267 (decided February 8, 1921); and Porter v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., 188 Wis. 638 (decided Jan. 12, 1926), which seem to sustain the contention that an employer cannot be an employee within the contemplation of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts of the respective. States. The policy in the instant case was issued March 23, 1928, and the defendant must be presumed to have known the law which it now cites when it issued the policy. It characterizes the policy as a ridiculous attempt of the parties to run counter to the Act. It would be a reasonable conclusion from the defendant\u2019s argument that it knowingly issued what it assumed to be a policy void under the Act. The defendant then advances a contention, inconsistent with the former one, that in the present case the plaintiff\u2019s right of action, if any she have, \u201ccould only be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law and not by a suit in the first instance in the Superior Court of Cook County,\u201d and this contention is strenuously argued. The defendant also contends that the policy is a void one and recovery under the same would therefore be impossible in any forum. The decision of the majority of this court, upholding the contention that the superior court was without jurisdiction to pass- upon the claim of the plaintiff, especially in view of- the position of the defendant, does not accord with my sense of justice. The plaintiff\u2019s action is in assumpsit, and it is not based upon the theory that the defendant was bound under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. It is a suit to recover the amount the plaintiff claims to be due her under an alleged policy of insurance. \u25a0</p> <p id=\"b249-4\" pgmap=\"249(69) 250(357) 251(260)\">In Healey v. Mutual Acc. Ass\u2019n of the Northwest, 133 Ill. 556, 561, the court quotes with approval the following: \u201c \u2018No rule in the interpretation of a policy is more fully established, or more imperative and controlling, than that which declares that in all eases it must be liberally construed in favor of the insured, so as not to defeat, without a plain necessity, his claim to the indemnity which, in making the insurance, it was his object to secure. When the words are, without violence, susceptible of two interpretations, that which will sustain his claim and cover the loss must, in preference, be adopted.\u2019 May on Insurance (2d ed.) sec. 175.\u201d (See also Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Dunlap, 160 Ill. 642, 646.) In Julius v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 299 Ill. 343, 348, it is said: \u201cIf there is any ambiguity in an insurance policy it is the fault of the insurance company. It prepares the contract and the language used in the contract is its language. If that language is susceptible of two interpretations, that one will be -adopted which is most favorable to the insured in order to indemnify him for the loss he has sustained.\u201d (See also Wilkinson v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 240 Ill. 205; Clarke &amp; Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 220 Ill. App. 576; Goetz v. Continental Casualty Co., 245 Ill. App. 350, 356.) \u201cIt is a cardinal principle of insurance law that a policy or contract of insurance is to be construed liberally in favor of insured and strictly as against the company. Stated more fully, the rule is that, where, by reason of ambiguity in the language employed in a policy or contract of insurance, there is doubt or uncertainty as to its meaning and it is fairly susceptible of two interpretations, one favorable to insured and the other favorable to the company, the former will be adopted. Similar statements of this rule have been repeatedly reiterated in numerous decisions of the courts.\u201d (32 O. J. 1152.) In support of this statement of the law the editor cites a great many cases from the various states. Numerous Illinois cases are cited. \u201cContracts of insurance should be liberally construed to accomplish the purpose for which they are made.\u201d (Ib.) \u201cInsurance or indemnity against loss, being the object and purpose of the contract, the courts will construe it, when possible, so as to effectuate this purpose and so as to uphold rather than defeat or.avoid, the contract.\u201d (Id. 1150; Weisguth v. Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, 194 Ill. App. 17, affirmed in 272 Ill. 541.) \u201cNo one can doubt that the language employed in an insurance policy is to be construed in aid of the insurance rather than to the end of defeating it, for, indeed, the insurance vouchsafed is the'very object and purpose of the contract.\u201d (De Mun Estate Corp. v. Frankfort General Ins. Co., 196 Mo. App. 1, 7.) If the policy in .question is interpreted as a workmen\u2019s compensation policy, it follows, of course, that it must be held to be a void policy, for the reason that an employer cannot be an employee within the contemplation of the Act. Therefore, in construing the policy, we must interpret it, if possible, in a way that will give effect to it \u201cso as to uphold rather than defeat or avoid, the contract.\u201d Here, we have an insurance company boldly asserting that it attempted, in a \u201cridiculous way,\u201d to contravene the Act. The policy was prepared by it, and it cannot be presumed that the deceased, a teamster, was engaged in any such alleged attempt. He sought insurance. The defendant -claims that it did not give him insurance of any kind by the policy. Under all the circumstances in this case the defendant should not be allowed to make this claim. If it is a valid policy, and I think it is, as it is not a policy under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, it necessarily follows that it is a contract of insurance.</p> <p id=\"b251-4\" pgmap=\"251(97) 252(96)\">In any event, the judgment of this court that the superior court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim of the plaintiff is an erroneous one. The position of the defendant is that the policy is not a valid workmen\u2019s compensation policy and that if a proceeding were brought under it before the Industrial Commission it would fail. The plaintiff admits that the defendant was not bound to make compensation payments to her under the Compensation Act, and she is not attempting, in the present proceeding, to have the superior court pass upon a claim brought under the Act. Her action is in assumpsit and, as I have heretofore stated, it is not based upon the theory that the defendant was bound under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, but it is a suit to recover the amount the plaintiff claims to be due her under an alleged policy of insurance. In my opinion the superior court had full jurisdiction to pass upon the subject matter of the action. Nor would the claim of the defendant that the alleged contract was nonenforceable by its \"terms affect, in any way, the jurisdiction of the court.</p> <p id=\"b252-5\" pgmap=\"252\">I dissent from the judgment of this court holding that the superior court of Cook county was without jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
