By that assertion, Defendants mean that the complaint \"alleges only one type of defeat device,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   one whose purpose is to defeat EPA certification testing and evade federal emissions standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

That is not the definition given by Plaintiffs in the consolidated amended complaint. According to Plaintiffs, \"[a] defeat device means an auxiliary emissions control device that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and use.\" Con. Am. Compl. at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   It is undoubtedly true that the consolidated amended complaint includes references to EPA standards, emissions testing, and Plaintiffs' belief that the vehicles at issue violate EPA regulations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 3, 6. But Plaintiffs can prevail on\n   their claims without proving the existence of a \"defeat device\" as that term is defined by the EPA. Plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment and consumer protection claims are premised on the following assertions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A reasonable consumer would not expect their Silverado or Sierra vehicle to spew unmitigated NOx in this fashion while driving in the city or on the highway, nor would a reasonable consumer expect that fuel economy was achieved in part by turning off or derating the emission systems, nor would a reasonable consumer expect that if the emissions were as promised the advertised fuel economy and performance could not be achieved....GM never disclosed to consumers that the Polluting Vehicles may be \"clean\" diesels in very limited circumstances but are \"dirty\" diesels under most driving conditions. GM never disclosed to consumers that it programs its emissions systems to work only under certain conditions. GM never disclosed that it prioritizes engine power and profits over the environment. GM never disclosed that the Polluting Vehicles' emissions materially exceed the emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, that the emissions exceed what a reasonable consumer would expect from a \"low emissions\" vehicle, and that the emissions materially exceed applicable emissions limits in real-world driving conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   None of these allegations, with the exception of the very last phrase,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   will require proof that the Duramax engine contains a \"defeat device\" which violates EPA standards. To the contrary, Plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment and consumer protection claims are focused on whether Defendants fraudulently concealed information regarding the operation of the Duramax engine's emissions technology which would have been material to a reasonable consumer. Thus, Plaintiffs will be required to prove that the Duramax engine contains a component which \"derates\" emissions reduction technology and thus increases emissions to a level that a reasonable consumer would not anticipate and would consider material to his or her purchase decision. But Plaintiffs will not be required to prove that the engine component which is the source of the harm meets the EPA's definition of an illegal defeat device.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs are asking the Court to \"declare the EPA's existing compliance determination invalid-and\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   such effort is an affront to the EPA's exclusive jurisdiction.\" GM Mot. Dismiss at 22 (emphasis in\n   original). Just like Plaintiffs can prevail without demonstrating the existence of a \"defeat device\" that is illegal under EPA regulations, Plaintiffs can prevail without showing that the subject vehicles violate EPA regulations. The gravamen of their state law claims is that they purchased a vehicle which polluted at levels far greater than a reasonable consumer would expect. In other words, the vehicle operated differently than they expected. And, importantly, Plaintiffs allege that this disparity results from a nondisclosed vehicle component which is inherently deceptive: its alleged purpose is to surreptitiously permit dramatically higher emissions under certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On their face, these allegations do not require proof of noncompliance with EPA regulations. In fact, it is conceivably possible that Defendants could simultaneously comply with EPA regulations while still concealing material information from consumers. Defendants' arguments to the contrary are premised on the assumption that consumers only care about compliance with emission standards, not the total level of emissions by a certain vehicle or the different levels of pollution emitted by competing vehicles. But that assumption cannot be true: the significant market for environmentally friendly vehicles-which are designed to emit pollution far below the regulatory maximums-directly contradicts that assertion. As noted above, the advertisements and press releases which GM issued regarding the Duramax engine and subject vehicles repeatedly emphasized the engine's low emissions, but never expressly referenced EPA regulations. In other words, GM's own conduct reveals an understanding that consumers believe emission levels are material to their purchasing decisions separate and apart from the regulatory maximum emission standards. Thus, the allegation that the subject vehicles do not comply with EPA regulations is consistent with Plaintiffs' theory of harm, but proof of noncompliance is not required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   If Plaintiffs' claims were predicated on proving noncompliance with EPA regulations or with demonstrating that Defendants had defrauded the EPA, they would be preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813711\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/770/570/#p575\">\n    770 F.Supp.2d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding state tort claims advanced by government employees to be preempted because the plaintiffs had abandoned all claims except those expressly based on proving violation of the CAA).

GM argues that Plaintiffs' claims represent an obstacle to Congress's purpose and objectives in enacting the CAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Specifically, GM argues that \"[t]o the extent that Plaintiffs' claims are based on GM's failure to publically disclose (or only partially disclose) specific aspects of its AECDs, these claims are preempted\" because \"the EPA has already decided what should and should not be disclosed to the public with respect to emissions controls\" and thus \"the EPA has decided that [this information] may remain confidential.\" GM Mot.

GM has provided no legal authority to support the proposition that the CAA and/or the EPA is responsible for determining the extent to which vehicle manufacturers must disclose information about the emissions produced by their cars to consumers. The EPA is tasked with\n   <em>\n    environmental\n   </em>\n   protection, not\n   <em>\n    consumer\n   </em>\n   protection.

And the EPA has further concluded that some of those disclosures will not be made public record by the agency.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , EPA Class Determination 1-13, ECF No. 45, Ex. 2. Defendants reference a document produced by the EPA which explains that the EPA will not produce information under the Freedom of Information Act if the requested information involves confidential trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. GM appears to argue that because the EPA does not have a legal duty to disclose certain information to the public, GM does not have a duty to disclose that information to the public. Simply put, the EPA's duty to disclose information to the public is entirely untethered from GM's duty to disclose information to the public. The idea that the EPA's interpretation of its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act has any bearing on Defendants' obligations to disclose material information to consumers simply has no merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no risk that Plaintiffs' claims will interfere or undermine the purposes and objectives of Congress in passing\n   the CAA, and so Plaintiffs' claims are not implicitly preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiffs' claims are not preempted, \"Plaintiffs have not plausibly pled that there is\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   kind of 'defeat device' other than the kind used to defeat EPA regulations that would be material to a reasonable consumers.\" GM Mot. Dismiss at 28 (emphasis in original). In other words, \"[w]hile it might plausibly be material to a reasonable consumer that [the level of emissions allegedly revealed by Plaintiffs' testing] does not comply with EPA regulations, it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   plausible that a reasonable consumer would care about those numbers outside the context of EPA regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This is an argument for a jury. In essence, GM is arguing that consumers care only about compliance with EPA regulations, as opposed to the true level of emissions. That assertion might be true for some consumers, but it cannot possibly be generally accepted as true as a matter of law. Plaintiffs allege that there is a significant consumer demand for environmentally friendly vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Con. Am. Compl. at 5. And that fact is common knowledge. Many of these vehicles, like the Toyota Prius, emit pollution far below the regulatory maximums. If consumers only cared about regulatory compliance and not the quantitative level of emissions, then vehicle manufacturers would focus their advertising on regulatory compliance, not environmental friendliness. But as already noted twice, Plaintiffs have summarized or reproduced over ten pages of GM advertisements and press releases where the company repeatedly touts the low emissions and environmentally friendly nature of the Duramax engine, but never expressly states that the engine complies with emission regulations. That fact goes without saying: all consumers naturally expect their vehicles to be compliant. Consumers who purposefully buy a \"green\" vehicle, then, must be (at least partially) basing their purchase decision on the technology in the vehicle which reduces emissions far\n   <em>\n    below\n   </em>\n   that maximum level. Plaintiffs allege that the subject vehicles operate with significant portions of its emissions reduction technology inactive for 65 to 70% of the miles driven.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. It is very plausible that a consumer who bought a vehicle because it purportedly contained advanced emissions reduction technology would consider that fact to be material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that this case should be stayed pursuant to the primary jurisdiction doctrine in favor of an EPA investigation. \"The doctrine of primary jurisdiction arises when a claim is properly cognizable in court but contains some issue within the special competence of an administrative agency.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And, more importantly, Bosch's argument is factually suspect. Although GM's profits from sales of Duramax-equipped vehicles might be distinct from Bosch's profits for development and implementation of EDC17 in those vehicles, all Defendants clearly profited from the alleged scheme. EDC17 enabled GM to produce diesel vehicles with an apparent blend of high power, high fuel efficiency, and low emission levels. Because that combination was attractive to consumers, the scheme resulted in higher demand for GM's diesel vehicles, which in turn increased GM's demand for EDC17 devices.

Defendants contend that Plaintiffs do not allege any fraudulent omissions \"with the factual specificity mandated by Rule 9(b).\" GM Mot. Dismiss at 40. But, as discussed earlier, allegations of omissions-as opposed to affirmative misrepresentations-will inevitably be less specific. Misrepresentations occur at a definite point in time, but omissions occur over periods of time. And, because misrepresentations involve action while omissions involve inaction, plaintiffs are less likely to uncover discrete evidence of omissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418319\" index=\"370\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/735/#p751\">\n    273 F.Supp.3d at 751-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that both GM and Bosch had specific intent to defraud consumers. But, as explained above, that intent can be inferred from the nature of the alleged conduct. The way in which EDC17 interacted with the Duramax engine is inherently deceptive. The alleged purpose of the device is to provide the perception of reduced emissions while avoiding the reality of reduced emissions. Defendants cannot reasonably argue that the deceptive nature of EDC17 was unanticipated or unintended, and even if they do, that argument could be resolved only by a jury. Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the purpose of EDC17 was deception, and so Defendants' protestations that it has an innocent and lawful purpose are noncognizable at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Defendants also appear to argue that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged or specifically identified specific uses of the mail or wire which were fraudulent.

Additionally, the Supreme Court has held that \"[m]ailings occurring after receipt of the goods obtained by fraud are within the statute if they 'were designed to lull the victims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely than if no mailings had taken place.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In other words, Plaintiffs do not bear the burden of pleading uses of the mail or wire that were fraudulent. They need only identify uses of the mail or wire which furthered the fraudulent scheme. Allegations that mailings by the Defendants aided in the concealment of the fraud are sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In making the argument that Plaintiffs must specifically allege fraudulent uses of the mail and wires, Defendants conflate several legal requirements. As described above, Plaintiffs bear the burden of alleging\n   that each Defendant committed two predicate acts of racketeering activity. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in wire and mail fraud. Wire and mail fraud require a scheme to defraud through fraudulent representation or omission\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a use of the mail or wire to further that scheme. But a defendant can commit wire or mail fraud without actually having used the wire or mail to defraud. Rather, and as explained above, a defendant can be found culpable simply by entering into the scheme to defraud if a co-defendant's use of the mail or wire was reasonably foreseeable and closely related to the scheme. Thus, Bosch's repeated argument that Plaintiffs must specifically allege that\n   <em>\n    Bosch\n   </em>\n   used the mail or wire to defraud is, simply, wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a number of uses of the mail and wire which furthered the fraudulent scheme. GM submitted applications to government regulators which affirmed that the vehicles complied with emission standards. Without those mailings and electronic communications, GM would have been unable to sell the vehicles. The applications and resulting certificates also increased the likelihood that consumers would perceive the Duramax vehicles as emitting pollution at a low level. And although Bosch may not have directly used the mail or wire to further the fraudulent scheme, GM's uses of the mail and wire were inevitable and thus reasonably foreseeable. Plaintiffs have not specifically alleged the date of the applications or the specific identity of the employee who prepared them, but Plaintiffs have alleged enough detail to put Defendants on notice of the alleged predicate acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs have identified a number of advertisements made by GM which characterized the Duramax vehicles as having low emissions and as being friendly to the environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Con. Am. Compl. at 61-70. If Plaintiffs were relying on these advertisements as the basis for its claim of fraud, then Defendants' arguments regarding puffery and duty to disclose would become relevant. However, these representations do not constitute the fraudulent scheme; they merely further it. The level of emissions produced by a diesel engine was a material consideration for consumers purchasing a vehicle. GM's extensive advertising which emphasized the low emissions and environmentally-friendly nature of its \"clean diesel\" engine underscores its understanding of that fact. Thus, regardless of whether these advertisements would be actionable on their own, they were material to the scheme. The advertisements urged consumers to buy Duramax vehicles\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they were environmentally friendly even though the Defendants had purposefully worked together to obfuscate the true level of emissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Plaintiffs have specifically identified a number of communications that were \"reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.\"\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633285\" index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/749/1205/#p1216\">\n    749 F.2d at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The communications themselves may not have been demonstrably fraudulent, but they were intended to increase the likelihood that consumers would purchase Duramax vehicles because they produced emissions at a low level, when in fact the true level of emissions was much higher. The nondisclosure of the true operation of the Duramax engine was material precisely because GM worked so hard to convince consumers that it was a \"clean diesel\" engine. The fact that the uses of the mail and wire which Plaintiffs identify may have been innocent or legally required is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910731\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/346/#p354\">\n    125 F.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmuck\n   </em>\n   , 489 U.S. at 712,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033146\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/705/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]lthough the registration-form mailings may not have contributed directly to the duping of either the retail dealers or the customers, they were necessary\n   to the passage of title, which in turn was essential to the perpetuation of Schmuck's scheme.\").
