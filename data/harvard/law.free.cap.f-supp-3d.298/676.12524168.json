Salas was proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   when she filed her Complaint (Dkt. 2) and her Amended Complaint (Dkt. 18), but\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel later entered an appearance on her behalf. Defendants now move to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. For the reasons explained below, that motion is denied in part and granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Amended Complaint, the original Complaint, and the documents attached to the original Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All non-conclusory facts are assumed to be true for the purposes of resolving Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stadnick v.

In 2008, she began working in a clerical role for the Fingerprint Division (the \"Division\") of DOI. In that role, she regularly observes \"members of the Hasidic sect of the Jewish religion\" come in for fingerprinting. Am. Compl. \u00b6 5. Men who are Hasidic have a religious objection to being touched by women and, thus, an objection to being fingerprinted by them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276100\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/31/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In 2013, Salas wrote a letter to the Director of the Division, Danielle Desrouleaux, about the \"contemptuous and rude behavior\" of two of her coworkers, Maria Calvi and Judith Marrero, who Salas said had been \"display[ing] obvious disrespect toward [the] visiting Hasidic Jews.\" Dkt. 2 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The \"primary incident\" that Salas complains of took place in September 2015. Am. Compl. \u00b6 8. According to Salas, Maria Calvi approached \"a Hasidic man who came to the Division for fingerprinting\" and \"suddenly grabbed\" the man's hand, proceeding to \"forcibly\" take his fingerprints over his screamed objections.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276100\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/31/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Salas \"heard the commotion\" in the fingerprinting area that adjoins her work space. Dkt. 2 at 15. She attempted to interfere, \"beseech[ing] her Division colleague to let go of the man's hand,\" but Calvi \"sneered at her, made vulgar remarks, and carried on\" with the fingerprinting. Am. Compl. \u00b6 9. Calvi allegedly \"stuck her nose\" in Salas's face and told Salas that it was\n   \"none of [Salas's] business\" and that Salas could \"report [her] to the Director!\" Dkt. 2 at 15, 26. Salas went to management to report the September incident. After Salas reported it, Calvi confronted her, shouting in a \"menacing manner\" to \"[g]et off [her] face.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Salas alleges that her reports about the treatment of the Hasidic man were \"met with ridicule and indifference\" and that \"nothing was done\" despite multiple follow-ups. Am. Compl. \u00b6 10. According to Salas, the incident with the Hasidic man \"was merely one of many which occurred at the Division over time,\" and \"a hostile work environment and religious discrimination has existed and been pervasive at the Division both before and after this incident.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2015, Salas's supervisor wrote a formal warning to Salas about the September 2015 incident. In the warning, the supervisor criticized Salas for \"[b]erating\" Calvi and \"tak[ing] matters into [her] own hands\" rather than simply notifying her supervisor. Dkt. 2 at 47. In the Amended Complaint, Salas refers to the warning as a \"derogatory note,\" which she alleges was placed in her file as a result of her complaints about the September incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51; Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. A few weeks later, on December 14, Salas complained to DOI's Assistant Commissioner for Administration, Edgardo Rivera, that Calvi at some point had \"humiliated and embarrassed\" Salas \"by mimicking [her] murmuring disability in front of co-workers.\" Dkt. 2 at 24. In that same complaint to Rivera, Salas asserted that she had been \"victimized\" for reporting the incident with the Hasidic man.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. On February 1, 2016, Salas was notified that she would not receive a raise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2016, Salas filed a formal charge of discrimination with the EEOC, identifying retaliation, religion, and disability as the grounds for the charge. She provided the following description of the discriminatory conduct that she claimed to have experienced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Maria Calvi improperly handled an Orthodox Jewish male. (She physically abused him and spoke to him in a harsh manner. She did not address any other patrons harshly). I reported the mistreatment to my supervisor and I received a command discipline. I filed an internal EEO complaint regarding the mistreatment of the Jewish male ... but it was never addressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Calvi makes fun of my stuttering and she intimidates me on a daily basis. I have reported the harassment to management and nothing was done to stop the harassment. In retaliation for filing my internal discrimination complaints I have not received a raise as all of the other employees in my unit[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. Allegedly as a result of this charge, DOI gave Salas a raise in June 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Even after Salas received the raise, however, she corresponded several times with the EEOC. On August 5, 2016, she sent the EEOC a letter that, among other things, noted how \"Calvi... mimic[s her] on a daily basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Salas further asserts that, after the September 2015 incident and her complaints about it, \"she has repeatedly been mocked, ridiculed, and made fun of\" at the Division. Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. She alleges that someone removed some of her files, that the \"derogatory note\" (apparently the written warning described above) \"was put into her personnel file,\" that \"she has suffered abuse,\" and that \"her religion has repeatedly been mocked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She concludes that she \"has suffered discrimination and abuse at the Division on account of her stuttering disability and her religion\" and that she has \"suffered damages as a result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 2, 2016, Salas, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed the Complaint in this action,\n   asserting claims of employment discrimination under the ADA and Title VII. Shortly after Salas filed her Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel entered an appearance on her behalf. Defendants now move to dismiss the Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26.

Title VII and ADA Claims Against DOI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's primary argument is that DOI violated Title VII and the ADA by subjecting her to a hostile work environment on the basis of her religion and disability, by discriminating against her on those bases, and by retaliating against her for complaining about the discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hostile Work Environment Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DOI argues that Salas's hostile-work-environment claims must be dismissed\n   because she fails to plead that she suffered workplace harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive under either Title VII or the ADA. (DOI appears to concede for the purposes of this motion all other elements of the causes of action.) To state a claim for a hostile work environment under Title VII, Salas must plausibly allege that her \"workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera v.

Salas's allegations of discriminatory conduct directed at non-employees in this case do not plausibly amount to an objectively hostile work environment. Thus, she has not alleged sufficient non-conclusory facts to support her hostile-work-environment claim under Title VII. Defendants' motion as to this claim is granted without prejudice. To the extent that Plaintiff amends her complaint, she may add additional details to support this claim so long as she does so in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Disability-Based Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Salas also asserts a disability-based claim for a hostile work environment under the ADA. The materials attached to Salas's original Complaint include allegations that \"Calvi makes fun of [Salas's] stuttering ... on a daily basis,\" \"intimidates [her] on a daily basis,\" and \"mimic[s]\" her \"on a daily basis.\" Dkt. 2 at 13, 28-29.

But the daily, humiliating mocking of a pronounced stutter in front of one's colleagues could well prove to be more than \"simple teasing,\" \"offhand comments,\" and \"isolated incidents.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petrosino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319463\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/210/#p223\">\n    385 F.3d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike Salas's allegation that some unidentified person \"repeatedly mocked\" her religion in some unidentified way, her allegations that Calvi mimicked her stutter in front of her coworkers in a humiliating way on a daily basis-a very specific and self-explanatory form of bullying-is sufficient to survive a motion to\n   dismiss. Accepting Salas's factual allegations as true and drawing reasonable inferences in her favor, a jury could \"conclude that [Salas's] work environment both objectively was, and subjectively was perceived by the plaintiff to be, sufficiently hostile to alter the conditions of employment for the worse.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schiano v.

Retaliation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VII and the ADA must be dismissed. Under Title VII, employers may not \"discriminate against\" employees because they have \"opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because [they have] made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\"\n   <em>\n    Vega v.

The ADA contains nearly identical language, and retaliation claims under the two statutes are analyzed under the same framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lovejoy-Wilson v.

Thus, for a retaliation claim to survive a motion to dismiss under either statute, \"the plaintiff must plausibly allege that: (1) [her employer] discriminated-or took an adverse employment action-against [her], (2) 'because' [s]he has opposed any unlawful employment practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p89\">\n    801 F.3d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Adverse Employment Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants contend that Salas has failed to allege any adverse employment action for her retaliation claims. Ds' Mem. at 14. Salas asserts that she has suffered two of them: the denial of a raise in February 2016 and the \"derogatory note\" in her personnel file in November 2015. P's Mem. Opp. at 9-10 (Dkt. 29).

Whether the written warning in Salas's file, which is all the \"derogatory note\" purports to be, could similarly dissuade a reasonable worker from complaining of discrimination is less clear. The Court need not decide if the relevant \"note\" is an adverse action for now, however, because Plaintiff's retaliation claims based on the note fail on other grounds as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Protected Activities and Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants also argue that Salas has failed to allege that she engaged in a protected activity under either the ADA or Title VII.

To avoid dismissal based on such activities, however, Salas \"must plausibly allege that the retaliation\" for those complaints \"was a 'but-for' cause of the employer's adverse action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p89\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This causation standard necessarily means that any of Salas's alleged protected activities must have occurred before the purportedly adverse actions-namely, the November 2015 \"derogatory note\" or the February 2016 denial of a pay raise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Salas does not allege that she complained to anyone about religious intolerance towards her at any point prior to February 2016. Instead, she points to several complaints she made about her coworkers' treatment of Hasidic men who came in for fingerprinting, particularly with respect to the September 2015 incident. As Salas concedes in her opposition papers, however, \"reporting discrimination by an employer against a non-employee is not cognizable\" under Title VII. P's Mem. Opp. at 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570936\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/10/#p14\">\n    716 F.3d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Complaining of a coworker's discriminatory treatment of nonemployees cannot, as a matter of law, amount to an \"unlawful\n   <em>\n    employment practice\n   </em>\n   \" under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570936\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/10/#p14\">\n    716 F.3d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Thus, \"it should have been plain to the plaintiff and to any other lay person that [her] complaint of retaliation for opposing discrimination by co-employees with respect to the general public was not a complaint about an employment practice.\"\n   <em>\n    McMenemy v.

To the extent that Plaintiff's complaints to her employer and the EEOC focused on Calvi's (or other employees') alleged mistreatment of Hasidic visitors to the Division, such complaints are not protected activity under Title VII and cannot form the basis of Salas's retaliation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although Salas does not allege in her current pleading that she complained of religious harassment or discrimination directed at her, Salas's counsel nonetheless argues in opposition to Defendants' motion that Salas made \"good faith reports of a variety of discriminatory acts,\" suggesting that there may have been reports besides those alleged in the current pleading. P's Mem. Opp. at 6-7. Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim is thus granted without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    b. ADA Retaliation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Salas also asserts that she has plausibly alleged protected activities based on her complaints about Calvi mimicking her stutter. As an initial matter, Salas does not allege that she made any such complaints before November 2015. Thus, she has failed to allege that the \"derogatory note\" was placed in her file because of her engagement in a protected activity under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although it is a close question, Salas has adequately alleged that she engaged in a protected activity that caused the denial of her raise in February 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p89\">\n    801 F.3d at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She does not state in her pleading when she complained about the daily nature of Calvi's alleged harassment, but she sufficiently alleges in her EEOC charge that her internal discrimination complaints about Calvi's daily mocking of her stutter resulted in the denial of her raise in February 2016, clearly suggesting that her complaints preceded that denial. Dkt. 2 at 28-29 (\"Ms. Calvi makes fun of my stuttering and she intimidates me on a daily basis. I have reported the harassment to management and nothing was done to stop the harassment. In retaliation\n   for filing my internal discrimination complaints I have not received a raise as all of the other employees in my unit[.]\"). Salas also attaches to her original Complaint a letter dated December 14, 2015, in which she informed Edgardo Rivera that Calvi had committed an \"act of discrimination when she humiliated and embarrassed\" her \"by mimicking [her] murmuring disability in front of co-workers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. An inference of causation can be drawn from the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the allegedly adverse action, and even a five-month period is \"not too long\" to create such an inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219367\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/93/#p110\">\n    596 F.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (2d Cir. 2010). At this stage, it is plausible enough that Salas complained about the daily nature of Calvi's harassment between when she wrote her letter to Rivera in December 2015 and when her raise was denied in February 2016. That two-month period \"nudge[s]\" Salas's causation allegations \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p89\">\n    801 F.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Salas has also adequately alleged the other elements of retaliation under the ADA, because the language she used in her letter suggests that she subjectively believed that Calvi's actions were discriminatory. This belief was objectively reasonable for the reasons explained above. Defendants' motion to dismiss is therefore denied as to Salas's ADA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants interpret Salas's Complaint as asserting substantive discrimination claims under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ds' Mem. at 18 &amp; n.8. Defendants argue that these claims fail because Salas has not plausibly alleged that any adverse employment actions were \"imposed [on her] because of her disability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Defendants further contend that, to the extent Salas makes religion-based discrimination claims under Title VII, those claims also fail on causation grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ds' Mem. at 18 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss a Title VII discrimination claim, a plaintiff must \"plausibly allege that\" her Title VII protected characteristic (here, religion or disability) \"was a motivating factor\" in her employer's decision to take an adverse action against her.\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p89\">\n    801 F.3d at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Salas alleges that Calvi may have had discriminatory animus toward her, there is no indication that Calvi had anything to do with the purportedly adverse actions against Salas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Salas comes closer to asserting that the Division and DOI provided \"preferential treatment\" to other employees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chertkova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n    92 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because she alleges that she was denied a raise when others in her unit were granted one. But this allegation does not plausibly give rise to an inference of discrimination under the facts of this case. To show that preferential treatment gives rise to an inference of discrimination, a plaintiff normally must allege that the relevant comparators were not members of the relevant \"protected group\" and were treated less harshly despite being \"similarly situated\" to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saji v.

It is unclear, for example, whether any of them were Jewish, or whether any of them had disciplinary notes in their files. Salas also fails to explain whether, or under what circumstances, other individuals at the Division received written warnings.
