(DE # 35.) For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The clerk is\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Michelle Haywood (\"Haywood\"), filed her complaint in state court on August 13, 2015. (DE # 4.) The complaint brought claims for negligence, negligent training and supervision, and public disclosure of private facts; it also listed \"punitive damages\" as a separate count. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The defendant, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (\"Novartis\"), removed the matter to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction on September 28, 2015. (DE # 1.) On November 2, 2015, Novartis filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. (DE # 14.) On September 27, 2016, the Court granted the motion, dismissed the complaint without prejudice, and granted Haywood thirty days to file an amended complaint. (DE # 28.) The first amended complaint was filed by Haywood on October 25, 2016. (DE # 30.) In Count one of her complaint, Haywood alleges that Novartis acted negligently when it disclosed personal information to her co-workers and supervisors via facsimile transmission which violated duties it owed to her under its privacy policy, under Indiana Code 25-26-13-15(b), and under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\n   Act (\"HIPPA\"). In Count Two, Haywood alleges that Novartis was negligent in its training and supervision of its employees regarding the protection of customer privacy and confidentiality. Finally, in Count Three, Haywood alleges that she is entitled to punitive damages because Novartis acted with reckless indifference when it disclosed her protected information despite being told, in writing, not to do so. Novartis filed the instant motion to dismiss on December 27, 2016. (DE # 35.) Haywood filed her response on January 9, 2017. (DE # 37.) Novartis filed its reply on January 17, 2017. (DE # 38.) The motion is ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Novartis Patient Assistance NOW Oncology, a division of Novartis, administers the GLEEVEC Co-Pay Assistance Program (the \"Program\") in which eligible patients are given a GLEEVEC Co-Pay Card by Novartis to help offset the costs of their prescription medication.

Haywood applied for the Program, and on May 19, 2015, she sent Novartis a written statement requesting that no information regarding her application be sent to her place of employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) On July 8, 2015, Novartis disclosed the following via facsimile transmission to Haywood's co-workers and supervisors: her social security number, her date of birth, her income, her Medicare number, and information about her disease, treatment, and medical providers.

App. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, Haywood's amended complaint alleges that Novartis breached explicit duties of privacy that it owed to her as a customer pursuant to the representations on its websites. In her response brief, Haywood argues that she relied on those representations to ensure that her information would remain private when applying for the program. However, as Novartis points out, the assurances in the Privacy Notice relate to the dissemination of information to its business partners who are prohibited from using customers' personal data for marketing purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint does not allege, nor is it reasonable to infer, that the facsimile transmission sent to Haywood's place of employment was in any way connected with third-party marketing. Similarly, according to its own terms, the purpose of the Privacy Statement is to explain what Novartis does with its customers' personally identifiable information and how it will be protected. In relevant part, the Privacy Statement confirms that Novartis will \"limit[ ] the collection and processing of personal information to what is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is to be used\" and will require third-parties and other departments within the Novartis group to conform with those same policies. (DE # 30,\n   pp. 3-4.) The portion of Privacy Statement included in Haywood's amended complaint does not set forth detailed standards or describe Novartis' specific obligations with regard to general non-disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, of note, the Privacy Statement does indicate that a customer's consent related to the collection of personal information is required when he or she registers for a Novartis program or service, and it states that Novartis will explain how the information will be used for that particular program upon registration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The Privacy Statement goes on to indicate that, if information is to be used \"for purposes incompatible from those for which the data was initially collected, we will offer an effective way to opt out of the secondary use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reading the Privacy Statement cited in the amended complaint in conjunction with the Privacy Notice associated with the Program, it is clear that the relevant privacy considerations focus primarily on dissemination to Novartis' partners and the subsequent intended secondary usage of that information rather than a duty to ensure against all possible disclosures in all circumstances. Again, the allegations in the complaint do not suggest, nor is it reasonable to infer, that the facsimile transmitted to Haywood's place of employment was related to improper secondary usage or was anything other than routine collection and processing by Novartis. Rather, the complaint simply alleges that \"in processing\" the Program application, Haywood's information was disclosed by facsimile to her place of employment, and the fact that Haywood allegedly told Novartis not to send any information regarding her application to her place of employment, without more, does not create a legal duty where none previously existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Haywood also argues that Novartis owed her a statutory duty to protect her personal information pursuant to Indiana Code 25-26-13-15(b). It is true that, under Indiana law, violating statutory duties constitutes negligence\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Kho v. Pennington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8370109\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/875/208/#p212\">\n    875 N.E.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (Ind. 2007) (citing cases);\n   <em>\n    Thiele v.

Ct. App. 1991) ). The question here is whether the section of the code relied upon by Haywood applies to Novartis. Haywood argues that it does because the statute clearly and unambiguously pertains to \"any 'person' with patient information.\" This is true, according to Haywood, because the preceding and subsequent subsections of the statute refer specifically to a pharmacist or pharmacy, while the subsection in question refers more generally to a person. Novartis argues that such an interpretation fails to consider the statute as a whole which applies to pharmacists, pharmacies, and drug stores rather than drug manufacturers or the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   If a statute is clear and unambiguous, courts are directed to take words and phrases in \"their plain, ordinary, and usual sense\" when analyzing their applicability.\n   <em>\n    City of N.

See\n   <em>\n    City of N. Vernon v. Jennings N.W. Regl. Utilities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939035\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/829/1/#p4\">\n    829 N.E.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (Ind. 2005) (court proceeded to construe a statute that appeared unambiguous at \"first blush\" because \"a strict interpretation\" in light of the facts presented would have produced \"an absurd result\"). First, subsection (b) itself expressly limits the definition of a \"person\" to one whose knowledge is obtained \"by virtue of his office.\" That particular phrase is not defined in the statute, which results in some degree of ambiguity; however, reading the statute as a whole makes it clear that the regulations are intended to apply to those associated with the \"practice of pharmacy\" which the legislature has determined to be a matter of public concern. The practice of pharmacy is \"a patient oriented health care profession\" that focuses on a pharmacist's interactions with and counseling of patients regarding their prescription drug needs. The statute describes several acts, services, and/or operations that a pharmacist (or those interns or unlicensed persons the pharmacist supervises) is responsible for during the practice of pharmacy, none of which pertain to manufacturing pharmaceutical drugs or administering a co-payment assistance program. Moreover, the title of Chapter 13 itself applies directly to pharmacists and pharmacies. A pharmacy is a place where \"prescriptions are filled or compounded,\" and its principal purpose is dispensing drug and health supplies to the public; the definition also refers directly back to the practice of pharmacy as being of the upmost importance. Reading the statute to limit the applicability of its regulations to a person acting within the realm of the practice of pharmacy is also consistent with long-standing Indiana law recognizing the distinction of an individual who acts by virtue of his or her office as opposed to one who is employed more generally. See e.g.\n   <em>\n    Wells v. State ex rel. Peden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1659476\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/175/380/\">\n    175 Ind. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20N.E.%20321\">\n    94 N.E. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (1911) (\"An office is a position or station in which a person is employed to perform certain duties, or by virtue of which he becomes charged with the performance of certain duties, public or private; a place of trust.\"). Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the legislature intended subsection (b) to apply to a person involved in the practice of pharmacy, rather than to \"any person with patient information\" as is argued by Haywood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The amended complaint describes Novartis as a \"Pharmaceutical Corporation,\" with a division that administers the Program, and also as a \"provider of pharmaceuticals.\" Haywood does not properly allege, nor is it reasonable to infer, that Novartis falls within the definition of a\n   pharmacy, that Novartis filled or dispensed any prescriptions to Haywood, that the person who sent Haywood's information to her place of employment was a pharmacist, intern, or other unlicensed person working within a pharmacy, or that Novartis or the Program performs acts consistent with the practice of pharmacy as described above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The allegation that Novartis is a \"provider of pharmaceuticals\" is not enough to bring it within the purview of Indiana Code 25-26-13-15 ; thus, Novartis did not owe Haywood a duty under that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Haywood also claims that Novartis owed her a duty, under a negligence theory, for violating HIPPA standards.

As noted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , \"HIPAA provides civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosures of medical information, but it does not create a private cause of action, leaving enforcement to the Department of Health and Human Services alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2971182\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/429/930/#p944\">\n    429 F.Supp.2d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indiana state law claims that rely on HIPPA as the basis for establishing negligence are not cognizable because utilizing them in such a way would circumvent HIPPA's enforcement mechanisms. See e.g.\n   <em>\n    Sheldon v. Kettering Health Network\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20N.E.3d%20661\">\n    40 N.E.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (Ohio App. 2d Dist. 2015) (stating that \"in our view utilization of HIPAA as an ordinary negligence 'standard of care' is tantamount to authorizing a prohibited private right of action for violation of HIPAA itself\"). Thus, HIPPA does not create a duty or provide a statutory basis for Haywood's negligence claim in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Haywood cites to no Indiana case, nor can the Court find any, that would suggest that a pharmaceutical corporation has a general duty to safeguard an individual's personal information from disclosure to her employer. In cases where a duty has not been established, Indiana courts look to the relationship between the parties, the reasonable foreseeability of harm, and public policy concerns to determine whether a duty should be imposed at common law. See\n   <em>\n    Neal v. IAB Fin. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12354168,12327758\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/68/1114/\">\n    68 N.E.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117-18 (Ind.

Ct. App. 2004).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the relationship between Haywood and Novartis is described in the amended complaint in terms of a potential customer and a co-pay assistance company. Haywood alleges that she was in the process of applying for the Program when her information was disclosed to her employer. She does not allege that she was in a contractual relationship with Novartis or that she had even begun receiving or relying on the benefits provided by the Program. Although she describes Novartis as a \"provider of pharmaceuticals,\" she does not allege, nor is it reasonable to infer, that Novartis was a pharmacist or pharmacy that directly provided her with pharmaceutical drugs, medical care, treatment, counseling, or the like. While it is well-settled that the law recognizes a duty-bound relationship between a pharmacist and a customer, see e.g.\n   <em>\n    Forbes v. Walgreen Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10988525\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/566/90/#p91\">\n    566 N.E.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991), that\n   duty is premised upon a unique patient oriented health care connection. As noted by the Supreme Court of Indiana, \"pharmacists possess expertise regarding the dispensing of prescription drugs,\" and consumers rely upon that expertise during direct interactions with pharmacists regarding their prescription drug needs.\n   <em>\n    Hooks SuperX, Inc. v. McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10873242\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/642/514/#p517\">\n    642 N.E.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (Ind. 1994). That special relationship has been codified by the Indiana legislature, as described in detail above, to include the practice of pharmacy more broadly. See I.C. 25-26-13-1 through 25-26-13-33. However, the relationship between a pharmaceutical corporation and a person seeking assistance with their co-payments is not similarly close to justify imposing a duty, mainly because the direct contact, expertise, reliance, and counseling aspects of the relationship are wholly lacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to foreseeability, courts must look to the broad type of plaintiff and broad type of harm at issue and focus on \"the general class of persons of which the plaintiff was a member and whether the harm suffered was of a kind normally to be expected-without addressing the specific facts of the occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12354168,12327758\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/68/1114/\">\n    68 N.E.3d at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). However:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   because almost any outcome is possible and can be foreseen, the mere fact that a particular outcome is sufficiently likely is not enough to give rise to a duty. Instead, for purposes of determining whether an act is foreseeable in the context of duty we assess whether there is some probability or likelihood of harm that is serious enough to induce a reasonable person to take precautions to avoid it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Goodwin v. Yeakle's Sports B. and Grill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137688\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/62/384/#p392\">\n    62 N.E.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (Ind. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the broad type of plaintiff is a consumer seeking to enroll in a program administered by a company, and the broad type of harm is the damage suffered from the disclosure of the prospective enrollee's personal and protected health information to that person's place of employment. Considering the fact that much of an employee's personal information is likely already available to his or her employer, and the fact that a reasonable employer and/or co-worker would be unlikely to take negative action against an employee based on the receipt of protected health information, the likelihood of harm that is serious enough to be legally actionable is slight.

Ct. App. 2004). \"Various factors play into this policy consideration, including convenience of administration, capacity of the parties to bear the loss, a policy of preventing future injuries, and the moral blame attached to the wrongdoer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9227580\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/809/473/#p476\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Ousley v.

Ct. App. 2000) ). While it seems likely that a pharmaceutical company could adequately bear the loss in an action such as this and that personal and protected\n   health information should ideally be protected, other elements weigh against imposing a duty. Assigning significant moral blame to a pharmaceutical corporation in this situation is disproportionate to the actual acts performed (i.e. negligently disclosing information to an employer during a routine application process). The reality is that, for most people, the amount of sensitive personal information readily available to third parties with whom no close relationship exists is significant due to the nature of today's digital society. Imposing a duty to safeguard information from all possible disclosures upon any party or entity who happens to be in possession of the personal information of another would expand liability in a way that has the potential to stifle the collection of data and the routine processing of information. As noted by Novartis, courts have construed Indiana laws applicable to the disclosure of private information narrowly. For example, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals analyzed the Indiana data disclosure statute and found that there is no private right of action against a database owner for negligently disclosing information; rather, the database owner is simply obligated to advise potentially affected customers of a breach, and enforcement is handled by the Indiana Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    Pisciotta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654649\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/629/#p636\">\n    499 F.3d at 636-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, as discussed in detail above, while duties of non-disclosure have been imposed on those with specialized expertise (i.e. pharmacists and physicians), the nature of the specialized relationship is the driving force behind the imposition of that duty rather than the act of disclosure itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After balancing the relevant factors, the Court concludes that the general, non-specialized nature of the relationship between the parties and the fact that actionable harm is not reasonably foreseeable from the type of disclosure at issue outweighs the public policy considerations suggesting that potential customers may be entitled to protection of their personal data during an application process. Ultimately, \"[w]hen given a choice between an interpretation of [state] law which reasonably restricts liability, and one which greatly expands liability, we should choose the narrower and more reasonable path (at least until the [state] Supreme Court tells us differently).\"\n   <em>\n    Pisciotta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654649\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/629/#p636\">\n    499 F.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Todd v.

In one such case, the North Carolina court of appeals found that the plaintiff had not stated a cause of action under HIPPA, but it recognized that HIPPA was applicable to the extent that it \"provid[ed] evidence of the duty of care owed by [the defendant] with regards to the privacy of plaintiff's medical records.\"\n    <em>\n     Acosta v.

In another, a district court acknowledged that HIPPA does not confer a private right of action but found that HIPPA could be used to establish a negligence\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    claim under Missouri law.\n    <em>\n     I.S. v.

Mo. June 14, 2011). However, these cases are not binding on this Court, and the Court finds their reasoning unpersuasive in light of the weight of authority to the contrary and the lack of any Indiana decision allowing HIPPA to be used as the basis for a negligence claim such as this.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Because jurisdiction in this case is premised on diversity, the Court must apply the substantive law of Indiana and attempt to predict how the Indiana Supreme Court would decide a novel question of state law. \"Where the state supreme court has not ruled on an issue, decisions of the state appellate courts control, unless there are persuasive indications that the state supreme court would decide the issue differently.\" See\n    <em>\n     Lexington Ins.
