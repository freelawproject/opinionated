The officers encountered Mendoza sleeping in a child's bedroom and escorted him to the living room. After securing Mendoza in the living room, the officers found Joshua Valle (\"Valle\"), the other defendant, Elizabeth Colon (\"Colon\"), and their young child sleeping in another bedroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers secured Valle, Colon, and the child in the living room and began the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the search, the PRPD officers found various contraband items. In the room where Valle and Colon had been sleeping with their child, the officers found two baggies containing marijuana on top of a dresser and a shoebox containing drug paraphernalia, including empty baggies and blades, inside a closet. In the child's bedroom where Mendoza had been sleeping, the officers found a pill jar containing Percocet on top of a dresser; three marijuana baggies and $266 in Mendoza's pants pocket; and a Kel-Tec assault rifle loaded with 44 rounds of .223 caliber ammunition, 40 capsules of cocaine base, drug paraphernalia, and a toothbrush in a backpack inside the child's closet, which also contained toys and diapers, among other child items. In the kitchen, the officers found a black Smith &amp; Wesson pistol loaded with 15 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, a box containing rounds of ammunition, and a plastic bag of 60 decks of heroin and $129 lying in plain view on top of the cabinets. Finally, in a blue Suzuki Vitara parked by the residence, the officers found over 1,000 empty capsules that were identical in appearance to the capsules of cocaine-base found in the backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officers arrested Mendoza and brought him to the police station. At the station, Mendoza waived his constitutional rights and admitted ownership of the marijuana and money found in his pants pocket to Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") Special Agent Erick Del Valle. Mendoza also told PRPD Agent Steven Perez (\"Agent Perez\") that \"all the property that had been seized in the search belonged to him and to Joshua.\" (Docket No. 247 at p. 40.) Later, Mendoza memorialized his confession in writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The bags that were seized in the pants and the money are mine. The ones seized in the house are Joshua's and mine. Elizabeth has nothing to do with this or anything that was seized inside the house like the drugs, the weapons, etcetera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Trial Ex. 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, the government presented Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Task Force Agent Eddie Vidal (\"Agent Vidal\") as an expert in the field of drug trafficking and in the street value of controlled\n   substances. In his expert opinion, Agent Vidal asserted that possession of 40 capsules of heroin and 60 decks of cocaine base was inconsistent with personal use. He testified that the street value of each individual unit of heroin and cocaine bases ranged from $6 to $10 and that the heroin and cocaine base admitted as trial exhibits were packaged in a manner consistent with retail distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the government rested, Mendoza testified. He conceded that a pair of shoes found near the empty capsules in the blue Suzuki Vitara belonged to him. He also confirmed that he had been unemployed for at least a year before the date of his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the trial, the jury found Mendoza guilty of: (1) possessing firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking crimes in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (\" section 924\"); (2) possessing heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. section 841(a)(1) (\" section 841\"); and possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of section 841. Mendoza moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 on September 14, 2017. (Docket No. 250.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government opposed Mendoza's Rule 29 motion. (Docket No. 253.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, a court must consider the evidence \"in the light most favorable to the prosecution\" and determine whether the \"body of proof, as a whole, has sufficient bite to ground a reasoned conclusion that the government proved each of the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To uphold the jury's guilty verdict, the Court need only determine that the guilty verdict \"finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To find Mendoza guilty of violating section 841, the jury must have found beyond\n   a reasonable doubt that Mendoza: (1) knowingly possessed (2) a controlled substance (3) with the intent to distribute it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To find Mendoza guilty of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, the jury must have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mendoza: (1) knowingly possessed (2) one or both firearms described in the superseding indictment\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mendoza argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he violated sections 841 and 924. (Docket No. 250.) According to Mendoza, no rational juror could find that Mendoza knowingly possessed heroin and cocaine base with the intent to distribute or that he knowingly possessed one or both firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 8-13. Mendoza asserts that \"there is no basis on which to hinge the inference that Mendoza [ ] had to have known of the presence of drugs or firearms within the household,\" nor is there \"mention of specific drug trafficking activities in which the defendant engaged into and which would serve as the basis for a finding of 'intent to distribute,' or 'in furtherance of drug trafficking activities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 11 &amp; 13. Further, Mendoza argues that \"[t]he amount of drugs, paraphernalia, or firearms within the household, was not so staggering or overwhelming so as to allow an inference that ... Mendoza [ ] had to be aware of the items, had to be in cahoots with Valle [ ], a participant of drug trafficking activities, and willing to possess the firearms in order to defend the possession of the drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After review of the trial record in this case, the Court concludes that the government presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Mendoza guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of knowingly possessing heroin and cocaine base with intent to distribute, and knowingly possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Knowing Possession\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The jury convicted Mendoza of three offenses, each of which involves the element of \"knowing possession.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; 924(c)(1). \"Knowing possession\" may be proven through either \"actual or constructive possession.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To prove \"knowing possession\" through circumstantial evidence, the record must contain evidence of \"some action, some word, or some conduct that links the individual to the contraband and indicates that he had some stake in it, some power over it.\"\n   <em>\n    McLean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955424\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/492/#p501\">\n    409 F.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mendoza contends that the government failed to establish \"knowing possession\" for all three counts, arguing that \"[t]here is no evidence on this record that would allow an inference that [ ] Mendoza [ ] had knowledge, actual or inferable, of the presence of the drugs and firearms inside the closet or on top of the kitchen cabinet.\" (Docket No. 250 at p. 9.) Mendoza's argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government provided sufficient evidence for a jury to find reasonably that Mendoza knowingly possessed the heroin, cocaine base, and firearms. The government presented evidence that: (1) a Kel-Tec rifle, 40 capsules of cocaine base, and empty baggies were located in a backpack inside a closet in the child's bedroom; (2) Mendoza had been sleeping in the child's bedroom just before the PRPD officers found the backpack; (3) the backpack also contained a toothbrush; (4) the capsules of cocaine base inside the backpack were identical in appearance to over 1,000 empty capsules that were found in the blue Suzuki Vitara; (5) a pair of shoes belonging to Mendoza were found in the blue Suzuki Vitara near the capsules; (6) a Smith &amp; Wesson pistol was found in plain view on top of the kitchen cabinets; (7) a bag of 60 decks of heroin and $129 was found next to the Smith &amp; Wesson pistol; and (8) the Smith &amp; Wesson pistol and bag of heroin and cash were readily accessible. The government also provided evidence that Mendoza told Agent Perez, \"[A]ll the property that had been seized in the search belonged to him and Joshua,\" and that Mendoza memorialized his admission in writing. (Docket No. 247 at p. 40; Trial Ex. 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the government's evidence provided \"some action, some word, or some conduct\" that exhibited Mendoza's \"stake in\" or \"power over\" the heroin, cocaine base, and one or both firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955424\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/492/#p501\">\n    409 F.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, Mendoza's statements, coupled with the Smith &amp; Wesson pistol and heroin decks that were readily accessible to any adult in the residence, were sufficient for the jury to have inferred plausibly that Mendoza exercised dominion and control over these items and that he had constructive possession of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridolfi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264631\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/57/#p61\">\n    768 F.3d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury could have also concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Mendoza exercised dominion and control over the backpack containing the Kel-Tec rifle, 40 capsules of cocaine base, empty baggies, and toothbrush, given the identical capsules found near Mendoza's shoes in the blue Suzuki Vitara, as well as Mendoza's verbal and written statements and his use of the child's bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Intent to Distribute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The jury's convictions pursuant to section 841 require a showing that Mendoza possessed the controlled substances \"with intent to distribute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court extended the time for all filings due between September 6, 2017 and September 8, 2017 because of the passage of Hurricane Irma, allowing Mendoza until September 14, 2017 to submit the Rule 29 motion.

Throughout his Rule 29 motion, Mendoza indicates many factors about which \"the Government presented no evidence whatsoever.\" (Docket No. 250 at p. 8.) For example, Mendoza argues that the government provided no evidence that he \"entered the residence with the [contraband], or that [he] had concealed or hidden these items in the car, the house or any place.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 9. Mendoza also argues that the government \"did not provide any evidence regarding a joint enterprise between [Mendoza and Colon].\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 11. In challenging the verdict, however, Mendoza overlooks the evidence supporting the jury's conclusion. While additional evidence could have served to supplement the government's case, the trial record contains sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Mendoza guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for violating sections 841 and 924.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
