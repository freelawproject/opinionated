INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment in this Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") dispute between journalist and professor of journalism Charles Seife, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and the United States Department of State (the \"State Department\") that began with two July 22, 2014 requests for various records related to press briefings given \"on background\" by anonymous senior agency officials. The Court must now rule on the adequacy of the State Department's response to the first request, as well as the applicability of FOIA's Exemptions 5 and 6 to approximately 80 responsive documents, portions of which were redacted by the State Department, and to one document withheld in full. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the State Department is entitled to summary judgment on a portion of its withholdings under Exemption 6. The Court also concludes that the State Department should be granted a further opportunity to substantiate its claim that a search in response to the first request would be unreasonably burdensome, its claims of deliberative process and presidential communications privilege over the information it has withheld, as well as its claim that Exemption 6 applies to the identities of the anonymous background briefers. The State Department's motion for summary judgment is therefore GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Mr. Seife's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 22, 2014, Mr. Seife submitted a FOIA request to the State Department seeking information on the following \"on background\" conferences:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) Background Conference Call by Senior Administration Officials on Iraq, conducted on or about June 20, 2014[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) Background briefing by Senior Administration Officials via Conference Call on Afghanistan, conducted on or about May 27, 2014[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) Background Briefing on Syria, conducted on or about May 5, 2014[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (4) Background Conference Call on Ukraine Sanctions, conducted on or about April 28, 2014[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (5) Background Briefing on Designation of Boko Haram and Ansaru as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, conducted on or about November 13, 2013[; and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (6) Background Briefing on Section 1230 Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in Afghanistan, Pentagon Briefing Room, conducted\n   on or about December 10, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Declaration of Eric Stein, ECF No. 29 (\"Stein Decl.\"), Ex. 2. In connection with each of the six on background briefings, Mr. Seife requested (1) the unredacted transcript, which \"should identify\" the officials involved in the briefing, and (2) any documents, \"including but not limited to e-mails, meeting minutes, memos, and other communications,\" that described the \"planning and/or execution of\" each briefing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That request was received by the State Department and assigned case number F-2014-12996 (the \"12996 request\"). Stein Decl., Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also on June 22, 2014, Mr. Seife submitted a second FOIA request to the State Department, seeking the unredacted transcripts for any \"on background\" briefing that took place between January 20, 2009 and July 21, 2014. Stein Decl., Ex. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Seife explained that \"such a transcript should identify officials involved in the conference/briefing/call by name.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That request was assigned case number F-2014-12997 (the \"12997 request\"). Stein Decl., Ex. 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Seife filed this lawsuit on September 13, 2016, seeking an injunction requiring the State Department to provide him with the requested information. ECF No. 1. During a November 22, 2016 initial pretrial conference, the Court directed the State Department to provide a full response to the 12997 request no later than December 16, 2016. ECF No. 14. The Court also directed the State Department to provide rolling responses to the 12996 request, with a first production due no later than December 16, 2016, and with production to be completed no later than January 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In accordance with the Court's order, on December 16, 2016, the State Department produced six documents responsive to the 12996 request. Stein Decl., Ex. 4. In response to the 12997 request, the State Department explained that it had no responsive documents because the State Department does not maintain transcripts identifying the names of the officials conducting the background briefings. Stein Decl., Ex. 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State Department also provided the web address at which the background briefing transcripts were available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The State Department produced additional documents in response to the 12996 request on January 19, 2017. Stein Decl., Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 10, 2017, the Court granted the State Department an extension of time within which to complete its production in response to the 12996 request, extending the January 20, 2017 deadline to April 17, 2017. ECF No. 18. Three days before that deadline, on April 14, 2017, the State Department produced additional responsive documents. Stein Decl., Ex. 8. The State Department also removed certain redactions from previously produced documents and re-released those documents on January 23, 2017, March 6, 2017, and June 2, 2017. Stein Decl., Exs. 6, 7, 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After receiving a description of the search that the State Department had conducted\n   with respect to the 12996 request, Mr. Seife requested that additional, targeted searches be performed. Stein Decl. \u00b6 12. Mr. Seife agreed that, if those searches were conducted, he would not challenge the adequacy of the Department's search in connection with his 12996 request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The requested searches were performed, and the State Department completed its production of documents in connection with the 12996 request on June 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State Department withheld information in seventy-two documents under FOIA Exemption 5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5), which exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" Stein Decl. \u00b6 25.

ECF Nos. 27, 30. Following the filing of those motions, the State Department filed a supplemental declaration of Stein, as well as an updated\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index. ECF No. 35. The supplemental submissions indicate that, after production of the initial\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, the State Department released portions of previously withheld information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Eric Stein, ECF No. 35 (\"Stein Supp. Decl.\") \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its summary judgment motion, the State Department stands by its withholdings in response to the 12996 request, as identified in the updated\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index (the \"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index\"), and maintains its position that no records responsive to the 12997 request exist.

In evaluating the 12997 request, IPS determined that the only State Department component \"reasonably likely\" to possess responsive documents was the Bureau of Public Affairs (\"PA\"). Stein Decl. \u00b6 19. The Deputy Executive Director of PA, in turn, determined that the only PA component \"reasonably likely\" to have records responsive to Mr. Seife's request was the Office of Press Relations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The 12997 request was therefore submitted to the director of the Office of Press Relations for review, and that director confirmed that the office did not maintain responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Stein Declaration establishes that the State Department \"frequently\" holds briefings in which government officials address the State Department press corps \"on background,\" that is, \"not for individual attribution.\" Stein Decl. \u00b6 22. Stein avers that \"[a]ll of these background briefings are transcribed,\" but that the transcripts \"[a]t no point\" identify the background briefers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While the government officials hosting the briefings \"may\" be introduced by name to the journalists, they are identified only as \"State Department Official\" or \"Senior Administration Official\" in the transcripts that are produced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, because transcripts of the background briefings never include the name of the briefer, the State Department asserts that it was reasonable for the Office of Press Relations to believe that no search would generate any\n   records responsive to Mr. Seife's request, thereby making any search futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The legal premise of this argument is correct: \"FOIA does not demand a search that would be futile.\"\n   <em>\n    Amnesty Int'l USA v.

The State Department interprets this language as a request for only those transcripts of background briefings that \"identify officials involved in the conference/briefing/call by name.\" Pl.'s Reply Memorandum, ECF No. 38 (\"Pl.'s Reply\") at 5. However, as Mr. Seife has rightly observed, his request does not limit the transcripts that he seeks to those that\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   identify the briefers by name. Rather, his use of the phrase \"should identify\" expresses his\n   <em>\n    expectation\n   </em>\n   to receive transcripts containing the briefers' identities. Because an agency responding to a FOIA request is mandated to construe the request broadly, the State Department should have interpreted the 12997 request as one for unredacted transcripts of each \"on background\" conference, briefing, and call that took place between January 20, 2009 and July 21, 2014, regardless of whether the transcript identified by name the government official providing the briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With this liberal construction of the 12997 request in mind, the Court turns to\n   the State Department's decision to forego a search for responsive transcripts. Contrary to the State Department's representation, Mr. Seife argues that the agency does, in fact, maintain transcripts of background briefings in which the briefers' names are identified. As examples of such transcripts, Mr. Seife points to several transcripts that contain, in place of the briefers' names and titles, bracketed terms such as \"title redacted,\" \"introductions redacted,\" \"name deleted,\" and \"briefer name deleted.\" Pl.'s Mem., Ex. C. These transcripts, Mr. Seife comments, suggest that the State Department \"occasionally keeps transcripts\" in unredacted form identifying the briefers. Pl.'s Mem. at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In his supplemental declaration, Stein affirms that he reviewed the initial draft of one of the five transcripts relied on by Mr. Seife and confirmed that the draft produced by the stenographer contained the bracketed terms in the first instance, and not the actual names and titles of the briefers. Stein Supp. Decl. \u00b6 4. Stein clarified that the briefers' names and titles do not appear in even the initial drafts prepared by the stenographers, but that those drafts are produced with the bracketed terms in place of any identifying information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Mr. Seife has not produced any evidence to suggest that the averments of Stein's supplemental declaration were made in bad faith. Accordingly, the Court affords the supplemental declaration the presumption of good faith that it must and finds that the State Department has adequately shown that any search for unredacted transcripts of background briefings containing the names of the briefers would indeed be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This does not end the inquiry, however, as Mr. Seife's request also included, as the Court has just explained, a request for transcripts in which the briefers' names were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   identified. It is true that the State Department is not required to produce, in response to a FOIA request, any documents that are otherwise publicly available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triestman v.

Stein Supp. Decl. \u00b6 7.

That is the extent of his explanation of the burden imposed by Mr. Seife's 12997 request. Stein provides no information regarding the total number of email accounts that would need to be searched, or the level of difficulty of, or amount of time required by, the search process itself.

This consideration provides considerable weight to the approach embraced by the District of the District of Columbia: an agency's decision regarding how to present its substantive policies to the public often involves the evaluation of alternative public relations policies, policies which by their very nature are audience-sensitive and must anticipate public reaction. Even when an underlying decision or policy has already been established by the agency, the decision of how, and to what extent, to convey that policy to the public may require input by many working components within the agency, or even an analysis of the underlying policy itself. The Court is concerned that a rule categorically exempting such decisions from the deliberative process privilege would force agencies to prematurely \"operate in a fishbowl.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3502938,11294231\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/1429/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3502938,11294231\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/1429/\">\n    at 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, the Second Circuit has previewed its position on this issue, a position which aligns with the approach taken by the First Circuit and the District of the District of Columbia. In\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Justice\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found that the deliberative process privilege applied to \"a draft of a proposed op-ed article that suggested some\n   <em>\n    ways of explaining\n   </em>\n   the Government's legal reasoning in support of drone strikes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175047\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/126/#p133\">\n    844 F.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (2d Cir. 2016) (emphasis added).

If the Second Circuit viewed such a decision as outside the category of policy-oriented judgment protected by the deliberative process privilege, there would be no basis for the Circuit's conclusion that the document was in fact privileged. Thus, while\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union\n   </em>\n   contains no detailed analysis in connection with the privilege's application to that draft document, it does suggest that, if faced with the question of whether decisions regarding press strategy may be exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process privilege, the Second Circuit's answer would be \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit's holding, and the policy underpinnings of the deliberative process privilege, this Court respectfully parts ways with its esteemed colleagues\n   and adopts the approach espoused by the District of the District of Columbia. Therefore, the State Department here may withhold documents that reflect agency deliberations regarding the manner in which its policies are explained to the public.

Neither Stein's declarations nor the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index indicate that the information in the email was gathered or created for the purpose of advising the President, or in the course of such advising.

The State Department is directed to submit revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   submissions addressing the State Department's response to the 12997 request, the information and document claimed exempt under Exemption 5, the identities of background briefers claimed exempt under Exemption 6, as well as a segregability analysis addressing the Category 15 document, along with a renewed motion for partial summary judgment no later than April 30, 2018. Mr. Seife may file a renewed cross-motion for summary judgment with respect to the State Department's response to the 12997 request and its withholding of information and documents under Exemptions 5 and 6 no later than thirty (30) days from the date of service of the State Department's renewed motion. Any oppositions to the motion(s) for summary judgment are due no later than twenty-one (21) days following service of the motions, and any replies are due no later than fourteen (14) days following service of the oppositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Stein's Declaration indicates that this request is attached as Exhibit 11.

First, Stein's declaration sufficiently establishes that IPS had the knowledge required to determine which office within the State Department was reasonably likely to maintain records responsive to the request. IPS itself is tasked with managing records within the State Department and with responding to records requests under FOIA. Stein Decl. \u00b6 2. Second, the Stein Declaration sufficiently shows that the Office of Press Relations was reasonably likely to have the requested records. As Stein explains in his declaration, the Office of Press Relations is \"the central conduit of information flowing from the [State] Department to accredited journalists\" and \"supports the President and the Secretary of State by explaining U.S. foreign policy and actions to domestic and foreign journalists.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 20. The office prepares the State Department spokesperson for daily press briefings, releases additional information to the media, acts as the \"authoritative channel of information about the Secretary's schedule,\" and responds to inquiries from the press.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In light of these functions performed by the Office of Press Relations, it was reasonable to believe that that office would have in its possession any documents responsive to the 12997 request. Because the Court finds that the State Department's interpretation of the 12997 request was overly narrow, and in light of the State Department's recognition that Department employees may have responsive documents stored in their email, it is not clear that the Office of Press Relations would be the only department to have information responsive to the 12997 request as the Court has just interpreted that request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    This email is also described as including communications with presidential advisers, and the State Department has withheld it under the presidential communications privilege, discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    at Section IV.B.1.b\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    The State Department has also withheld the contact information of an Office of the Director of National Intelligence official. That official's identity was withheld under FOIA Exemption 3, and Mr. Seife does not contest that withholding. Stein Supp. Decl. \u00b6 12 n.8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
