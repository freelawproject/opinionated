Dkt. No. 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 22. Bigsby and Freeland alleged that Barclays and HomEq defrauded mortgagors in the assessment of foreclosure-related fees, giving rise to claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") and related common law claims. Barclays previously filed a motion to dismiss the complaint by Bigsby and Freeland pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Freeland, Maria R. Brandt, Kathleen Murry, and Herman Grimes, were mortgagors. Bigsby was a resident of Georgia; Freeland was a resident of Massachusetts; and Brandt, Murry, and Grimes were residents of California. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs have sued Barclays, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, in its capacity as successor to HomEq. Barclays acquired HomEq, a mortgage-servicing company, in 2006. HomEq collected on home loans on behalf of mortgage-note holders, who were typically trustees and beneficiaries of securitized loans. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 14, 17, 26. After acquiring HomEq, Barclays continued to operate HomEq using the same employees, guidelines, and business strategies. SAC \u00b6 27. HomEq and Barclays serviced note holders' loans pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (a \"PSA\"). SAC \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26, 122. Under a PSA, a note holder assigned to HomEq and Barclays certain ownership rights of the note, including the right to foreclose on delinquent mortgages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 28, 57, 59, 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Each plaintiff obtained at least one mortgage serviced by HomEq and Barclays. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, 53, 148, 153, 206-08, 225-27, 243-45. All of the plaintiffs went into default on their mortgage obligations, and Barclays instituted foreclosure proceedings against them. This case deals with Barclays's conduct during those foreclosure proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The claims and factual allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are organized around three allegedly fraudulent schemes perpetrated by Barclays in foreclosure proceedings-a \"fraudulent foreclosure scheme,\" a \"fee shifting scheme,\" and an \"inflated fees scheme.\" The plaintiffs allege that these schemes caused them \"to pay the illegal amounts sought by Barclays, and ... incur[ ] legal and other expenses associated with the illegal activity.\" SAC \u00b6 298.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bigsby, Freeland, Brandt, and Grimes allege that Barclays and others engaged in a \"fraudulent foreclosure scheme.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 276-77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs assert that this scheme involved Barclays and others identifying an entity as the assignee of the security instrument that bore the beneficial ownership interest in the mortgage note \"at the time of the commencement of foreclosure, when the Deed of Trust or Mortgage [was] not assigned until after the [foreclosure] action was initiated.\" SAC \u00b6 276. This scheme allegedly permitted Barclays to assert standing in foreclosure actions on behalf of its note-holder clients before those clients had in fact acquired standing through the recording of the assignment of the ownership interest in the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiffs also allege that Barclays and others engaged in a fraudulent \"fee shifting scheme.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 265-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Barclays used an \"outsourcing\" model to hire counsel for all of the foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings at issue in this case. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 28-30. Under this model, Barclays entered into a Master Servicing Agreement with a non-legal entity-often Fidelity National Foreclosure Solutions-which provided that Fidelity would serve as Barclays's representative in dealings with local foreclosure and bankruptcy counsel. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 29-31, 33. Fidelity agreed to be \"solely responsible ... for local counsel's performance\" in the bankruptcy and foreclosure actions. SAC \u00b6 34. In exchange, the Master Servicing Agreement provided that Barclays would pay Fidelity a fee for each bankruptcy and foreclosure Fidelity arranged and monitored, as well as a continuing fee for each foreclosure (assessed every six months) so long as the mortgagor was \"reasonably performing\" on a payment plan. SAC \u00b6 39. Fidelity also entered into retainer agreements with bankruptcy and foreclosure counsel, which provided that counsel would pay fees to Fidelity for each mortgage referred to counsel out of funds counsel received from the client. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The loan documents for the plaintiffs' mortgages were standard forms issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These forms permitted Barclays to assess various fees associated with foreclosure costs against mortgagors in default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 51, 150. Some of the foreclosure-related fees Barclays assessed against the plaintiffs that were listed as \"attorney's fees\" or \"legal fees,\" were ostensibly designed to pass only the cost of foreclosure and bankruptcy counsel onto defaulting mortgagors. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 163, 172, 178, 191, 216-17, 233, 235, 253. The plaintiffs allege that Barclays surreptitiously used these \"attorney's fees\" or \"legal fees\" not just to pass onto mortgagors the cost of counsel but also to pass on the cost of hiring Fidelity to serve as an intermediary with counsel on Barclay's behalf. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 269-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bigsby and Freeland alleged RICO claims premised on a similar \"fee shifting scheme\" in their first amended complaint. Dkt. No. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 173-79. The Court dismissed those RICO claims on Barclays's prior motion to dismiss primarily because Bigsby and Freeland failed to allege claims of fraud and scienter.\n   <em>\n    Bigsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344829\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/568/#p572\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 573-74, 576-77, 578-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"fee shifting scheme\" alleged in the operative Second Amended Complaint is exactly the same as the \"fee shifting scheme\" the Court dismissed previously with one addition: The plaintiffs now allege that Barclays and Fidelity entered into an indemnity agreement dated April 9, 2009, as part of the scheme. SAC \u00b6 268;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 33-47, 265-72. This agreement provided that Fidelity will hold Barclays harmless for \"[a]ny allegations that the business model employed by [Fidelity] ... constitutes an impermissible 'fee splitting' or 'referral fee' arrangement.\" SAC \u00b6 Ex. C;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs allege that Barclays and others engaged in a fraudulent \"inflated fees scheme.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 273-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Master Servicing Agreement between Barclays and Fidelity contained a schedule of maximum fees that Fidelity was authorized to charge in the event of a bankruptcy. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 273. Fidelity and foreclosure counsel also entered into retainer agreements that contained schedules for the foreclosure-related fees counsel was permitted to charge Barclays. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 273. The plaintiffs allege that Fidelity and foreclosure counsel knowingly charged Barclays fees in excess of the maximum limits set by the Master Servicing Agreement and the retainer agreements, and that Barclays passed these inflated fees onto the defaulting mortgagors. SAC \u00b6 274;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 58, 64, 74, 80, 89,\n   93-94, 99-100, 133, 163, 169, 178-79, 183, 186, 191-92, 212-17, 237, 258. The plaintiffs allege that Barclays benefitted from this scheme \"by not having to have a department of employees analyzing legal bills to make sure they were in conformity with the maximum allowable fees.\" SAC \u00b6 275.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that they were victims of all three fraudulent schemes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2005, Bigsby obtained two mortgages, secured by his home in Stockbridge, Georgia, from Freemont Investment and Loan Co., with Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (\"MERS\") serving as nominee. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. Bigsby went into default on his mortgages in or about the latter part of 2006. SAC \u00b6 54. Barclays initiated foreclosure proceedings against Bigsby on November 8, 2006, on behalf of \"U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee.\" SAC \u00b6 55. U.S. Bank National Association had not been assigned the note or Deed of Trust for Bigsby's property when the Bigsby foreclosure was initiated. SAC \u00b6 57. The document assigning the Note and Security Deed for Bigsby's property from MERS to U.S. Bank National Association was prepared and executed on December 14, 2006. SAC \u00b6 62. All of the correspondence between Barclays, foreclosure counsel, and Bigsby through October of 2009 related to the foreclosure listed MERS as Barclays's client and creditor on Bigsby's loan. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 86, 91, 96, 102, 106, 109-12, 115. Barclays first stated that U.S. Bank National Association was the creditor for Bigsby's loan on October 22, 2009. SAC \u00b6 117. Barclays sold Bigsby's house in foreclosure to U.S. Bank National Association on May 4, 2010. SAC \u00b6 132. Bigsby alleges that Barclays charged him fraudulent fees associated with foreclosure costs on multiple occasions between November 29, 2006, and October 22, 2009. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 56, 63, 71, 77, 88, 92, 97, 116, 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2004, Freeland obtained a mortgage secured by her home in Plymouth, Massachusetts, from Aames Funding Corp. SAC \u00b6 148. Freeland went into default on her mortgage in or about the first half of 2006. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 154, 158. Barclays initiated foreclosure proceedings against Freeland on July 14, 2006, on behalf of \"Deutsche Bank National Trust Co[.], as Trustee.\" SAC \u00b6 158. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. did not hold the note or mortgage to Freeland's property when the Freeland foreclosure was initiated. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 159, 174. On March 12, 2007, Barclays, through counsel, recorded an Assignment of Mortgage transferring the beneficial interest in Freeland's mortgage to Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. SAC \u00b6 176. The assignment document was dated January 31, 2004, and listed a notarization date of February 6, 2004.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344829\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/568/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Freeland paid off all amounts due on her mortgage and related fees as of May 15, 2013.

Barclays initiated foreclosure proceedings against Brandt on October 16, 2007, naming \"Quality Loan Service Corp.\" as the \"original trustee, the duly appointed substituted trustee, or acting as agent for the trustee or beneficiary.\" SAC \u00b6 210. Barclays knew that Quality Loan Service Corp. was not the \"original trustee, the duly appointed substituted trustee, or acting as agent for the trustee or beneficiary\" when the foreclosure began.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344829\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/568/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On February 7, 2008, Barclays filed an assignment of Deed of Trust transferring the interest\n   in Brandt's mortgage to Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.

Murry was notified that she was in default on her mortgage on or about September 15, 2008, and at some point thereafter foreclosure proceedings were initiated against her. SAC \u00b6 228. The Second Amended Complaint does not state which company initially owned Murry's mortgage note or on which company's behalf Barclays initiated the Murry foreclosure. Murry paid off her mortgage loan in full as of September 23, 2009, but Barclays charged her a fee associated with the foreclosure proceedings after that date. SAC \u00b6 233. Murry alleges that Barclays charged her fraudulent fees associated with foreclosure costs on multiple occasions between December 23, 2008, and November 24, 2009. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 230-33, 235-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 2003, Grimes obtained a mortgage from New Century Mortgage Corporation, with Southland Title serving as trustee. SAC \u00b6 244. Grimes defaulted on his mortgage in or around the summer of 2009. SAC \u00b6 246. Barclays initiated foreclosure proceedings against Grimes on September 1, 2009, on behalf of \"Old Republic,\" which Barclays listed as \"agent for the beneficiary.\" SAC \u00b6 248;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 244. When the Grimes foreclosure began, Old Republic did not have the authority to commence the foreclosure and New Century was not the holder of the Deed of Trust. SAC \u00b6 248. Barclays executed an assignment of Deed of Trust from New Century to Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., and a Substitution of Trustee substituting Old Republic for Southland Title as trustee on September 2, 2009.

Barclays argues that the premise of the plaintiffs' argument is flawed because the PSAs effectuated complete transfers of the beneficial interests-including the right to initiate foreclosure-of all loans subject to those PSAs even before any mortgage assignments were recorded. Because each foreclosure at issue was allegedly initiated after the associated PSA was executed, Barclays argues that the mortgage assignments to the trusts were valid before the foreclosures began and thus the representations on the foreclosure documents regarding who owned the beneficial interest in the loans were true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Second Circuit Court of Appeals confronted this issue in\n   <em>\n    Rajamin v.

The\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing because their claimed injury-that the defendants commenced foreclosure proceedings they were not empowered to commence-was too conjectural or hypothetical.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125632\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125632\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/79/\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiffs also do not assert that any entity other than the trusts that Barclays asserted in the foreclosure documents owned the mortgage notes attempted to claim the plaintiffs' foreclosed assets in the many years between the institution of their foreclosures and the present lawsuit. As in\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   , the absence of such allegations make it \"difficult to view\" the plaintiffs' allegations that some entity other Barclays's clients owned the beneficial ownership rights in their mortgages \"as other than conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125632\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/79/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125632\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/79/\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   There is a related and independent reason that the plaintiffs' allegations of a fraudulent foreclosure scheme fail: the plaintiffs have failed to allege material misrepresentations. The impact of\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   on this case demonstrates that the statements in the foreclosure documents regarding who owned the mortgage notes was not material to the plaintiffs' alleged injury. The plaintiffs do not allege that they would not have had to pay the principal and interest that were due on their mortgages. They claim only that they would not have had to pay various fees, such as fees to bankruptcy and foreclosure lawyers. But there is no plausible argument that the difference in the name of the foreclosing party would have affected the amount of fees that the plaintiffs paid. The plaintiffs do not and cannot dispute that they could be required to pay some amount in fees to the foreclosing entities for costs incurred in foreclosure proceedings. And in light of\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs cannot meaningfully dispute that the entities entitled to foreclose on the plaintiffs' notes were Barclays's clients, based on the language in the PSAs and the fact that no other entity had even attempted to institute foreclosure proceedings even though the plaintiffs admitted they were in default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The plaintiffs' efforts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   fail.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   court relied on New York law to interpret the effect of the PSA not because those mortgagors resided in New York or because the mortgages are secured by property in New York but because the PSAs contained an express provision that stated they were to be interpreted under New York law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant PSAs in this case, which are at base contracts, also expressly state that they are to be governed by New York law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   therefore controls the question of the impact of the PSAs here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The plaintiffs point out that the principal issue in\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   was whether a mortgagor had standing to use a violation of the PSA to challenge a foreclosure whereas here the principal issue is whether the foreclosures were fraudulent. They also assert that the damages sought in\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   were the principal and interest paid on the mortgages whereas the damages sought here were the fees paid in connection with the foreclosures.
