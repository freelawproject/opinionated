CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Medical Diagnostics Labs alleges that Defendant Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc.'s development of a drug called PTG-200 infringes on its patent for polypeptides that bind to IL-23 receptors. These polypeptides, including PTG-200, have therapeutic potential to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Protagonist has entered into a multi-million dollar agreement with third-party pharmaceutical company Janssen, Inc. to develop the drug, perform testing necessary for regulatory approval, seek regulatory approval, and, if regulatory approval is obtained, to manufacture and commercialize the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss, arguing that the activities alleged in the complaint all fall under the safe harbor provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).

Here, MDL's allegations leave no doubt that the purpose of the Janssen Agreement is to explore the viability of PTG-200 as a therapeutic drug to treat certain anti-inflammatory conditions. Indeed, the key pre-commercialization terms relate to the division of financial and oversight responsibilities between Protagonist and Janssen with respect to pre-clinical research, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and the regulatory approval process. At this juncture, the only payment made under the Janssen Agreement is $50 million to fund research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although MDL broadly alleges that Protagonist has \"attempted to advance and sell IL-23 receptor inhibitor compounds,\" the only specific examples alleged are the sales to Janssen under the Agreement in connection with clinical trials. Compl. \u00b6 43. In the absence of a factual allegation that Protagonist has made sales to a party other than Janssen under the Agreement, or to Janssen for a specific use unrelated to research for the regulatory approval process, MDL's vague allegation of attempted sales fails to support a plausible inference that Protagonist has engaged in activities outside the safe harbor. Indeed, MDL has not identified\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific use, sale, or offer to sell the patented technology outside the context of the Janssen Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the hearing, MDL advocated a new, more focused argument that was not briefed and therefore was arguably waived. In particular, MDL claimed that, at the very least, Protagonist lacked a \"reasonable belief that the compound will cause the sort of physiological effect the research intends to induce,\"\n   <em>\n    Merck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209013\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/193/\">\n    545 U.S. at 205-206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209013\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/193/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , until Protagonist met with MDL in May 2015, and therefore could not have benefited from the safe harbor before that time. As MDL's counsel put it, Protagonist had a \"Eureka!\" moment after MDL divulged its secrets at that 2015 meeting. MDL's suspicion is bolstered by Protagonist's disclosure of significantly more amino acid sequences in its '627 application (filed only two months later on July 15, 2015) than in its July 2014 provisional '899 application. According to MDL, the only explanation is that Protagonist used the information it learned at the \"Eureka!\" meeting to identify the new polypeptides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   MDL's \"Eureka!\" theory is flawed. First, MDL does not allege anywhere in its complaint that Protagonist lacked a reasonable belief regarding the potential of the drugs it was researching (including the PTG-200), nor does it allege facts that would support that inference. Thus, the complaint, as pled, does not support MDL's theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, even assuming that Protagonist lacked a reasonable belief\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the May 2015 meeting with MDL, that \"Eureka!\" moment would, by definition, have then endowed it with a reasonable belief in the\n   drug's potential. That epiphany\n   <em>\n    precedes\n   </em>\n   the Janssen Agreement, and therefore any sales or uses pursuant to the Agreement, by two years; MDL has not alleged any infringing sales or uses prior to the Janssen Agreement. Thus, the \"Eureka!\" theory now advanced by MDL would, if anything, immunize under Section 271(e)(1) Protagonist's conduct pursuant to the Janssen Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, as a matter of fact, it is highly unlikely that Protagonist lacked a reasonable belief prior to the May 2015 meeting with MDL. As Protagonist's counsel pointed out and MDL's complaint acknowledges, Protagonist had already been developing and researching polypeptides with the specific purpose of locating the four-leaf clover that would inhibit IL-23 receptors, as indicated by Protagonist's July 17, 2014 provisional '899 application. Thus, in light of MDL's own allegations, it is implausible to suggest that, at least as of July 17, 2014, Protagonist lacked a \"reasonable belief that the compound will cause the sort of physiological effect the research intends to induce.\"\n   <em>\n    Merck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209013\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/193/\">\n    545 U.S. at 205-206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209013\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/193/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, MDL's revised position that it \"has alleged infringement in its complaint based on Protagonist's making and using activities occurring between issuance of the '150 patent on February 3, 2015 and approximately five months later, on July 15, 2015, when Protagonist filed its patent application that led to the '268 patent,\" Docket No. 42 at 4, is not supported by the complaint because MDL does not identify any \"making and using activities\" occurring during that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although whether challenged activity is reasonably related to the development and submission of information for FDA approval may in some circumstances be a fact question, there must be specific facts alleged to create a plausible claim to the contrary in order to escape dismissal under the safe harbor provision.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

To a certain extent, MDL's argument creates an irony; it is MDL-not Protagonist-that suggested the Court look to Protagonist's business motivations to determine whether the safe harbor applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 9 (arguing that \"the substantial payments from Janssen to Defendant\" were not reasonably related to providing information to the FDA). Indeed, MDL now goes so far as to argue that \"the plain language of \u00a7 271(e)(1), as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    AbTox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    precludes\n   </em>\n   consideration of the 'underlying purposes or attendant consequences of [Protagonist's] activit[ies] when making a factual determination about the activities' reasonable relation to obtaining FDA approval.\" Docket No. 42 at 4 (emphasis added). The Court agrees, but that is a reason for granting, at least in part, not denying, Protagonist's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The only activity alleged to have already taken place so far, however, is Janssen's payment of $50 million to Protagonist to fund the research and initiate the clinical trial process. Compl., Ex. J at 3. This is clearly reasonably related to the development and submission of information for the FDA approval process. Whether Protagonist is ultimately motivated to use that research (or the money) to promote or commercialize the drug is immaterial under\n   <em>\n    AbTox.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To the extent MDL alleges that future payments under the Janssen Agreement are not protected by the safe harbor, the Court notes that the clear purpose of the agreement with Janssen revolves around obtaining FDA approval of PTG-200. The agreement is explicitly structured around the stages of FDA approval. Protagonist and Janssen are betting on PTG-200's success as a therapeutic drug, and they are also betting on FDA approval to manufacture and market the drug. Janssen funds Protagonist's research to pave the road to regulatory approval and, in exchange, Protagonist offers Janssen the future option to exercise an exclusive license to Protagonist's patent over PTG-200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That future contingent payments to Protagonist by Janssen for licensing rights may be characterized as creating an incentive to Janssen to assume risks and incur costs in the development and obtaining FDA approval does not necessarily deprive Protagonist of the safe harbor protection. The activities provided in the Janssen Agreement include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , completion of the Phase 2A and Phase 2B portions of the clinical trials, and Janssen's election at both junctures whether to pursue the agreement, including whether to maintain license rights for sums in the range of $125 and $200 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. J at 3. Though the question is not yet ripe for review for the reasons stated below, it is by no means clear that the size of those payments or Protagonist's subsequent use of the money to invest in other research unrelated to PTG-200 is relevant to the safe harbor analysis. As the\n   <em>\n    Intermedics\n   </em>\n   court explained, \"Congress clearly intended ... to create a legal environment in which the potential competitors of patent holders would be free, through non-infringing activities like raising capital, to position themselves to enter the market in\n   a commercially significant way just as soon as the relevant patents expired.\"\n   <em>\n    Intermedics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703152\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/775/1269/#p1277\">\n    775 F.Supp. at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the patent context, courts typically permit a plaintiff seeking a declaration of non-infringement to proceed on the understanding that a plaintiff \"need not bet the farm, or ... risk treble damages [for patent infringement] ... before seeking a declaration of its actively contested legal rights\" or force the potential infringer to make \"in terrorem choices.\"\n   <em>\n    Cat Tech LLC v.

Cir. 2008). The circumstances here are reversed: it is Protagonist and Janssen (not MDL) who are betting the farm, so to speak. They are on notice that MDL believes PTG-200 will infringe on its patented\n   technology. Because it is not yet known whether the FDA will approve further clinical trials or ultimately give final approval to PTG-200, whether Janssen and Protagonist will in fact seek such further and final approval, and whether Janssen will opt in at contractually specified junctures, Plaintiff has not identified a clear equitable or policy reason to entertain its request for declaratory relief at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff has cited no case-law to the contrary. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss the request for declaratory judgment based on future payments or commercialization as not presenting a case-or-controversy at this juncture. Dismissal is without prejudice to re-filing if and when the challenged conduct which MDL contends falls outside the safe harbor becomes imminent or concrete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff has not adequately pled that Defendant is currently engaging, or has engaged, in any infringing activities that are not protected by the Section 271(e)(1) safe harbor provision. Though Plaintiff did not identify other facts at the hearing or in its supplemental brief pertaining to activities outside of the safe harbor, the Court will grant Plaintiff leave to amend only if it can allege specific sales or uses outside of the Janssen Agreement, or specific uses under the Agreement but which are not reasonably related to seeking FDA approval, with an articulation why they are not consistent with this Order. If Plaintiff opts to do so, Plaintiff must file the amended complaint within 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff claims that future payments or commercialization of PTG-200 would fall outside the safe harbor and infringe its patent, that claim is at present too speculative to create a case or controversy under Article III. Nor does it warrant the Court's exercise of its discretion to exercise jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief. Plaintiff does not have leave to amend that claim but may re-file in the future if commercialization becomes imminent or concrete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This order disposes of Docket No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The analysis in\n    <em>\n     Intermedics\n    </em>\n    has been expressly endorsed by the Federal Circuit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Telectronics Pacing Sys., Inc. v.
