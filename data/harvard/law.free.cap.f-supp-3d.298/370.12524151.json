At the end of the summer, S.C. was hospitalized. S.C. Ex. 11. Bradley Hospital noted that S.C. had a history of oppositional behavior, defiance, school avoidance, and had expressed thoughts of being \"better off dead.\" S.C. Ex. 12. Chariho school psychologist Tara Reddington recommended this hospitalization. S.C. Ex. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Reddington also recommended that S.C. attend the RYSE Alternative Learning Program (\"RYSE\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   RYSE is a clinical day program at Chariho for at-risk youth and their families that partners with community and school support services.

Susan Meyer, the therapist S.C. was seeing at the time, noted that RYSE did not seem to be working. S.C. Ex. 4 at 9. N.C., S.C.'s mother, also believed S.C. was having difficulties at RYSE. Vol. I, 42:10-21. These suspicions proved true when, in January of 2013, S.C. overdosed on ibuprofen. S.C. Ex. 16 at 2. Bradley Hospital, where S.C. was taken, recommended trying to return S.C. to mainstream schooling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After this hospitalization, N.C. transferred S.C. back to Chariho Middle School.

Chariho Ex. 7 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   February saw numerous reports and evaluations concerning S.C. Ms. Reddington believed that S.C.'s overdosing was atypical of a suicide attempt and \"more\n   indicative of an impulsive, reactive response to a situation that [S.C.] was upset about at home.\" S.C. Ex. 22. Ms. Reddington arranged for a case history evaluation of S.C. which noted S.C.'s diagnoses of Mood Disorder NOS, Anxiety Disorder NOS, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and that she was taking Prozac and Abilify. S.C. Ex. 24 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vol. I, 59:11-14. The evaluation posited that S.C. had avoided school and other uncomfortable activities and that her behavior was being reinforced by these outcomes. S.C. Ex. 24 at 17. Ms. Reddington also prepared a transition plan for S.C. to return to school; S.C. refused. S.C. Exs. 25, 26. Dr. Abraham believed that she wanted to be home schooled and that she would push until she got what she wanted. S.C. Ex. 26.

Ex. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March of 2013, S.C. was determined to be ineligible for special education. S.C. Ex. 28 at 3; S.C. Ex. 29 at 3. Dr. Abraham reported that S.C.'s school refusal was due to anxiety, mood problems, and a wish to be home schooled. S.C. Ex. 31. Dr. Abraham was in favor of proceeding with truancy proceedings, perhaps simultaneously with treatment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Later in March, S.C. was hospitalized for cutting herself with a razor after an incident with some girls from school.

S.C. was provided with additional supports, including a social worker to help her at school, and a social worker to visit her at home. S.C.

S.C. continued to accumulate absences, was struggling academically, and risked being held back a grade. S.C. Exs. 50, 51. In addition, S.C. was hospitalized in May for suicidal thoughts and an inability to function. S.C. Ex. 52. Chariho determined S.C. was eligible for a 504 plan\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and provided accommodations. S.C. Exs. 56, 57. Despite some academic improvements (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 58), S.C. was hospitalized again in September for contemplating suicide (S.C. Ex. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   October of 2014 was another busy month of evaluations. Brett Leimkuhler, PhD, conducted a neuropsychological evaluation of S.C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 68.

After this, N.C. was willing to try RYSE again. Chariho Ex. 3 at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In November, Chariho's team finally concluded that S.C. was eligible for special education services. S.C. Ex. 74 at 3. That month, the IEP team convened to develop an IEP; however, because S.C. had not been attending school, the team decided to gather information while S.C. was being home tutored. S.C. Ex. 77 at 4, 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 117.

Ex. 118 at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 31, 2014, S.C. was allegedly raped, and she was hospitalized one week later for worsening depression and suicidal ideation. S.C. Ex. 79; Vol. I, 120:10-121:11. Dr. Leimkuhler believed S.C. could not return to RYSE because the alleged perpetrator was a RYSE student; he believed S.C. needed a therapeutic school. S.C.

N.C. provided Chariho with a summary of her concerns, outlining goals that she wished S.C. to achieve. S.C. Ex. 84. Both N.C. and Chariho also agreed to have Dr. Steven Feldman conduct an assessment of S.C. Vol. VIII, 33:13-21. The evaluation took place later that month. S.C. Ex. 85. Dr. Feldman believed that S.C. could attend RYSE and receive a FAPE as long as the risk of contact between S.C. and her alleged rapist were minimized and there was a safety plan in place should they come into contact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Perhaps most relevant for purposes of the instant action was the way the meeting ended. N.C. and her attorney believed the plan would not work and again requested a residential placement; Chariho refused. Vol. II, 12:10-16.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   S.C. bears the burden of proof in overturning the Decision. Her first challenge is that the Hearing Officer erred in failing to order a remedy for the denial of FAPE between October 1, 2015, and the date of the Decision. Her second issue is that the Hearing Officer failed to determine whether Chariho provided her with a FAPE in two IEPs promulgated between November 2014 and October 2015. The Court addresses each of these topics, and the related issues they present, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A. S.C. is entitled to a remedy for the denial of FAPE beginning October 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The principal dispute in this case is whether Chariho provided S.C. a FAPE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   with the October 1, 2015 IEP. The Hearing Officer concluded that, while Chariho failed to provide S.C. a FAPE, she was not entitled to a remedy. First, the Court must determine whether it is bound by this finding, Second, the Court turns to whether the Grove School was an appropriate placement. Finally, the Court turns to whether S.C. is entitled to some other compensatory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1. This Court is bound by the Hearing Officer's determination that Chariho failed to provide S.C. with a FAPE as of October 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The threshold issue the Court must address is whether it can disturb the finding that Chariho failed to provide S.C. a FAPE as of October 1, 2015. S.C. argues that Chariho did not file a cross-appeal from the Hearing Officer's Decision as an \"aggrieved party,\" and so it is stuck with this finding.

The Hearing Officer also cited an example of Dr. Leimkuhler's opinion changing when confronted with a contradictory report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Hearing Officer then noted several opinions of Dr. Leimkuhler which were contradicted by Dr. Feldman, including that \"DBT is intended to be part of an inpatient program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This Court, reviewing a cold administrative record, defers to the credibility determinations of the Hearing Officer, who heard live testimony and whose credibility findings are entitled to special weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shore Reg'l High Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9196888\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/194/#p199\">\n    381 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   199 ;\n   <em>\n    Sudbury Pub.

The administrative record leads the Court to two conclusions. First, the more credible expert testified that S.C. needed DBT and CBT, combined with family therapy in a setting with close family and community involvement. Second, while the Grove School does provide CBT and DBT, it does not provide the level of family and community involvement that the more credible expert testified was medically necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Dr. Feldman's central recommendation was that S.C. be provided with DBT. S.C. Ex. 85 at 5; Vol. VIII, 93:10-21. A preponderance of the evidence in the record does suggest that the Grove School provides some form of CBT and DBT. Peter Chorney, the executive director of the Grove School, testified before the Hearing Officer that, although the Grove School is \"not a licensed DBT program,\" the school does use DBT. Vol. IV, 3:6-10, 30:23-24. Mr. Chorney further testified that while the school does not \"define [itself] as a DBT program, nor ... as a CBT program,\" it does use both of those therapies \"when it\n   makes sense.\" Vol. IV, 31:1-4. He also testified that most or all of the Grove School therapists are trained in DBT. Vol. IV, 11: 16-19. Mr. Chorney explained that DBT is \"a tool we can use for students,\" is one they have used in the past, and \"could or could not, depending on the child\" be used in treatment. Vol. IV, 11:20-12:3. Patrick McAvoy, an admissions officer for the Grove School, told Jennifer Durkin, the special education director at Chariho, that while the Grove School was \"not a DBT program,\" the school does \"utilize many of the skills taught in DBT.\" Chariho Ex. 5 at 1; Vol. IV, 15:20-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Vol. IV, 30:17-23 (additional statement by Mr. McAvoy that Grove not a DBT program). Whether or not the school is licensed as or considers itself a DBT program may be a matter of semantics; it is clear that the Grove School has DBT-trained therapists and can offer some level of that treatment to students who need it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   However, this does not mean the Grove School can provide S.C. the specific treatment that she needs. Dr. Feldman testified that DBT at a residential placement would not be best for S.C. In general, Dr. Feldman testified that for DBT, outpatient, community-based treatment is the \"gold standard of treatment.\" Vol. VIII, 57:9-12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vol. VIII, 52:15-24 (describing DBT as \"basically an outpatient program,\" that is a \"community-based practice\"), 56:13-24 (explaining importance of outpatient setting). While DBT could be conducted on an inpatient basis, it is usually not. Vol. VIII, 51:16-20, 78:20-79:1. With respect to S.C.'s specific needs, Dr. Feldman testified that the goal for a person with borderline personality disorder like S.C. is an outpatient placement. Vol. VIII, 66:8-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Dr. Feldman also testified to the importance of family involvement in the therapeutic process. Based on his review of literature on the efficacy of residential placement for children with mental health issues, Dr. Feldman testified that \"gains made in a residential treatment program, absent any changes in the family or community, wash out within six to eight weeks or longer. The gains are not sustained.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vol. VIII, 85:3-12. For this reason, he testified, the \"psychoeducation\" of the family is a component of DBT for someone with a borderline personality disorder. Vol. VIII, 53:7-17. Dr. Feldman also testified that family therapy is \"very important\" in therapy of adolescents \"because they live in families.\" Vol. VIII, 83:8-11. The family must be aware of the skills the adolescent is developing, what the goals are, what the child is working on, and how the family can contribute to making things better. Vol. VIII, 83:11-18. Dr. Feldman specifically noted that, \"[g]iven how difficult borderline personality disorder is to live with, family therapy is very important when you're treating borderline personality disordered individuals.\" Vol. VIII, 83:19:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With respect to the Grove School, Dr. Feldman testified that, from reading the school's website, he believed the Grove School families to be on campus twice a month for family therapy. Vol. VIII, 84:3-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 123 at 46 (Grove School website stating that family visits occur \"at least once per month\"). Dr. Feldman testified that even twice-a-month family therapy would be insufficient for someone with a borderline personality disorder like S.C. Vol. VIII, 84:9-21. Ultimately, Dr. Feldman testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, S.C. would not sustain\n   emotional, social, or academic gains made at the Grove School. Vol. VIII, 91:11-92:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   S.C. argues that Dr. Feldman's views are premised on the assumption that the Grove School is not a DBT program. It is true that, in his ultimate opinion testimony, he was asked to assume that the Grove School was \"not a DBT program.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895129\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, as discussed above, Dr. Feldman's principal concern with Grove's provision of DBT is that it takes place in an inpatient setting. Indeed, Dr. Feldman's opinions seem firmly-and fairly-rooted in the fact that the Grove School is a residential placement that provides limited opportunity for family involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To rebut the claim that Grove has limited family involvement, S.C. cites to the Grove School website, which states that \"[f]amily sessions occur at least once per month and are preferably done in person at the School.\" S.C. Ex, 123 at 46. While conceding that perhaps twice monthly family therapy \"might not be enough,\" she argues that family involvement \"is not capped at any specific amount\" at Grove. ECF No. 21 at 30. Although the phrasing of the language does suggest that families may be more involved, S.C. points to no other evidence or testimony that visits actually are more frequent. In addition, the record suggests that the number of in-person visits could actually be less: the school also allows for \"teleconferences\" in place of family therapy where there is \"significant distance or other logistical problems.\" S.C. Ex. 123 at 46. In any event, Dr. Feldman already assumed that visits at Grove would be twice the amount stated on the school's website, and still found this insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Taken together, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the Grove School would not be able to offer S.C. the special education services that the more credible expert testified were necessary. Accordingly, S.C. has failed to prove that the nexus between her needs and what the Grove School provides is sufficient to render the school a proper placement under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   3. S.C. is entitled to some amount of compensatory education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Aside from any relief related to the Grove School, S.C. argues she is entitled to compensatory education as a matter of law because the Hearing Officer concluded that she was denied a FAPE. The Court must first address Chariho's contention that S.C. waived any right to compensatory education by failing to exhaust her administrative remedies. Finding that she did not, the Court considers whether S.C. is entitled to compensatory education, particularly in light of the actions of N.C. and her attorney at the October 2015 IEP meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"Compensatory education is a surrogate for the warranted education that a disabled child may have missed during periods when his IEP was so inappropriate that he was effectively denied a FAPE.\"\n   <em>\n    C.G. ex rel.

And that is true: in her original administrative complaint, \"[c]ompensatory educational services\" is the first remedy sought. Ct. Ex. A. While the four-sentence supplement does not mention compensatory education, this does not waive any claim to relief she originally sought. Rather, the supplement merely sets forth factual developments with S.C. since the filing of the initial complaint, and clarifies that the \"particular\" residential placement she is seeking is the Grove School.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507597\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/184/#p190\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because she sought compensatory education at the outset of her administrative proceedings, her compensatory education claim is not \"automatically barred from consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Pihl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507597\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/184/#p190\">\n    9 F.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Chariho argues that, much like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Pihl\n   </em>\n   , S.C. agreed that the Hearing Officer need only decide a narrow issue: whether she was entitled to residential placement at the Grove School. Early on in the administrative hearing, the parties discussed the logistics of having someone from the Grove School testify. S.C.'s attorney cautioned that they need not be limited to the Grove School, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   [W]e like Grove School, we'd like to go to Grove School, but if the hearing officer at the end of this said, you know, a residential therapeutic placement is ordered, then it's not magic for Grove School. There are other facilities that meet that criteria, although we like Grove School.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Vol. II, 42:4-10. The Hearing Officer responded, \"I don't see me as hearing officer picking somebody other than Grove School; do you understand that?\" Vol. II, 42:16-18. S.C.'s attorney responded, \"That's fine. Absolutely.\" Vol. II, 42:19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Chariho also points to a second exchange on the second to last day of the hearing. The Hearing Officer interrupted S.C.'s attorney to clarify that she was questioning the witness only about the Grove School: \"Is it my understanding that the parents are still asking that the child, the student go to the Grove School?\" Vol. VII, 45:22-25. S.C.'s attorney responded, \"The Grove School, or a similar residential placement.\" Vol. VII, 46:1-2. After objection from Chariho's attorney, the Hearing\n   Officer responded: \"I don't know what that means. Throughout this very long hearing it was the Grove School, I understand?\" Vol. VII, 46:5-7. S.C.'s attorney responded \"Yes,\" and the Hearing Officer replied, \"If you're going to go into something similar, that's not good enough for me. So I kind of was under the impression we weren't sure if it was the Grove School anymore. But it is. Thank you.\" Vol. VII, 46:8-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court does not believe that these exchanges are significant enough to constitute a waiver to any relief other than placement at the Grove School. Both of these conversations occurred once it became unclear whether S.C. was seeking placement\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   at the Grove School, or whether she was seeking some residential placement,\n   <em>\n    preferably\n   </em>\n   at the Grove School. In both exchanges, S.C.'s attorneys clarified that the only residential placement they wished to have considered was the Grove School; they did not state that residential placement at the Grove School was the only relief they were seeking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Chariho claims that it \"relied on th[ese] admission[s] in framing its entire case.\" ECF No. 17-1 at 103;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vol. VII, 46:3-4. When S.C.'s attorney's comments are properly understood, this objection is meaningless. Plaintiff's counsel conceded they would seek no residential placement other than the Grove School; Chariho accepted this paradigm and litigated accordingly. Whether S.C. is entitled to compensatory education depends primarily on whether she was provided a FAPE-an issue that Chariho litigated and lost before the Hearing Officer. Accordingly, the Court concludes that S.C. did not fail to exhaust her claim for compensatory education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   However, that does not end the inquiry. This Court has discretion to award compensatory education as a remedy for any \"nonfeasance or misfeasance\" in connection with Chariho's failure to provide a FAPE to S.C.\n   <em>\n    See C.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3162993\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/279/#p290\">\n    513 F.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, there is ample evidence in the record to suggest that the failure of the October 2015 IEP to provide FAPE to S.C. is attributable not only to Chariho but, to some degree, to N.C. and her attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Hearing Officer reviewed at length the faults underlying the October 2015 IEP meeting. First, the Hearing Officer noted that meeting was the first time the entire IEP team-including Chariho and N.C.-had reviewed S.C.'s prior IEP. Decision at 54-55. The Hearing Officer attributed this delay to both Chariho and N.C. requesting further evaluations of S.C. and otherwise seeking additional information.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3162993\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/279/#p290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Vol. V, 17:3-11 (N.C.'s refusal to participate in a social history).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, the Hearing Officer noted that the IEP team had set \"totally unrealistic\" expectations for S.C. to attend school. Decision at 56. A short-term objective in the IEP was to have S.C. attend school daily by November of 2015, despite her history of excessive absence and school avoidance. Decision at 56;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 104A at 9. Oddly, even though the IEP had set this goal, it also had the expectation that S.C. would be in the classroom less than forty percent of the time. Decision at 56;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 104A at 16. The Hearing Officer noted that, \"[i]t had to be obvious\" that the services provided to S.C. were insufficient to get her to attend school; however, those services went unchanged. Decision at 57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. Indeed, the October 2015 IEP \"basically provided the same program that was in existence prior to October 1, 2015.\" Decision at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Even if those faults were wholly attributable to Chariho, there remains the fact that N.C. and her attorney walked out of the IEP meeting. The Hearing Officer described their approach to the meeting as \"residential placement or nothing,\" a finding\n   supported by the record. Decision at 56;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vol. II, 12:10-16 (N.C. testifying that her attorney asked Chariho's attorney \"was he planning on doing anything regarding the Grove School, and he said no, and I think we packed up and left\"); Vol. II, 13:22 (N.C. describing IEP meeting as \"very short\"); Vol. II, 14:11-12 (N.C. testifying that \"we left quite abruptly\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Vol. VII, 29:4-30:6 (witness testifying that, after reviewing recommended, placement, N.C.'s attorney said \"[t]his is bullshit\" and abruptly left with N.C.), Although N.C. and her attorney may have disagreed with the recommendation-or specifically the lack of recommendation for the Grove School-this was an unreasonable response and hindered the collaborative nature of the IEP meeting.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3162993\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/279/#p290\">\n    513 F.3d at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting reimbursement claim where \"parents' actions disrupted the IEP process, stalling its consummation and preventing the development of a final IEP\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3162993\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/279/#p290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that \"parents' single-minded refusal to consider any placement other than a residential one,\" \"whether or not well-intentioned, constitutes an unreasonable approach to the collaborative process envisioned by the IDEA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Had N.C. remained, it is entirely possible that the parties could have developed an IEP that would have provided FAPE to S.C., including adequately addressing her attendance issues. Indeed, the alternative education plan proposed by Chariho subsequent to the meeting specifically targeted S.C.'s attendance issues. This plan provided for S.C. to spend time at Kindred Spirits, a therapeutic horseback riding program, as an incentive for her to leave home and attend school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chariho Ex. 1 at 1. While the Court does not offer an opinion on whether this plan could have provided S.C. with a FAPE, it certainly addressed her attendance issues, and was undoubtedly an improvement over what resulted from the October 2015 IEP meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vol. VIII, 90:3-10 (testimony by Dr. Feldman that alternative education plan is \"a very good plan\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   89:6-25 (testimony of Dr. Leimkuhler that while alternative education plan is \"excellent,\" it was not immediately appropriate, and instead \"a good Phase II or Phase III plan\" for S.C.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Ultimately, however, a plaintiff need not \"have a perfect case to be entitled to a compensatory education award.\"\n   <em>\n    Stanton ex rel.

The Court agrees. At the outset, the deficiencies are obvious and acknowledged: there is repeated placeholder language that certain information is not available. For example, the IEP does not state how S.C.'s preferences, interests, and goals were obtained-it just says that, because S.C. cannot attend school, information will be gathered later and her IEP revised, S.C. Ex. 77 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (repeating same language for measurable post-school goals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In terms of present levels of academic achievement and functional performance,\n   the IEP identifies \"coping skills\" as a need.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. It also identifies \"problem solving skills\" as a measurable annual goal, with the expectation of attending school \"all day, every day,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. However, it does not specifically state what coping and problem solving skills S.C. needs. As she points out:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Based on past history, there was an obvious need to focus on calming herself when anxious. There may also have been a need to focus on conflict resolution skills. There could also have been a need to work on remaining motivated. There could have been a combination of those needs. The IEP never tells us, and thus we are left in the dark as to precisely what S.C. was expected to be able to do at the end of the IEP, or the extent to which she would be able to do it, or how we would know when she had accomplished the skill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   ECF No. 10 at 39. The IEP does suggest that some of these skills can be measured by her attendance. S.C. Ex. 77 at 9. However, this is not an objective criterion with which to measure her success: an increase in attendance does not necessarily mean that S.C. has developed those skills. For example, S.C.'s attendance increased when she lived with her father, who took her off her medications and out of therapy-but that does not mean she developed problem solving and coping skills in that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In any event, even if attendance were a reliable benchmark for measuring the development of undefined problem solving and coping skills, numerous other \"areas to be addressed\" during this IEP have no goals set forth at all, including social skills, self-determination/self-advocacy, study skills, and attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   To be sure, the IEP does contain more concrete information in other areas, such as measurable goals for her math and algebra needs, as well as specific services to be offered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 13, 14.

Nor was the need for more information an objectively reasonable basis for these fundamental flaws. As Chariho acknowledges, in the run up to the November 2014 IEP meeting, \"Dr. [Michael] Vergnani conducted the clinical observation. Ms. [Elizabeth] Sanfilippo did the educational evaluation. Ms. [Jane] Cronin invested far more time than Dr. Leimkuhler ever did trying to gather background information on S.C.\" ECF No. 17-1 at 92 (citations omitted). Even if the Court accepts Chariho's argument that N.C. improperly interfered with Ms. Sanfilippo's evaluation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17-1 at 93, the school district offers no explanation why the information gathered by Dr. Vergnani, Ms. Cronin, and Dr. Leimkuhler was insufficient to develop an IEP that met minimum requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Because of these deficiencies, the November 2014 IEP was not designed to provide S.C. educational benefit, and thus, she was denied a FAPE during the period this IEP was in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   2. The March 2015 IEP could provide S.C. a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   S.C. next challenges the March 2015 IEP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two days before the March IEP team meeting, Chariho received a letter from Wendy Miller, LICSW, recommending\n   that the school district incorporate aspects of DBT into its plans for S.C. S.C. Ex. 81. Chariho represents that this is \"the first time that any clinician had raised the issue of DBT to Chariho.\" ECF No. 17-1 at 94. During the next month, Dr. Feldman evaluated S.C. at the request of both N.C. and Chariho.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 85; Vol. VIII, 33:13-21. As discussed earlier, a central recommendation of Dr. Feldman was that S.C. undergo DBT. S.C. Ex. 85 at 5. The IEP team subsequently met in early April to review Dr. Feldman's report. S.C. Ex. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   This IEP was a marked improvement over its predecessor. While continuing to recognize \"coping skills\" and \"problem solving skills\" as areas in need of improvement, this IEP adds specific, DBT-related goals for S.C. to improve in these areas. S.C. Ex. 89 at 11. Specifically, the IEP contemplates that, by June, S.C. is to understand concepts of mindfulness, distress tolerance, and interpersonal relationships, while by September, demonstrating skills in those areas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556542\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/18/#p23\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the hope was that S.C. \"will implement DBT skills during times of duress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556542\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/18/#p23\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This IEP also dramatically increases the specific services provides for S.C.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   S.C.

ECF No. 10 at 44;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Ex. 89 at 9, 11. However, the record shows that may not necessarily be what Chariho contemplated. While the IEP says that the expectation is that S.C. will attend school \"all day, every day\" (S.C. Ex. 89 at 9), the proposed reintegration program shows something different. Specifically, this plan contemplates that S.C. return to school for two hours a day in May; for four hours a day in June; and, after entering the extended school year program, that S.C. be a full-time student by August. S.C. Ex. 87. These dates do align with the goal of having S.C. understand DBT concepts by June and develop DBT skills by September.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 89 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Moreover, S.C. would have more support in place this time, including a contact person in school to help her, particularly when in crisis; extra time and breaks on assessments; and assistance with organization and time management skills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. It may be the case that getting S.C. to school by May for even a few hours a day was ambitious, but given the step-up approach, the supports in place, and the ongoing DBT skills she was developing, it was reasonably ambitious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. ex rel.

S.C. is thus entitled to a compensatory education award for the period from November 25, 2014, through April 15, 2015.

Ex. 89. There also appears to be a nearly identical copy of this IEP in the record as S.C. Exhibit 98, which was printed in August of 2015, although it does not differ in any significant respect.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 17-1 at 28. Nevertheless, the Court accepts the parties' representation that Exhibit 89 is the proper version of the IEP.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 10 at 16 (citing S.C. Ex. 89); ECF No. 17-1 at 22, 94-95 (same).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    S.C.'s other arguments, including that Chariho itself did not provide DBT, are unavailing. N.C. testified that she made an appointment for S.C. with Rhode Island CBT \"before [Chariho] even had a chance,\" and that, by March, \"everybody was working in the same direction of trying to get DBT services for [S.C.]\" Vol. II, 121:13-25;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    S.C. Ex. 86. Additionally, S.C.'s ultimate academic performance under this IEP is not a proper consideration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Roland M.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539302\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/983/#p991\">\n     910 F.2d at 992\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
