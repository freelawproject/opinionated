MCCONNELL, JR., United States District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jennifer McElroy's former employer Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Company, Inc. (\"Fidelity\") and Fidelity Financial Advisor Solutions (\"FFAS\") move for summary judgment of Ms. McElroy's claims for gender discrimination, retaliation, and breach of contract. This motion raises issues of the applicable statute of limitations for breach of a contract that contains compensation provisions and the factual and legal elements required to assert gender and family and medical leave claims in the employment setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. McElroy worked for Fidelity for almost seventeen years. In 2004, she began work as an internal wholesaler. Her primary responsibilities were to prospect for new business within the corporate market. She worked in FFAS, a business unit within Fidelity now known as Fidelity Institutional Asset Management. FFAS had two channels of distribution, intermediary and direct. Within FFAS is the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Management Solutions group (\"FILMS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2009, Ms. McElroy became regional vice president, a wholesaler role in which Ms. McElroy's primary responsibility was to manage existing client relationships. She worked in the intermediary channel with banks and broker dealers to provide updates, market information, product information, and to assist intermediaries with opportunities to bring in new business to Fidelity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. McElroy had a contract with Fidelity that set forth the plan for the payment of commissions to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plan set forth the calculation of commissions, bonuses, and other incentives based on determinations by Fidelity of the plan payout. In January 2012, Fidelity informed Ms. McElroy that it had overpaid her 2011 commissions to the tune of $61,149.29. Ms. McElroy requested information about the overpayment, but no significant information was ever forthcoming. When asked to sign a repayment letter, Ms. McElroy refused. She objected to any deductions or repayment claiming it would not be legitimate. Despite her protestation, Fidelity unilaterally deducted 75% of the total amount it alleged it overpaid Ms. McElroy from her paychecks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the beginning of the summer in 2012, Ms. McElroy's supervisor, William Pickens,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   informed her that Fidelity was going to promote her by the end of that year at the next promotional cycle. The promotion was to include a title change and $50,000 more in compensation. Mr. Pickens had the same discussion with a male employee, Jason Campellone, who was functioning in the same area of responsibility as Ms. McElroy but was based in Atlanta and covered the Southeast territory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the fall of 2012, Ms. McElroy, while serving as regional vice president, informed her supervisor Mr. Perkins and his supervisor Joyce Marsilia that she was pregnant and planned to take a medical\n   leave due to her pregnancy under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A few weeks later, at the end of 2012, Mr. Pickens informed Ms. McElroy that the promotion and raise she had been expecting was not going to take place. He told her that there would be no promotions because Fidelity was experiencing challenging market conditions. Despite this representation, Fidelity promoted a male employee, James Scalisi, from a regional vice president in the direct channel of the FILMS group to vice president-the same level promotion that Fidelity had promised to Ms. McElroy. Mr. Scalisi had not asked for parental or other medical leave. Mr. Pickens acknowledged that the same economic factors that affected Ms. McElroy's promotion also affected Mr. Scalisi's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. McElroy began her FMLA leave when her child was born in the spring of 2013. In October 2013, after she returned from her FMLA leave, she initially returned to her position as a regional vice president. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Pickens informed Ms. McElroy that a senior vice president in charge of managing client relationships in New York and New Jersey was vacating her position. This position was two pay grades higher than Ms. McElroy's. He asked Ms. McElroy to cover this position on a temporary basis while they searched for a permanent employee. Fidelity describes this as a reward \"for ten years of solid work by giving her the interim opportunity to take over a job two grades above her current role, with the hope that she would win the spot on a permanent basis.\" ECF No. 20-1 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. McElroy agreed, despite the fact that she considered this position less desirable than her existing position, as it entailed extra travel and increased work responsibilities while a new parent. Ms. McElroy served in this position for eight months yet she never received the position's $375,000 established base salary (which was $200,000 greater than the base salary of her old position).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2014, Ms. McElroy informed Mr. Pickens and Ms. Marsilia that she would not apply to fill permanently the position she was temporarily occupying and that she would like to return to her old job as soon as they hired someone permanently. Four months later, Ms. McElroy again inquired about the status of Fidelity filling the position so that she could return to her regular position. She explained that this temporary position was causing her undue hardship. Mr. Pickens told Ms. McElroy that Fidelity had eliminated her old position, despite having assured her for weeks that it was open and that Fidelity was holding it open for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. McElroy resigned in May 2014. She claims that Fidelity constructively discharged her. She did not receive any severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. McElroy filed suit against Fidelity and FFAS. She alleges in her suit that Fidelity: 1) discriminated against her for being pregnant and for notifying her boss that she planned to become pregnant again at some point in the future; 2) retaliated against her because she previously took and would likely again take FMLA leave; and 3) breached its contract with her by recouping tens of thousands of dollars of an alleged commission overpayment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fidelity and FFAS have moved for summary judgment (ECF No. 20), to which Ms. McElroy objects (ECF No. 34), and the Defendants reply (ECF No. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Summary judgment is a drastic remedy because it deprives the parties of the opportunity to have a jury determine the outcome as enshrined in the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Colman v.

Ms. McElroy does not present any factual evidence or legal support for a separate claim against this division of Fidelity. In fact, Ms. McElroy does not dispute the fact that \"FFAS is not and never was[ ] a distinct corporate entity.\" ECF No. 21 \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 1 (not disputing this fact).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion for Summary Judgment as to Defendant FFAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Breach of Contract Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. McElroy asserts that Fidelity breached the Employee Compensation Plan with her by its \"unilateral assertion ... to seek reimbursement of what it claims were excess commissions/incentives paid to Ms. McElroy ... as a result of what [Fidelity] claims was a manual administrative error.\" ECF No. 34-1 at 12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 49-54 (Count VI). Fidelity avers that Ms. McElroy did not bring this claim for wages within the applicable statute of limitations. Ms. McElroy counters that this \"is not a claim for unpaid wages,\" but rather a breach of a contractual obligation to Ms. McElroy \"under the terms of the variable compensation plan, by denying her the contractual benefits to which she was due.\" ECF No. 34-1 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Fidelity's argument turns on whether this is actually a breach of contract claim or a Rhode Island Payment of Wages Act claim. The Payment of Wages Act allows \"[a]ny employee or former employee ... aggrieved by the failure to pay wages and/or benefits or misclassification in violation of chapter 28-12 and/or 28-14\" to bring suit to obtain relief. R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 28-14-19.2(a). However, the statute of limitations for such a claim is only three years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10501865\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/13/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-14-19.2(g). Fidelity claims that this three-year limitations period-not the ten-year period applicable to breach of contract claims-controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Rhode Island Supreme Court instructs that, in analyzing a claim for purposes of determining the appropriate statute of limitation, the Court is to \"look to the substance of a claim, rather than the pleading's nomenclature.\"\n   <em>\n    Bisbano v.

Ms. McElroy's claim that Fidelity deducted alleged overpayment of commissions is a claim by her for wages under the state statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 28-14-1(4) (\" 'Wages' means all amounts at which the labor or service rendered is recompensed, whether the amount is fixed or ascertained on a time, task, piece,\n   <em>\n    commission basis,\n   </em>\n   or other method of calculating the amount.\" (emphasis added) ). There is no doubt that the substance of Ms. McElroy's claim for breach of contract is one for wages, and that her wages included commissions. Therefore, the three-year statute of limitations contained in the state Payment of Wages Act applies. Because Fidelity notified Ms. McElroy in January 2012 that it sought reimbursement for overpaid wages (ECF No. 21 \u00b6 85), and Ms. McElroy did not bring her Complaint until June 2015 (ECF No. 1-1), the applicable three-year statute of limitations bars this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count VI, breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Discrimination and Retaliation Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. McElroy asserts that Fidelity discriminated and retaliated against her for being pregnant and for using FMLA leave.

Ms. McElroy offers no evidence to support that she \"opposed\" any \"protected conduct.\" For example, there is no evidence that she complained about any gender-based discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, or FMLA discrimination. Moreover, she did not oppose any discriminatory practice by Fidelity. While she asserts now that she suffered these types of discrimination, there is no evidence that she complained about them to her employer and that Fidelity took some adverse action as a result. Because of the lack of evidence that Ms. McElroy opposed a discriminatory practice, her claims for retaliation under FEPA, RICRA, and Title VII must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

This is especially true in combination with the fact that Fidelity promised Ms. McElroy the promotion before she told them she was pregnant. A jury could reasonably decide that being promised a promotion, then telling her supervisors she is pregnant, and then being denied a promised promotion-occurring in a matter of weeks-is sufficient to establish causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To summarize, Ms. McElroy has established a prima facie case of discrimination and FMLA retaliation in being denied a promotion.

Having set forth a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the lack of promotion, the Court turns to Ms. McElroy's attempt to establish that this nondiscriminatory reason was merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

And then [Fidelity] had someone voluntarily vacate a territory in the southwest, and [Fidelity] asked [Mr. Scalisi] to take that territory in addition to his current territory, so he was basically covering twice the amount of clients and territory as other people.

Ms. McElroy suggests that she was forced to resign because Fidelity told her that it eliminated her specific regional vice president position. However, there is no evidence that there would not be another suitable position available for Ms. McElroy once the temporary position ended. Ms. McElroy made the voluntary decision to resign without first engaging in any kind of conversation about opportunities for her future at Fidelity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although some cases have held that after a job is eliminated, a plaintiff who quits may have a claim for constructive discharge, the fact here is that Ms. McElroy never got to the point where she no longer had employment at Fidelity. All she knew when she resigned was that she believed she could not return to the regional vice president role. She never sought or received any clarification from Fidelity about how long she could continue to work in the interim role or whether there would be other opportunities for her. There is no evidence in this case, and no reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, such that a reasonable employee could think that termination was imminent.
