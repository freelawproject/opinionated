WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Norman Whitt, Jr., as the administrator of the Estate of Norman Whitt, Sr. (\"Whitt\"), brings this action against defendant Kaleida Health (\"Defendant\" or \"Kaleida Health\"), for claims arising out of Whitt's employment at Kaleida Health. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. (Dkt. 23). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is granted in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The summary judgment evidence shows the following facts, which are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant, a health care provider in Western New York, was formed in 1998 after the merger of various health care entities, including Buffalo General Hospital. (Dkt. 23-1 (\"Def. Stmt.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Dkt. 29 (\"Whitt Stmt.\") at \u00b6 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The integration of various hospitals into the Kaleida Health system occurred over a number of years, and the majority of incumbent staff transitioned during 1999 and early 2000. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whitt, an African American, began working for Buffalo General Hospital on June 17, 1985. (Dkt. 20 at \u00b6 6; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 3; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 3). He began working for Kaleida Health in its Clinical Engineering Department on July 1, 1999. (Def.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stmt. at \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 3). At all times working as a Clinical Engineering Specialist, Whitt reported to Peter Castronova (\"Castronova\"), who is the Manager of Clinical Engineering. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 4; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 4). During his employment, Whitt's position was referred to by different names, such as \"Physiological Equipment Specialist and Physiological Data Specialist,\" but the job duties remained the same. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 4 n.1; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Clinical Engineering Department oversees the distribution and maintenance of various pieces of medical equipment throughout the Kaleida Health system. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 13). Castronova oversaw the daily management and operation of the Clinical Engineering Department, including setting work priorities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The various positions within the department, all of whom reported to Castronova, were as follows: Clinical Engineering Specialists; Senior Biomedical Equipment Technicians; Biomedical Equipment Technicians; and Network Cable Specialists. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 14). It is not clear from the record how each of those positions differed from each other, if at all. For example, Defendant asserts-and Whitt does not dispute-that \"there were several areas of overlap\" between the jobs of Clinical Engineering Specialist and Senior Biomedical Technicians, although the Senior Biomedical Technicians had different responsibilities. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 67;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Whitt took extended medical leaves of absence during his employment, including the following: (1) October 2000 to February 2003; (2) September 30, 2005, to August 6, 2007; (3) January 24, 2008, to February 4, 2008; and (4) February 21, 2008, to March 18, 2008. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 5). Whitt did not return from a final medical leave of absence that began on September 30, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Disparate Pay Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following facts are relevant to Plaintiff's disparate pay claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Overall Seniority of Clinical Engineering Specialists and Comparators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whitt was the third-most senior Clinical Engineering Specialist, based on the date that he was hired by a predecessor to Kaleida Health, which was June 17, 1985. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 44; Pl Stmt. at \u00b6 44; Dkt. 23-17 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). Two individuals, both Caucasian Clinical Engineering Specialists, had several years' more overall seniority than Whitt: Bruce Kovach (\"Kovach\"), whose seniority date was January 23, 1968, and Robert Sobkowiak (\"Sobkowiak\"), whose seniority date was August 11, 1971. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 44; Pl Stmt. at \u00b6 44; Dkt. 23-17 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). The remainder of the Clinical Engineering Specialists-who, with the exception of Debra Fayson (\"Fayson\"), were Caucasian-had less seniority than Whitt. (Def. Stmt. \u00b6 44; Pl Stmt. \u00b6 44; Dkt. 23-17 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Dkt. 35-12 at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed below, the parties dispute whether three individuals are comparators: Rick Seaton (\"Seaton\"), Douglas Bellanti (\"Bellanti\"), and John Wisniewski (\"Wisniewski\"). Seaton, having been hired by a predecessor to Kaleida Health in April of 1981, had more overall seniority than Whitt. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 66; Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 50; Dkt. 23-17 at \u00b6 50). Bellanti's overall seniority date is not entirely clear from the record, but a Kaleida Health performance assessment lists his \"hire date\" as January 8, 1991. (Dkt. 29-3 at 2). John Wisniewski, whose seniority date was February 13, 1995, was less senior than Whitt. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 44; Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 54; Dkt. 35-12 at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Historical Pay Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Whitt returned from medical leave on February 9, 2003, his rate of pay\n   was $25.15 per hour. (Dkt. 23-15 at 2). At that time, two individuals earned more than Whitt: Kovach, who earned $26.12 per hour, and Wisniewski, who earned $25.56 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 3). Two less-senior Caucasian Clinical Engineering Specialists earned the same rate of pay as Whitt: Anthony Sebastiano (\"Sebastiano\") and Jeffrey Ward (\"Ward\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3). Six Clinical Engineering Specialists earned less than Whitt: (1) Sobkowiak, who is Caucasian, earned $24.67 per hour; (2) John Perusich (\"Perusich\"), who is Caucasian, earned $24.50 per hour; (3) Fayson, who is African American, earned $23.54 per hour; (4) Mark Wujek (\"Wujek\"), who is Caucasian, earned $24.01 per hour; (5) Scott Schultz (\"Schultz\"), who is Caucasian, earned $24.50 per hour; and (6) Kenneth Cerra (\"Cerra\"), who is Caucasian, earned $23.08 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 1, 2003, some employees, excluding Fayson and Schultz, received pay raises. (Dkt. 23-15 at 1-5). As a result of this pay raise, Whitt earned $25.67 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). At that time, three individuals, all Caucasian, earned more than Whitt: Kovach, who earned $27.43 per hour; Sobkowiak, who earned $25.90 per hour; and Wisniewski, who earned $26.07 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 3, 5). Two individuals, both Caucasian, earned the same rate of pay as Whitt: Sebastiano and Ward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3). Five individuals earned less than Whitt: (1) Perusich, who earned $24.99 per hour; (2) Fayson, who did not receive a raise and still earned $23.54 per hour; (3) Wujek, who earned $24.49 per hour; (4) Schultz, who did not receive a raise and still earned $24.50 per hour; and (5) Cerra, who earned $23.54 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 16, 2004, most employees, excluding Fayson, received pay raises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5). As a result of this pay raise, Whitt earned $26.19 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). At that time, two individuals earned more than Whitt: Kovach, who earned $27.98 per hour, and Sobkowiak, who earned $26.43 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5). Once again, Sebastiano and Ward earned the same rate of pay as Whitt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3). Five individuals earned less than Whitt: (1) Perusich, who earned $25.49 per hour; (2) Fayson, who did not receive a raise and still earned $23.54 per hour; (3) Wujek, who earned $24.98 per hour; (4) Schultz, who earned $24.99 per hour; and (5) Cerra, who earned $24.01 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4). Wisniewski, who earned $26.60 per hour, had a higher rate of pay than Whitt at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). According to Kaleida Health, before the raises went into effect on May 16, 2004, Wisniewski transitioned from a \"Specialist\" to the title of Cardiopulmonary Equipment Specialist. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 35-7 at 4-5 (Wisniewski's performance evaluation, dated May 10, 2004, showing title of \"Cardiopulmonary Equipment Specialist\"), 6-7 (Wisniewski's performance evaluation, dated March 23, 2003, showing title of \"Specialist\") ). Defendant argues that Wisniewski was therefore no longer a comparator. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 35 at \u00b6 11). However, Defendant's record of salary histories reflects only one job code and title, which are the same as Whitt's: Clinical Engineering Specialist, with job code 532000. (Dkt. 23-15 at 3). Also, Castronova remained as Whitt's supervisor. (Dkt. 35-7 at 4, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 1, 2005, employees received pay raises. At that time, Whitt earned $26.98 per hour. (Dkt. 23-15 at 2). Once again, Kovach and Sobkowiak, both Caucasian, earned more than Whitt; Kovach earned $28.82 per hour, and Sobkowiak earned $27.22 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5). Also once again, Sebastiano and Ward earned the same pay rate as Whitt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3). Five individuals earned less than Whitt: (1) Perusich, who earned $26.25 per hour; (2) Fayson, who earned $24.25 per hour; (3) Wujek, who earned $25.73 per hour; (4) Schultz, who earned $25.74 per hour; and (5) Cerra, who earned $24.73 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4). Wisniewski earned $27.40 per hour, which was more than Whitt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 6, 2005, George Militello (\"Militello\"), who is Caucasian, entered the position of Clinical Engineering Specialist and earned $26.85 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). On September 19, 2005, Frank Sacco (\"Sacco\"), who is Caucasian, entered the position of Clinical Engineering Specialist and earned $24.73 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Both Militello and Sacco earned less than Whitt when they entered the position. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 30, 2006, employees received pay raises. At that time, Whitt's rate of pay increased to $28.06, although he was on an extended leave of absence at that time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). As before, Kovach and Sobkowiak earned more than Whitt; Kovach earned $29.97 per hour, while Sobkowiak earned $28.31 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5). Also as before, Sebastiano and Ward had the same rate of pay as Whitt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3). The following employees had pay rates that were less than Whitt's: (1) Perusich, who was paid $27.30 per hour; (2) Fayson, who was paid $25.22 per hour; (3) Sacco, who was paid $25.72 per hour; (4) Militello, who was paid $27.92 per hour; (5) Wujek, who was paid $26.76 per hour; (6) Schultz, who was paid $26.77 per hour; and (7) Cerra, who was paid $25.72 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4). Wisniewski was paid $28.50 per hour, which was more than Whitt earned at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 29, 2007, employees, excluding Whitt, receive pay raises. At that time, Whitt was on an extended leave of absence, and his rate of pay remained stagnant at $28.06 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The following six employees had rates of pay higher than Whitt's: (1) Kovach, who was paid $31.03 per hour; (2) Sobkowiak, who was paid $29.30 per hour; (3) Perusich, who was paid $28.26 per hour; (4) Sebastiano, who was paid $29.05 per hour; (5) Militello, who was paid $28.91 per hour; and (6) Cerra, who was paid $28.30 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5). Wisniewski earned $29.50 per hour, which was also more than Whitt at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The following four employees had rates of pay lower than Whitt's: (1) Fayson, who earned $26.11 per hour; (2) Wujek, who earned $27.70 per hour; (3) Schultz, who earned $27.71 per hour; and (4) Sacco, who earned $26,62 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Those rates of pay for Whitt's co-workers were in effect when Whitt returned from an extended leave of absence on August 7, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5). According to Defendant, \"[d]espite the near two-year absence from the workplace, in 2007, Whitt's salary increased to $29.18 per hour when he returned, an increase of 8.15%.\" (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 53; Dkt. 23-17 at \u00b6 38). Whitt does not specifically disagree with this factual assertion, but points out that \"Kaleida represents that Mr. Whitt's hourly was $29.18 even though its own Exhibit M shows that his hourly rate was only $28.06.\" (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 53). That exhibit shows salary histories only through April 29, 2007. (Dkt. 23-15). Defendant also cites the declaration of Susan Passmore, Human Resources Director, as evidentiary support. (Dkt. 23-17 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 38). Moreover, among Defendant's exhibits submitted in reply is a printout showing Whitt's pay rate history, including his rate of pay in effect on August 7, 2007. (Dkt. 35-8). According to that document, Whitt's rate of pay was increased to $29.18 per hour as of April 29, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Whitt also asserts that Seaton and Bellanti are comparators. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29 at 5; Dkt. 30 at 10). Defendant included neither Seaton nor Bellanti with the comparators in its original moving papers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to Defendant, although Bellanti held the position of Clinical Engineering\n   Specialist until November 5, 2000, he later had a different title-Clinical Lab Instrument Specialist-with a different job code. (Dkt. 29-3 at 3-4 (Bellanti's April 2005 performance assessment showing title of \"Clinical Lab Equipment Specialist\"), 5 (July 2004 letter offering Bellanti position of \"Clinical Lab Instrument Specialist\"), 6 (July 2004 email showing Bellanti's title of Clinical Lab Instrument Specialist and job code); Dkt. 35-5 (Defendant's Reply exhibit showing different job code as of November 5, 2000) ). Bellanti's rate of pay was higher than Whitt's, but Defendant maintains that the reason for the higher pay rate was that it was necessary to recruit Bellanti back to Kaleida Health after he had left Kaleida Health for a period of time. (Dkt. 29-3 at 8-10 (emails discussing salary offer necessary to recruit Bellanti); Dkt. 35 at \u00b6 7; Dkt. 35-6 at 3 (showing history of Bellanti's pay rates as consistently higher than Whitt's) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant argues in its reply papers that Rick Seaton was not included as a comparator because he did not hold the position of Clinical Engineering Specialist until July 8, 2007; before that, his title was \"Senior Technician Biomed Equipment.\" (Dkt. 35 at \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-5 at 1 (showing Seaton as having Clinical Engineering Specialist job code as of July 8, 2007) ). When Seaton entered the position of Clinical Engineering Specialist in July of 2007, his pay rate was $29.54 per hour, which was higher than Whitt's at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-5 at 2 (Seaton's pay rate history),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 35-8 at 2 (Whitt's pay rate history) ). Furthermore, Seaton's pay rate had been consistently higher than Whitt's when Seaton was in the position of Senior Technician Biomed Equipment. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-5 at 2,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 35-8 at 2). Defendant states that, \"[w]hile [Seaton's] pay when he entered into the position was slightly higher than Whitt's, he did not receive a pay raise at the time of his promotion, waiting nearly a year until his next raise.\" (Dkt. 35 at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reduction in Job Duties Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The following facts are relevant to Whitt's claim of racial discrimination based on a reduction in job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant maintains that Whitt had no direct reports, but Whitt disputes this as misleading based on his position description, certain email exchanges, and a past performance assessment. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 14; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 14). Whitt contends that, although his position description states that he did not have any subordinate staff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23-12 (Ex. J, position description) ), it also states that the position requires leadership \"[c]onsistent with experience and opportunity\" and that he must \"[p]erform instructional activities that will assist other biomedical technicians in learning and performing preventive maintenance procedures and corrective troubleshooting and repair processes\" and \"[m]entor[ ] and instruct[ ] junior personnel ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also points to email exchanges with other employees, suggesting that those employees received instructions from and reported to him. (Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-6 (email exchanges) ). Whitt also points to a 2005 performance assessment in which Defendant identified \"managerial skills training\" as an area of development for Whitt. (Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 14; Dkt. 23-11 (Ex. I, performance assessment) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A disciplinary incident in September 2005 preceded an alleged reduction in Whitt's job duties. Kaleida Health was expecting a shipment of beds to arrive on September 23, 2005. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 55; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 55). The beds required preventative maintenance checks. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 55; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 55). By email on September 15, 2005, Whitt asked Castronova for two or three additional employees\n   to assist Whitt with the preventative maintenance checks. (Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 55; Dkt. 23-8 at 6 (Email to Castronova) ). Castronova assigned one additional staff member to assist Whitt. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 55; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 55; Dkt. 23-8 at 4-6). On September 22, 2005, one day before the beds' arrival, a confrontational telephone conversation took place between Whitt and Castronova, although the parties disagree on the details of the exchange. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 55-57; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 55-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to Castronova, Whitt called Castronova and asked for additional assistance with the preventative maintenance checks. (Dkt. 23-10 at 1). Whitt explained that another employee was off work in the morning when the checks needed to begin, and that Whitt had a number of other projects to attend to at the same time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Castronova alleges that Whitt became agitated, and Castronova told Whitt that the preventative maintenance checks were his only priority for the next day and that Castronova would attend to other service calls at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Castronova further alleges that Whitt \"became very loud and uncooperative stating that he was simply giving [Castronova] the courtesy of telling what was going on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Castronova alleges that he asked Whitt to confirm whether he understood the instructions, and Whitt responded, \"Peter, do you know who [you're] talking to, I ain't no kid!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Whitt allegedly hung up on Castronova. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Whitt presents a competing version of the phone call, as documented in a complaint to Human Resources. According to Whitt, he did not tell Castronova that he could not attend the preventative maintenance checks; rather, he stated that he may have to leave if \"something comes up that is priority.\" (Dkt. 23-8 at 2; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 56). Whitt alleges that Castronova asked what Whitt considered his priority to be, and when Whitt answered, \"Nurse Station Monitor failures, Telemetry units, etc.,\" Castronova became annoyed and loudly told Whitt to do the preventative maintenance checks. (Dkt. 23-8 at 2; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 56). Whitt responded that he was just informing Castronova about potential issues, and Castronova demanded that Whitt answer him \"yes or no\" as to whether he would do the preventative maintenance checks. (Dkt. 23-8 at 2; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 56). Whitt felt that comment was disrespectful and demeaning. (Dkt. 23-8 at 2; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On the day of the beds' arrival, Whitt was present for the beginning of the preventative maintenance checks, but he later left. (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 59; Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 59). Whitt maintains that he did so because an additional employee was there to help with the assignment, so Whitt went to attend to other tasks. (Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 59; Dkt. 23-8 at 3). On September 26, 2005, Defendant issued Whitt a written warning for insubordination, alleging that Whitt engaged in \"[a]busive language\" toward his supervisor and [n]on-professional communication and phone etiquette,\" and did not \"perform reasonable requests of a supervisor\" by not following Castronova's direction to remain through the completion of the preventative maintenance checks. (Dkt. 23-10 at 1; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 60;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Whitt Stmt. at \u00b6 60). According to the written warning, Whitt was \"immediately removed from his current area of responsibility until further notice.\" (Dkt. 23-10 at 1). Defendant maintains that \"Castronova decided to move responsibility for coordinating requests for services and workflow at Buffalo General Medical Center from a single person, which had been Whitt, to the entire group of Clinical Engineering Specialists working at the site,\" such that Whitt shared the responsibility with the other Clinical Engineering Specialists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 62). Indeed, in its answer to Whitt's complaint, Defendant \"admits that, as a result of a written warning issued on September 30, 2005 based on Plaintiff's insubordinate behavior, Plaintiff was removed from serving as 'point person' ....\" (Dkt. 4 at 6). According to Whitt, he was relegated to processing paperwork, based on an email from Castronova instructing Whitt to \"transfer all outstanding work activity to Bob Kawalerski\" and to \"catch up on all work order documentation\" as his assignment for the following day. (Dkt. 29-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On October 13, 2005, Whitt submitted a problem resolution request concerning the incident involving the preventative maintenance checks. (Dkt. 23-8). He claimed that he was suffering \"disparity, harassment and abusive language\" from Castronova. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). In it, Whitt recounted his version of the incident and requested that Castronova withdraw the \"bogus\" written warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Whitt also stated that Castronova was hostile to him, disliked him, and had never treated him fairly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Whitt requested that \"someone come[ ] in to take a look at this situation as well as speak to other African Americans regarding how [Castronova] is treating them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Plaintiff filed the instant action in this Court, after the EEOC issued a determination, dated September 3, 2009, that there was reason to believe that violations of Title VII had occurred, followed by a right-to-sue letter dated March 17, 2015. (Dkt. 1). Defendant filed an answer on August 12, 2015. (Dkt. 4). On October 26, 2016, Plaintiff moved to amend the complaint and caption on the basis that, when the complaint was filed, the name of the administrator of Whitt's estate was omitted by oversight. (Dkt. 18). Magistrate Judge Foschio granted the motion (Dkt. 19), and Plaintiff filed an amended complaint that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , changed the caption and some references to Mr. Whitt in certain paragraphs. (Dkt. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant moved for summary judgment on March 14, 2017. (Dkt. 23). Plaintiff responded on May 5, 2017. (Dkt. 29 (Response); Dkt. 30 (Memorandum) ).

Oral argument was held before the undersigned on November 27, 2017, at which time the Court directed the parties to submit post-hearing letter briefs and reserved decision. (Dkt. 38).

Abandoned and Newly-Raised Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Whitt's Amended Complaint raises the following claims: (1) race discrimination, which included \"a lower pay rate, a demeaning work location, being denied promotions, training and overtime opportunities, and being subjected to undeserved discipline, including without limitation, written warning and demotion, and he was assaulted and subjected to verbal abusive language\" (Dkt. 20 at \u00b6 16); and (2) retaliation that ensued after he filed his EEOC charge in December 2005 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). He asserts two causes of action: discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-30), and discrimination and retaliation in violation of NYSHRL (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In its summary judgment motion, Defendant raises three primary arguments: (1) Whitt failed to exhaust administrative remedies regarding his race discrimination claims arising out of failure to promote, denial of training and overtime, a demeaning work location, and pay disparity; (2) Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Whitt's race discrimination claims-including failure to promote, denial of training and overtime, pay disparity, a demeaning work location, undeserved discipline, and abusive language; and (3) Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on his retaliation claims. (Dkt. 23-19 at 6-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In opposition to summary judgment, Whitt characterizes his complaint as asserting the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Whitt ...brings this race discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation claim for unequal pay compared to Caucasian comparators, a material reduction in job duties as the result of a scheme by his supervisor, Peter Castronova, harassment by Mr. Castronova and retaliation resulting in the loss of all of Mr. Whitt's job duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Dkt. 30 at 1). He argues that he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to a race-based pay disparity claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5). He then argues that he \"put forth sufficient evidence to establish that race was a motivating factor in the adverse employment actions taken against [him] and that he endured a racially hostile work environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). His argument that he can establish a prima facie case of race discrimination focuses on his disparate pay claim, as well as his claim that he experienced a material reduction in duties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-15). Next, he argues that he can establish a hostile work environment claim \"based on his allegations of repeated disparate and rude treatment at the hands of Mr. Castronova.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). Finally, he addresses his retaliation claim, which he characterizes as follows: \"\n   <em>\n    Following discovery\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Whitt's retaliation allegations narrowed to his July 2005 complaint to Mr. Castronova and the removal of his supervisory preventative maintenance duties and then the removal of all of his 'areas of responsibility.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Abandoned Race Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, as Defendant rightly argues in reply (Dkt. 35-12 at 1-2), Whitt has abandoned certain race discrimination claims that he had asserted in his amended complaint by failing to address them in opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment. Where, as here, a counseled non-moving party submits \"a partial response arguing that summary judgment should be denied as to some claims while not mentioning others,\" the Court may\n   deem that the response is \"an abandonment of the unmentioned claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Newly Raised Hostile Work Environment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, nowhere in Whitt's complaint does he allege a claim of \"hostile work environment,\" as he attempts to do in opposition to summary judgment.

Abandoned and Newly Raised Retaliation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Third, Defendant rightly argues (Dkt. 32-12 at 7-9) that Whitt's opposition brief fails to address the retaliation claim that he actually pleaded in his amended complaint-based on the filing of his EEOC charge-and argues, for the first time, that he experienced retaliation based on a July 2005 complaint to Castronova. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24 (amended complaint alleging retaliation based on filing EEOC charge); Dkt. 30 at 23-25 (claiming that retaliation claim is based on a July 2005 complaint to Castronova) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Whitt's post-hearing letter brief argues that he alleged the latter retaliation claim in his amended complaint; in his view, paragraphs 18 and 19 alleged that \"in 2005, after he lost some job duties, he complained to human resources about treatment from his supervisor, but nothing was done.\" (Dkt. 39 at 1). Paragraphs 18 and 19-set forth in the section of his complaint entitled \"Race Discrimination Against Mr. Whitt\" (Dkt. 20 at 3) rather than the section entitled \"Retaliation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5)-state as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   18. Mr. Whitt lost additional duties after he returned to work and this continued in 2005. Mr. Rick Seaton, displaced from Brooks Memorial\n   Hospital, was brought to Buffalo General Hospital and placed into a Senior Tech position that supervised a Preventative Maintenance team throughout the Kaleida system. Prior to this, Mr. Whitt and other techs performed PM duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   19. Mr. Whitt was treated differently in regards to treatment and receiving respect. Mr. Peter Castronova, the Corporate Manager for Clinical Engineering, on numerous occasions, became irate with Mr. Whitt and cursed and screamed at him. Mr. Castronova did not treat the Caucasian Specialist in this manner.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Whitt communicated his concerns to the Human Resources Department, but nothing was done\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Those paragraphs' reference to Whitt's complaint to Human Resources, made at an unspecified time, is insufficient to allege a claim of retaliation. Whereas he explicitly asserts that he \"filed a complaint with the EEOC in December, 2005 regarding discrimination\" and \"was retaliated against as a direct result of the complaint\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23), Whitt sets forth no equivalent allegations with respect to his July 2005 complaint to Castronova as set out in his opposition brief (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"430375\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/236/522/#p525\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). This is insufficient to state a claim of retaliation arising out of the July 2005 complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. City of Norwalk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20Fed.%20Appx.%2025\">\n    562 Fed.Appx. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29 (2d Cir. 2014) (\"To succeed on a retaliation claim ... the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case by showing: '(1) participation in a protected activity; (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hicks v. Baines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517031\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/159/#p164\">\n    593 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (2d Cir. 2010) ). Indeed, Whitt's opposition brief seems to concede that the retaliation claim is newly raised: \"\n   <em>\n    Following discovery\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Whitt's retaliation allegations narrowed to his July 2005 complaint to Mr. Castronova and the removal of his supervisory preventative maintenance duties and then the removal of all of his 'areas of responsibility.' \" (Dkt. 30 at 23 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, Whitt has not only abandoned his retaliation claim based on the EEOC charge, but he has also inappropriately raised the retaliation claim arising out of his July 2005 complaint to Castronova for the first time in opposition to summary judgment. As a result, the Court does not consider that retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lyman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20Fed.%20Appx.%20699\">\n    364 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   701 ;\n   <em>\n    Greenidge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2838828\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/356/#p361\">\n    446 F.3d at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant argues that Whitt's EEOC charge did not refer at all to claims of pay disparity, and, as a result, Whitt failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim that he was paid less than Caucasian workers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 23-19 at 3-5). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Whitt's charge of discrimination stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   I began working for the Respondent in or around June 1985.

The three-year limitations period, with the addition of the tolling period of nine years, two months, two weeks, and three days, renders NYSHRL claims based on events after March 31, 2003, timely.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sloth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4313064\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/883/359/#p373\">\n    883 F.Supp.2d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to Plaintiff's claim of race discrimination based on a reduction in job duties, Plaintiff's counterstatement of undisputed facts describes the complaint as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The Complaint does not only allege that the demotion occurred after he received discipline stemming from the\n   <em>\n    September 2005 incident\n   </em>\n   , as Kaleida contends, but also that he was demoted upon his return to work in\n   <em>\n    February 2003\n   </em>\n   following Mr. Whitt's leave of absence that began in October 2000, including having his position broken up and his authority reduced and having supervisory job duties taken away, including the oversight of technicians who performed preventative maintenance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (Dkt. 29 at \u00b6 11 (emphasis added) (citing Dkt. 20 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14, 17-18) ). In paragraph 14 of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that, when he returned from a medical leave of absence that began in 2000, he \"was no longer the Data Specialist for all five hospitals. Defendant had promoted four Senior Techs, all Caucasian, into the other four positions.\" (Dkt. 20 at \u00b6 14).

In paragraph 18, he alleges as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Mr. Whitt lost additional duties after he returned to work and\n   <em>\n    this continued in 2005\n   </em>\n   .

Once again, Defendant does not dispute that Whitt was a member of a protected class. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 23-19 at 7 n.2). Rather, Defendant's primary objection to Whitt's claim arising out of the reduction in his job duties is that he did\n   not actually lose any job duties and thus did not suffer an adverse employment action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Whitt's job duties claim suffers from the same infirmity as his disparate pay claim.

The Second Circuit has explained the circumstances which would permit a rational trier of fact to infer a discriminatory motive as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Circumstances contributing to a permissible inference of discriminatory intent may include the employer's continuing, after discharging the plaintiff, to seek applicants from persons of the plaintiff's qualifications to fill that position, or the employer's criticism of the plaintiff's performance in ethnically degrading terms, or its invidious comments about others in the employee's protected group, or the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group, or the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff's discharge, or the timing of the discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    Dunn v.

As discussed below, Whitt has not presented any such evidence that racial discrimination motivated his employer's decision to reduce his job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In opposition to summary judgment, Whitt argues that he \"had his job duties taken away by Mr. Castronova, Caucasian, and given to other less-qualified, less senior Caucasians, for no justifiable basis.\" (Dkt. 30 at 17). Aside from his conclusory statement, he offers no evidence to support that argument or his contention that the reduction in his job duties after the discipline he received in September 2005 occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination based on race. In his counterstatement of material facts, Whitt concedes that he \"did not identify specific remarks concerning his race, but he did allege general derogatory words and actions in the same context that he requested human resources speak with African Americans.\" (Dkt. 29 at 63). Without evidentiary support, this is insufficient to meet his burden. Moreover, the record establishes that the complained-of reduction of job duties-removing his status as the sole point person and having to share this task with all employees in his title-followed a disciplinary incident. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not set forth circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination, and his discrimination claim arising out of a material reduction in job duties fails. The Court therefore grants Defendant's summary judgment motion with respect to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Defendant's summary judgment motion in its entirety.

Civ. P. 56(a)(2). The Court cites individual paragraphs as they correspond to Defendant's Local Rule 56 Statement of Undisputed Facts, even if Whitt included his corresponding response to a specific paragraph within a range of paragraphs. For example, as seen on page 4 of Whitt's Counterstatement of Facts Under Local Rule 56, he responds to paragraphs \"15-17, 37, 44\" in a single paragraph. (Dkt. 29 at 4).

Thus, Defendant appears not to argue that Whitt failed to exhaust his claim of a reduction in job duties.
