CRENSHAW, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a putative class action brought by James and Lonnie McKinnie, and Larry and Tina Roberts on behalf of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (\"State Farm\") insureds. The core claim is that State Farm refuses to pay prime contractor's overhead and profit associated with the estimated cost to reconstruct a structure where the covered loss is $25,000 or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   State Farm has filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 29) that has been fully briefed by the parties (Doc. Nos. 30, 31 &amp; 32). For the reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The factual allegations are drawn from the controlling First Amended Complaint. Construed in Plaintiffs' favor, those facts follow, and will be supplemented where necessary for purposes of the legal analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs collectively owned two commercial structures (connected by a breeze way) located at 650 and 654 North Spring Street in Sparta, Tennessee. Those structures are insured against property loss through an insurance policy (\"Policy\") issued by State Farm. The Policy contained an endorsement providing coverage on an \"actual cash value\" valuation basis, i.e. replacement cash value less depreciation. (Doc. No. 25, First Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 10, 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 14, 2015, Plaintiffs' buildings suffered extensive damage as a result of a hail storm. The damage affected the entire roof of both structures (more than 200,000 square feet), necessitating their replacement, as well as the replacement of skylights, ridge end caps, ridge vents, ridge cap flashing, eave trim, gable trim, and other items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two days after the storm, State Farm inspected the damage and determined the loss was covered under the Policy. Thereafter, State Farm issued multiple estimates for the property damage utilizing Xactimate, a software estimating program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The most recent estimate was received by Plaintiffs on June 2, 2017. State Farm\n   determined that the replacement cost value for the damage to the building located at 654 North Spring Street was $556,354.26, which was reduced to $479,993.39 after depreciation. According to the estimate, reconstruction would require approximately 55 hours of \"commercial supervision/project management\" time, as defined by the Xactimate software program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   State Farm also determined that the replacement cost value for the property damage at 650 North Spring Street was $419,768.97, which was reduced to $362,932.66 after depreciation. According to this estimate, reconstruction for this building would also require approximately 55 hours of \"commercial supervision/project management\" time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Commercial supervision/project management\" time is defined in the Xactimate software as the time required \"to manage commercial jobs where Supervision/Project Management is needed to coordinate the work of subcontractors, or perform other project management duties.\" Further, \"[a] Superintendent/Project Manager may complete tasks such as, but not limited to, create/maintain project schedules, coordinate/meet trades, order materials, inspect job sites, obtain permits, meet with inspectors, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the cover page of each estimate, State Farm provides written guidance concerning the Structural Damage Claim Policy.\" It stated that, \"[d]epending upon the complexity of your repair, our estimate may or may not include an allowance for general contractor's overhead and profit. If you have questions regarding general contractor's overhead and profit and whether general contractor services are appropriate for your loss, please contact your claim representative before proceeding with repairs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs contacted Titan Exteriors, Inc. for an estimate of the cost to repair the damaged roofs. Titan is licensed by the Tennessee Board of Licensing Contractors to act as a \"prime contractor\" with respect to commercial building reconstruction in Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Titan, which also used Xactimate, came up with an estimate significantly higher than that of State Farm. When overhead and profit are included, the difference was more than $270,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94). Even without overhead and profit, Titan's figure was more than $60,000 higher because State Farm failed to include eave trim, light fixtures, pipe boots and other items in its estimate, and failed to provide payment for temporary repair costs incurred in replacing skylight panels that were needed to prevent additional damage to the roof deck and interior of the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs further allege that, as result of State Farm's failure to promptly adjust and pay the amounts owed, they have been damaged because of the increase in pricing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs sought payment for the omitted licensed prime contractors' overhead and profit from State Farm. State Farm has refused to pay those amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both with respect to their individual claims and that of the class they seek to represent, Plaintiffs contend that State Farm's pattern and practice is to fail to pay overhead and expenses when a prime contractor is required by Tennessee law to perform repairs. It does this by manipulating Xactimate. That is, even though Xactimate allows an insurance adjuster to\n   choose whether to provide full payment for a prime contractor's overhead and profit when calculating replacement cost value, State Farm intentionally changes the settings to omit overhead and profit for a prime contractor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-55). In so doing, State Farm eliminates \"payments for all overhead that is not directly attributable to an individual construction project, such as general expenses, payroll expenses, office and building rent and maintenance, management and ownership wages and benefits, utilities, office supplies, salaries for office and sales personnel, office equipment, payroll and construction related software, the costs of ongoing licensure, training of employees, full-time employment of a qualifying agent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   audit, accounting, tax and legal fees, advertising, and as profit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Instead of paying proper overhead and profit when a prime contractor is necessary, State Farm pays only \"job-related\" overhead. Such overhead is the type incurred by a single, unlicensed tradesman or a small, unlicensed subcontractor working a job and is directly related to the job. Examples include a temporary power line to a jobsite, or the depreciation of a tradesman's hand-tools. It does not include the overhead, such as the retention of a QA, as well as having the necessary ongoing business liquidity and business assets unrelated to a job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [a]ll persons and legal entities insured under a State Farm homeowner or property policy insuring property in Tennessee, and for these policyholders: (1) State Farm determined that the policyholder suffered direct physical loss to a dwelling or other structure located in Tennessee that State Farm determined was covered by the terms of the policy; (2) the estimated costs to make the repairs caused by the covered loss met or exceeded one or more of the thresholds set by the Tennessee Contractor's Licensing Act and mandate that those performing work to repair or replace the damaged property hold a valid Tennessee contractor's license and be a \"prime contractor\"; and (3) State Farm refused to pay the policyholder for overhead and profit as more fully described herein in its adjusting/settlement of the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \"construe[s] the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept[s] its allegations as true, and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Directv, Inc. v.

Class Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court agrees with State Farm that Plaintiffs' class claim has been a moving target. As initially filed, Count I sought to recover for the failure to pay contractor's overhead and profit. In substance, Count I alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   62. State Farm failed to pay for contractor's overhead and profit even when the size of the underlying project required contractor licensure under Tennessee law by meeting or exceeding the TCLA Thresholds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   63. State Farm breached its contractual duty to pay Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class the full value of their claims by withholding contractor's overhead and profit under these limited circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   64. State Farm's actions in breaching its contractual obligations to Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class benefitted and continue to benefit State Farm. Likewise, State Farms Actions damaged and continue to damage Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Doc. No. 1-2 \u00b6\u00b6 62-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After State Farm filed a Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs' class allegations failed to state a claim because \"settled authority provides that GCOP [General Contractor Overhead and Profit] should be included in an actual cash value (\"ACV\") estimate of repair costs when it is reasonably likely that the services of a general contractor will be required,\" (Doc. No. 19 at 1), Plaintiffs responded by filing an Amended Complaint. This time the substance of the breach of contract claim on behalf of the class read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   102. State Farm failed to pay prime contractor's overhead and profit even when the size of the underlying project required licensure under Tennessee law by meeting or exceeding the TCLA Thresholds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   103. State Farm breached its contractual duty to pay Plaintiffs and members\n   of the proposed class the full value of their claims by withholding prime contractor's overhead and profit under these limited circumstances, in the manner described herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   104. State Farm's actions in breaching its contractual obligations to Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class benefitted and continue to benefit State Farm. Likewise, State Farm's actions damaged and continue to damage Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Doc. No. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 102-104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This version of Plaintiffs' class claim was reiterated in the Initial Case Management Order filed two weeks after the First Amended Complaint. There, Plaintiffs alleged that \"State Farm has a custom and practice of consistently refusing to pay prime contractor's overhead and profit in its adjustment of property damage claims that exceed the thresholds of the Tennessee Contractor Licensing Act requiring licensure to act as a 'prime contractor' under Tenn. Code 62-6-102(6).\" (Doc. No. 28 at 1). Nevertheless, in response to the present (second) Motion to Dismiss in which State Farm argued that (1) a contractor's GCOP is includable only when the insured would reasonably be expected to hire a general contractor, and (2) the reasonable necessity standard is not susceptible to class resolution, Plaintiffs couched their claim differently. Now, they argue that State Farm steadfastly refuses to pay for \"licensure-related overhead\" when a licensed prime contractor performs repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The language of the First Amended Complaint obviously controls.\n   <em>\n    Hayward v.

As factual support, Plaintiffs rely on the following allegations from the First Amended Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Subject to certain monetary limitations not at issue here, only a\n   <em>\n    licensed\n   </em>\n   contractor can contract with a building owner in the State of Tennessee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   By statute, the State calls these licensed contractors \"prime contractors\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Contractor\n   <em>\n    licensure\n   </em>\n   in the State of Tennessee requires a contractor to incur several specific categories of overhead costs. These categories of overhead, all of which are required by licensure;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   State Farm uses a commercially available computer software program to pay for property damage claims, called Xactimate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Xactimate allows for inclusion or exclusion of different categories of overhead, such as \"job-related overhead\" and \"generalized\" overhead; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   When adjusting property claims that require licensure, State Farm has manipulated Xactimate so as to exclude overhead for \"the costs of ongoing\n   <em>\n    licensure\n   </em>\n   ,\" \"any of the overhead costs associated with Tennessee\n   <em>\n    licensure\n   </em>\n   \" and the \"overhead and profit needed to operate the business of a\n   <em>\n    licensed\n   </em>\n   prime contractor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original, internal citations omitted). Leaving aside that Plaintiffs fail to explain what is meant by \"licensure-related overhead and profits,\" fail to explain how the same would be calculated, and fail to allege any facts that it is the custom and practice in Tennessee for \"prime contractors\" to charge of such expenses, their class claim fails for at least four reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, Plaintiffs mistakenly equate a \"prime contractor\" with a \"general contractor\" by citing cases like\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

While the Tennessee Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   stated that \"[t]he traditional construction relationship involves a direct contractual relationship between the owner and the general contractor who is also referred to as the prime contractor, the principal contractor, or occasionally simply as the contractor,\" the court went on to observe:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The general contractor performs the work with his own forces, through subcontractors, or with a combination of the two. Subcontractors have contracts with the general contractor, not the owner, and the general contractor is responsible\n   for scheduling, coordinating, and supervising the subcontractors' work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

Code Ann. \u00a7 62-6-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). Thus, a \"prime contractor\" could be a \"general contractor\" who contracts with the owner to hire and supervise the work of various subcontractors, or it could be a contractor (like a roofer or plumber) who simply contracts with the owner to perform all of the necessary work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilderman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706786,7877276\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/649/941/\">\n    649 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   945 ) (noting that \"there clearly are certain types of property damage claims which will not require the services of a general contractor,\" such as \"where the loss involves only a damaged pipe, and a plumber alone normally would be called to perform all necessary repairs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, the TCLA provides for a single \"contractor\" license and does not differentiate between a \"contractor,\" a \"general contractor,\" or a \"prime contractor.\" While Plaintiffs allege that \"Titan's licensure\" permits it \"to act as a 'prime contractor,' \" that license-photocopied into the First Amended Complaint-simply identifies Titan as a \"Contractor.\" (Doc. No. 25, \u00b6 35). The license does not indicate that Titan is a \"prime contractor,\" or that it is entitled to any extra benefits by virtue of such a title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Third, insofar as Plaintiffs now argue that the class is entitled to \"licensure-related overheard and profit,\" this claim is not moored to their individual claim. In Count I, Plaintiffs \"individually assert that they are entitled to payment of prime contractor's overhead and profit from State Farm because a prime contractor would be utilized to make to make repairs to their insured property in light of the scope, nature, and complexity of the work necessary as a result of the Loss, without regard to the requirements of the TCLA.\" (Doc. No. 25 \u00b6 108). That is, \"irrespective of the application of the TCLA, State Farm's failure to pay Plaintiffs['] prime contractor's overhead and profit constitutes a breach of contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In support of this \"alternative theory,\" Plaintiffs attached Titan's second estimate to the First Amended Complaint. This estimate contains line items for overhead and profit of ten percent, which are typical of a general contractor overhead and profit claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Windridge of Naperville Condo.

The district court found that the insured was not entitled to overhead and profit because it intended to utilize the services of an unlicensed general contractor. The Sixth Circuit reversed on this point, stating that the TCLA \"says nothing to the issue of whether an insured who contracts to receive the actual cash value of its lost must deduct overhead and profits because it plans to hire an unlicensed contractor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Fed.%20Appx.%20955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Fed.%20Appx.%20955\">\n    at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Ultimately, the Sixth Circuit held that the actual cash value of a loss \"includes contractor's overhead where a contractor would reasonably utilized to make repairs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Fed.%20Appx.%20955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Fed.%20Appx.%20955\">\n    at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In context, however, this was clearly shorthand for the use of the term \"general contractor.\" Not only did the appraisal award under review deal with overhead and profit for a general contractor, the Sixth Circuit relied on\n   <em>\n    Gilderman\n   </em>\n   's observation that there are some types of losses for which a general contractor might not be needed, but \" '[t]here are many instances to where the insured reasonably would be excepted to call a contractor, especially where there is extensive damage.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Fed.%20Appx.%20955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gilderman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706786,7877276\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/649/941/\">\n    649 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   945 ). Again, this is clearly shorthand for \"general contractor\" because the quoted language in\n   <em>\n    Gilderman\n   </em>\n   was immediately preceded by the observation that \"there are types of property damage where a homeowner would use the services of a general contractor,\" and immediately followed by the observation that an insured would reasonably consult such a contractor where the repairs \"[r]equire the use of more than one trade specialist.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilderman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706786,7877276\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/649/941/\">\n    649 A.2d at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Subsequent case law confirms this reading of\n   <em>\n    Parkway\n   </em>\n   .

By State Farm's own estimate, the loss was nearly $1,000,000 (minus applicable depreciation and the deductible), and completion of the project would take 20 weeks for both buildings. (Doc. No. 25, First Amended Complaint \u00b6 92). Further, State Farm itself arguably contemplated the possibility of the need for a general contractor when it wrote that, \"[d]epending upon the complexity of your repair, our estimate may or may not include an allowance for general contractor's overhead and profit,\" and then estimated that reconstruction of the loss would require approximately 55 hours of \"commercial supervision/project management time\" for each of the two buildings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23). Further, the second estimate from Titan roofing (Doc. No. 29-2) that State Farm attached to its Motion to Dismiss, and the State Farm Xactimate print-out (Doc. No. 31-1) that Plaintiffs attached to their reply, suggest the use of multiple trades, including demolition laborer, equipment operators, electrician and roofer. There is more than enough in the First Amended Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support Plaintiffs' individual breach of contract claim based on State Farm's refusal to pay overhead and profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count II-Breach of Contract-Other Contractual Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The allegations in the First Amended Complaint are also more than sufficient to support Plaintiffs' claim that State Farm breached the insurance policy contract by failing to pay for other items beyond profit and overhead. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   95. Although a portion of the differences between the estimates of State Farm and Titan are related to State Farm's failure to pay overhead and profit, other differences include, but are not limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   a. Errors in State Farm's measurements, scope, and quantities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   b.

State Farm's failure to pay for temporary repair costs incurred by Plaintiffs to replace skylight panels broken by hail in order to promptly mitigate losses and to prevent further damage to the roof deck and interior of the building. The temporary repairs totaled $9,518.79 at 654 North Spring Street (the \"Front Building\") and $9,409.23 at 650 North Spring Street (the \"Rear Building\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   96. Additionally, as result of State Farm's failure to promptly adjust and pay the amounts owed, Plaintiffs have been further damaged as a result of increases in pricing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Doc. No. 25, First Amended Complaint \u00b6 95-96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   State Farm characterizes the foregoing as \"vague allegations,\" and argues that \"plaintiffs must separately identify each aspect of their insurance claims that they assert was not paid, and explain how the alleged non-payment breached the policy.\" (Doc. No. 30 at 16). It cites no authority for that proposition, however.
