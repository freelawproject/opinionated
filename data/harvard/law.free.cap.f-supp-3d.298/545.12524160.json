(Dkt. 1). After being granted both leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and leave to file an amended complaint (Dkt. 4), on March 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint (Dkt. 6). On October 8, 2015, the claims in the Amended Complaint were dismissed as against all named defendants, except for Sergeant Keith Kastner-Smith (\"Sgt. Kastner-Smith\"), Lieutenant Amy Bouck (\"Lt. Bouck\"), and Sergeant Lorrie Gardner (\"Sgt. Gardner\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Dkt. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 52). For the following reasons, Defendants' motion is granted, and Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was confined as an inmate at the County Jail from January 3, 2013, through January 17, 2014, and from May 28, 2014, through August 27, 2014. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6 2). During his incarceration, Plaintiff received numerous \"write-ups for violations of jail rules,\" and often made violent and threatening comments, statements, and hand-drawn pictures directed towards the County Jail's employees. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). The County Jail also provides inmates with \"Inmate Medical Request Slips, which inmates may use to request medical or mental health care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25). Plaintiff frequently submitted medical requests that included graphic or hostile language towards the jail officials or white people, and often used these slips as an outlet to voice his religious and nutritional preferences. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 16-18, 64-66;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-28;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 52-4 at 20-21, 24, 27, 32-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff identifies as a Muslim, and specifically, \"a member of the Nation of Islam.\" (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-2 at 68:49-50). Plaintiff adheres to fasting traditions during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which require him to abstain from eating or drinking from dawn to dusk every day. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-2 at 67:43). The date of the alleged assault, July 10, 2014, occurred during Ramadan. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-2 at 67:43). On July 10, 2014, at about 3:30 a.m., Sgt. Kastner-Smith and Sgt. Gardner provided Plaintiff with his before-dawn meal, at which time Plaintiff complained that he had not been provided with any peanut butter. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7-8; Dkt. 52-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Sgt. Kastner-Smith and Sgt. Gardner informed Plaintiff that they would speak with the kitchen staff when the staff arrived for work later that day. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 8; Dkt. 52-6 at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At about 4:00 a.m., Officer Ryan Aldridge (\"Officer Aldridge\") began her security tour of Plaintiffs inmate housing unit when she discovered an inmate request slip under Plaintiff's cell door. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 6). Although Officer Aldridge attempted to interact with Plaintiff, Plaintiff did not respond. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 7). Plaintiff's inmate request slip complained about the lack of peanut butter provided with his meal, and then he proceeded to make hostile comments about white people and mentioned that another jail officer, Officer Hann, \"got served\" because of his conduct. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6\u00b6 27-29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-4 at 4; Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). The latter reference alluded to an inmate assault upon Officer Hann that occurred several days earlier. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 9). Plaintiff had also crossed out his vitriolic comments, apparently because he was concerned that the request might be \"considered an emotionally driven complaint rather than a legitimate complaint.\" (Dkt. 52-2 at 69:56;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-4 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After Sgt. Kastner-Smith was given the inmate request slip and had reviewed it, he returned to Plaintiff's cell, but Plaintiff refused to speak with him. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13; Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 11). Sgt. Kastner-Smith then \"slid a Grievance Form under the cell door\" to Plaintiff. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 13). Sgt. Kastner-Smith asked Lt. Bouck to review the inmate request slip due to its content and because it was addressed to a lieutenant. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 14). At that point, the jail officials decided to transfer Plaintiff to a different housing unit \"to maintain the safety and order of the facility.\" (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sgt. Kastner-Smith, Lt. Bouck, Sgt. Gardner, and Officer Eugene Kennedy (\"Officer Kennedy\") approached Plaintiff's cell, at which time Sgt. Kastner-Smith woke Plaintiff and ordered him to kneel in front of his bed, place his head on the mattress, and put his hands on his head to be handcuffed. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Dkt. 52-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 13; Dkt. 52-9 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5). Sgt. Kastner-Smith proceeded to handcuff Plaintiff (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 17), and then, when Plaintiff refused to stand on his own, Officer Kennedy and Sgt. Kastner-Smith lifted Plaintiff to his feet (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at\n   \u00b6 18; Dkt. 52-9 at \u00b6 5). Sgt. Kastner-Smith held Plaintiffs left elbow and left wrist while the four officials escorted Plaintiff out of his cell. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 37;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. 52-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Dkt. 52-9 at \u00b6 6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Sgt. Kastner-Smith, Sgt. Gardner, Officer Kennedy, and Plaintiff arrived at the new cell, Plaintiff was ordered to reassume the kneeling position and to place his hands on his head once his handcuffs were removed, and then to remain kneeling until the officers closed the cell door. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-22; Dkt. 52-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Dkt. 52-9 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). Once the handcuffs were removed, Plaintiff began to stand up, at which point Sgt. Kastner-Smith \"placed [his] left hand on [Plaintiff's] hands and [his] right hand on [Plaintiff's] back to slow his momentum,\" and then instructed Plaintiff to return to the kneeling position. (Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 40). Plaintiff complied, and the officers left the cell. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-5 at \u00b6 24; Dkt. 52-6 at \u00b6 15; Dkt. 52-9 at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Subsequently, Officer Aldridge and Sgt. Gardner retrieved Plaintiff's personal property, and then Officer Aldridge brought an \"inventory document\" to his new cell. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). At that time, Plaintiff \"told Officer Aldridge that Sgt. Kastner-Smith had abused him, including slamming his head on the concrete wall and punching him in the head while placing him in the new cell.\" (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 18). Officer Aldridge did not observe any indications of physical abuse or injury. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 44;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 19). Officer Michael Brotzman, who accompanied Officer Aldridge to Plaintiff's cell, also did not observe any signs of abuse. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 45;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-10 at \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-8 at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the events of July 10, 2014, Plaintiff \"submitted several Medical Request Slips discussing what he alleged to be an attack by Sgt. Kastner-Smith.\" (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 52-4 at 30-31, 36, 41, 48, 52). In addition, Plaintiff drafted a letter to a state court judge in which he recounted the alleged assault. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-4 at 17-18). Major Matthew P. Whitmore (\"Major Whitmore\") of the Steuben County Sheriffs Office, and the \"Chief Administrator at the County Jail\" (Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6 1), searched the County Jail's records and did not find any record denoting the filing of a formal grievance by Plaintiff in relation to this matter (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 56). However, in response to Plaintiff's letter to the state court judge, Major Whitmore requested that Lieutenant David Sutton (\"Lt. Sutton\") investigate Plaintiff's complaints and interview Plaintiff and the officers involved. (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 59;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-11 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8-9). Ultimately, Major Whitmore and Lt. Sutton determined that Plaintiff was not mistreated at any point during his transport between jail cells, and that Sgt. Kastner-Smith used \"no more force than necessary to escort Plaintiff\" and to ensure his compliance with lawful orders. (Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6 15; Dkt. 52-11 at \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 59). Major Whitmore issued a written response to Plaintiff, dated July 24, 2014, indicating that he and Lt. Sutton \"had investigated Plaintiff's claims and found them to be without merit.\" (Dkt. 52-12 at \u00b6 74;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-3 at \u00b6 33; Dkt. 52-4 at 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on August 22, 2014. (Dkt. 1). After being granted both leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and leave to file an amended complaint (Dkt. 4), Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 5, 2015, which remains the operative pleading in this action (Dkt. 6). Plaintiff's allegations stand in stark contrast to the evidence in the record. Plaintiff claims that on July 10, 2014, he was subject to a brutal assault by Sgt. Kastner-Smith, and that Lt. Bouck and Sgt. Gardner failed to protect him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 11, 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Sgt. Kastner-Smith initially failed to wake him up in the early morning, and then said, \"Fuck this [s]tupid [n]igger.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). When Sgt. Kastner-Smith returned, he allegedly awakened Plaintiff by slamming his face against the prison walls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Sgt. Kastner-Smith then escorted Plaintiff into a different jail cell, while he allegedly bent and contorted Plaintiff's hand and fingers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). In addition, Sgt. Kastner-Smith allegedly threatened Plaintiff and proceeded, again, to slam his face into the concrete walls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Lt. Bouck allegedly made light of the matter by making sarcastic remarks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 14-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Sgt. Gardner was present and did not act to stop the alleged assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). Plaintiff claims that this assault was committed in retaliation for his previous filing of a grievance against Officer Hann. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff also attached miscellaneous \"additional documents\" as separate filings to the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 7; Dkt. 8). The exact origin of these documents is unclear. However, they appear to relate to Defendants as well as parties not subject to the present action, and include Plaintiff's recitation of the events of July 10, 2014, as well as a number of other alleged confrontations. The Court finds these submissions largely irrelevant to the extent that Plaintiff raises issues pertinent to individuals not named as defendants in this lawsuit and that are unrelated to his claims against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After discovery concluded (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 49), Defendants filed the pending motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 52). Plaintiff opposed the motion, submitting only his own assertions declared under penalty of perjury.

Instead, the evidence in the record demonstrates that not only did Plaintiff fail to file a single formal grievance form, but he also failed to ever attempt to appeal any decision or non-decision related to the alleged assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Therefore, Plaintiff's action is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 52) is granted, and Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (Dkt. 6) is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Although Plaintiff opposed Defendants' motion for summary judgment (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 54), he failed to submit a statement of undisputed material facts controverting Defendants' Rule 56 statement as required by the Local Rules of this District.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    L.R. Civ. P. 56(a)(2). The Court may not simply rely upon an uncontroverted statement of undisputed material facts submitted by the movant; \"[i]t must be satisfied that the citation[s] to evidence in the record supports the assertion.\"\n    <em>\n     Vt.

Accordingly, the following facts are taken from Defendants' Local Rule 56 statement of undisputed material facts and are \"deemed to be admitted\" to the extent they are supported by admissible evidence in the record.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gubitosi v.
