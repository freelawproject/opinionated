MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Kandi Morris, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings this action against her former employer, the U.S. Department of Justice, for alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Equal Pay Act of 1963,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Morris claims that she was terminated from her position as a FOIA Specialist \"without just cause\" and that, while she was employed at the Department, she \"did not receive pay commensurate with [her] education and experience\" and was paid \"at a rate lower than [her] male counterparts.\" Dkt. 1 at 1. The Department moves to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, on two grounds: first, as a procedural matter, Morris failed to exhaust her administrative Title VII remedies in a timely manner, and, second, as a substantive matter, the uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that she was paid at the same rate as her male counterparts. The Court agrees on both counts and will, accordingly, grant summary judgment in favor of the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the purpose of evaluating the Department's motion for summary judgment, the following uncontroverted facts are construed\n   in the light most favorable to Morris as the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arrington v.

Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Morris, who is an African-American woman, worked at the Department of Justice as a FOIA Specialist with the Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\") for approximately seven months, until she was terminated in early 2011. Dkt. 10 at 3-4; Dkt. 10-2 at 5. She was hired under the Federal Career Intern Program (\"FCIP\"), which \"allowed agencies to appoint qualified individuals in entry level positions in the excepted services and, upon successful completion of a two[-]year internship period, convert those ... appointments to career or career-conditional positions in the competitive service.\" Dkt. 9 at 3 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 2); Dkt. 13 at 5 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 36). FCIP employees were eligible for a grade increase after one year of service. Dkt. 10-1 at 128 (Pustay Interrogatory).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Morris was offered the FOIA Specialist position under the FCIP, she objected to the starting salary, explaining that the job advertisement stated that the \"[s]alary [would] be determined [based on] educational level, GPA, and work experience,\" Dkt. 13 at 2 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 2); Dkt. 10-1 at 253, and that, based on those measures, she was entitled to a higher salary, Dkt. 13 at 2 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5). As Morris concedes,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560900,2536589\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/329/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 3), her OIP contact, Laurie Day, responded to this complaint by explaining that \"all FOIA Specialists were started at the same grade regardless of educational level, GPA[,] or work experience.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560900,2536589\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/329/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 3). Day, moreover, later confirmed under the penalty of perjury that \"[a]ll candidates hired under the [FCIP] in the Office of Information Policy were hired at the GS-7 level.\" Dkt. 10-1 at 148 (Day Interrogatory). As Day explained, \"when OIP first began to use the FCIP, ... the Justice Management Division ... advised that all candidates had to start at either the GS-5 or GS-7 level because the FCIP required that individuals show progressive advancement on the FOIA Specialist career ladder [which ran from GS-5 to GS-11] in order to successfully complete the program and be converted to a competitive service appointment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149. Although Morris contends that by slotting her at the GS-7 level OIP \"disregarded [her] educational level, GPA[,] [and] work experience,\" Dkt. 13 at 2 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 5), she does not controvert the Department's assertion, Dkt. 9 at 4 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 3), or the uniform testimony in the administrative process, that all of the FOIA Specialists that OIP hired under the FCIP \"were appointed at the GS-7, Step 1 level,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10-1 at 124 (Pustay Interrogatory);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 148 (Day Interrogatory);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 136 (Mallon Interrogatory);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165 (Douglas Affidavit);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 179 (Souser Affidavit);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 193 (Smith Affidavit);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 204 (Logan Affidavit) (\"To my knowledge, if I can recall, I think it's either a 5 or a 7.\"). Morris attests that, despite the GS-7 pay grade, she accepted the position on the understanding that \"after one year, the pay would automatically increase to a GS-9 [level] and[,] after the second year, it would go to a GS-11 [level].\" Dkt. 10-1 at 100 (Morris Affidavit). The Department, in turn, does not dispute that these grade increases were \"available,\" but asserts that they were not \"automatic\" and, instead, were \"based off of performance.\" Dkt. 10-1 at 166 (Hibbard Affidavit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Morris never reached the one-year mark, however. According to Morris, the FCIP was terminated on December 27, 2010, and those serving \"under the FCIP as of March 1, 2011,\" were \"converted to the competitive service.\" Dkt. 13 at 2-3 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exec.

On January 26, 2011, between the termination of the FCIP and the March 1\n   conversion date, Morris was told by OIP's Chief of Staff, Carmen Mallon, that she \"was being terminated from the Department of Justice for budget reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 14). Morris asked \"for a written statement [of] the reason for [her] termination,\" but OIP leadership declined that request and, instead, offered Morris \"the option\" of resigning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 16). Morris, in turn, declined and contacted the Justice Management Division (\"JMD\") \"to report the unfair treatment and to ask why her reasons for termination would not be committed to writing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 19). Although JMD did not respond to that request, she was eventually presented with a \"one-page document\" that was purportedly from JMD, which \"stated that [Morris] was being terminated for poor performance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10-1 at 46. Although Morris's SF-50, notice of personnel action, states that she was terminated because her FCIP term had come to an end, Dkt. 10-1 at 48, Mallon purportedly placed the one-page document, which cited poor performance, in Morris's file, Dkt. 13 at 5 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 32). The actual one-page document, which the Department produced in support of its motion, reflects aspects of both accounts. It asserts that OIP management declined to convert Morris's FCIP position to a position in the competitive service because she had \"not demonstrated performance of the quality expected for employees in the FCIP program.\" Dkt. 10-1 at 46. In any event, all agree that Morris was terminated on February 10 or 11, 2011. Dkt. 13 at 4 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 31); Dkt. 9 at 4 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 8, 2013, nearly two years after her termination, Morris filed an EEO complaint with the Department, alleging that she was discriminated against based on her sex and race because (1) she was paid \"at a rate at or below similarly situated white males with less education,\" and (2) she was told that she was terminated because the FCIP program came to an end, but \"two white women were hired\" by OIP. Dkt 10-1 at 26. Morris contends that she did not file a complaint until earlier because it was not until September 14, 2012, that she \"received information that white males at OIP were being paid more than black females with more education.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2082%2C585\">\n    at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the EEO staff explained, the record indicated that Morris was informed by OIP management at the time she was terminated that she had a \"right to appeal their decision through the Department's Equal Employment Opportunity ... Complaint process and [informed] of the time for contacting an EEO Counselor.\" Dkt. 10-1 at 71. Despite this notice, however, Morris did not \"initially contact[ ] the [EEO] Staff\" until \"October 25, 2012, 594 days after the date of the alleged harm,\" well beyond the 45-day period specified by the governing federal regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Dkt. 10-1 at 70. Although Morris argued there-as she argues here-that she did not become aware of the pay disparity until September 14, 2012, the EEO staff concluded that this revelation failed to explain Morris's delay in initiating the counseling process with respect to her separate termination claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    at 70-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After a counseling period, Morris filed a formal administrative complaint and, on August 31, 2013, she requested that her claim be heard by an Administrative Judge (\"AJ\"). Dkt. 10-2 at 4. As a discovery sanction, the AJ dismissed Morris's hearing request, but he did not dismiss her underlying claims and, instead, remanded the case to the Department for issuance of a decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After that decision was entered, the matter was referred to the Department's Complaint Adjudication Office, which issued a \"final agency decision\" on December 9, 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    at 4-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Most significantly for present purposes, she fails to respond to the Department's contention that all new FCIP employees started at the GS-7, Step 1 level, and she offers no evidence purporting to controvert the numerous statements offered by the Department, all of which were made in the form of declarations pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Supreme Court \"has said that summary judgment should be granted where the evidence is such that it would require a directed verdict for the moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 251,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). That standard is easily satisfied here. Morris alleges that she was \"paid at a rate lower than [her] male counterparts in violation of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII,\" Dkt. 1 at 1. The uncontroverted evidence, however, establishes that she-like every other FOIA Specialist hired under the FCIP-started at the GS-7, Step 1 level. To be sure, there is evidence that other specialists eventually received promotions to higher grades,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10-1 at 268, 270,\n   277, 279, 291, 302, but they did so only after at least a year of service in grade. Morris, in contrast, was terminated after seven months on the job, and thus never reached the one-year threshold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 13 at 2 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 6). She, accordingly, cannot establish that the Department paid \"different wages to employees of opposite sexes,\" as required to prevail on an Equal Pay Act claim,\n   <em>\n    Corning Glass Works\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    417 U.S. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or that the Department discriminated against her \"with respect to [her] compensation\" based on her race or sex, as required to prevail under the related terms of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1),\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2000e-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Morris also alleges that she \"did not receive pay commensurate with [her] education and experience.\" Dkt. 1 at 1. To the extent the claim is premised on the notion that she received less than she deserved because of her sex or race, it fails for the reasons described above. The Department has offered uncontroverted evidence that it had a firm policy of paying all new FOIA Specialists hired under the FCIP at the same GS level, regardless of any other considerations. As the Chief of the OIP's Initial Request Staff testified, that decision was premised on the advice from JMD\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   that all candidates had to start at either the GS-5 or GS-7 level because the FCIP required that individuals show progressive advancement on the FOIA Specialist career ladder in order to successfully complete the program and be converted to a competitive service appointee. The FOIA Specialist career ladder goes from GS-5 to GS-11. Because the career ladder ended at the GS-11 level, no one could start at the GS-9 level and show successful advancement through two years in the program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dkt. 10-1 at 149-50 (Day Interrogatory). That testimony, and other testimony to the same effect, is uncontroverted and thus controlling for present purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Morris does allude in her opposition to evidence that another female employee at OIP did not receive grade increases at the same rate as the male hires. Dkt. 13 at 5 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 39). The personnel records attached to the Department's motion, moreover, appear to show that one black female hired as a FOIA Specialist under the FCIP program remained at a GS-7 level for over two years, Dkt. 10-1 at 280, 286, 291, despite holding a masters' degree,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while it appears that two men hired under the FCIP had only bachelors' degrees,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    at 261, 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , yet received annual promotions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    at 261, 267-71, 275-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, even assuming that Morris's former colleague was the victim of pay discrimination after her first year at OIP, that would not undercut the Department's uncontroverted showing that\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   was treated just like all other new FCIP hires, regardless of their sex or race. Accordingly, construed in the light most favorable to Morris, the uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that she was not paid less than any of her counterparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, even assuming that Morris was more qualified than others who were paid at the GS-7 level, she still has not controverted the Department's showing that the pay scale for new FCIP hires was \"based on [a] factor other than sex.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As explained above, the evidence shows that the pay scale was not tied to employees' qualifications, but rather was based on a desire to provide room for \"progressive advancement\" as part of the FCIP. Dkt. 10-1 at 149 (Day Interrogatory). That policy may have undervalued Morris's education and experience, and it may have been in some tension with the job listing's notation that \"[s]alary will be determined by educational level, GPA, and work experience.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Dkt. 10-1 at 253. But the uncontroverted evidence establishes that it was not based on sex or race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Department has, accordingly, carried its initial burden on summary judgment, and Morris has failed to offer any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury \"to find that [the Department] intentionally discriminated against the employee\" on the basis of her race or sex,\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918761,4280190\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/244/\">\n    753 F.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247 (D.C.
