CALDWELL, CHIEF JUDGE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n   A plot of land known as Tract 46 in Pike County, Kentucky has valuable coal and two owners who cannot agree on how it should be used. One cotenant, Pike-Letcher\n   Land Company (\"PLLC\"), has conveyed the right to enter and surface mine coal to its affiliate Premier Elkhorn Coal LLC. The other cotenant, M.L. Johnson Family Properties, LLC, has not consented to mining. Over Johnson LLC's objection, Kentucky has granted Elkhorn a right of entry to surface mine Tract 46. Johnson LLC challenged that decision before the Secretary of the Interior and now seeks review of the administrative decision that permitted Elkhorn to commence mining operations. For the reasons discussed below, the Court affirms the Secretary's decision.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n<strong>\n    I. Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   Coal companies must comply with certain minimum requirements before mining a surface estate. Those requirements are set forth in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (\"SMCRA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n<em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   SMCRA's regulatory requirements are primarily implemented through a permitting regime. 30 U.SC. \u00a7 1256(a) (\"[N]o person shall engage in or carry out on lands within a State any surface coal mining operations unless such person has first obtained a permit issued by such State pursuant to an approved State program or by the Secretary pursuant to a Federal program ....\"). As \u00a7 1256(a) suggests, regulatory power under SMCRA is not solely vested in the federal government. Instead, states which \"wish[ ] to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining\" are invited to submit to the Secretary a state program \"which demonstrates that such State has the capability of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and meeting its purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201253\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n   The mineral and surface estates of Tract 46 in Pike County, Kentucky have been severed since the early 1900s. The mineral estate is owned by PLLC. The surface estate, which consists of approximately 450 acres, was previously owned by M.L. Johnson, who left an undivided interest to each of his eight heirs. Two of the heirs conveyed their interests to PLLC, while five transferred theirs to Johnson LLC. By fall 2014, the surface estate was owned collectively by Johnson LLC (62.5%), PLLC (25%), and the eighth heir (12.5%) as tenants in common.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   PLLC entered into an Original Right of Entry Agreement in 1995, and an Amended Right of Entry Agreement in 2013 with its affiliate Elkhorn, granting it the right to enter and conduct surface mining operations. Johnson LLC has not consented to surface mining on Tract 46.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Kentucky Cabinet first issued Elkhorn a permit for surface mining operations on Tract 46 in 2003. Elkhorn subsequently sought approval of Amendment # 1 to increase the number of acres covered by the permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Cabinet determined that Elkhorn had demonstrated a right of entry based upon the consent of PLLC and the holding of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Certain Johnson heirs initially challenged Amendment # 1 in Kentucky's Office of Administrative Hearings on the basis that not all cotenants consented to surface mining, but the heirs ultimately dismissed that appeal with prejudice. Instead, Johnson LLC initiated a citizen suit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201270\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) in this Court.

Elkhorn's alternative claim that its permit was valid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201260\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6)(C), as approved by Minor Revision # 2, was rejected as procedurally flawed due to the lack of adequate notice and opportunity to object. OSMRE concluded that Elkhorn lacked a valid permit and issued a cessation order.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-28\">\n   Seeking to abate the cessation order, Elkhorn submitted (1) copies of the original severance, deed which did not expressly grant the right to surface mine, (2) chain of title documents, and (3) the Original and Amended Right of Entry Agreements.

The Cabinet approved Minor Revision # 3. Johnson LLC filed an objection with the Cabinet to the proposed revision, but did not pursue a state administrative appeal.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-29\">\n   OSMRE determined that Minor Revision # 3 abated the violations and moved to terminate the cessation order.

Johnson LLC filed an application for review of that order with the Hearings Division, which was heard by Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Harry C. Sweitzer. On October 30, 2015, the ALJ issued a decision upholding OSMRE's termination of the cessation order. Johnson LLC now appeals from that decision and has filed a motion for summary judgment. (DE 46).

For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ's decision was not arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-35\">\n<em>\n    A.

That decision was upheld by an ALJ, who found that SMCRA and the analogous Kentucky regulations permitted consideration of all relevant state law, including the law of cotenancy. Johnson LLC argues that subsection (C) of \u00a7 1260(b)(6), and its implementing regulations, are narrower, allowing the regulatory authority to consider only law interpreting the original severance instrument. As explained below, Johnson LLC's construction of the statute is mistaken. Both U.S.C. \u00a7 1260(b)(6)(C) and 405 KAR 8:030 Sec. 4(2)(c) permit consideration of all applicable state law, including Kentucky cotenancy law.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-37\">\n<em>\n    1.

The right of entry provision requires the surface-subsurface relationship to be \"determined in accordance with State law.\" 30 U.S.C. 1260(b)(6)(C). The use of \"state law\" in this provision is clear: all state law that is relevant to determining the surface-subsurface relationship may be considered. Congress, could have easily chosen to specify a limited type or subject matter of relevant state law. They chose not to. Instead, they left \"state law\" unmodified. That phrase, standing alone, indicates\n   a clear and unambiguous intent to encompass all forms of state law.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   Johnson LLC argues that the text, purpose, and legislative history of the statute compel the Court to adopt its narrow reading of \"state law.\" It claims the phrase \"surface-subsurface relationship\" limits the applicable state law to law interpreting the severance instrument. Johnson LLC puts forth three textual arguments in support of this construction. First, it argues that any ambiguity in subsection (C)'s operative clause is resolved by its prefatory clause, which, it contends, limits subsection (C)'s applicability to instances where the \"conveyance does not expressly grant the right to extract coal by surface mining methods.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201260\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6)(C). While a prefatory clause \"may ... resolve an ambiguity in the operative clause\" its function is clarifying and it cannot \"limit or expand the scope of the operative clause.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v. Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p577\">\n    554 U.S. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p577\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p577\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Subsection C's prefatory clause does not alter the meaning of \"surface-subsurface legal relationship\" in the operative clause. Instead, its role is to state the purpose of subsection (C) in the statute as an alternative method for establishing a right of entry where subsection (B) does not apply because the conveyance does not expressly grant a right of entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-41\">\n   Johnson LLC's second textual argument is that subsection (B) and (C), when harmonized, support its narrow reading of subsection (C). It frames subsection (B) as applying where the conveyance instrument is explicit in granting or denying the right of entry and subsection (C) as specifying the choice of law when the instrument is not explicit. Johnson LLC's framing of the subsections as operating in parallel is correct. But this parallelism does not narrow the meaning of \"state law\" in subsection (C) as Johnson LLC claims. While a permitee will only rely on subsection (C) when there is no consent by the surface owner and the conveyance is not explicit, it does not follow that subsection (C) limits state law to the law interpreting the conveyance instrument. Instead, the permitee may invoke state law to demonstrate that either his right of entry is implicit in the conveyance or that some other right of entry exists, such as a right under cotenancy law.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-42\">\n   Johnson LLC's third textual argument relies on \u00a7 1260(b)(6)'s prefatory clause, which limits the subsections applicability to \"cases where the private mineral estate has been severed from the private surface estate.\" 30 U.S.C. 1260(b)(6). This argument, like its first textual argument, seeks to imbue the prefatory clause with a limiting function that goes beyond its proper role. The function of \u00a7 1260(b)(6)'s prefatory clause is to make the subsection applicable in instances where there has been a severance, not to limit the scope of the operative clause of subsection (C).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, all of Johnson LLC's textual arguments are weakened by the expectation of \"a 'clear and manifest' statement from Congress to authorize an unprecedented\n   intrusion into traditional state authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Rapanos v.

Johnson LLC's narrow reading of \"state law,\" as its counsel stated at oral arguments, would mean that SMCRA overrides state property law. But subsection (C) does the opposite of overriding state law. Consistent with SMCRA's cooperative federalism scheme, it instructs the regulatory authority to look to state law where the conveyance does not provide an explicit right of entry. Had Congress intended to displace state cotenancy law, it could have clearly done so by adding limiting language before \"state law.\" Because it choose not to, SMCRA should not be interpreted as preempting common law rights of entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    United States v. Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p349\">\n    404 U.S. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p349\">\n    92 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p349\">\n    30 L.Ed.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971) (\"[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.\").\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-44\">\n   Johnson LLC also claims that the broad reading adopted by the ALJ frustrates the fundamental purpose of SMCRA. In enacting SMCRA, Congress identified thirteen purposes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support of its narrow construction, Johnson LLC points to the statutes second enumerated purpose of \"assur[ing] that the rights of surface landowners and other persons with a legal interest in the land or appurtenances thereto are fully protected from [surface coal mining] operations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). But neither the ALJ's broad interpretation nor Johnson LLC's narrow interpretation of state law differ in the amount of protection provided for \"the rights of surface landowners.\" If state property law does not provide the surface owner a right to be free from mining operations, SMCRA's purpose is not frustrated. That is the case here. As discussed below, under Kentucky cotenancy law, Johnson LLC has no right as a cotenant to be free from surface mining operations where another cotenant has consented to surface mining. Johnson LLC may have an interest in preventing surface mining on Tract 46, but that is not equivalent to a right to be free from surface mining.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Johnson LLC turns to the lengthy legislative history of SMCRA in support of its narrow construction of \u00a7 1260(b)(6)(C). In its view, the legislative history reveals that subsection (C) was the result of a compromise between a full service owner consent requirement and a regime in which the right of entry was left entirely to state law. It primarily relies on a colloquy between Ohio Representative John Seiberling and House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs Chairman Representative Morris Udall. In that colloquy, Representative Seiberling, who had offered the amendment that would become \u00a7 1260(b)(6) and only reluctantly agreed to include subsection (C), stated that he understood that subsection to \"require a showing that there is a deed or other instrument of conveyance and that, under the applicable State law, it is construed to authorize surface mining.\" 123 Cong. Rec. 24419, 24424. Jul. 21, 1977. Chairman Udall stated that this interpretation of subsection C was correct.\n   <em>\n<extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-46\">\n   While the colloquy between Representative Seiberling and Chairman Udall is convincing evidence that those representatives understood subsection (C) to apply narrowly, it does not warrant the Court adopting that construction for two reasons. First, as explained above, the text of subsection (C) is clear: the phrase \"state law,\" without limiting language, clearly applies broadly to include all forms of state law. The Court may \"not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.\"\n   <em>\n    Ratzlaf v.

Accordingly, legislative history is not relevant to the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 1260(b)(6)(C). Second, even if the Court were to consider SMCRA's legislative history to be relevant, the colloquy relied on by Johnson LLC is not the most probative legislative history available on the issue. Instead, the House and Senate Conference Committee Report provides a better guide as to Congressional intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Schmitt v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9168188\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/327/\">\n    395 F.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 n.2 (6th Cir. 2005) (noting that, when resorting to legislative history, courts should not go beyond committee reports). While the House bill required landowner consent for surface mining, expressly or through the conveyance, the Senate bill contained no such consent requirement. The Conference Report explained that \u00a7 1260(b)(6) sought to resolve the matter by:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [P]roviding that in those cases in which there is no written consent of the surface owner or no express coverage of the right to mine coal by surface methods in the relevant legal instruments that (1) the determination of whether or not the private mineral estate owner or a successor-in-interest has the right to mine the coal by surface methods\n   <em>\n    shall be made in accordance with applicable state law\n   </em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-48\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 95-493, at 106 (1977) (Conf. Rep.) (emphasis added).

The federal regulation that implements\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201260\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6)(C) more closely mirrors the statute, requiring only \"documentation that under applicable State law, the applicant has the legal authority to extract the coal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.15\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). The addition of the first clause in the Kentucky regulation, therefore, seems to suggest that Kentucky sought to require the severance instrument to provide the right of entry. Looking closer, however, reveals that the Kentucky regulation, while textually different, is substantively identical to SMCRA and the federal regulation. It merely imposes an additional procedural requirement that the applicant submit the severance instrument.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, Johnson LLC's reading would make the second clause of the Kentucky regulation mere surplusage. If the original severance instrument must be the basis for the right of entry, then there is no need to provide \"documentation\" of the right of entry under state law as required by the second clause. Second, the state regulation, like its federal counterparts, does not contain express limiting language on what state law is \"applicable.\" Third, OSMRE has consistently interpreted the regulation as being \"substantively identical to the Federal rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027235\">\n    59 Fed.

And, most importantly, the Kentucky regulation could not, under Kentucky law, be more stringent than the federal law or regulation.

Instead, it argues that the decision was wrongly decided and that this Court should not rely on it as a state law basis for determining whether a right to conduct surface mining exists. This argument fails for two reasons. First, it cannot be arbitrary or capricious for the ALJ to have relied on a state appellate court decision interpreting the state law at issue. Federal courts frequently construe state law by applying decisions of state courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Erie R.R. Co. v.

Admin. Regs. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :030 \u00a7 4(3) (\"Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the cabinet to adjudicate property rights disputes.\") Johnson LLC argues that, in contravention of this proviso, the Kentucky Cabinet approved Minor Revision # 3 and OSMRE terminated the cessation order. It claims that the ongoing dispute over whether Premier Elkhorn had a right to enter Tract 46 to extract coal by surface mining methods constituted a property rights dispute. Because of the existence of this dispute, it interprets SMCRA as placing the burden on Elkhorn to obtain a final and unappealable resolution of the dispute before the regulatory authority could approve the application. This is an incorrect reading of the statute. Neither the Kentucky Cabinet nor OSMRE adjudicated a property rights dispute.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, Johnson LLC's position that a final and unappealable judicial determination was required before a permit could be issued is unsupported by the text of SMCRA. In prohibiting adjudication of property rights disputes, the proviso's text contains nothing that suggests a final and unappealable judicial determination concerning an applicant's property rights is required. Finding little support in the text of subsection (C), Johnson LLC again turns to the legislative history. The Conference Committee Report provided that:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [I]n those cases in which there is no written consent of the surface owner or\n   no express coverage of the right to mine coal by surface methods in the relevant legal instruments that (1) the determination of whether or not the private mineral estate owner or a successor-in-interest has the right to mine the coal by surface methods shall be made in accordance with applicable state law, and (2) jurisdiction to make that determination under applicable State law shall remain in the body-most probably the State courts-given that jurisdiction by the state in question.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-64\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 95-493, at 106. A requirement of a final and unappealable judicial determination does not follow from this language. When the Cabinet made the prima facie determination that Elkhorn had a right of entry it relied on the decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Envtl. &amp; Pub. Prot. Cabinet.\n   </em>\n   Jurisdiction to make the decision of whether a right of entry existed remained, as intended by Congress, in Kentucky state court.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, the dispute between Johnson LLC, Elkhorn, and the Secretary does not concern which parties have \"a right to specific property, whether tangible or intangible.\"\n   <em>\n    Property Right\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , (10th ed. 2014). Instead, the dispute primarily concerns the scope of the phrase \"state law\" in Subsection (C). Once the regulatory authorities correctly determined that SMCRA encompasses all relevant state law, Kentucky state law provided a clear answer as to whether cotenancy law or the Broad Form Deed Amendment applied. The only dispute before the regulatory authorities concerned the proper interpretation of SMCRA and its analogous regulation. It did not require any analysis or consideration of property law.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-66\">\n   Johnson LLC also argues that the citizen suit it filed in this Court was a property dispute, and its pendency required the regulatory authority to refrain from determining if Elkhorn had a right of entry to surface mine. For similar reasons, this argument fails. SMCRA's citizen suit provision authorizes any adversely affected person to bring a civil action against the Secretary to \"compel compliance ... where there is alleged a failure of the Secretary ... to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201270\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Johnson LLC's complaint alleged that Elkhorn's permit applications did not contain certain information required by SMCRA. While the allegations in Johnson LLC's citizen suit may touch on property rights concerns, it is not a property rights dispute. Johnson LLC's citizen suit primarily challenges the Cabinet's construction of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201260\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6)(A). Like this case, the citizen suit concerns the proper interpretation of SMCRA's right of entry provisions, not state property law.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-67\">\n   Johnson LLC argues that case law and administrative decisions supports its position that Kentucky and the Secretary adjudicated a property rights dispute. Those cases, however, are distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Ky. So. Coal Corp v. Ky. Energy &amp; Env't Cabinet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094044\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/396/804/\">\n    396 S.W.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), the Kentucky Supreme Court held that a bona fide property rights dispute existed where the lease issued for surface mining had expired. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the intermediate court of appeal's ruling that \"[t]he burden is on the permit applicant to resolve such issues prior to applying for, or obtaining, a permit. Absent a valid lease, deed, contract with the owners of the real estate, or judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction, the Cabinet has no basis for finding ... a legal right to mine this property.\"\n   <em>\n    Ky. So. Coal Corp v. Ky.

Ct. App. Dec. 11, 2009). Here, however, Elkhorn has a right of entry agreement with PLLC. There is no dispute as to the validity of that agreement.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-68\">\n   And because\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Envtl. &amp; Pub. Prot. Cabinet\n   </em>\n   clearly states that consent of one cotenant creates a right of entry to surface mine, Elkhorn was not required to obtain a favorable court judgement prior to approval of its application. The regulatory authority could rely on the valid right of entry agreement and the clearly established Kentucky law in determining the surface-subsurface legal relationship.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-69\">\n   Johnson LLC also points to IBLA's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marion Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 125 I.B.L.A. 271 (1993),\n   <em>\n    vacated\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coal-Mac, Inc. v. Babbitt\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 7:93-cv-00117-JMH, ECF No. 48 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 9, 1995). In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , IBLA found that a property rights dispute existed because there was a pending state court action over whether a reservation of mineral rights in a deed allowed for surface mining.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 276 (\"Litigation was then pending ... to decide whether the reservation in the December 1971 deed ... actually permitted him to authorize another to mine the subject land by surface means.\"). This constituted a property rights dispute because the disagreement concerned the interpretation of the phrase \"mining rights\" in the deed. In contrast, there is no controversy in this case as to what rights ML Johnson's heirs assigned to PLLC or what right PLLC intended to convey to Elkhorn in the right of entry agreement.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-70\">\n   Other cases in which Courts and IBLA have addressed the meaning of property rights have interpreted the phrase narrowly. In an order issued by Judge William O. Bertelsman, this Court interpreted subsection (C)'s proviso to mean \"only that the regulatory agency would not have power to determine whether any given conveyance had been obtained by fraud, whether the consent obtained was signed by the proper heirs to a particular tract of land, whether there was a boundary line or other dispute concerning the realty' description, and other such individualized matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Akers v.

Envtl. &amp; Pub. Prot. Cabinet, June 2, 2008) (\"[C]ontentions regarding whether the deed is valid or its legal import are basically a property dispute.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of these cases resemble the challenges brought before the Secretary or in Johnson LLC's citizen suit. And Johnson LLC has not identified any judicial or agency decision in which a dispute similar to its own was deemed a property rights dispute.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, Johnson LLC's position presents two practical problems for resolution of this case. First, Johnson LLC argues that the issues raised before the Secretary and in its citizen suit are property rights disputes that should be adjudicated by a Kentucky state court. But those disputes primarily concern the interpretation of SMCRA, not state property law. The final authority on the interpretation of SMCRA are the federal courts. If the Court were to require Elkhorn to obtain a state court judgment, that decision would merely provide an interpretation of SMCRA subject to ultimate review in federal court. In contrast, if the dispute were a bona fide property dispute, such as whether Elkhorn's right of entry agreement was valid, Kentucky state courts would provide the final determination. Second, if this Court sent Elkhorn to state court to obtain a declaratory judgment, Kentucky's lower state courts would be bound by the decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Envtl. &amp; Pub. Prot. Cabinet\n   </em>\n   , and would return to the regulatory authority with a final judicial determination that applies Kentucky state law identically to the prima facie determination made by the Kentucky Cabinet and Secretary. Thus, a requirement of a final and unappealable judicial determination does nothing except delay the resolution of this litigation.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-73\">\n<em>\n    C. Reclamation Advisory Memorandum # 159 did not modify state law\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Kentucky Cabinet relied on Reclamation Advisory Memorandum (\"RAM\") # 159 in approving Minor Revision # 3. RAM # 159 was issued in response to Judge Thapar's order in\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   granting Johnson LLC a preliminary injunction. RAM # 159 stated, as a result of the Court's order, that \"the Cabinet intends to find [ 405 Ky Admin. Regs.] 8:030 Sec. 4(2)(c) satisfied if the additional documentation consists of the consent of less than all the cotenants because state case law has so held.\" Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet Department for Natural Resources, Reclamation Advisory Memorandum (RAM) # 159 (June 27, 2014).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Cabinet did not seek approval from the Secretary before issuing RAM # 159 or applying it to Minor Revision # 3. Johnson LLC argues that RAM # 159 constitutes a significant change to Kentucky's approved regulatory program and, because it was not approved by the Secretary, approval of Minor Revision # 3 violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20732.15\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 732.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). In his written decision, the ALJ rejected this argument, finding that \"while RAM # 159 expressed an intention to follow a different right of entry subsection in response to the District Court's findings, the document did not purport to change existing State law. Consequently, RAM # 159 did not violate the\n   amendment procedures under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20732.17\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 732.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" (Administrative Record (\"AR\") 1171).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Secretary's decision is correct-RAM # 159 constituted a guidance document that did not modify the Kentucky state program and is therefore exempt from SMCRA's formal amendment process. A RAM is intended to be \"an open correspondence from the commissioner of the Department for Natural Resources (DNR) to operators and other interested persons, that provides information related to DNR's surface mining regulatory program.\"\n   <em>\n    Reclamation Advisory Memoranda\n   </em>\n   , Division of Mine Permits, http://minepermits.ky.gov/Pages/RAMs.aspx (last visited Mar. 21, 2018). As such, RAM # 159 merely \"establish[es] guidelines\" for how the Cabinet will evaluate right of entry permits. RAM # 159, at 1. It does not bind the regulatory authority, but rather seeks \"cooperation in submitting the necessary documentation\" from permit applicants. RAM # 159, at 3. Because RAM # 159 is a guidance document, it lacks the force of law and could not change Kentucky laws or regulations. Instead, RAM # 159 resembles an interpretative rule or general statement of policy that, under the Administrative Procedure Act, are \"issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers\" and \"do not have the force and effect of law and are not accorded that weight in the adjudicatory process.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

It claims that RAM # 159 rewrote 405 Ky Admin. Regs. 8:030 Sec. 4(2)(c) to require that applicants submit only \"copies of the original severance documents and documentation to demonstrate that under Kentucky state law it has the right to mine by those methods,\" RAM # 159, at 2, and removed the requirement that the applicant base its right to extract coal on the severance instrument. This argument misses the mark. Johnson LLC is correct that the text of Kentucky's subsection (C) and RAM # 159's interpretation of that language differ. But, as explained above,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20Ky.%20Admin.%20Regs.%208\">\n    405 Ky. Admin. Regs. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :030 Sec. 4(2)(c) does not require applicants to base their right of entry on the severance instrument. It only requires applicants to submit the original severance instrument. Thus, RAM # 159, and its application to Minor Revision # 3, was consistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20Ky.%20Admin.%20Regs.%208\">\n    405 Ky.

An application may only be approved if the regulatory authority finds that \"the permit application is accurate and complete and that all requirements of the Act and the State or Federal program have been complied with.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201260\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. 350.060(2). When Elkhorn submitted its permit application to commence\n   surface mining on Tract 46, Johnson LLC's citizen suit was, and still is, pending before this Court. In its permit application, however, Elkhorn answered \"N/A\" to item 9.8, which asks: \"Are any rights to enter and mine the area, as claimed by the applicant, subject to any pending litigation?\" (AR 0825-1642).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-80\">\n   Johnson LLC argues that Elkhorn's failure to disclose the pending citizen suit made its application noncompliant with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201257\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9) and that, as a result, Kentucky had a non-discretionary duty to withhold the permit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201260\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Elkhorn's omission, however, constitutes harmless error. The requirement that permit applicants disclose pending litigation serves the purpose of assisting the regulatory authority from improperly adjudicating a property rights dispute. The ALJ found, and Johnson LLC concedes, that \"all parties, including the Kentucky Cabinet, were well-aware of the prior District Court proceedings ....\" (AR 1326). Thus, the Kentucky Cabinet and the Secretary had the opportunity to consider whether Johnson LLC's citizen suit constituted a property rights dispute. The APA instructs this Court, in conducting its review of the Secretary's decision, that \"due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Sierra Club v.
