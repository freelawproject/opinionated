Specifically, Plaintiffs Demetrius Martin, Omar Atebar, Esther Vega, Jesus Vega, Lizett Anguiano, Tomas Hernandez, Greg Robison, Dale Holzworth, Eric Pirverdian, Tomig Salmasian, Michael Kouyoumdjian, Dior Dee, Cory Raymond, and Jesus Sanchez (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") allege that their smartphones are prone to explode or burst into flames. They assert claims for violations of state consumer-protection laws and unjust enrichment against Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (collectively, \"Samsung\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Presently before the Court is Samsung's Motion to Compel Arbitration, Dismiss Plaintiffs' Class Claims, and Stay All Proceedings. Mot., ECF 67. The Court held a hearing on Samsung's motion on March 1, 2018. The Court has considered the arguments presented at oral argument and in the briefing, as well as the submitted evidence and applicable law. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that certain Plaintiffs formed a valid arbitration agreement with Samsung, and therefore GRANTS Samsung's motion as to those Plaintiffs, DENIES Samsung's motion as to the remaining Plaintiffs, and STAYS the case pending the outcome of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\"FAC\"), ECF 65. In October 2016, Samsung recalled the Samsung Galaxy Note7 (\"Note7\") after reports that numerous devices had exploded and burst into flames. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 38, 42. Plaintiffs own at least one of six other models of Samsung phones-the Galaxy S7 (\"S7\"), the Galaxy S7 Edge (\"S7 Edge\"), the Galaxy S6 (\"S6\"), the Galaxy S6 Edge (\"S6 Edge\"), the Galaxy S6 Edge+ (\"S6 Edge+\"), and the Galaxy Note5 (\"Note5\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Plaintiffs plead that these models, like the Note7, \"pose a risk of overheating, fire and explosion as they were designed, engineered, developed, manufactured, produced and/or assembled in a substantially similar manner to the Note7.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this putative class action on November 2, 2016 and filed the operative FAC on August 3, 2017. ECF 1, 65. Plaintiffs hail from California, Massachusetts, or Maryland and seek to represent three statewide classes, which encompass all consumers who reside in and purchased one of the relevant Samsung phones in California, Massachusetts, and Maryland, respectively. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 95, 107, 119.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs bring six causes of action: (1) violation of California's Unfair Competition Law on behalf of the California class, (2) violation of California's False Advertising Law on behalf of the California class, (3) violation of California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act on behalf of the California class, (4) violation of Maryland's Consumer Protection Act on behalf of the Maryland class, (5) violation of\n   Massachusetts Regulation of Business Practices for Consumers Protection on behalf of the Massachusetts class, and (6) unjust enrichment on behalf of all classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 143-85, 198-201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2017, Samsung moved to compel arbitration on the ground that Plaintiffs assented to, and did not opt out of, an arbitration clause that appeared either in a guidebook included in the box with their phones or on Samsung's website. Mot. 8-23. As discussed in more detail below, the analysis of assent hinges on what information was presented and how that information was presented to each individual Plaintiff-including the box, guidebook, and website. Samsung also requests that the Court dismiss the class-action claims of all Plaintiffs compelled to arbitrate and stay all proceedings in the litigation pending arbitration. Mot. 23-25. Plaintiffs filed an opposition, Opp., ECF 74, and Samsung filed a reply, Reply, ECF 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The court recognized the corollary that silence or inaction usually is not enough because acceptance is measured by whether an offeree's outward manifestations of consent would indicate to a reasonable person that the offeree has assented to the agreement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202204\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Finally, the court noted that \"regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent, [an offeree] is not bound by inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he was unaware, contained in a document whose contractual nature is not obvious.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202204\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202204\">\n     at 1285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Windsor Mills, Inc. v.

The court held that the consumer had not assented to the arbitration agreement expressly nor shown an intent that his inaction could be understood as acceptance.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1285. Nor did either of the two recognized exceptions to the bar on acceptance by silence apply.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1286. Samsung did not establish that the consumer, either by operation of law or prior course of dealing, had a duty to act in response to the brochure.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Similarly, Samsung could not claim that the consumer retained the benefit of the agreement when the consumer was entitled to the benefits of the warranty even if he opted out of arbitration.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Accordingly, the court chose to follow the no-acceptance-by-silence rule.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The court also addressed Samsung's arguments that analogies to shrink-wrap agreements and inside-the-box contracts displaced the no-acceptance-by-silence rule.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    With a shrink-wrap agreement, the packaging on the outside of a product states that the consumer agrees to the terms of the agreement by opening the packaging.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The court noted that California law could be read to support the proposition that a consumer has a duty to act to negate the conclusion that he accepted the terms by opening the wrapper.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1287. But that scenario was different than Samsung's case.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The court reasoned that even if a shrink-wrap agreement \"could be analogized to a brochure that contains contractual terms, the outside of the Galaxy S4 box did not notify the consumer that opening the box would be considered agreement to the terms set forth in the brochure.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1287. Thus, the court fell back on \"California's general rule that silence or inaction does not constitute acceptance.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    As to inside-the-box contracts, the court could identify no California case that had adopted the rationale in the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    that buyers can be bound by an arbitration clause in a brochure enclosed in a product box merely because the buyer kept the product beyond the specified return window.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1287-88. In the court's view,\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    's holding is difficult to square with California's clear rule that silence alone does not constitute assent.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1290. The court also explained that even in cases that recognize the propriety of enforcing inside-the-box provisions in certain instances, the consumer must have adequate notice of the contractual terms.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1289. That notice was lacking with regard to the S4. In particular, the arbitration provision appeared\n    in a brochure titled \"Product Safety &amp; Warranty Information,\" so a reasonable person \"would not be on notice that the brochure contained a freestanding obligation outside the scope of the warranty.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1289-90. Further undermining the notice was that a reasonable person would not expect that failing to opt out of an arbitration provision within the seller's warranty would subject even non-warranty claims to arbitration.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1290. Thus, the court \"reject[ed] Samsung's argument that [the consumer] reasonably assented to the arbitration provision because he failed to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in the product box.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In sum, the court determined that \"Samsung's inclusion of a brochure in the Galaxy S4 box, and [the consumer]'s failure to opt out, does not make the arbitration provision enforceable against [the consumer].\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Armed with that analysis and conclusion, the Court turns to the facts of the instant case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     b. Application of\n     <em>\n      Norcia\n     </em>\n     to the Facts of this Case\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Before scrutinizing the individual circumstances present here, the Court notes a simple, but important, distinction that applies to all Plaintiffs in the instant case. Unlike in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    , Samsung does not rest its argument for assent entirely on Plaintiffs' \"fail[ure] to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in the product box.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Rather, because most of the guidebooks premise acceptance on a consumer's use of the device, Samsung relies on each Plaintiff's use of the device. While that difference may seem practically insignificant, it takes this case outside the silence-by-acceptance rubric utilized in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    . Indeed, in contrast to silence or inaction, each Plaintiff's use of his or her phone can signify an outward manifestation of consent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 19(2) (1981) (noting that a party's conduct may manifest assent where the party \"intends to engage in the conduct and knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents\"). The court in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    recognized that acceptance by conduct is a valid means of assent under California law.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1284-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And the relevant California statute, as well as case law interpreting that statute, provides that a contract can be formed where \"conduct by both parties...recognizes the existence of such a contract.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202204\">\n     Cal.

As\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    recognized, \"regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent, [an offeree] is not bound by inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he was unaware, contained in a document whose contractual nature is not obvious.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Windsor Mills\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20347\">\n     101 Cal.Rptr. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    351 ).

The back of two of the boxes states: \"Device purchase subject to additional Samsung terms and conditions.\" Blackard Decl., Exs. C, E. Although these references appear in the middle of a short paragraph of information, they are written in the same font type and size as the surrounding text and are not buried in a way that makes them difficult to see. The third box is even more explicit, instructing buyers to \"[s]ee brochures and\n    <strong>\n     Terms and Conditions (including arbitration provision)\n    </strong>\n    at T-Mobile.com.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623805\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/110/#p124\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , Ex.

There, the box stated only that the package contained a \"Product Safety &amp; Warranty Brochure.\"\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1282\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As the court emphasized, a reasonable person would not understand that there are bilateral contract obligations when the language is couched in terms of warranties, which run from the seller to the buyer.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     at 1289-90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, the text on the boxes uses classic contractual language by giving users notice of additional\n    <em>\n     terms\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     conditions\n    </em>\n    . Such language also places this case closer to cases involving shrink-wrap agreements than\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    . Thus, the boxes would make a reasonable person aware of the existence of other binding conditions as part of the purchase.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The guidebooks within the boxes make clear on the cover that the terms and conditions are contained inside. Although the guidebooks are titled either \"Health &amp; Safety and Warranty Guide\" or \"Product Safety and Warranty Information,\" all of the guidebooks include the following language in bold on the front: \"\n    <strong>\n     Please read this manual before operating your device and keep it for future reference. This document contains important terms and conditions with respect to your device. By using this device, you accept those terms and conditions.\n    </strong>\n    \" Blackard Decl., Exs. G, H, J. Thus, even for Plaintiffs whose boxes do not indicate where to find the terms and conditions, their location is prominently displayed on the front of the guidebook in the box. What is more, the guidebook expressly provides the manner in which the consumer would bind himself or herself to the terms-\"[b]y using th[e] device.\" Plainly, this setup is much more likely to notify consumers than\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    's \"Product Safety &amp; Warranty Information\" brochure, which made no mention of the buyer's obligations but instead referred only to the seller's warranties.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1282\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In particular, the entire passage is framed as a description of Samsung's warranty and does not point out that arbitration also applies to non-warranty claims. However, the language is not actively misleading-it conspicuously mentions arbitration and the 30-day opt out procedures, and does not state or imply that only warranty claims are covered by arbitration.

As the court explained in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    , the warranty label is ineffective to put a reasonable person \"on notice that the brochure contain[s] a freestanding obligation outside the scope of the warranty.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1289-90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Specifically, Plaintiff Dee's box provides: \"Device purchase subject to additional Samsung terms and conditions. For more information on your device, please visit www.samsung.com.\" Blackard Decl., Ex. A. Thus, a consumer would likely consult the Internet to search for Samsung's terms and conditions. But the website would not put a reasonable person on notice that he binds himself to arbitration by using his phone. While consumers are instructed in bold, capitalized letters to read the important legal information before using the phone, the website nowhere provides that use of the phone constitutes acceptance of the terms.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , Ex.

Cal. Sept. 13, 2017).\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Looking at the external packaging, the court explained that the reference to \"additional terms and conditions\" on the box was insufficient because it did not notify the consumer where to find those additional terms and conditions or provide that taking certain actions (such as opening the box or using the phone) constituted assent.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. Turning to the warranty guidebook, the court observed that \"the mere inclusion of the Warranty Guide in the Galaxy S7's box cannot bind [the consumer] to an arbitration provision appearing toward the end of the Guide because the Guide's cover page indicates only that it contains health, safety, and warranty information.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7. Despite the first page's reference to arbitration, the court held that \"Samsung's external packaging disclosure and in-the-box\n    Warranty Guide are insufficient to put a reasonable consumer on notice of the arbitration provision or the contractual nature of the purchase-and-usage transaction.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    For the reasons stated above, this Court agrees and therefore DENIES Samsung's motion to compel arbitration as to Plaintiff Dee.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     ii. S6 Edge+ Plaintiff\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Plaintiff Martin purchased an S6 Edge+. FAC \u00b6 10. The critical difference between Plaintiff Martin and the foregoing Plaintiffs is that Samsung does not submit an exhibit or argue that the outside of Plaintiff Martin's box said anything about terms and conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Court does not read\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    to mandate that notice appear on the exterior of the box to form an agreement. In one passage, the court in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    rejected Samsung's analogy to a shrink-wrap agreement by stating \"the outside of the Galaxy S4 box did not notify the consumer that opening the box would be considered agreement to the terms set forth in the brochure.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1287\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But that statement is not properly understood as a general rule applicable in all scenarios. Rather, the Ninth Circuit refuted a particular argument raised by Samsung and noted that the analogy failed because of the absence of language on the box. The Ninth Circuit did not purport to hold that language on the box is always necessary. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, the court went on to discuss the title and contents of the brochure when it later held that the consumer did not receive adequate notice of the arbitration provision in the brochure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     at 1289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In other words,\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    does not preclude consideration of material inside the box.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    More fundamentally, Plaintiff Martin's case is different than\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    because acceptance here is tied to the consumer's use of the phone. Thus, in asking what a reasonable person in Plaintiff Martin's shoes would have known at the time the contract was formed,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     AIU Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20820\">\n     274 Cal.Rptr. 820\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=799%20P.2d%201253\">\n     799 P.2d at 1264\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the Court may consider anything that the consumer would have seen before using the phone-including materials inside the box and (potentially) the contents of the guidebook. Plaintiffs' arguments and cited authority support this approach. For example, Plaintiffs point to\n    <em>\n     Cory v. Golden State Bank\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2004936\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/95/360/\">\n     95 Cal.App.3d 360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20538\">\n     157 Cal.Rptr. 538\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 541 (1979), and\n    <em>\n     India Paint &amp; Lacquer Co. v.

Again, Plaintiff Martin's guidebook keyed contract formation to his use of the phone. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the materials that would be seen before the consumer began using the device.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Here, the Court concludes that a reasonable person in Plaintiff Martin's position would have been aware of arbitration and that using the phone constituted acceptance. It is true that the outside of the box provided no notification of arbitration or additional contractual terms. But when the consumer dumped out the contents of the box to retrieve the phone, he or she would be confronted with the guidebook. Right on the cover, the guidebook states in bold lettering: \"\n    <strong>\n     Please read this manual before operating your device and keep it for future reference. This document contains important terms and conditions with respect to your device. By using this device, you accept those terms and conditions.\n    </strong>\n    \" Blackard Decl., Ex. K at 2. Although that text is written in smaller font below the title \"Health &amp; Safety and Warranty Guide\"-which is similar to the brochure title at issue in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    -the inclusion of the additional language would put the reasonable person on notice that\n    the guidebook contains a freestanding obligation that the consumer agrees to by using the phone. Unlike\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    , where the brochure did not appear to be a contract because the cover did not go beyond mentioning warranties,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     845 F.3d at 1289-90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the cover here unequivocally alerts the consumer to the presence of terms and the conduct required to assent to those terms. At a minimum, it is reasonable to conclude that the consumer must take some affirmative action (such as returning the phone or opting out of arbitration) to negate the conclusion that he or she accepts the terms.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/\">\n     at 1287\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Similarly, in contrast to\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    , the arbitration clause is not inconspicuous inside the guidebook. The guidebook contents are the same as the S7 and S7 Edge Plaintiffs' guidebook, so the consumer would follow the same course to reach the arbitration clause. In short, the first page directs the consumer to read the important legal information and notes in bold that arbitration applies (at least to warranty claims), the table of contents lists a section for dispute resolution and 30-day opt out of arbitration, and the guidebook includes the capitalized arbitration provision and the bolded procedure describing how to opt out. Blackard Decl., Ex. K at 3, 8, 22-24. The brochure in\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    did not reference either legal information or arbitration at the front and had no table of contents listing arbitration and the option to opt out. As the Court has already concluded above, the directions at issue here are sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice about the arbitration provision. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Samsung's motion to compel arbitration as to Plaintiff Martin.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     iii.

FAC \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 18-19, 23. As to these remaining Plaintiffs, the Court need not do any analytical heavy lifting. Samsung concedes that, under\n    <em>\n     Norcia\n    </em>\n    , these Plaintiffs did not form an agreement to arbitrate; Samsung \"move[s] to compel arbitration with respect to these five Plaintiffs for preservation purposes only.\" Mot. 21.

The cryptic clues and tortuous path that these Plaintiffs would have to follow to arrive at the arbitration clause do not sufficiently place a reasonable person on notice that using the phone constitutes acceptance of arbitration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The outside of the box mentions terms and conditions (and even arbitration), but the presentation is somewhat obscuring and misleading. Specifically, the box states: \"See enclosed materials for manufacturer's Limited Warranty and important user guide information. See brochures and Terms and Conditions (including arbitration provision) at T-Mobile.com, for rate plan information, features and services, coverage maps and additional details.\" Blackard Decl., Ex. T. That language is sandwiched in the middle of a long paragraph of information and does nothing to set off this information as important.

The inside of the guidebook is to the same effect. Unlike some of the iterations described above, the first page does not even indicate that use of the phone constitutes acceptance of the terms contained therein. Blackard Decl., Ex. U at 3.

Although the arbitration provision appears in capital lettering and the opt-out procedures appear in bold, they do not stand out because multiple other provisions are written in the same formatting. These circumstances are a far cry from providing notice to a reasonable person that using the phone constituted assent to arbitration.

Motion to Dismiss Class Claims\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    For Plaintiffs whose phones are subject to arbitration, Samsung also moves to dismiss their class-action claims. Mot. 23-24. The relevant Plaintiffs' guidebooks included a clause waiving class treatment immediately below the arbitration clause. Specifically, that clause provided that \"ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL NOT BE COMBINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH A DISPUTE INVOLVING ANY OTHER PERSON'S OR ENTITY'S PRODUCT OR CLAIM, AND SPECIFICALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PROCEED AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.\" Blackard Decl., Ex. G at 26; Ex. H, at 28; Ex. I at 30; Ex. J, at 27; Ex. K at 22. The Supreme Court has enforced class waivers in arbitration agreements in functionally identical circumstances.\n    <em>\n     Am. Exp.

Plaintiffs do not contest that the Plaintiffs whose phones are subject to arbitration cannot sustain their class-action claims. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Samsung's motion to dismiss the class-action claims of Plaintiffs Martin, Atebar (as to the S7), Esther Vega, Holzworth, Kouyoumdjian, and Raymond.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Motion to Stay the Litigation Pending Arbitration\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Finally, Samsung requests that if the Court orders arbitration as to any Plaintiff, it should stay all proceedings in this litigation pending arbitration. Mot. 24-25. Under the FAA, the court is authorized to stay proceedings pending arbitration.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n     9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[U]pon being satisfied that the issue involved in [the] suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under [the pertinent] agreement, [the court] shall on application of one of the parties\n    stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement....\").
