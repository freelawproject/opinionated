The Government alleges that Mr. Lieu engaged in a series of electronic communications with an undercover detective who was posing as a father of a fictitious nine-year-old girl and that Mr. Lieu made arrangements to meet the fictitious father and child for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity with the daughter. This matter is presently before the Court on two related evidentiary motions. First, Mr. Lieu moves to suppress a variety of evidence based on his claim that the Government violated his constitutional protections under the Fourth and Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Suppress (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 52. Second, the Government moves to admit evidence that Mr. Lieu (1) possessed child pornography at his home, (2) had previously sexually abused his stepdaughter, and (3) was communicating with someone, contemporaneous with his conversations with the undercover detective, about his sexual interest in children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States' Mot. Admit (\"Gov't Mot.\"), ECF No. 50. For the reasons stated below, the Court will deny Mr. Lieu's motion to suppress and grant the Government's motion to admit the evidence of the prior bad acts, subject to a limiting instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Allegations of the Instant Offenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Government intends to prove the following allegations at trial. In the winter of 2016, Detective Timothy Palchak was acting in an undercover capacity as part of the Metropolitan Police Department-Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"MPD-FBI\") Child Exploitation Task Force. In that role, he posted an online advertisement on Craigslist intended to attract individuals with a sexual interest in children. The advertisement read: \"Any other young perv dads into no limit taboo stuff, shoot me an email or leave me your kik, don't want to say to[o] much on here.\" An individual with the profile name \"Dave Loof\" answered the ad via email, stating \"[h]ey, I'm totally a taboo/pervy dad. Yeah, I'm into that. What's on your mind[?]\" Detective\n   Palchak, in his undercover capacity, responded, \"looking to meet other [young] dads that are into [young]/incest, etc.\" and asked for the individual's username on an instant message platform known as \"KIK,\" which \"Dave Loof\" supplied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, Detective Palchak initiated a conversation on KIK, telling the now-target of the investigation that his name was \"John.\" The target, whose KIK username was \"Dave Ell,\" told Detective Palchak that he was a 42-year-old man from \"Nova\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   interested in \"incst/yng.\" Detective Palchak asked the target whether he had \"any lil ones.\" Detective Palchak indicated that he himself had a nine-year-old daughter. \"Dave Ell\" responded \"[w]ow! ... hot\" and noted that he had two stepchildren, ages eleven and fourteen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Dave Ell\" then asked the detective for details of any sexual acts that the detective had engaged in with his supposed nine-year-old. Detective Palchak stated that he and his fictional daughter had engaged in reciprocal acts of oral sex on one another. The target responded \"Omfg..... HOT,\" asked whether she \"like[d] it,\" and said that the detective was a \"lucky dawg.\" \"Dave Ell\" also asked if the detective had any pictures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Palchak then turned to the subject of \"Dave Ell's\" activities. Detective Palchak asked whether \"Dave Ell\" ever got \"any play or peeks\" of his stepdaughters. The target responded that he \"used to .. about 4 ye[ar]s ago. Less now but get peeks.\" He also indicated that he did not have any pictures of his stepdaughters because \"mom is watching like a hawk.\" Detective Palchak asked whether he had \"[p]ics of any of what we like,\" to which the target responded \"Plenty. Just not of mine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Dave Ell\" then raised the possibility of meeting in person. He first asked whether the detective had ever done a meeting before. Detective Palchak stated that he had come close once before, but it never came to fruition. He explained that he \"was disappointed because [he] was looking forward to it and she [referring to his fictional daughter] actually was too.\" \"Dave Ell\" responded \"Damn.... I'd be more than happy to help out with that.\" Detective Palchak indicated that he \"may be interested,\" but he would have to know that \"Dave Ell\" was \"safe\" by getting some sort of proof. Detective Palchak asked, of the pictures that \"Dave Ell\" had, what the age was of the youngest child. \"Dave Ell\" indicated that the youngest was probably six years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The two then agreed to trade pictures. Although he initially indicated that he did not have any pictures of his stepdaughters, \"Dave Ell\" indicated that he \"[a]ctually found one\" from when one of his stepdaughters was seven years old. He then sent Detective Palchak an image of a naked girl who appeared to be approximately seven years old and was date stamped May 2009, which is consistent with the actual age of Defendant's daughter at that time. Detective Palchak then sent two images of his purported nine-year-old daughter, though the images in actuality were not of a real child. \"Dave Ell\" responded with comments like, \"[n]iiice,\" \"[d]amn hot,\" and \"[g]od she looks delicious!\" He also asked sexually explicit questions about the child like, \"[d]oes she\n   like getting licked\" and \"[e]ver rub it on her own face?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Detective Palchak noted that he sent the images so that \"Dave Ell\" would know that he was \"real/cool\" and indicated that \"a pic or 2 more from u will be all I need the[n] we can talk about meeting up.\" \"Dave Ell\" responded, \"let me find some more proof for ya.\" After apparently looking for additional photographs, he stated \"[d]amn ... all the ones I have are on another computer,\" which he claimed was \"in [his] NY apartment.\" Nevertheless, Dave Loof asked to switch their conversation to Yahoo Messenger, where he said he could share \"some tamer ones.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The two then moved their conversation to Yahoo Messenger, where the target used the username \"roll8mi.\" At that point, the target sent Detective Palchak several images of child erotica\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and three images of child pornography. Each of the three images of child pornography involved naked pre-pubescent girls between the ages of six and twelve years old posing in sexually explicit positions. Thereafter, \"roll8mi\" asked Detective Palchak if he had ever seen \"vicky videos.\" Detective Palchak understood the target to be referring to the child pornography series involving the well-known child victim \"Vicky.\" The target indicated that he had a few of her videos, but \"lost most of the good ones.\" Detective Palchak asked if \"roll8mi\" had \"any of those on [him],\" to which \"roll8mi\" responded, \"no ... in my other computer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the conversation progressed, \"roll8mi\" began to discuss having sexual contact with his stepdaughter. He claimed that he started with his oldest stepdaughter when she was seven years old. He said it \"started out when [he] put her to bed one night.\" He claimed that \"she put her hand on [his] thigh and started creeping up.\" He said, \"as soon as she did that mydick started creeping to meet her hand\" and \"she made contact and played some that night.\" He emphasized that \"the anticipation of what she would do next was enough to make [his] heart jump out of [his] chest.\" The target said that he \"took it slow from there but she never went much further.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Palchak and \"roll8mi\" then began to arrange a meeting for the next day, when Detective Palchak told the target he would have his supposed daughter. The target indicated that he had to be in Owings Mills, Maryland until around 3:00 p.m. or so, but that he would be free after that. Detective Palchak stated the he had to work until about 3:30 p.m. and said that they \"could meet at a bar near [his] apartment[,] grab a drink and then go back to [his] place and have fun with her.\" The target replied, \"that would be sweet.\" Detective Palchak then asked \"roll8mi\" what he would be \"interested in doing.\" The target said he would \"do everything except cross your limits.\" Detective Palchak said his \"only limit is fucking,\" and \"everything else is cool.\" \"Roll8mi\" asked if \"rubbing\" was alright, to which Detective Palchak indicated that it was, as was \"all licking sucking and fingering.\" \"Roll8mi\" replied that he was \"good with that\" and that he \"really love[d] licking and tasting anyway.\" He noted that he hoped they could \"play for a good long time.\" The two then traded cell phone numbers and noted that they looked forward to meeting one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The next day, February 4, 2016, the suspect sent a text message to Detective\n   Palchak stating that he could be at the designated bar in Washington, D.C. around 3:30 p.m. When Detective Palchak indicated that he had told his daughter that he \"might have company,\" the target responded \"[a]wesome..... so she's expecting to play then :-)\" He also expressed great enthusiasm for their upcoming meeting, making statements like \"damn I'm excited\" and that he had \"[n]ever been so eager :-)\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Later, the suspect sent Detective Palchak a text message stating that he was leaving and expected to arrive at the designated bar around 4:00 p.m. The detective described his clothing and stated that he would wait for him inside at the corner of the bar. The target noted that he would be wearing a \"light sport coat with blue grey slacks.\" At approximately 4:00 p.m., Defendant Lieu arrived at the bar and immediately approached Detective Palchak. The Detective surmised that Mr. Lieu was the suspect he had been communicating with based on the clothes that Mr. Lieu was wearing at that time. Detective Palchak then asked if he was \"Dave,\" to which Mr. Lieu replied yes. Mr. Lieu then asked whether the detective was \"John.\" Detective Palchak responded affirmatively and asked whether Mr. Lieu was looking forward to later, and Mr. Lieu indicated that he was. At that point, members of the Child Exploitation Task Force placed Mr. Lieu under arrest, searched his person, and recovered, among other things, a cellular telephone and a driver's license with a stated address in Camillus, New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on this alleged conduct, Mr. Lieu is now charged with one count of distributing child pornography, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and one count of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Subsequent Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Mr. Lieu's Interview with FBI Agents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following Mr. Lieu's arrest, he was interviewed by FBI Agent Alicia McShane and FBI Agent Jenny Cutalo-Patterson. At the beginning of Mr. Lieu's interview, and before asking him any questions whatsoever, Agents McShane and Cutalo-Patterson advised Mr. Lieu, both orally and in writing, that he had a right to remain silent and that he had a right to have an attorney present. Mr. Lieu orally represented to the agents that he understood those rights and that he was \"willing to cooperate.\" Mr. Lieu initially represented, however, that he wanted to have a lawyer before proceeding with the interview. But moments later, and without prompting from the agents, he indicated that he wanted to \"try to have a conversation\" so long as he could answer only the questions that he was comfortable with. The agents agreed that he could do so and that, in fact, he was entitled to do so. Given that he had previously requested a lawyer and then asked to have a \"conversation,\" the agents asked whether he was, in fact, waiving his right to a lawyer at that moment. Mr. Lieu said he wanted to \"run through the questions\" and would defer on any questions he felt he could not answer on his own. The agents told Mr. Lieu that they understood this response to mean that he was waiving his right to an attorney for the time being and asked Mr. Lieu if their understanding was correct. He indicated that it was. Agents then proceeded to ask Mr. Lieu several questions, some of which Mr. Lieu was willing to answer and others that he was not. Throughout all of this, the agents emphasized at multiple points that any refusal to answer questions was within his right and would not change anything that would happen to him going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the interview, the agents noted that Mr. Lieu had a New York driver's license. Mr. Lieu affirmed that his primary residence was in New York and that he had a wife, two stepchildren, and a biological child. Mr. Lieu also explained that he was in the D.C. metropolitan area on business and had traveled from a meeting in Maryland to the District of Columbia to meet \"John.\" Mr. Lieu was not willing, however, to answer any further questions about how he met \"John\" or the reasons for which he was meeting him. Based on Mr. Lieu's unwillingness to answer these types of questions, the agents decided to end the questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2. Execution of Search Warrants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 8, 2016, based on the facts alleged above, a United States Magistrate Judge from the Northern District of New York issued a warrant authorizing law enforcement officials to execute a search of Mr. Lieu's home in New York. Pursuant to the warrant, law enforcement sought evidence that Mr. Lieu possessed child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2252A and were permitted to seize, among other things, computers and other electronic media devices that might contain such evidence. That same day, the warrant was executed and several computers and other electronics were seized, including an external hard-drive that contained 397 images and 19 videos of child pornography, including approximately 41 media files of the \"Vicky Series.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to the search of Mr. Lieu's home, federal agents also secured a warrant authorizing the forensic examination of the phone that officials seized from Mr. Lieu's person upon his arrest. That examination revealed the conversation that had taken place with Detective Palchak, but also electronic communications that Mr. Lieu had with another individual, hereinafter referred to as John Doe. These other communications began on February 3, 2016, the same day that Mr. Lieu began corresponding with the undercover detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This conversation, like the one with the undercover agent, was initiated by Mr. Lieu in response to an advertisement posted on Craigslist that sought other individuals who were interested in \"taboo.\" In his initial email to John Doe, Mr. Lieu emphasized that he was into \"young\" and \"taboo.\" During this conversation, Mr. Lieu and John Doe exchanged stories of sexually abusing minors and enthusiastically discussed their mutual sexual desires involving children. For his part, Mr. Lieu admitted that he had had an \"experience\" with his stepdaughter when she was approximately seven years old and stated that he \"wish[ed] it coulda gone further than it did.\" And although she was now older, he claimed that he still caught \"glimpses\" of her and stated that the child \"[s]eems to have amnesia about it all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Lieu also told John Doe that he was supposed to meet with a nine-year-old that evening. Mr. Lieu indicated that he was \"[v]ery excited about it\" and that he \"was almost shivering uncontrollably\" the night before. Mr. Lieu told John Doe, that if it went \"well,\" he would \"see about expanding [the] circle to include\" him. Mr. Lieu and John Doe ultimately exchanged personal email addresses and made plans to meet in person after Mr. Lieu's encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3. Interview with Mr. Lieu's Oldest Stepdaughter\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on Mr. Lieu's statements that he had sexually abused his oldest stepdaughter, law enforcement officials in New York decided to interview the child. The child initially told investigators that, one time, when she was in the fifth grade, she was getting out of the shower when she noticed that Mr. Lieu was in the bathroom with her. She claims that he looked at her\n   naked body and told her that she was beautiful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The child also recounted other events that occurred starting from the time she was about seven years old. The child told investigators that, at that time, Mr. Lieu began something he called \"national naked day.\" On these \"national naked days,\" Mr. Lieu would apparently have the child run around the house naked and then later they would both lay naked in bed together. Mr. Lieu allegedly warned the child that she was not allowed to tell anyone about these exploits. Investigators asked her if Mr. Lieu had ever touched her during one of these days, but she initially claimed that she could not remember anything else. Several months later, however, she asked to speak with police again. This time, she informed them, consistent with Mr. Lieu's accounts, that Mr. Lieu had engaged in sexual acts with her from the time that she was seven years old until she was approximately ten. Specifically, she claimed that Mr. Lieu would \"tuck her in\" at night and have her touch his unclothed penis before bed. This behavior suddenly stopped, however, after the child began openly taking about \"national naked day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Current Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This case comes before the Court on two evidentiary motions. First, Mr. Lieu claims that the Government violated his constitutional rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and that, therefore, certain evidence must be suppressed. Specifically, Mr. Lieu seeks suppression of his cellular telephone, statements that he made to federal agents following his arrest, and the various electronic devices that were seized from his home. The Government, on the other hand, moves to admit evidence of Mr. Lieu's prior acts under Rules 414 and 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Specifically, the Government seeks to introduce evidence that Mr. Lieu (1) sexually abused his step-daughter when she was between the ages of seven and ten years old, (2) possessed 397 images and 19 videos depicting child pornography, and (3) communicated simultaneously with someone else about his sexual interest in children at the same time he was communicating with the undercover agent. Gov't Mot. at 1. Both motions have now been briefed and on January 18, 2018, the Court heard oral argument from the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court first considers Mr. Lieu's motion to suppress. In broad strokes, Mr. Lieu essentially presents three arguments for why certain evidence should be suppressed. First, Mr. Lieu argues that, notwithstanding what was said in the communications to Detective Palchak, the agents had neither a warrant nor probable cause when they arrested him because they could not at that time have been sure he was the person who had generated the messages in question. Accordingly, he argues that this arrest violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures and that any evidence stemming from his arrest is fruit of the poisonous tree and must be suppressed. Second, Mr. Lieu argues that the agents violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment because he invoked his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   . For this reason, he argues that his post-arrest statements must be suppressed. Finally, he argues that, because his post-arrest statements were used to support the warrant application for his home and the application did not declare that the statements had been obtained in violation of his rights, the warrant application was necessarily defective and any evidence obtained as a result of that search warrant should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court rejects each of Mr. Lieu's contentions. Specifically, the Court finds that the circumstances known to the agents at the time of Mr. Lieu's arrest were sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. Therefore, there was no violation of Mr. Lieu's Fourth Amendment rights with respect to his arrest or the search of his person. Moreover, the Court finds that there was no violation of Mr. Lieu's Fifth Amendment rights because, after being advised of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney, Mr. Lieu made a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of those rights when he decided to speak with the federal agents. For that reason, the affidavit supporting the warrant to search Mr. Lieu's home was not defective and, in any event, the warrant contained sufficient factual underpinnings to support a probable cause determination even in the absence of Mr. Lieu's post-arrest statements. Accordingly, the Court finds no basis to suppress any evidence and consequently denies Mr. Lieu's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court then addresses the Government's Motion to admit evidence of certain prior acts under Rules 414, 404(b), and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Specifically, the Government seeks admission of evidence that (1) Mr. Lieu possessed child pornography at his home, (2) Mr. Lieu had previously sexually abused his stepdaughter, and (3) Mr. Lieu, contemporaneous with his communications with the undercover detective, was also communicating with someone else about his sexual interest in children. The Court finds that each of these categories of evidence is variously admissible under Rules 404(b) and 414 as to each of the charges currently pending against Mr. Lieu. However, the Court will endeavor to ensure that the admission of this evidence is not unduly prejudicial by instructing the jury concerning the purposes for which they may consider this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mr. Lieu's Arrest and Seizure of Items from His Person\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Lieu argues that the agents \"lacked both a warrant and probable cause to seize, search[,] and arrest Mr. Lieu.\" Def.'s Mot. at 4. For this reason, Mr. Lieu argues that any evidence seized from his person, any statements that he subsequently made to police, and any other evidence that might have flowed from his arrest must be suppressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 4. For the reasons set forth below, Mr. Lieu's arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Fourth Amendment guarantees that the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Thus, all seizures must be \"founded upon reasonable, objective justification.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mr. Lieu does not dispute this. Rather he argues that the officers were unreasonable in believing that he was the person who sent the messages. Mr. Lieu premises his argument on the fact that, prior to his arrest, law enforcement did not know exactly what he looked like. But, the confluence of several factors made it eminently reasonable for officers to believe that he was the person responsible. To start, Mr. Lieu arrived at the designated location at the designated time. Once inside, Mr. Lieu immediately proceeded to a specified location in the bar and approached the detective-a man that Mr. Lieu obviously did not know. Moreover, the target of the investigation had indicated that he would be wearing a \"light sport coat with blue grey slacks,\" which matched the clothing that Mr. Lieu was wearing at that time. Furthermore, in the short conversation that then ensued, Mr. Lieu confirmed that his name was \"Dave\"-the same name the target gave to the detective-and asked if the detective's name was \"John\"-the fake name that the detective had supplied. And when Detective Palchak-again, a stranger to Mr. Lieu-asked whether he was \"looking forward to later,\" Mr. Lieu affirmed that he was. Law enforcement therefore had every reason to believe that Mr. Lieu was the same person with whom they had been messaging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But Mr. Lieu argues that the names \"Dave\" and \"John\" are relatively common names and that the clothing description is too general to support the connection that the agents made.

The law enforcement officers subsequently obtained a search warrant authorizing a forensic examination of the phone, which did in fact contain Mr. Lieu's communications with Detective Palchak and Mr. Lieu's communication with John Doe. Mr. Lieu makes no argument that the search incident to arrest, the seizure of his phone, or the subsequent examination of the phone pursuant to a warrant were in any way improper or violated Mr. Lieu's rights.

Thus, according to Mr. Lieu, any post-arrest statements he made must be suppressed. Furthermore, he argues that \"[e]ven though the [G]overnment obtained a warrant to search Mr. Lieu's New York home, agents did not have a good faith basis to rely on the warrant\" because, according to Mr. Lieu, the agents \"misled the Court by not disclosing that they procured the statement on which they were relying [in the warrant application] despite Mr. Lieu's invocation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\" Def.'s Mot. at 5.

Federal agents advised Mr. Lieu of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney, both orally and in writing, before asking Mr. Lieu any questions. Mr. Lieu then represented that he understood those\n   rights. Moreover, the audio recording reveals no apparent language barrier impeding Mr. Lieu's ability to communicate with the agents, it appears that Mr. Lieu had no trouble grasping any concepts presented to him, and he spoke intelligently and discerningly throughout his interview. In addition, Mr. Lieu further demonstrated his understanding of the consequences of waiver when he agreed to selectively answer only some questions but not others.

They also repeatedly reassured Mr. Lieu that he was permitted to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights at any time and that he would suffer no ill consequences for doing so. And Mr. Lieu, in fact, did refuse to answer several questions during the interview. Mr. Lieu's ability to discern which questions he wanted to answer is further evidence that his will was not overborne and that his post-arrest statements to the agents were made voluntarily and were not the product of undue coercion.

The only statements from Mr. Lieu's interview reported in the warrant application were Mr. Lieu's confirmation that he lived in New York with his wife, two stepchildren, and biological daughter and that he was in the D.C. area on business when he was arrested. The sole import of this information for purposes of the probable cause determination would seem to be that he lived in New York-the place to be searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But even without Mr. Lieu's statements, the affidavit supporting the warrant application gave ample reason to believe that there may be evidence of a crime at his New York residence. During Mr. Lieu's conversation with the undercover agent, Mr. Lieu apparently sought to provide Detective Palchak images of child pornography as a means of demonstrating that he was not law enforcement or otherwise to prove that he was serious about meeting with the supposed father. Mr. Lieu wrote \"ok .... let me find some more proof for ya,\" but stated that \"all the ones [he] [had] are on another computer,\" which he indicated were \"in [his] NY apartment.\" Likewise, during their discussion of a series of child pornographic videos known as \"Vicky videos,\" Mr. Lieu indicated that he had one such video \"in [his] other computer.\" According to the affidavit, at the time of Mr. Lieu's arrest, he was in possession of a valid New York state driver's license,\n   which indicated a current address in Camillus, New York.

Aff. \u00b6 25. Consequently, the other details of the affidavit provided ample support for a finding of probable cause and issuance of the warrant, even when discounted for Mr. Lieu's statements. Thus, the Court finds that the items and materials seized from Mr. Lieu's home were properly seized pursuant to a valid warrant and that Mr. Lieu has not identified any legitimate basis upon which the items should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Government seeks to introduce evidence pertaining to three matters that it claims are relevant to the charges against Mr. Lieu. First, the Government seeks admission of evidence that Mr. Lieu sexually abused his stepdaughter when she was between the ages of seven and ten years old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. at 1.

Lastly, the Government would like to introduce evidence that, at the same time that Mr. Lieu was communicating with the undercover agent, he was simultaneously communicating with someone else about his sexual interest in children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. at 1. The Court finds that evidence concerning all of these matters may be properly introduced variously under Rules 404(b) and 414 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, subject to a limiting jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   1.

In cases where the charged crime involves a question of whether the defendant intended to have sexual contact with a minor, courts routinely find that possession of such material is admissible under Rule 404(b) as probative of the defendant's sexual attraction to children.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303321\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/110/#p116\">\n    916 F.Supp.2d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Defendant's access to child pornography is relevant to the Defendant's intent in this case insofar as it is probative of his sexual attraction to children\" in case involving two counts of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argues that the child pornography is not relevant because he did \"not have [ ] access to images and videos found on a computer in New York ... because the government alleges that he was in the Districts of Columbia and Maryland.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 1. Mr. Lieu emphasizes\n   that, while the hard drive was found in his home, it is a home that he \"shared ... with other people.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 1. As we know, those other people were his wife, two stepdaughters, and biological daughter. Mr. Lieu does not seriously contend that the materials in fact belonged to any of them. Indeed, there is every reason to find that Mr. Lieu was in constructive possession of the child pornography because it was found in his home and he specifically linked himself to it when he told Detective Palchak that this material could be found there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276263\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/675/#p681\">\n    860 F.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (D.C.

More importantly, whether Mr. Lieu had immediate physical access to the material at the exact moment of his alleged offenses does not detract from its relevance on the issues related to his state of mind. His possession alone is indicative of his sexual interests in children and it is especially probative of his state of mind as to the charged offenses because, during his conversation with Detective Palchak, he specifically referenced his interest in these photographs and videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   While the Court finds that the images likely have significant probative value, the Court will at this time reserve judgment as to the extent of their admissibility under Rule 403 because the Government has not yet identified the images that it wishes to present at trial or the form in which it wishes to present them. As discussed above, a defendant's possession of child pornography is generally admissible under Rule 404(b) in cases such as this because such evidence is regarded to be probative of matters of motive, intent, knowledge, and absence of mistake. Moreover, the probative value of such material may be heightened if they are, for example, representative of the conduct at issue in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303321\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/110/#p116\">\n    916 F.Supp.2d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The revised exhibit should include images accessed in 2012 to the extent they are representative of the type of sexual conduct the Defendant discussed with JP.\"). On the other hand, the Government has identified literally hundreds of photographs and nearly twenty videos depicting sexually explicit images of children.

Accordingly, the Court finds that, as a general matter, the images and videos of child pornography found at Mr. Lieu's home are admissible under Rule 404(b), but this admissibility is subject to this Court's review of the evidence so that it may determine the number of images that might be admitted and how they may be presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Indeed, like possession of child pornography, a prior act of molestation demonstrates a prurient interest in children, and courts have frequently admitted evidence of such acts under Rule 404(b) in cases involving charges of child pornography and crimes involving travel for purposes of engaging in illicit sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, the Court is convinced that evidence of Mr. Lieu's alleged assault on his stepdaughter is particularly salient on the issue of Mr. Lieu's intent and knowledge. To start, this alleged conduct occurred within approximately four years of the alleged crimes at issue, which is not so remote in time as to have lost all relevance to the crimes at issue.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Knope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829241\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/647/#p657\">\n    655 F.3d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"The other acts occurred within the past three years, sufficiently close in time to his arrest to be relevant to the offense.\"). Its relevance is further confirmed, however, by the fact that Mr. Lieu expressly raised this alleged abuse in his communications with Detective Palchak and, later, with John Doe. Because Mr. Lieu himself raised this conduct in his communications, the truth and veracity of his assertions on that topic are highly informative of his state of mind. Indeed, by corroborating these interactions, it casts doubt on the notion that his communications with the detective were merely a manifestation of harmless sexual fantasy or some other morbid curiosity and were, in fact, a reflection of his actual intent and desires. In addition, evidence that Mr. Lieu abused his stepdaughter between the ages of seven and ten demonstrates, not just a sexual interest in children, but an actual and specific sexual interest in female children of approximately that age. This is relevant because it is consistent with the crimes with which he is charged. Indeed, the images that he sent to Detective Palchak depicted girls between the ages of six and twelve years old and he is accused of traveling into the District to have sex with a nine-year-old girl. Thus, it paints a picture that Mr. Lieu sent images of child pornography knowingly and that he traveled to the district with an actual and serious purpose to abuse a female child of that age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Weighing against this rather significant and probative evidence is minimal prejudice. While the alleged abuse would certainly seem abhorrent, based on the representations made to the Court, it does not appear that the evidence will be especially graphic in the context of the crimes with which Mr. Lieu has been charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Likewise, the Court has no reason to believe that the testimony on the topic will be especially voluminous or otherwise dominate the trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that evidence of Mr. Lieu's alleged abuse of his stepdaughter is admissible under Rules 404(b) and 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    c. Mr. Lieu's Communications with John Doe\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that evidence that Mr. Lieu engaged in explicit discussions with John Doe is properly admissible under Rules 404(b) and 403 and is relevant to the issues of knowledge, intent, motive, and absence of mistake. Mr. Lieu initially made contact with John Doe through the Craigslist website and the two then enthusiastically discussed their mutually shared sexual interest in children. Thus, at a minimum, these communications demonstrate Mr. Lieu's sexual interest in children, and are therefore relevant to Mr. Lieu's knowledge at the time he sent the images of child pornography to Detective Palchak. Moreover, in light of the fact that Mr. Lieu is charged with using the Craigslist website to arrange a meeting with a supposed father of a young girl for the purpose of sexually abusing a child, Mr. Lieu's communications with John Doe are sufficiently similar to the charged conduct to permit a reasonable jury to draw from it an inference that Mr. Lieu was motivated by a sexual intent when he traveled into the District of Columbia to meet Detective Palchak and his fictitious daughter.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303321\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/110/#p116\">\n    916 F.Supp.2d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]vidence the Defendant engaged in explicit discussions of sexual contact with minors, regardless of whether or not he followed through with plans to meet in person, is probative of his intent to entice or coerce the minors to engage in illicit sexual activity.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And, just as he admitted to Detective Palchak, Mr. Lieu admits in this conversation with John Doe that he had sexual contact with his stepdaughter, further adding to its probative value on the issue of intent, knowledge, and absence of mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303321\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/110/#p116\">\n    916 F.Supp.2d at 122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's \"repeated admission\" in an electronic chat transcript that \"in the past he had sexual contact with an eleven year-old boy\" was \"highly relevant to the Defendant's intent to actually coerce or entice the minors at issue in this case.\"). But perhaps the most probative aspect of this correspondence is the fact that it occurred contemporaneously with Mr. Lieu's conversation with the undercover agent and Mr. Lieu expressly referenced his upcoming meeting with the undercover agent. In fact, Mr. Lieu expressed great enthusiasm for his upcoming meeting with the agent and his fictitious daughter and gave no indication that his desire to meet them involved fantasy rather than actual intent. Thus, for these reasons, the conversation is highly probative of Mr. Lieu's state of mind around the time of his alleged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   After closely reviewing the transcript of Mr. Lieu's conversation with John Doe, the Court finds that the risk of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh its probative value. As noted above, the transcript of Mr. Lieu's communications with John Doe is highly probative of Mr. Lieu's state of mind-an issue that is likely to be of critical importance in this case. Although the graphic nature of the conversation may be prejudicial in some sense, the conversation is relatively brief and, given that the subject matter of this case is centered on sexual exploitation of minors, any prejudice to Mr. Lieu cannot be said to be wholly \"unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303321\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/110/#p116\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303321\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/110/#p116\">\n    at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The subject matter of the Defendant's conversations with Aussie creates some risk of prejudice,\" but \"in a case that by definition concerns sexual activity with minors, the discussions with Aussie are not\n   <em>\n    unduly\n   </em>\n   prejudicial.\" (emphasis in original) ). Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Lieu's conversation with John Doe is admissible under Rule 404(b) and 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2. Rule 414\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In addition to Rule 404(b), the Government argues that evidence of Mr. Lieu's collection of child pornography and his abuse of his stepdaughter are independently admissible under Rule 414. As discussed above, the admissibility of a defendant's prior acts is ordinarily governed by Rule 404, which prohibits using evidence to show that the defendant has a propensity to act in a certain manner and that the defendant, in fact, acted in accordance with that propensity in a given instance. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1),(2). But, cases involving \"child molestation\" are different. Rule 414(a) provides that \"[i]n a criminal case in which a defendant is accused of child molestation, the court may admit evidence that the defendant committed any other child molestation\" and emphasizes that \"[t]he evidence may be considered on any matter to which it is relevant.\" Fed. R. Evid. 414(a). Thus, Rule 414\"create[s] an exception to the general ban on propensity evidence contained in Rule 404(b).\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Seymour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453298\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/378/#p385\">\n    468 F.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (6th Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In fact, Rule 414 embodies a \"strong legislative judgment that evidence of prior sexual offenses should ordinarily be admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. LeCompte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889056\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/767/#p769\">\n    131 F.3d 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769 (8th Cir. 1997). The Rule's historical notes suggest that \"[t]o implement the legislative intent, the courts must liberally construe these rules to provide the basis for a fully informed decision of sexual assault and child molestation cases, including assessment of the defendant's propensities and questions of probability in light of the defendant's past conduct.\" Fed. R. Evid. 413 Historical Notes. Nevertheless, \" Rule 414 evidence remains subject to Rule 403's balancing between probative value and unfair prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Joubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051277\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/247/#p254\">\n    778 F.3d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254 (1st Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To determine the applicability of Rule 414, the Court must first consider the threshold issue of whether this is a criminal case in which Mr. Lieu has been \"accused of child molestation,\" as the Rule defines that term. Under Rule 414, \"child molestation\" is defined to include, among other things, crimes under federal law involving \"any conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. chapter 109A and committed with a child,\" \"any conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. chapter 110,\" as well as certain other crimes of a sexual nature committed with children\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or attempts or conspiracies\n   to engage in such conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 414(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In this case, only one of the two charges against Mr. Lieu comes within Rule 414's definition of \"child molestation.\" Count One of the superseding indictment, which concerns Mr. Lieu's alleged distribution of child pornography, is a crime under 18 U.S.C. chapter 110 and therefore constitutes \"child molestation\" under Rule 414.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). On the other hand, Count Two, which involves travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, is found in chapter 117 of Title 18. Thus, it does not fall within Rule 414's inclusion for crimes found in chapters 109A or 110.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the acts alleged for purposes of Count Two do not fall within the other acts enumerated in Rule 414, which generally involve sexual contact with persons under the age of 14.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Government makes no argument for why Rule 414 evidence should be considered for purposes of Count Two. Thus, to the extent that Rule 414 applies, it applies only to evidence used for purposes of Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The next step then is to assess whether the evidence that the Government seeks to admit is \"evidence that the defendant committed [another] child molestation\" and whether it is relevant to the current charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 414(a). The Government seeks to admit the evidence of Mr. Lieu's collection of child pornography and evidence that Mr. Lieu sexually abused his stepdaughter when she was seven-years-old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. at 8-10. The Court has no trouble finding that such matters constitute \"child molestations\" for purposes of the Rule and that they are relevant to Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   First, the images and videos of child pornography discovered at Mr. Lieu's home clearly constitute \"child molestation\" under the Rule because, like Count One, knowing possession of child pornography is conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. chapter 110.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). Moreover, as discussed in greater detail above, his possession of this material is certainly relevant to the distribution charge for it is helpful in proving intent, knowledge, and absence of mistake or accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825638\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/1033/#p1038\">\n    862 F.2d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \"no difficulty with the admission into evidence of the child pornography found ... in [defendant]'s home\" in case involving charge of knowing receipt of child pornography because it was relevant to show \"proof of ... intent, ... knowledge, ... or absence of mistake or accident.\" (quoting Fed.

Cir. 2001) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Likewise, evidence that Mr. Lieu sexually abused his seven-year-old stepdaughter is also properly admissible under Rule 414 for purposes of Count One. According to the Government, Mr. Lieu's stepdaughter, in her discussions with police, indicated that Mr. Lieu had \"engaged in sexual acts with her, beginning from when she was seven years old until she was ten years old.\" Gov't Mot. at 9. Specifically, she claimed that Mr. Lieu would \" 'tuck her in' at night and have her touch his unclothed penis before bed.\" Gov't Mot. at 9. Such conduct constitutes \"child molestation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   as it is a \"crime under federal law\" involving \"contact between the defendant's genitals ... and [a] part of a child's body.\" Fed. R.

It is also conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 109A that was committed with a child under the age of 14. Fed. R. Evid. 414(d)(2)(A). And, as discussed above, Mr. Lieu's alleged abuse of his daughter is relevant to the charged offenses because, like the evidence of child pornography found in his home, if true, it demonstrates Mr. Lieu's sexual interest in children and is admissible to prove his propensity to possess and distribute prurient materials involving children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A careful review of the audio from Mr. Lieu's interrogation demonstrates that this is precisely what happened here. Indeed, Mr. Lieu made it quite clear to agents that he was inviting conversation about the circumstances of his arrest and that he wished to proceed with the interview without his lawyer present. The Court has no reason to believe that Mr. Lieu spoke with agents involuntarily or that agents acted in any way improper by proceeding with the interview. Accordingly, the Court has no reason to believe that this document evidences a contravention of Mr. Lieu's rights under\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The term \"child\" is further defined as \"a person below the age of 14.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Although the Government initially claimed in its motion that the Count Two was a crime under chapter 110, it notified the Court at oral argument that this claim was in error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    There is conflicting authority on the issue of how evidence of \"child molestation\" may be used in cases in which some, but not all, of the charges against a criminal defendant amount to \"child molestation.\" Some courts have held that the evidence may only be considered in relation to the crimes that fall within Rule 414's definition.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Mich. Jan. 22, 2010) (\"Insofar as Congress, in FRE 414, requires admission at trial of evidence of a prior child molestation offense[ ], the Court finds admissible Defendant's prior conviction, noted by the Government-but only as to the Counts that come under 414\"). Other courts, however, have emphasized the sweeping language that Congress employed in the rules specific to sexual assaults and child molestations and the legislative intent to interpret those rules broadly. Indeed, they point out that Rules 413 and 414 permit evidence of certain prior acts to be admitted in any \"\n    <em>\n     case\n    </em>\n    in which a defendant is accused of\" certain sex crimes and broadly permits the evidence to be \"considered on\n    <em>\n     any matter\n    </em>\n    to which it is relevant.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Cal. Sept. 17, 2012) (\"[a]lthough defendant contends that Count One does not charge defendant with an act of sexual assault and therefore the Rule 413 evidence is inadmissible as to that offense, Rule 413 does not differentiate between or among counts in an indictment,\" rather \"the plain language of the statute is that prior acts are admissible in any 'case' in which a defendant is so accused.\"). Nevertheless, this Court sees no need to resolve this split of authority here because, even though the travel offense does not independently come within Rule 414's definition of \"child molestation,\" as discussed above, a jury may properly consider evidence of Mr. Lieu's collection of pornography and his alleged sexual abuse of his stepdaughter as to that charge under Rule 404(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
