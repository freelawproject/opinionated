The plaintiff argues, however, that \"the 90-day deadline runs from the deadline of the filing of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, which was filed on October 24, 2017, making the deadline January 22, 2018.\" Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Extend Deadline Class Cert. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") at 3, ECF No. 17-1.

This Court has not had the opportunity to address whether the ninety-day deadline runs from the filing of the original complaint in state court or instead from the removal of the case to federal court, and doing so today is unnecessary because the deadline has lapsed under either rule: ninety days from the filing of the complaint was October 29, 2017, while ninety days from removal was December 11, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nevertheless, the plaintiff's neglect is excusable. The plaintiff's motion and the parties' Joint Meet and Confer Statement indicate that the plaintiff requested the defendants' consent to an extension of time sometime around November 8, 2017, when defendants' counsel represented that they would \"confer\" about the plaintiff's request. Jt. MCS at 6. When plaintiff's counsel followed up on that request on November 13, 2017, defendants' counsel responded two days later asking \"why [plaintiff's counsel] [is] requesting an extension of the certification deadline, so we can discuss the matter with our client.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3931636\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/474/41/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Five minutes later, plaintiff's counsel explained that the request was due to the discovery he anticipated would be necessary to support the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Defendants' counsel never responded to that e-mail but later represented to plaintiff's counsel that the defendant took \"no position on Plaintiff's request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. That neutrality changed into opposition by the time the parties discussed the joint meet and confer statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff's attempts to communicate the request for an extension to defendants' counsel indicate that the defendants have suffered no prejudice as a result of this delay.
