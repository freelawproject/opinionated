BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Richard Caires, it might feel like Groundhog Day. Caires, who has been trying to avoid repayment of a $5.5 million loan he obtained from Washington Mutual Bank in 2005, has filed, reworked, and re-filed several markedly similar lawsuits in four different courts over the past ten years. Each time he loses-whether on the merits or because of a jurisdictional bar-he tries again. This time around, Plaintiff has filed suit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seeking a declaratory judgment on the current ownership of the loan and damages for a bevy of alleged injuries. The FDIC, in response, has now filed a Motion to Dismiss. Unfortunately for Plaintiff, the Court finds that he is once again barred by jurisdictional limitations; for the purposes of this suit, his Day is now finally over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Like many others on the eve of the financial crisis, Caires took a gamble to purchase, remodel, and hopefully sell an \"exclusive property... at the top of the market.\" ECF No. 1 (Complaint), \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Unfortunately for him, he defaulted on his loan, which has resulted in over eight years of litigation. The story begins in 2006 with Caires's purchase of a $1.4 million house in Greenwich, Connecticut, financed primarily by a $1 million loan from WaMu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. L (2016 Proof of Claim), \u00b6 3.10. In August 2007, he obtained an additional $5.5 million construction loan from WaMu, which he used, in part, to pay off his initial acquisition loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While Caires was going about the business of remodeling his property, the financial crisis brought WaMu to its knees. On September 25, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision declared the Bank insolvent\n   and appointed the FDIC as its Receiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7-2 (Declaration of Donald G. Grieser), \u00b6 3. That same day, the FDIC-Receiver entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank for the sale of all the assets and certain liabilities of WaMu.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. The FDIC published a Notice to Creditors and Depositors of WaMu-online and in three national newspapers-informing them that all administrative claims against the Bank had to be submitted to the FDIC by the administrative bar date of December 30, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7-4 (FDIC Website Notice); Grieser Decl., \u00b6 7. It is uncontested that Plaintiff did not comply with this deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8; Compl., \u00b6 6. Although Caires did end up submitting an administrative claim to the FDIC, he did not do so until October 17, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proof of Claim, \u00b6 1.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 3, 2009, Caires received a notice of default-on WaMu letterhead-regarding his failure to comply with the terms of his loan agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. G (Notice of Default and Renegotiation Agreement). But, on May 5, 2009, he apparently negotiated and signed a loan-modification agreement with JPMC that extended his deadline to comply to September 1, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, the agreement specifically recites that JPMC acquired Caires's loan from WaMu through the 2008 P &amp; A agreement with the FDIC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Caires was, nonetheless, seemingly unable to satisfy this modified loan agreement, as he sued JPMC in Connecticut state court on December 3, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caires v. JP Morgan Chase Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167574\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/745/40/#p42\">\n    745 F.Supp.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 (D. Conn. 2010) (describing original complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If Plaintiff has not successfully vindicated his claims, he has surely had his day in court. His first suit-against JPMC in the Superior Court of Connecticut-alleged claims for fraud in the inducement, equitable estoppel from foreclosure, and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167574\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/745/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   JPMC removed the complaint to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167574\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/745/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167574\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/745/40/#p42\">\n    at 43-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After several rounds of motions and a counterclaim by JPMC seeking to foreclose on Plaintiff's property, the court ultimately dismissed all of Caires's suit and remanded the counterclaim to state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7 (Def. Motion to Dismiss) at 7. Notably, when Caires subsequently sought to dismiss JPMC's foreclosure counterclaim by alleging that his loan had never been transferred from WaMu to JPMC through the P &amp; A Agreement, the court found that JPMC \"had established that [JPMC] or its duly authorized agents had possession of the [2007 WaMu note].\"\n   <em>\n    Caires v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202541858\">\n    2017 WL 2541858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Conn. Super. Ct. Apr. 5, 2017). That suit is ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While simultaneously litigating that state action, Caires sued the FDIC in the Southern District of New York on April 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 1. In an attempt to clarify whether JPMC had actually purchased his loan from WaMu, Plaintiff sought a declaration from the court as to whether WaMu had his loan on its books or records, or as part of its assets and liabilities, at the time the FDIC was appointed as the Bank's Receiver on September 25, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Caires v. FDIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201393735\">\n    2017 WL 1393735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2017). In response to a motion to dismiss filed by the FDIC, that federal court found that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Caires's claims because he had failed to exhaust the administrative-claims process mandated by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. No. 101-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Stat.%20183\">\n    103 Stat. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court further held that even if Caires had exhausted that claims process, it would lack subject-matter jurisdiction, as \u00a7 1821(d)(6(A)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   of FIRREA limits post-exhaustion review to the District Court for the District of Columbia and the federal court where WaMu's principal place of business was located-namely, the District Court for the Western District of Washington.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This brings the Court to the present case. Presumably under the impression that the dispositive weaknesses of his SDNY suit were his failure to file an administrative FIRREA claim and his improper choice of venue, Plaintiff resolved to address both issues. He first filed a claim with the FDIC on October 17, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proof of Claim. When this claim was summarily rejected on March 23, 2017, for lack of timeliness,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7-17 (FDIC Rejection Notice), Caires followed with this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Complaint on May 22, 2017. Although that pleading is somewhat difficult to parse, his claims appear to belong in three separate buckets: (1) claims seeking a declaration as to whether WaMu did or did not have his loan on its books or records, or as part of its assets and liabilities, on September 25, 2008,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 51; (2) claims seeking damages for misrepresentation, fraud, and \"losses of millions of dollars\" to his property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12, the FDIC \"having taken part i[n] what seems like a scheme,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33, and acting with \"post-closing willful blindness to the malicious prosecution by [JPMC] against the Plaintiff,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 36; and (3) claims for violations of \"the Plaintiff[']s right under the 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The FDIC has moved to dismiss, and Caires, now represented by counsel, opposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant's Motion invokes the legal standards for dismissal under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). When a defendant brings a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the Court indeed has subject-matter jurisdiction to hear his claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

First, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"[a]n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages for injury or loss of property... unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.\" Specifically, a plaintiff must first file with the agency a \"written notification of [the] incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for injury to or loss of property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.2\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In addition to not complying with FIRREA's administrative requirements, Caires has never contended that he presented a damages claim to the FDIC as required by the FTCA. His claims are thus unexhausted. Second, they are also barred by the FTCA's statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues\"). In other words, even if his Notice of Claim could be seen as FTCA exhaustion, it is untimely. Finally, to the extent Plaintiff's claims sound in misrepresentation and fraud, they are barred by sovereign immunity, which the Government has not waived for this category of claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
