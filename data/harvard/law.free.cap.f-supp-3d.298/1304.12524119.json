No. 234). This order, however, addresses a separate motion by the government to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim for relief under FRCP 12(b)(6). This order sustains three claims for relief but finds that the rest fall short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

For the same reasons that the promulgation of DACA needed no notice and comment, its rescission needed no notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Almost this exact problem was addressed in\n   <em>\n    Mada-Luna\n   </em>\n   . There, our court of appeals held that the repeal of an INS policy under which applicants could seek deferred action was not subject to notice and comment. It rejected the argument that the repeal could not constitute a general statement of policy because it diminished the likelihood of receiving deferred action for a class of individuals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689851,1689815\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1006/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689851,1689815\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1006/\">\n    at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, because the original policy allowed for discretion and failed to establish a \"binding norm,\" the repeal of that policy also did not require notice and comment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689851,1689815\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1006/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689851,1689815\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1006/\">\n    at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So too here. The DACA program allowed but did not require the agency to grant deferred action, and upon separate application, travel authorization, on a case-by-case basis at the agency's discretion. Therefore, neither its promulgation nor its rescission required notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Parco v.

Pa. 1977), on which plaintiffs heavily rely, does not warrant the conclusion that the rescission policy is a substantive rule.\n   <em>\n    Parco\n   </em>\n   also addressed whether the rescission of an INS policy required notice and comment. Notably, the government in\n   <em>\n    Parco\n   </em>\n   stipulated that the policy's precipitous rescission was the sole reason for denial of the plaintiff's application for immigration relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903008\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/426/976/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903008\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/426/976/\">\n    at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court determined that the repeal therefore left no discretion, explaining that \"discretion\" was stripped of all meaning where \"one contends that under a certain regulation 'discretion' was exercised favorably in all cases of a certain kind and then, after repeal of the regulation, unfavorably in each such case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903008\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/426/976/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, by contrast, plaintiffs do not allege that all deferred action applications under DACA were approved but now, after the rescission, all requests for deferred action will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the rescission memorandum is more than a policy because it creates a blanket prohibition against granting deferred action to DACA applicants. Plaintiffs are correct that the rescission policy contains mandatory language on its face. It is also true that the rescission\n   memorandum categorically eliminates advance parole for DACA recipients. This comes closer to resembling a substantive rule. However, it remains the case that because the original promulgation of the discretionary program did not require notice and comment, a return to the status quo ante also does not require notice and comment.\n   <em>\n    Mada-Luna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689851,1689815\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1006/\">\n    813 F.2d at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Section 706(2)(D) of the APA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is accordingly\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Plaintiffs fail to make the threshold showing that they have a protected interest in the continuation of DACA and, accordingly, their due process claims based on the rescission must be dismissed.

Yet a benefit is not a \"protected entitlement\" where \"government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Castle Rock v.

Rather, an individual has a protected property right in public benefits where the rules conferring those benefits \"greatly restrict the discretion\" of the people who administer them.\n   <em>\n    Nozzi v. Hous. Auth. of City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359150\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1178/#p1191\">\n    806 F.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (9th Cir. 2015). Plaintiffs' authorities confirm that the same principle applies in the context of renewing or retaining existing benefits.\n   <em>\n    Wedges/Ledges of California, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10502862\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/56/#p64\">\n    24 F.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (9th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    Stauch v.

No such limitations on agency discretion are alleged to have applied under DACA. Rather, the USCIS DACA FAQs referenced by plaintiffs in their complaints make clear that \"USCIS retain[ed] the ultimate discretion to determine whether deferred action\n   [was] appropriate in any given case even if the guidelines [were] met\" (Garcia Compl. \u00b6 24 n.16; Santa Clara Compl. \u00b6 58; UC Compl., Exh. B; State Compl., Exh. E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, plaintiffs argue that once DACA status was conferred, and recipients organized their lives in reliance on the program's protections and benefits, they developed interests protected by the Constitution. Plaintiffs' authorities, however, stand only for the uncontroversial proposition that once in possession of a particular benefit, the alteration, revocation or suspension of that benefit may implicate due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a principle has no application where, as here, extant benefits are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   impacted by a change in policy.\n   <em>\n    Indeed, there is no dispute that the rescission acts only prospectively.\n   </em>\n   That is, all existing DACA recipients will receive deferred action through the end of their two-year terms. What they will not receive, if the rescission endures, will be DACA renewal, thereafter. For this reason,\n   <em>\n    Ixcot v.

Plaintiffs allege that the government repeatedly represented that information provided by DACA applicants would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes absent special circumstances, and that DACA recipients relied on these promises in submitting the extensive personal information needed to meet the program's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants insist that the agency's information-sharing policy remains unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, however, the well-pled factual allegations in a complaint must be accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that DHS changed its information-sharing policy such that now, rather than affirmatively protecting DACA recipients' information from disclosure, the government will only refrain from \"proactively\" providing their information for purposes of immigration enforcement proceedings (Garcia Compl. \u00b6 126; Santa Clara Compl. \u00b6 58; State Compl. \u00b6 122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged a \"mutually explicit understanding\" giving rise to a protected interest in the confidentiality of DACA recipients' personal information. They allege that throughout DACA's existence, DHS made affirmative representations as to how this information would (and would not) be used. The policy stated (Garcia Compl. \u00b6 126; Santa Clara Compl. \u00b6 58; State Compl. \u00b6 121 (citing USCIS DACA FAQs) ):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA). Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE. The information may be shared with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense. The above information sharing policy covers family members and guardians, in addition to the requestor. This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The language contained in the policy's caveat, that it could \"be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time,\" is ambiguous. One reading advanced by the government is that this caveat allows the agency to change how it treats information already received from DACA applicants. Another reading, however, is that it simply allows the government to change its policy in connection with future applicants. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson's December 2016 letter to United States Representative Judy Chu supports the later reading. He stated that, \"[s]ince DACA was announced in 2012, DHS has consistently made clear that information provided by applicants ... will not later be used for immigration enforcement purposes except where it is independently determined that a case involves a national security or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance of a notice to appear is required by law\" (Garcia Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; State Compl. \u00b6 98, Exh. F). This ambiguity presents a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Taken as true at this stage, as must be done on a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion, plaintiffs' allegations regarding the government's broken promise as to how DACA recipients' personal information will be used-and its potentially profound consequences-\"shock[s] the conscience and offend[s] the community's sense of fair play and decency.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

Nor have plaintiffs pleaded that the alleged change in the agency's information-use policy was the result of an affirmative misrepresentation. Rather, they have merely alleged a change in policy.

DACA received reaffirmation by the agency as recently as three months before the rescission, only to be hurriedly cast aside on what seems to have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality). This strange about-face, done at lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration within the agency was bypassed (Garcia Compl. \u00b6 154; Santa Clara Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   That President Trump has at other times shown support for DACA recipients cannot wipe the slate clean as a matter of law at the pleading stage. Although the government argues that these allegations fail to suggest that the Acting Secretary (as the purported decisionmaker) terminated DACA due to racial animus, plaintiffs have alleged that it was President Trump himself who, in line with his campaign rhetoric, directed the decision to end the program (Garcia Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 124; Santa Clara Compl. \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Construed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as must be done at the pleading stage, these allegations raise a plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA.
