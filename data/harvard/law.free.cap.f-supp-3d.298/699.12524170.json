LTD Claim Specialists were tasked with gathering information from insured individuals claiming entitlement to long-term disability benefits and presenting this documentation to MetLife staff and supervisors to approve or deny the claims. SAC \u00b6 26. Julian worked for MetLife in Oriskany, New York from 2004 to 2016 and served as an LTD Claim Specialist from 2011 through 2016. SAC \u00b6 14.

Complaint, Dkt. No. 1. Specifically, Plaintiffs point out that prior to November 2013, MetLife classified LTD Claim Specialists as hourly employees and paid them overtime under the FLSA. SAC \u00b6 5. In November 2013, MetLife reclassified LTD Claim Specialists as \"exempt\" employees and ceased paying them overtime for hours they worked in excess of 40 hours per week. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that LTD Claim Specialists regularly work in excess of 40 hours (on average between 45 and 60 hours) without receiving overtime pay.

First, Plaintiffs all attested in their initial affidavits to having the same primary duties-to \"gather information concerning Long Term Disability claims, enter claim information into MetLife systems, and communicate with specialized MetLife staff, such as nurses and vocational experts, and supervisors about the information.\" Gill Decl. \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Julian Decl. \u00b6 14, 16-17; McKinney Decl. \u00b6 16. Contrary to the Defendant's claim, the depositions of the Plaintiffs elicited descriptions of the LTD Claim Specialist job that were very similar to those in the Plaintiffs' depositions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Julian Depo., Dkt. No. 38-4, at 25-29, 59; Julian Depo., Dkt. No. 49-2, at 159-61; McKinney Depo., Dkt. No. 38-5, at 145-46, 201, 208-10, 244. Moreover, even the declarations of LTD Claim Specialists filed by Defendant state that the duties of an LTD Claim Specialist included gathering information about claims, entering information into MetLife's systems, and communicating with MetLife staff about that information.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Barry Decl., Dkt. No. 49-17, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 16-17; Cala Decl., Dkt. No. 49-18, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5-7, 9-10; Crawford Decl., Dkt. No. 49-19, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5, 7, 10; Hawes Decl., Dkt. No. 49-21, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At bottom, the declarations and depositions of Plaintiffs and the declarations provided by the Defendant do not dispute\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   duties LTD Claim Specialists performed, but rather\n   <em>\n    how much discretion\n   </em>\n   LTD Claim Specialists used in performing those duties.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Julian Decl. \u00b6 18 (\"In carrying out my job duties, I, like all\n   other LTD Claim Specialists, was required to adhere to a tightly controlled process for handling Long-Term Disability claims.\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Julian Depo., Dkt. No. 49-2, at 59 (\"[W]e were peons. We were the gofers. We collected the information. We did not make the decisions.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Barry Decl. \u00b6 3 (\"That is all part of making an informed decision as to whether to approve or deny a claim-a decision that is mine to make with regard to each claim in my book.\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Hawes Decl. \u00b6 3 (\"I use my judgment and critical thinking every day in my work, not only to make the ultimate claim decision, but also to decide what information I need in order to make that determination, as well as the steps and timeframe to obtain that information.\"). However, determining whether all LTD Claim Specialists exercised a similar amount of discretion-and whether the exercise of that discretion rendered LTD Claim Specialists exempt from the FLSA's overtime provision-is a fact-intensive question that will require significant discovery and an assessment of the credibility of each party's LTD Claim Specialists. However, at the first step of the conditional certification process, \"the court does not resolve factual disputes, decide substantive issues going to the ultimate merits, or make credibility determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268368\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/638/#p644\">\n    754 F.Supp.2d at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the proper procedure at this stage of the litigation is to conditionally certify the class of individuals employed as LTD Claim Specialists because, as alleged in the Plaintiffs' declarations, they \" 'together were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Myers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795933\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/537/#p554\">\n    624 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is sufficient at the first stage of conditional certification, particularly where all LTD Claim Specialists were initially classified as exempt and then collectively reclassified.\n   <em>\n    Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322307\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/152/#p161\">\n    298 F.R.D. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In support of their claims that all LTD Claim Specialists performed the same function, Plaintiffs have also provided MetLife's own training and decisionmaking materials, including the Claims Management Guide, which provided the process by which claims were expected to be handled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 38-3, 38-8, 38-10, 38-11, 38-12, 38-13, 38-14, 38-15 (filed under seal) (portions of Claims Management Guide pertaining to claims process);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gill Decl. \u00b6 18 (describing the claims process as \"tightly controlled\" and the Claims Management Guide as \"provid[ing] detailed instructions for every element\" of the LTD Claim Specialist job); Julian Decl. \u00b6 18 (same); McKinney Decl. \u00b6 20 (same); Barry Decl. \u00b6 11 (acknowledging use of Claims Management Guide but disputing frequency of use). By its own terms, the Claims Management Guide was intended to \"manage quality\" and \"maintain consistency\" across MetLife's short term disability and long term disability claims processers by \"utilize[ing] a standard methodology which includes a system of processes, procedures and resources.\" Dkt. No. 38-3 at McKinney_MLIC001030 (filed under seal). Newly hired LTD Claim Specialists were likewise subject to a uniform 3-week training program to learn \"the claims management process with opportunities imbedded to practice various elements of claims processing.\" Dkt. No. 38-6 at McKinney_MLIC 001822 (filed under seal). Claims were expected to proceed along a standard timeline with certain milestones set for every 5 to 10 days until the claim was resolved. Dkt. No. 38-7 (filed under seal). LTD Claim Specialists were likewise given uniform claims-process checklists, Dkt. No. 38-9 at Julian_000002635 (filed under seal), and uniform guides for interviewing claimants, Dkt. Nos. 38-10 through -12 (filed under seal), and they prepared decision letters using standardized forms available on MetLife's correspondence software, Dkt. No. 38-13 (filed under seal). In sum, MetLife's determination that all LTD Claim Specialists could\n   receive identical training and guides supports the conclusion that all LTD Claim Specialists performed essentially the same role and thus are \"similarly situated\" for the purpose of conditional certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Defendant does not dispute that all LTD Claim Specialists were given the same guides and training documents. Instead, it argues that \"use of guides or handbooks does not prove that an employee is not exercising discretion in judgment in carrying out her duties.\" Opp. at 17 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.704\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). This argument, however, goes to the merits of whether Plaintiffs were properly designated as exempt from the FLSA's overtime provision and has no bearing on whether LTD Claim Specialists were similarly situated-only whether that group of similarly situated LTD Claim Specialists were entitled to overtime payment. As a result, the Court finds that the MetLife's own manuals support the conclusion that LTD Claim Specialists generally performed the same duties and are thus sufficiently \"similarly situated\" at this stage of the litigation. The Defendant also asserts that LTD Claim Specialists are not similarly situated because \"the record already contains wildly different facts regarding how often the Claims Management Guide is referred to or used\" by different LTD Claim Specialists. Opp. at 20. It is not clear at this early stage whether it is legally relevant how often different LTD Claim Specialists consulted the Claims Management Guide. Regardless of the answer to that question, however, a discrepancy in how often LTD Claim Specialists consulted the Claims Management Guide is insufficient to overcome the Plaintiffs' evidence militating in favor of conditional certification-namely, that LTD Claim Specialists were collectively treated as exempt and collectively reclassified subject to a single policy change by their employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795933\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/537/#p554\">\n    624 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   555 ;\n   <em>\n    Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322307\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/152/#p161\">\n    298 F.R.D. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conditional Certification of LTD Claim Specialists at All MetLife Locations Is Appropriate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Defendant argue that Plaintiffs-who worked at only three of MetLife's offices-have not sufficiently shown that LTD Claim Specialists from other branches are similarly situated and therefore properly part of the conditionally certified class. Opp. at 21-22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 14 (Julian worked in a New York office); SAC \u00b6 15 (McKinney worked in the Connecticut office); Gill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (Gill worked in the Illinois office). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the declarations of the Plaintiffs, it appears that there are only four or five offices in which LTD Claim Specialists work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Julian Decl. \u00b6 3 n.1 (identifying offices in Oriskany, New York; Bloomfield, Connecticut; Tampa, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and Marlborough, Massachusetts); McKinney Decl. \u00b6 3 n.1 (identifying offices in Bloomfield, Connecticut; Oriskany, New York; Tampa, Florida; and Chicago, Illinois). The three Plaintiffs work at three of these four or five offices and have all attested to performing similar duties and regularly working in excess of forty hours. They have also stated that they know through observation or conversations that other LTD Claim Specialists both in their offices and others perform the same job duties and regularly work over 40 hours. Gill Depo., Dkt. No. 49-4, at 269-76; Julian Depo., Dkt. No. 38-4, at 110, 118-20; Julian\n   Depo., Dkt. No. 49-2, at 74-77; McKinney Depo., Dkt. No. 49-3, at 253-55. Based on this information, it seems very likely that LTD Claim Specialists in the remaining one or two offices also performed the same job duties and regularly worked over 40 hours. This common sense conclusion is supported by the numerous documents provided by the Plaintiffs-described above at length-indicating that all LTD Claim Specialists at all MetLife branches were trained using the same materials and provided the same checklists and scripts to use in processing claims.\n   <em>\n    See supra.\n   </em>\n   MetLife's reclassification of all LTD Claim Specialists at all locations from non-exempt to exempt also supports the conclusion that all LTD Claim Specialists are similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322307\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/152/#p161\">\n    298 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   161 ;\n   <em>\n    Jacob,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20260230\">\n    2012 WL 260230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs testified in their depositions that they participated in trainings where MetLife employees from other offices would share their computer screens to demonstrate the claims process, and that Plaintiffs knew from these trainings that LTD Claim Specialists in other offices handled disability claims in the same way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Julian Depo., Dkt. No. 38-4, at 116-18; McKinney Depo., Dkt. No. 49-3, at 102-05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Together, this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that all LTD Claim Specialists working in any of MetLife's offices are similarly situated for purposes of conditional certification. Courts in this circuit have granted conditional certification where plaintiffs had first-hand knowledge of a much smaller proportion of a corporation's locations. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ravenell v. Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC,\n   </em>\n   the court granted conditional certification for all shift managers at all 1,000 Avis Car Rental locations even though the plaintiffs had only worked at three of those locations. No. 08-cv-2113 (SLT) (ALC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202921508\">\n    2010 WL 2921508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, *4-5 (E.D.N.Y. July 19, 2010). In\n   <em>\n    Guttentag v. Ruby Tuesday, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   Judge Baer conditionally certified a collective action covering tipped employees in 750 restaurants in 39 states although the plaintiffs had produced evidence only specifically attesting to the conditions in four of those states. No. 12-cv-3041 (HB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202602521\">\n    2013 WL 2602521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2013). Based on such examples, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to warrant conditionally certifying a nationwide class of LTD Claim Specialists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Parties Shall Confer on the Proposed Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its opposition to conditional certification, the Defendant raises several objections to the notice proposed by the Plaintiffs both in form and substance. Opp. at 27-28. The parties are ordered to attempt to resolve these disputes related to the method and text of the proposed notice. By April 30, 2018, the parties shall submit a new proposed notice. If, after meeting and conferring, the parties should fail to reach an agreement on one or more issues, the parties are ordered to submit a letter to the Court of no more than eight pages. The letter should identify the precise issue(s) on which disagreement remains and set forth each side's respective position on those issues. Each party should include citations to supporting case law sufficient to enable the Court to render a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for conditional certification is granted, and the parties are ordered to submit their jointly proposed notice or joint letter to this Court by April 30, 2018. This resolves Docket Number 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because this Memorandum Opinion and Order may reference information that the parties seek to maintain under seal, the Court will file it under TEMPORARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   SEAL. The parties are directed to meet and confer and submit within 10 days any proposed redactions for the version of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to be filed on the public docket. If the parties are unable to reach agreement, they may set forth their respective positions in letter briefs not to exceed three pages in length. Although the Court will publicly docket an order announcing its bottom-line conclusion, it will refrain from publicly docketing this Memorandum Opinion and Order until it has ruled on the proposed redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Plaintiffs McKinney and Gill joined the suit subsequent to the filing of the original complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Defendant raises other alleged differences between the proposed conditional class of LTDCSs such as how often they convened group meetings with medical and vocational resources to discuss a claim and how often-if ever-various LTDCSs could make claim decisions without review of their supervisors. Opp. at 21. For the same reasons the Court explained above, these inquiries do not defeat conditional certification at this initial stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
