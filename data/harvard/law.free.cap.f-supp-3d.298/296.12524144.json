Access Now has members in 47 states, including residents of Massachusetts. Plaintiff R. David New is a resident of Florida and the President of Access Now. Plaintiff Stephen Th\u00e9berge is a resident of Massachusetts. Both individual plaintiffs are legally blind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sportswear, Inc. is headquartered in Seattle, Washington where it maintains its corporate office. Sportswear also owns a manufacturing plant in Louisville, Kentucky. Sportswear does not maintain property in Massachusetts and employs no individuals in Massachusetts. Sportswear derives 3.78% of its revenue from sales in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The individual plaintiffs attempted to access Sportswear's website but found it unusable in light of certain barriers to access. The plaintiffs allege that the website is incompatible with screen readers which are programs that convert text to audio to allow individuals suffering from visual impairments to access the content and services of websites. Plaintiffs submit, for example, that the buttons on Sportswear's website lack labels that would describe their purpose to a screen reader user and error messages on the website do not provide sufficient information to such a user. Plaintiffs state that they would like to, and intend to attempt accessing Sportswear's website in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Although Access Now states that it has members in Massachusetts, it has not identified any individual members, other than Th\u00e9berge, who have attempted to access Sportswear's website or who have been injured by an inability to access it. In their opposition memorandum, plaintiffs rest their specific jurisdiction argument on Th\u00e9berge's ADA claims, stating that \"plaintiff Th\u00e9berge's claims relate to defendant's Website, which defendant makes available in Massachusetts\", without reference to Access Now or New's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Daynard v.

The plaintiffs appear to concede that nonresident plaintiffs New and Access Now have no connection to the forum in their opposition memorandum, referencing only Th\u00e9berge's ADA claims as giving rise to jurisdiction. Accordingly, plaintiffs New and Access Now have not met their burden and the Court finds that it does not have specific jurisdiction with respect to their claims.

Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Th\u00e9berge contends that the Massachusetts long-arm statute authorizes this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction\n   over Sportswear because Sportswear's business transactions give rise to the ADA claims, M.G.L. c. 223A \u00a7 3(a), and Sportswear caused a tortious injury, \u00a7 3(b). Sportswear responds that the Massachusetts long-arm statute may impose more restrictive limits than the Constitution. It contends that Th\u00e9berge's claim arises from the creation and maintenance of the website, which occurred in Washington, rather than the products offered for sale in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Massachusetts long-arm statute provides, in relevant part, that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   over a person [ ] as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's (a) transacting any business in this commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   M.G.L. c. 223A \u00a7 3.

To determine whether a claim arises from a defendant's \"transacting business\", a court looks to whether the transacted business was a but for cause of the harm alleged in the claim.\n   <em>\n    Cossart v.

Sportswear generates 3.78% of its annual revenue from online sales in the Commonwealth and features products bearing the names of Massachusetts schools, universities and athletic teams. Those actions are sufficient under the long-arm statute to support a conclusion that Sportswear transacted business in the forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach.

The complaint alleges that Sportswear's website limits accessibility to consumers who suffer from visual impairments seeking to purchase products from the website. Th\u00e9berge documents his attempt to access the website, with the use of his screen reader, from Attleboro, Massachusetts. Because Th\u00e9berge's denial of access to Sportswear's website occurred in the forum, the injury arises from Sportswear's transaction of business through its website in Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otter Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277779\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/287/\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Reasonableness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, this Court must consider a number of \"Gestalt factors,\" including (1) defendant's burden of appearing, (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) plaintiff's interest in convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining efficient resolution of controversies and (5) the common\n   interest of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    471 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Sportswear contends that exercising jurisdiction here would be unreasonable because Sportswear's center of gravity is located a great distance from Massachusetts, Massachusetts has little interest in the dispute and there is no advantage to the judicial system in adjudicating the dispute in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Another session of this Court has cautioned that the reasonableness factors play a large role in cases involving the Internet where commercial transactions can occur across the nation quickly and with the click of a button.\n   <em>\n    Photographic Illustrators Corp. v. A.W. Graham Lumber, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181058\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/123/#p131\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131 (D. Mass. 2016). In that case, however, the defendant was a small hardware store in Kentucky which made one sale to Massachusetts in eleven years and the sale of that shovel occurred just two weeks before the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181058\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/123/#p131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the Gestalt factors indicate that exercising jurisdiction over Sportswear would be fair and reasonable. First, Sportswear is a large company, with over $15 million in annual revenue. Sportswear does not identify any unique burden and appeals only to the convenience of a different forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baskin-Robbins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324541\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/28/#p36\">\n    825 F.3d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (making clear that the first factor is only determinative where the party can demonstrate a special burden more significant than cross-country travel) (internal citations omitted). Massachusetts has a clear interest in protecting the interests of its visually-impaired residents.\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    471 U.S. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a state \"generally has a manifest interest in providing its resident with a convenient form for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors\") (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The third factor involves the convenience of the forum for the plaintiff. Courts generally accord the plaintiff's choice of forum a degree of deference.\n   <em>\n    Sawtelle v. Farrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11934358\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/1381/#p1395\">\n    70 F.3d 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1395 (1st Cir. 1995). The last two factors are neutral here. Given that Th\u00e9berge is a Massachusetts resident and the forum has a clear interest in adjudicating the grievances of its disabled residents, exercising jurisdiction in this instance would be fair, reasonable and consistent with the requirements of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendant's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 12) is, with respect to plaintiffs New and Access Now,\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED,\n   </strong>\n   but with respect to plaintiff Th\u00e9berge,\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
