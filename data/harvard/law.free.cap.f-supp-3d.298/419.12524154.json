Equipment Co. (\"S.K.S.\"), AmeriPak, Inc. (\"AmeriPak\"), and O.P. Schuman &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"Schuman\"). Plaintiffs allege numerous claims sounding in products liability based on a workplace injury that plaintiff Vicuna sustained while using a machine that S.K.S. manufactured under its AmeriPak brand name. S.K.S. is now a defunct company. Schuman has purchased much of the assets once under the control of S.K.S., including the AmeriPak brand name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   There are currently four motions pending. First, the plaintiffs move for reconsideration of my order dated May 19, 2015. That order granted Schuman's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' so-called independent failure to warn claim. Second, Schuman moves to preclude the plaintiffs' proffered expert witness. Third, Schuman moves for summary judgment seeking dismissal of nearly all remaining claims outstanding against it. Fourth is the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 22, 2012, plaintiff Vicuna was injured while using a Model 60 packaging machine manufactured by S.K.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Federica Vicuna Depo., Sept. 5, 2014, 10:1-17:17, ECF No. 47-2. This occurred during the course of her work for Muffins 'n' More, Inc. in Brooklyn, New York (\"Muffins 'n' More\" or \"plaintiff's employer\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Model 60 is known in the packaging industry as a \"horizontal wrapper.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eng'g Report, Eric Heiberg, July 29, 2016, ECF No. 94-14, at 2-4. Model 60s use a conveyor belt to move baked goods towards a point of operation where plastic film is wrapped around them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once the plastic film covers the baked goods, the machine then cuts and seals the plastic film with a descending heating element that forms a pinch point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While operating a Model 60 in \"manual mode,\" the plaintiff crushed and burned three of her fingers, requiring amputation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AmeriPak Model 60 Operator's Manual, ECF No. 89-9, at 1-9; First Sterner Depo., Sept. 19, 2014, 115:5-7, ECF No. 47-5; First Vicuna Depo. 10:23-11:9; 37:4-18. Unlike when in \"automatic mode,\" the Model 60 can run in manual mode without a polycarbonate guard in place to protect operators from contacting the pinch point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operator's Manual, at 1-9; First Sterner Depo. 47:18-49:16. Without the polycarbonate guard in place, the pinch point is exposed and an operator is free to place his or her hand into that area. Indeed, Vicuna's employer directed her to sometimes operate the Model 60 in manual mode so that she could place her hand very close to the pinch point area. This allowed her to adjust certain \"small\" baked\n   goods so that they would not \"bounce around\" and become damaged at the pinch point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Vicuna Depo. 54:10-25. The plaintiff was performing this precise task when her accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The operator's manual for the Model 60 expressly contemplates that operators will use the machine in manual mode for \"setup\" as well as for \"jogging\" of the machine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operator's Manual, at 1-9. The operator's manual also states that \"GUARDS MUST BE IN PLACE BEFORE OPERATING.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-7. Plaintiff Vicuna was apparently never given a copy of the operator's manual, nor any other written instructions for the machine. First Vicuna Depo. 29:22-30:15; 32:7-18. The plaintiff testified that she did not realize that placing her fingers near the machine's moving parts was dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:18-50:19; 53:8-14. She testified that she would not have operated the machine in such a manner had she known of the danger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She did not remember seeing any warning decals on the machine the day of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:12-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A decal of some sort was in fact present on the Model 60 based on my review of a photograph taken in December 2012, roughly 9 months after the plaintiff's accident. In the photograph, the decal is difficult, if not impossible, to decipher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Photograph AmeriPak Model 60, Dec. 4, 2012, ECF No. 98-1. Schuman asserts that the decal warned against placing an operator's hand near the pinch point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Feb. 17, 2017, ECF No. 99, at 8-9. Importantly, whatever the decal portrayed, it appears that the decal was positioned such that an operator could see it only when the protective guard was horizontal and already secured in place, and not when the guard was vertical and unsecured-i.e., when a warning would be useful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Photograph AmeriPak Model 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Model 60 horizontal wrapper was the first in a line of wrapping machines that S.K.S. manufactured and marketed under the AmeriPak brand name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Sterner Depo. 34:15-24. S.K.S. discontinued the Model 60 around 1999. S.K.S. then sold the last machine of that model in 2004, though production continued on other models within the AmeriPak line.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   William Schuman Aff., Sept. 12, 2013, ECF No. 47-7, at \u00b6 10. Although S.K.S. thrived for a period, by 2004 its sales had decreased and it was forced to either sell the business or allow a bank takeover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Sterner Depo. 37:14-21; 38:13-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Around December 2004, defendant Schuman purchased certain S.K.S. assets for approximately $300,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Asset Purchase Agreement, ECF No. 47-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. The primary purpose of the asset sale was for Schuman to obtain the AmeriPak product line and continue the line under its own control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   William Schuman Depo., Sept. 18, 2014, ECF No. 74-3, 22:4-15; 51:20-24. Indeed, Schuman obtained blueprints and patents for the AmeriPak line of machines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Sterner Depo. 75:11-76:19. Schuman also obtained the goodwill that came with the AmeriPak line along with a list of customers and purchase records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schuman Depo. 40:2-19; 60:2-8; 60:23-61:19. After Schuman purchased the assets of S.K.S., all eight S.K.S. employees joined Schuman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Sterner Depo. 36:3-14; Schuman Depo. 63:19-22; Jim O'Shea Depo., Sept. 19, 2014, ECF No. 49-4, 17:1-7; 55:23-57:20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Numerous documents were brought from the S.K.S. facility to the Schuman facility following the asset purchase. Specifically, an engineering folder was brought to the Schuman facility. This folder contained a one-page \"alternative electronic schematic\" for the S.K.S. manufactured Model 60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Shea Depo. 23:11-22;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   27:2-5; 27:21-28:9; 53:6-15; 60:18-21; 61:2-12; Resp. to Pls.' Supp. Not. to Produce, June 27, 2016, ECF No. 98-4, at 5; Second Sterner Depo., July 5, 2016, ECF No. 89-5; 257:4-8. The alternative schematic provided a workaround design that, through rewiring, altered the Model 60. This alteration made it so that the Model 60 could not operate in any mode-neither automatic nor manual-without the polycarbonate guard in place to protect operators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Sterner Depo. 255:10-256:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Whether Schuman technically purchased this engineering folder and the alternative schematic is unresolved on the record. Schuman asserts repeatedly that the folder and schematic are \"S.K.S. documents\" and \"not Schuman documents.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , William Schuman Aff., Jan. 18, 2017, ECF No. 90-1, at \u00b6 15. Schuman further claims that it was not aware of these documents until as late as July 2016, roughly three years after this litigation began.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mem. Opp'n Pls.' Mot. for Reconsideration, Jan. 20, 2017, ECF No. 90, at 6. Nevertheless, the documents have been stored at Schuman's facility since around the time of the S.K.S. asset sale in 2004. Moreover, at least two of Schuman's long-time employees testified that, at all pertinent times, they were readily familiar with these documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Shea Depo. 23:11-22; 27:2-5; 27:21-28:9; 53:6-15; 60:18-21; 61:2-12; First Sterner Depo. 16:1-8; 36:12-17; 44:10-13; Def.'s Mem. Opp'n Pls.' Mot. for Reconsideration, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Since its asset purchase in 2004, Schuman has continued designing and manufacturing the line of AmeriPak horizontal wrappers originally created by S.K.S. Today, however, Schuman incorporates rewiring similar (if not identical) in nature to that set out in the S.K.S. alternative electronic schematic mentioned above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eng'g Report, at 11. Thus, new wrappers manufactured by Schuman cannot operate in either automatic or manual mode unless the protective guard is secured in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Sterner Depo. 257:19-258:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Around January 2012, roughly seven years after the asset purchase and approximately seven weeks before plaintiff Vicuna's injury, her employer, Muffins 'n' More, contacted Schuman to request spare parts and an operator's manual for its Model 60 horizontal wrapper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schuman Depo. 105:14-106:17; 110:10-24; Manual Invoice, Jan. 5, 2012, ECF No. 49-12; Parts Invoice, Jan. 12, 2012, ECF No. 49-13. Soon after the request from Muffins 'n' More, Schuman mailed the desired spare parts and operator's manual. Muffins 'n' More had not purchased any parts from Schuman prior to this time. Nor is there any evidence of contact after this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schuman Depo. 112:6-113:14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The operator's manual included a personalized cover page designating AmeriPak as \"a division of O.P. Schuman and Sons, Inc.,\" although the substance of the manual was written by S.K.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operator's Manual, at 1; First Sterner Depo. 44:19-45:17. The second page of the manual was also personalized. It stated in effect that \"this manual has been prepared for Muffins 'n' More\" and then listed the contact information for the Schuman sales department. Operator's Manual, at 2. The operator's manual did not include any alternative schematics, not even the one-page alternative schematic that had been stored within the engineering folder described earlier.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The parties agree that Muffins 'n' More never contacted Schuman directly about servicing the Model 60 horizontal wrapper in question. They further agree that Schuman never made a service call to Muffins 'n' More.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Def.'s 1st Mot. Summ. J., March 16, 2015, ECF No. 49-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Review of the exhibits filed with the instant motions reveals that at least two\n   other known accidents in addition to plaintiff Vicuna's have occurred involving Model 60 horizontal wrappers. First, depositions indicate that another accident occurred at Muffins 'n' More in 2014, two years after plaintiff Vicuna's accident. That accident involved the same exact underlying machine and resulted in another amputation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Isabella Ortega Depo., March 17, 2016, ECF No. 98-7, 31:23-33:12. Second, plaintiffs have discovered that, in or around 1995, S.K.S. was sued in an Iowa lawsuit styled\n   <em>\n    Lindsey v. S.K.S. Equipment Co.\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. for Reconsideration, at 8-9. That case involved another workplace accident. The machine in question there was a Model 60 with serial number 102-just one serial number higher than the Model 60 underlying this litigation, number 101.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs in the present case suspect that S.K.S. created the one-page alternative design schematic addressed earlier in response to the\n   <em>\n    Lindsey\n   </em>\n   case, possibly as part of a settlement there.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background &amp; Belated Discovery Production\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit against Schuman on May 14, 2013 for its role in plaintiff Vicuna's injuries, including Schuman's role as successor to S.K.S. The complaint asserted claims sounding in strict products liability, failure to provide proper warnings, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, negligence, and loss of services on behalf of Vicuna's husband, Martin Varelas.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., May 14, 2013, ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs later filed an amended complaint, which added S.K.S. and AmeriPak as defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Comp., July 17, 2013, ECF No. 4, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Schuman then filed a cross-claim against S.K.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer, Aug. 8, 2014, ECF No. 36, at 5. Schuman additionally filed a third-party complaint against Muffins 'n' More, plaintiff's employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d Party Compl., June 19, 2015, ECF No. 55. In turn, Muffins 'n' More filed counterclaims against Schuman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer to 3d Party Compl., Aug. 6, 2015, ECF No. 61. Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed defendant AmeriPak.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. &amp; Order, June 30, 2014, ECF No. 30. The court clerk has entered default against S.K.S. for failure to plead or otherwise defend the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Entry of Default, Aug. 15, 2014, ECF No. 40. Thus, Schuman, Muffins 'n' More, and the plaintiffs are the only parties that remain active in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 16, 2015, Schuman moved for summary judgment on the issue of successor liability. Schuman additionally moved for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim against Schuman for its \"independent\" failure to warn (i.e., Schuman's failure to warn plaintiff's employer about defects in the Model 60, notwithstanding that S.K.S. and not Schuman manufactured that machine).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., March 16, 2015, ECF No. 47. On May 19, 2015, applying Pennsylvania law, I denied Schuman's motion for summary judgment on successor liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vicuna v. O.P. Schuman &amp; Sons, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360033\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/286/#p294\">\n    106 F.Supp.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294-95 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). Applying New York law, I granted Schuman's motion on the independent failure to warn claim, finding that the record did not show the requisite \"special relationship\" between Schuman and plaintiff Vicuna or her employer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18. In short, while noting that Schuman might still be liable for warning failures as a successor to S.K.S., I held that New York law placed no independent duty to warn on Schuman, given its limited contact with the plaintiff and her employer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiffs ask me to reconsider today my independent failure to warn holding based on new evidence. The new evidence is that Schuman was in possession of the alternative electronic schematic at the time it provided plaintiff's employer with\n   the operator's manual for the Model 60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. for Reconsideration, at 8-9. Thus, the plaintiffs assert that, under the circumstances taken as a whole, this new evidence of Schuman's possession of the alternative design schematic tips the scale in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of whether Schuman had an independent duty to warn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Critical to plaintiffs' assertion is their contention that Schuman withheld from discovery the alternative design schematic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Indeed, discovery here has been long and convoluted. On May 28, 2014, plaintiffs served on Schuman a request for production. In that request, plaintiffs demanded \"all documents, memorandum, notes, letters and/or complaints prepared by O.P. Schuman, received by O.P. Schuman, or maintained by O.P. Schuman related to the safety guards of the Model 60 Horizontal Wrapper\" or \"related to operating the Model 60 Horizontal Wrapper in manual mode.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Not. to Produce, May 28, 2014, ECF No. 89-3, at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. Schuman responded to that request three months later, on August 28, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schuman Supp. Resp. Not. to Produce, Aug. 28, 2014, ECF No. 89-4, at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. Schuman asserted that \"none\" of the plaintiffs' requested documents existed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, on September 19, 2014, during the deposition of a long-time Schuman employee, it appeared that, contrary to its earlier discovery responses, Schuman might be maintaining an engineering folder on the Model 60. Over the course of the deposition, it became clear that the folder might contain information relevant to the functionality and design of the Model 60, and possibly its safety guard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Shea Depo. 60:13-66:11. During that deposition, counsel for the plaintiffs demanded that, if the engineering folder in fact existed at the Schuman facility, it be preserved and produced.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:17-66:11. Schuman's counsel and Schuman's president both acknowledged this demand on the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs additionally followed-up regarding this matter with counsel for Schuman after the deposition, though the record does not detail the nature of the plaintiffs' follow-up. Ultimately, the plaintiffs were forced to seek an order from Magistrate Judge Kuo on June 2, 2016, directing Schuman to search for and produce the engineering folder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry, June 2, 2016. In short, Schuman did not provide the engineering folder-nor the one-page alternative schematic contained within that folder-until roughly two years after the September 2014 deposition. Indeed, Schuman's supplemental production of these documents as well as other previously unproduced documents began around June 27, 2016 and continued as late as September 12, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. to Pls.' Supp. Not. to Produce, June 27, 2016, ECF No. 89-6, at \u00b6 3; Supp. Resp. to Pls.' Post-Depo. Demands, Sept. 12, 2016, ECF No. 89-7, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   By the time Schuman completed its supplemental production on September 12, 2016, it had been roughly 1.5 years since I granted Schuman's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' independent failure to warn claim. Plaintiffs now argue that, had they possessed the engineering folder and alternative schematic at the time of Schuman's motion for summary judgment, they would have successfully defeated that motion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. for Reconsideration. They emphasize that the engineering folder contained the one-page alternative schematic that provided a workaround to prevent the Model 60 from operating in manual mode without proper guarding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24. Plaintiffs further highlight that the alternative design set out in the one-page schematic is similar or identical to the current design of the AmeriPak wrappers that Schuman now produces. This information,\n   plaintiffs argue, would have defeated Schuman's motion for summary judgment because Schuman's knowledge of a feasible alternative design helps to trigger an independent duty to warn under New York law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for why Schuman failed to provide these documents upon plaintiffs' original request in May 2014, Schuman has offered no sound excuse. Instead, Schuman continues to argue that these documents are \"not Schuman document[s]\" and that Schuman's president was unaware of the existence of these documents until July 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   William Schuman Aff., Jan. 18, 2017, at \u00b6 15. What is concerning here is that, in response to plaintiffs' May 2014 request for production, the record does not establish that Schuman put forth any particular effort that would have led to the discovery and production of the engineering folder or the alternative schematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Indeed, a long-time Schuman employee familiar with these documents testified that no one asked him to search for responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Shea Depo. 62:1-3. Certainly, Schuman has not specified what actions, if any, it took to locate responsive documents in the time following plaintiffs' May 2014 request. Nor is there reason to believe that Schuman put forth any effort to locate responsive documents following the September 19, 2014 deposition, at which Schuman was informed that responsive documents might exist in its facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Shea Depo. 60:13-66:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Had it not been for the plaintiffs' investigatory work and its follow-up efforts, Schuman never would have made a supplemental production.

Only orders that are appealable will be considered final within Rule 60(b).

And this is precisely what the plaintiffs did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply Mem.

Indeed, the plaintiffs sought to coordinate a motion and briefing schedule with Schuman in accordance with my bundling rule. But Schuman apparently refused to coordinate such a schedule without a \"pre-motion conference\" or \"court order\" that expressly \"allowed\" for the plaintiffs' motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204762044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Magistrate Judge Kuo thus issued an order addressing Schuman's position.

Accordingly, the proper time to examine is not the roughly 1.5 years between May 19, 2015 (the date of my initial order) and October 24, 2016 (the date when the plaintiffs formally filed their motion for reconsideration). Rather, the proper time period to consider would be the roughly 20 days between September 12, 2016 (the date that Schuman completed its discovery productions) and October 6, 2016 (the date by which Schuman had refused to coordinate a briefing schedule with the plaintiffs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Measuring from this perspective, plaintiffs' motion was made within a reasonable period considering the plaintiffs' need to consult with an expert before taking the extreme measure of filing for reconsideration.

Had Schuman done so, there would be no need for the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. As set out earlier, the plaintiffs requested in May 2014 all documents \"prepared, received, or maintained\" by Schuman \"related to the safety guards [or the operation] of the Model 60 Horizontal Wrapper.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Not. to Produce, Aug. 28, 2014, at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. And yet, responsive documents did exist-apparently Schuman had simply not searched for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For instance, the engineering folder containing the one-page alternative schematic was stored at all pertinent times at Schuman's facility, and Schuman employees were highly familiar with the folder.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Schuman Aff., Jan. 18, 2017, at \u00b6 15 (indicating that employee Sterner was readily familiar with said documents). In addition to the one-page alternative design schematic, the engineering folder in question contained sales records, client contact information, and more, all related to the Model 60.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second Sterner Depo. 153:21-155:5. It clearly fell within the scope of discovery. Schuman could have and should have discovered the engineering folder and produced it upon the plaintiffs' May 2014 document request. Schuman's president implies in an affidavit filed with the court that he never asked his employees (or at least not his employees most knowledgeable about these matters) to search for responsive documents until as late as June or July 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schuman Aff., Jan. 18, 2017, at \u00b6 15. In fact, his affidavit does not indicate whether Schuman undertook any actions at all to search for documents following the plaintiffs' May 2014 request for production.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20137073\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Moreover, not only did Schuman apparently fail to search adequately for responsive documents, it also neglected to correct that failure when, during a deposition in September 2014, Schuman should have realized that previously unproduced responsive documents existed at the Schuman facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Shea Depo. 60:13-66:11.

There is no dispute that Schuman provided plaintiff's employer with an operator's manual as well as spare parts for the machine underlying this litigation.

But now we understand that further factors existed suggestive of a special relationship between Schuman and plaintiff's employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   That is, it appears that Schuman knew of an alternative design for the Model 60.

What is more, while Schuman did not continue manufacturing Model 60s, it did continue manufacturing the AmeriPak line of horizontal wrappers-i.e., Models 40 and 140. In doing so, Schuman itself incorporated an alternative design similar (or even identical) to that seen in the engineering folder taken from the S.K.S. facility-this is again similar to the\n   <em>\n    Radziul\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=479%20N.Y.S.2d%20324\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=479%20N.Y.S.2d%20324\">\n    at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I emphasize that I cannot ignore Schuman's knowledge or constructive knowledge of the alternative design for the Model 60 in determining Schuman's independent duty to warn plaintiff or her employer.

While Schuman did not draft the Model 60 operator's manual, it did personalize the cover page of that manual, choosing to denote AmeriPak as \"a division of O.P.

My holding here is especially appropriate where the New York Court of Appeals broke with its own tradition in 1983 and categorized questions regarding a successor corporation's independent duty to warn as an issue of fact for the jury, not an issue of law for the court-as I outlined earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Breach of Duty\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"The adequacy of the warning in a products liability case based on a failure to warn is, in all but the most unusual circumstances, a question of fact to be determined at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooley v.

This design schematic would have alerted plaintiff's employer as to the danger of operating the machine in manual mode and, more importantly, provided a simple and inexpensive electronic workaround to fix the defect in\n   question. Schuman was already in the practice of customizing the first two pages of the Model 60 operator's manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operator's Manual, at 1-2. Adding an additional one-page insert would not have burdened Schuman.

The plaintiff Vicuna has testified specifically that, had she be warned of the dangers present, she would not have operated the machine in the manner that she did. First Vicuna Depo. 49:18-50:19; 53:8-14. Moreover, common sense indicates that the injury in question could have been avoided had Schuman provided a proper warning or alternative schematic. Indeed, decals present on the machine could have alerted the plaintiff to the dangers of the machine as well as alternative operation methods available to ensure safety, such as protective gloves. Additionally, I highlight that plaintiff's employer specifically requested an operator's manual from Schuman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Manual Invoice, Jan. 5, 2012, ECF No. 49-12. Plaintiff's employer did this arguably for the purpose of maintaining and operating the machine in a safe and efficient manner.

Nevertheless, much of Mr. Heiberg's experience is directly applicable. For instance, Mr. Heiberg worked as the manager of engineering at a company known as EBI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eric Heiberg, Curriculum Vitae, at 29. His primary duties were to design, produce, and test medical equipment. This brought him into contact with various machines similar in nature to the Model 60 in question here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, 32. Other responsibilities at EBI included hazard and risk analyses, product labeling, warning labeling, operator manual drafting, workplace safety supervision, and more.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. In another position, as a mechanical engineer at Coltene/Whaledent, Mr. Heiberg oversaw the design and production of numerous plastic products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He was additionally responsible for the selection and purchasing of workplace safety equipment; further duties included supervision regarding regulatory workplace safety requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Mr. Heiberg has worked first-hand with numerous machines relevant to the events underlying this litigation, including heating machines, packaging machines, crimping machines, punch presses, brake presses, shrink wrapping machines, heat processing machines, mixing machinery, and more.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. Again, Mr. Heiberg's education specifically included training on machine guarding, which goes to the heart of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. He is currently a registered professional engineer in four states, including New York and Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.

Indeed, in arguing that Mr. Heiberg is unqualified to render an expert opinion, Schuman conflates admissibility with evidentiary weight. Schuman points out that Mr. Heiberg has never previously worked directly with an AmeriPak Model 60. See Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Exclude Expert, Dec. 9, 2016, ECF No. 94, at 7. This is precisely the type of fact that goes to the weight of Mr. Heiberg's testimony, and not his threshold qualification to testify. It would be immensely difficult (if not impossible) to locate and retain an expert who has worked first-hand with an AmeriPak Model 60-a machine that has been out of production for nearly 15 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   This is not unlike Schuman's other contention: that Mr. Heiberg is unqualified because he has never previously provided testimony\n   <em>\n    at trial\n   </em>\n   as an expert in a litigation involving\n   <em>\n    packaging equipment specifically.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. If that alone were sufficient to preclude Mr. Heiberg, all courts would be devoid of expert witnesses-there must be a first time for everything. At any rate, I observe that clients have retained Mr. Heiberg as an expert in thirty-six different projects involving machines with interlocking guards similar to the guard at issue in the present case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eric Heiberg, Retained Cases, Jan. 20, 2017, ECF No. 98-10, at 7-8. Of those thirty-six projects involving interlocking guards, fourteen progressed to formal litigation, including cases in state and federal courts in New York and New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, of the thirty-six projects involving interlocking guards, approximately ten involved packaging equipment specifically (though apparently none of those ten projects progressed to formal litigation).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At any rate, Mr. Heiberg is no stranger to the courtroom: in the past five years alone, he has appeared in person at court proceedings in at least ten litigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eric Heiberg, List of PE Court Appearances, July 18, 2016, ECF No. 94-14, at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Schuman's case citations here do not support its position. Schuman cites\n   <em>\n    Sorto-Romero v. Delta Int'l Mach.

Rather, it addressed the\n   <em>\n    reliability\n   </em>\n   of expert testimony, a completely different matter. Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Sorto-Romero\n   </em>\n   wrote expressly that the parties had conceded that the proffered expert there \"possesse[d] the requisite knowledge and experience to be qualified as an expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

Supp. Exclusion Expert Witness, at 13. Yet this issue merely weighs against the credibility of Mr. Heiberg's testimony. It does not speak to admissibility. Countless experts develop opinions \"solely for the purpose of paid testimony,\" and such is not a proper basis for exclusion. Indeed, the cases that Schuman cites here are altogether inapposite.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Parmalat Sec.

In discussing how the Model 60 could have been rewired to prevent operation in manual mode without proper guarding, Mr. Heiberg writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   A guard should have been provided where the machine was prevented from running while the infeed (fin seal) guard was in the vertical position, regardless of whether the machines was in manual or automatic mode. Such a guard could have been provided by splitting the electrical path downstream, not upstream of the guard micro-switches and NOT bypassing the micro-switches when the machine was in manual mode. In this design in order for the electricity to get to the \"Main Drive\" it has to pass through the micro-switch, and if the micro-switch opens (turns off) the electricity will cease to flow and the motor will stop. In such a design, the infeed (fin seal) guard would be required to be in the down, protecting position, during manual mode, in order for the machine to operate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Eng'g Report, at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Put simply, Mr. Heiberg's proposed alternative rewiring design would deprive the machine's conveyer mechanism of electricity in manual mode whenever the machine's protective guard was unsecured. This would apparently be similar to how a microwave oven will not activate unless its door is securely closed. In additional, it would also be similar to how the Model 60 operates in automatic mode, and similar to the one-page alternative design schematic created by S.K.S. in or around 1995-1996.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Importantly, the alternative rewiring design explored by Mr. Heiberg is a design similar or identical to that actually utilized in AmeriPak models that Schuman has manufactured subsequent to the Model 60, such as the Models 40 and 140.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Mr. Heiberg's proposed alternative rewiring design, if incorporated into the Model 60, would have prevented the injuries underlying this litigation. Moreover, the favorable feasibility, low cost, and continuing utility of the alternative design have been analyzed here by Mr. Heiberg.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 17. Again, quite persuasive is that subsequent machines that Schuman manufactured incorporate an alternative rewiring similar to Mr. Heiberg's and seemingly function without any handicap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almonte v. Averna Vision &amp; Robotics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759497\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/729/#p751\">\n    128 F.Supp.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (holding that \"the existence of a feasible alternative design may be established by pointing to the existence of a post-accident design\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   I further observe that, in addition to the alternative rewiring design, Mr. Heiberg proposed moving the \"start\" button on the Model 60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eng'g Report, at 15. Moving the start button as Mr. Heiberg proposes would prevent many operators from using the Model 60 in manual mode while his or her hand was near the dangerous \"pinch point.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759497\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/729/#p751\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, to use the Model 60's conveyor belt and pinching movement in manual mode, the operator must continually depress the machine's start button.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operator's Manual, at 1-9. Under the original design of the Model 60, the start button is located relatively close to the pinch point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Photograph AmeriPak Model 60, Dec. 4, 2012, ECF No. 98-2, at 1. For this reason, many operators can easily depress the start button while stretching to reach their hand into the pinch point area (which is what happened in this case). This creates a moving hazard near the operator's outreached hand. Mr. Heiberg's start button redesign would place that button father away from the pinch point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eng'g Report, at 15. Under this redesign, many operators (over 97% of all females, for instance) could not depress the start button and simultaneously stretch to reach their hand into the pinch point area.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759497\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/729/#p751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, an\n   operator would be less likely to lose his or her fingers in manual mode. Like his alternative rewiring design, Mr. Heiberg's alternative start-button design is complete with a feasibility, cost, and utility analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759497\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/729/#p751\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It cannot be argued that Mr. Heiberg did not consider alternative designs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Third, Schuman argues that Mr. Heiberg's testimony is unreliable because he did not consider plaintiff Vicuna's own misuse of the machine in question-that is, her choice to operate the Model 60 in manual mode contrary to the operator's manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Preclude Expert, at 9-10. Mr. Heiberg, Schuman argues, also failed to consider the training from her employer that the plaintiff received, in which Vicuna was apparently directed to operate the machine in manual mode.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759497\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/729/#p751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, I would surmise that Schuman has not read Mr. Heiberg's written report. There, Mr. Heiberg acknowledges that the plaintiff chose to operate the Model 60 in manual mode with the guard unsecured. Nevertheless, Mr. Heiberg's report determines that her use was foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eng'g Report, at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boots v. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155315\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/132/307/#p314\">\n    132 F.Supp.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314 (N.D.N.Y. 2015) (holding that foreseeable use of a product must be considered reasonable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On this point, Mr. Heiberg quotes deposition testimony of Mr. Sterner, who was a principal engineer at S.K.S. and later an employee at Schuman. Mr. Sterner's testimony indicates that the plaintiff's use of the machine was expected at the time of the Model 60 design:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Q. Did it occur to you when the machine was designed that the machine may be operated in the manual mode by an operator?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. And was it-did you consider the fact that the guard could be raised during that operation in the manual mode and the machine would function?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q. And did you consider that it might bypass the safety of the-of the point of operation guard by an operator doing that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eng'g Report, at 7. Moreover, Mr. Heiberg's report reveals that the operator's manual for the Model 60 contemplates at least some use of the machine in manual mode.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155315\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/132/307/#p314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For instance, the operator's manual contemplates \"jogging\" the Model 60 in manual mode as well as using manual mode for machine \"setup.\" Operator's Manual, at 1-9. This further indicates foreseeability. Mr. Heiberg properly considered the plaintiff's use of the Model 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Last, Schuman argues that Mr. Heiberg's testimony is unreliable because of his bias and predisposition towards finding in the plaintiffs' favor. Schuman emphasizes that Mr. Heiberg stated in his deposition, \"If [the plaintiff] were to have intentionally stuck her arm into the machine and still injured it, it would not have been relevant to whether or not the machine was defective-defectively designed in a manner that caused the accident.\" Eric Heiberg Depo., Sept. 8, 2016, ECF No. 94-15, 111:12-18. Some case law would suggest that such an extreme position might warrant exclusion of an expert's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lara v. Delta Int'l Mach. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346386\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/719/#p730\">\n    174 F.Supp.3d 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (suggesting that unwavering predisposition towards finding fault in a product's design could render an expert opinion unreliable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Yet Schuman has unfairly characterized Mr. Heiberg's position. Reading his deposition transcript in full, it is clear that Mr. Heiberg made a subtler point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eric Heiberg Depo. 110:1-116:20. Rather than suggest that an operator's actions could never be the cause of an accident on the Model 60, Mr. Heiberg merely stated that, in this case, it was the design of the Model\n   60 that contributed, at least in large part, to the injuries ultimately sustained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:5-20. In fact, during the course of clarifying his answer, Mr. Heiberg readily conceded that \"there may have been other causes to the incident\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. I further observe that the portion of Mr. Heiberg's testimony upon which Schuman relies was a point of real confusion between Mr. Heiberg and the attorneys present at his disposition. The attorney representing Muffins 'n' More actually \"moved to strike\" Mr. Heiberg's statement because he did not \"think that [it] answered the question\" being asked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111:19-21. Whatever the case with Mr. Heiberg's testimony, his written report makes clear that he did take into account Vicuna's use of the machine, concluding it was foreseeable, as addressed earlier. I cannot exclude Mr. Heiberg's testimony based on one stray statement indicating a predisposition toward his client, especially considering the overall context here. Mr. Heiberg's proffered testimony is thus relevant and reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The plaintiffs have submitted proffered expert testimony by their retained engineer, Mr. Heiberg.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section II.B. That report is thorough and spells out in great detail that the Model 60 could operate in manual mode without the safety of a secured interlocking guard to protect operators. According to Mr. Heiberg, such a design contravened industry standards as well as prudent design.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His report refers to, among other things, the standards set out in the Accident Prevention Manual published by the National Safety Council as well as the standards set out in the American National Standard for Packaging Machinery and Packaging Related Converting Machinery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Moreover, the defect could have been remedied inexpensively without changing the utility of the Model 60, according to Mr. Heiberg.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His report proposes two alternative designs for the Model 60-both of which I explained earlier-including analyses of feasibility, costs, and utility.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section II.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The record further shows that the design defect was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff's injuries. Had protective guarding blocked the plaintiff's access to the pinch point, no accident would have occurred. Moreover, it is reasonably expected that lack of guarding would lead to an operator's unsafe contact with the pinch point. As stated earlier, a\n   Schuman employee testified that, at the time of design, the designers of the Model 60 contemplated that operators might use the machine in manual mode without the protective guard in place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Schuman employee further testified that this presented safety concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the operator's manual for the Model 60 contemplates use of the machine in manual mode, albeit for limited purposes. A reasonable jury could find proximate cause here.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section II.B.;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mustafa v.

Schuman's motion for summary judgment therefore fails on the claim of negligent design, just as its motion failed on the claim of strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Plaintiff's Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Schuman asserts that it is excused from liability here because the plaintiff's own actions contributed to her injury-namely, operating the Model 60 in manual mode without secured guards and then reaching her hand into the pinch point area during operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., at 23.

That is not the case here, where the record indicates that the plaintiff used the Model 60 in a foreseeable manner, as addressed earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689872\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/29/#p34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (denying defendant's motion for summary judgment where plaintiff's misuse of devise in question was foreseeable);\n   <em>\n    Mustafa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20959704\">\n    2007 WL 959704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (\"Additionally, it is clear that Mustafa's conduct, however culpable, was not the sole cause of the accident, insulating Halkin from liability.

Failure to Warn-Successor Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   I have already discussed at length Schuman's motion for summary judgment on the independent failure to warn claim. Again, that claim should proceed to a jury determination. Separate and apart from that discussion is the plaintiffs' claim against Schuman for failure to warn as the successor to S.K.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. &amp; Order, May 19, 2015, at 18. On this issue, I note for the record that Schuman has not moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., at ii. This is surprising because Schuman appears to have moved for summary judgment on every other outstanding claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20959704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Schuman has further sought dismissal of \"all claims and counterclaims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Indeed, it would appear that Schuman's failure\n   to move for summary judgment on this successor issue was an oversight. Thus, while I will not reach the merits of that claim today, I remind the parties that it remains a cause of action for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Loss of Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The plaintiffs' claim for loss of services is derivative of the underlying claims. Schuman's motion for summary judgment on this claim is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Subsequent Remedial Measures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   I observe that Schuman objects throughout its briefing to the plaintiffs' use of the alternative schematic on grounds that the schematic represents a subsequent remedial measure inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 407.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mem. Opp'n Pls.' Mot. for Reconsideration, at 1. Nevertheless, the schematic dates from\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the injury in this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp. to Pls.' Supp. Not. to Produce, at 5 (dated 1996). Thus, while the schematic may have been created after the initial manufacturing of the machine in question here, it does not represent a subsequent remedial measure within the meaning of Rule 407. Indeed, Rule 407 only prohibits admission of measures \"that would have made an\n   <em>\n    earlier\n   </em>\n   injury or harm less likely to occur.\" Fed. R. Evid. 407 (emphasis added). Moreover, subsequent remedial measures are inadmissible only with respect to certain issues, such as negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this case, the plaintiffs use the schematic to prove feasibility as well as for other permissible purposes.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   sections I.B.1. &amp; II.B.;\n   <em>\n    In re Joint Asbestos Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514168\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/343/#p345\">\n    995 F.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345 (2d Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Plaintiffs' Motion for Costs and Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The plaintiffs request costs and attorney's fees. I decline to award such costs or fees against Schuman at this time. Schuman's presentation was not wholly frivolous, and Schuman did in fact prevail on a number of the issues litigated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Odeon Capital Grp. LLC v. Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275676\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/191/#p198\">\n    864 F.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 (2d Cir. 2017) (decision to award attorney's fees is within district court's discretion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The plaintiffs move for leave to amend their complaint. They wish to add six paragraphs that they omitted inadvertently from the version of their complaint last filed with the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Amend Compl., Dec. 6, 2016, ECF No. 76, at 1. Leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(3). The defendant Schuman has not shown any prejudice that would result from amendment to the complaint in the manner described.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ltr. Opp'n Mot. to Amend Compl., Dec. 8, 2016, ECF No. 78, at 1. I grant the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, I hereby order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of my decision dated May 19, 2015 is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and upon reconsideration Schuman's motion for summary judgment on the independent failure to warn claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   \u2022 Schuman's motion to preclude the plaintiffs' expert and his testimony is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   \u2022 Schuman's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part, consistent with this memorandum;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiffs' motion for costs and attorney's fees is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n   \u2022 The plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
