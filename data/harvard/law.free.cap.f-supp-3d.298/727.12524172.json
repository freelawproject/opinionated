RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although this case involves nearly a dozen parties in the fashion technology business and conduct that occurred on at least three continents, the underlying battle is basically between two men: Jerome Marechaux, a French citizen residing in Paris, France, and Bradley Zetler, a dual U.S. and South African citizen residing in Cape Town, South Africa. The various other parties are either individuals employed by Marechaux or entities controlled by Marechaux or Zetler. But while their controversies reflect the international reach of modern business, they also reflects such human emotions as greed and anger that are as old as the hills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Now locked in bitter disputes, Marechaux and Zetler were once business associates who shared funds and resources. Marechaux allowed Zetler to use his brand and cultivate his customer-base; Zetler lent Marechaux his technological know-how and business acumen. Of particular significance to the instant dispute Marechaux, in 2005, made Zetler the president of a Delaware company called C.D.S. Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"plaintiff\") that Marechaux had founded a decade earlier and that was engaged in helping fashion agencies connect with their customers electronically. Subsequently, Marechaux and Zetler developed a product called \"Agencypad,\" a software system that combined various functions and features of Marechaux's and Zetler's existing products. Thereafter, Marechaux and Zetler sold Agencypad to modeling agencies around the world, with Marechaux taking the lead in Europe, Zetler in Africa, and both overseeing aspects of the North American operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But as the business grew, so did the differences between the partners. Zetler, in particular, became increasingly dissatisfied with Marechaux, and demanded more money and more control over the global business. In 2015, Zetler threatened to break things off with Marechaux if Marechaux did not accede to his demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In early 2016, an uneasy stalemate collapsed. To retain the Company's head of sales, Diane Treat, Marechaux made her president of the Company, terminating Zetler from the role. In response, Zetler cut off the Company's access to various accounts and services, refused to turn over critical information belonging to the Company, and filed a series of copyright and trademark registrations in and to Agencypad-the Company's flagship product-claiming that Agencypad belonged to his South African company, Rapid Systems CC (\"Rapid Systems\"), pursuant to a 2001 contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusive Distributorship Agreement (\"EDA\"), Pl. Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 29, 2016, the Company, seeking to recover its assets and preserve its business, brought the instant action against Zetler, as well as against Rapid Systems and CDS LLC (\"the LLC\"), entities wholly-owned by Zetler (collectively \"defendants\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (\"Compl.\"), Dkt. 1. The Company argued,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , that Rapid Systems' copyright and trademark registrations in and to Agencypad were void, and that the Company was the rightful owner of Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Company also sought monetary damages and injunctive\n   relief in connection with actions Zetler took to undermine the Company during his final years as its president and in the months following his termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 6, 2016, the Honorable Victor Marrero, to whom this case was assigned prior to trial, issued a preliminary injunction granting the Company co-equal access to the accounts and tools necessary for the Company to maintain and operate its business during the pendency of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decision and Order, Dkt. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 8, 2016, defendants filed a second amended answer, including six affirmative counterclaims against the Company and naming six third-party defendants: Marechaux, Treat, three members of the Company's Board of Directors (Jerome Viollon, Christelle Riot, and Christophe Racle), and C.D.S. SARL (\"SARL\"), a French company majority-owned by Marechaux.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Second Amended Answer, Counterclaims, and Jury Demand (\"SAAC\"), Dkt. 139. Zetler also brought eight derivative counterclaims against the third-party defendants on behalf of the Company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following full and extensive discovery before Judge Marrero and Magistrate Judge James Cott, this action was reassigned to the undersigned on December 26, 2017 for trial. Prior to transfer, Judge Marrero, on December 21, 2017, issued a Decision and Order resolving a series of disputes between the parties regarding the effect of a parallel lawsuit in France on the scope of triable issues in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 392. On January 5, 2018, defendants moved, pursuant to Local Civil Rule 6.3, for reconsideration of the Decision and Order \"insofar as it granted plaintiff's motion for collateral estoppel\" and \"ruled on a conflict of laws issue that had not been presented in the papers before the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 397. The Company and third-party defendants (the \"Marechaux Parties\") opposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The cDs Parties' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Rapid Systems' Motion for Reconsideration (\"Opp. Br.\"), Dkt. 405. On January 22, 2018, the Court denied defendants' motion from the bench.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Transcript (\"Tr.\") 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, the Court held a three-week trial, during which time the Court heard testimony from approximately a dozen witnesses. On February 8, 2018, following the close of the evidence, the parties elected to dismiss the jury and submit their claims to the Court for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2128. The Court set a schedule for post-trial briefing, and the parties timely submitted their papers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The cDs Parties' Post-Trial Brief, Dkt. 450 (\"Pl. Mem.\"); Rapid Systems' Post-Trial Memorandum of Law (\"Def. Mem.\"), Dkt. 451-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court now renders its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and enters final judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although some material facts are undisputed, the Court's determination of many material facts turns on the Court's assessment of the witnesses' credibility, including their demeanor, as well as the entirety of the trial evidence and the parties' written and oral submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Jerome Marechaux is a French citizen living in Paris. Marechaux became a professional model when he was six years old. Tr. 663:11 (Marechaux). When he was 24, Marechaux quit modeling to start a company called Force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 664-67 (Marechaux). With Elite, his former firm, as his first client, Marechaux launched a software application called Force Booking, which offered modelling agencies a way to centrally manage bookings for their models as well as other aspects of their day-to-day business operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 665-67 (Marechaux).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1994, Marechaux changed the company's name from Force to Creation and Development of Software or C.D.S. SARL (\"SARL\"), Tr. 667 (Marechaux), and incorporated an entity in the U.S. called C.D.S. Inc. (\"the Company\"), Tr. 668 (Marechaux).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Marechaux did not formally link SARL to the Company, informally he ran the two entities as a unified global business (the \"cDs Group\"). SARL sold Force Booking software and its many later iterations (hereinafter the \"cDs booking software\") in Europe; the Company (C.D.S. Inc.) sold the software in North America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To oversee operations in New York, Marechaux recruited a woman named Susanne Funk, and appointed her vice president of the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 668 (Marechaux). Thereafter, Marechaux elevated her to president,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 669 (Marechaux), and made her the Company's majority shareholder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl. Ex. 32 (describing Funk as the 60% owner of the Company's stock). During her tenure with the Company, Funk hired several software developers to update and further enhance the cDs booking software including, in 1998, a Ukrainian engineer named Alex Gugnishev. Tr. 56 (Gugnishev). To assist with sales, accounting, and development, Marechaux hired,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , Christelle Riot, Christophe Racle, and Jerome Viollon in France.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 673-74 (Marechaux). By the end of the decade, the cDs Group had secured most of the top modelling agencies in New York and Paris as clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1552 (Zetler) (testifying that, by 2001, cDs had \"quite a big market share\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2001, at the tail end of the dot-com boom, Marechaux received a call from Bradley Zetler, a technology entrepreneur residing in Cape Town, South Africa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1553 (Zetler). Zetler, working with a software developer named Robert Nagel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1545:6 (Zetler), had created a product called \"Portfoliopad,\" which allowed modelling agencies to upload images of their models online and transfer them to their customers over the internet using a website called portfoliopad.com. Portfoliopad offered agencies a way to avoid hand delivering expensive hard copies of model portfolios and emailing large files.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1537-48 (Zetler).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Zetler needed a distributor for Portfoliopad with relationships in Paris and New York to sell his service to the major agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1552-53 (Zetler). Conversely, the cDs booking product did not yet have a digital imaging functionality, and while the Group's coders were working on one,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 685 (Marechaux), the Group's booking product, like most software at this time, stored client's data locally. Portfoliopad stood out because it stored client's data on the cloud, allowing anyone with the right credentials to access it using the internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Seeing an opportunity to enhance the Group's offerings to its clients, Marechaux agreed to become Portfoliopad's exclusive distributor in Europe and North America. Marechaux and Zetler memorialized their agreement in a written instrument known as the EDA, formally a contract between SARL, the Company (C.D.S. Inc.), and Rapid Systems. Under the terms of the agreement, Rapid Systems retained the right to sell Portfoliopad in South Africa and the Group agreed to pay Rapid Systems a 30% commission on sales of Portfoliopad in the rest of the world.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EDA \u00a7 14.2. (As the terms of the EDA make clear, client relationships, not software code, are the most valuable asset in the fashion technology business.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the success of the EDA, Marechaux and Zetler deepened their business ties, executing an agreement on April 1, 2003 called the Franchise Contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 3 (\"FC\"). Under the Franchise Contract, SARL granted Rapid Systems the right to use the cDs brand in South Africa,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FC \u00a7 3, and Rapid Systems began doing business as \"cDs Cape Town.\" Additionally, Rapid Systems gained the right to sell, in exchange for a 30% commission, the Group's branded booking software in South Africa, then referred to as \"M5,\" later referred to as \"CDS6.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FC \u00a7 7. Zetler also set up an LLC in Delaware, which he called CDS LLC (\"the LLC\"), to capture in the United States commissions due to Rapid Systems under the EDA. See Tr. 1600 (Zetler); Tr. 1828 (Zetler).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2005, Funk retired,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1028 (Funk), and Zetler, seeing an opportunity to strengthen his relationships with the Group's elite clients, boost sales of Portfoliopad in North America, and expand his role in what the parties were calling \"cDs Global,\" offered to step in as president of the Company. As part of the deal, Zetler wanted 50% of the Company's equity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1644:7-8 (Zetler). Ultimately, he settled for 45%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1644:15-16 (Zetler) (\"eventually we settled on 45/55\"). Zetler's goal, which he first pitched to Marechaux around this time,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1754:15 (Zetler), was to get Marechaux to agree to put all three companies under one roof, sell the entire business, and split the proceeds 50/50.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1644-45 (Zetler). Marechaux never agreed to this, and his reluctance to cede additional ownership and control over the cDs business, or to sell it, eventually doomed cDs Global and his partnership with Zetler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thereafter, in September 2010, Marechaux and Riot, now the Chief Operating Officer of the \"cDs Group,\" began to work with Zetler to develop a new version of the Group's booking software, the \"CDS Online Platform.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The then-current version, CDS6, was still a local application, meaning clients could only access their data on their own computers. Riot envisioned a program that would run on the cloud like Portfoliopad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Riot to Zetler and Marechaux dated September 13, 2010, Pl. Ex. 112 (attaching functional specifications for the \"CDS Online Platform\"); Tr. 751-52 (Marechaux).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Alex Gugnishev, the Company's primary software developer, spent the next two years writing the code for the new online upgrade, including nearly all of the so-called front-end and back-end code (the \"application code,\" accounting for between 90% and 97% of the total code in the final product).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 168 (Gugnishev); Pl. Ex. 335. There was one part of the product (accounting for the remaining three to ten percent of the total code),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 168-69 (Gugnishev); 410-13 (Horowitz) ), however, with which Gugnishev had meaningful help. This portion was known as the \"database code\" or the \"data schema.\" Gugnishev and Zetler decided that the Company could save time and money by storing the data uploaded by the booking software's clients in the same database as the data uploaded by Portfoliopad's clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Gugnishev to Zetler dated September 23, 2010, Pl. Ex. 116 (suggesting that the two applications use the same tables and fields for information used by both applications). Additionally, by using the same database for both applications, cDs Cape Town and the cDs Group could integrate their flagship products, so that clients buying both would only have to enter their information once (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , if a client hired a new model and entered that model's name and information in Portfoliopad, then the client could access that information while using the booking software).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Zetler directed his programmers in South Africa to work with Gugnishev to link the new booking software to the database used by Portfoliopad. That database, like a big excel spreadsheet, stored, in several dozen tables, information clients entered while using the application. For example, when creating an account, a client would enter information about their agency (such as their address and name) and information about their models (e.g. their gender, age, and hair color).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 74:4-13 (Gugnishev); Tr. 93 (Gugnishev). This database was saved online, on server space rented from third-parties (in the case of Agencypad, from Amazon Web Services,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 267), so clients could access their information again from any computer with an internet connection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, information common to both applications was stored in the same tables (in \"fields\" like agency name, agency address, model name, model age). There were 30 of these so-called shared tables. Tr. 1929:14 (Nagel). These tables were written by Nagel for Portfoliopad. Additionally, as the booking software performed many functions that did not overlap with Portfoliopad, Gugnishev coded at least 42 new tables to save booking-related information, and Nagel coded another 21 or so. Tr. 1930 (Nagel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As the project neared completion in June 2012, Marechaux decided to call the new software Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated June 6, 2012, Def. Ex. 142. He and Zetler further agreed to market Agencypad jointly with Portfoliopad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler and Viollon dated June 19, 2012, Def. Ex. 148. Thereafter, the Company, SARL, and Rapid Systems (doing business as cDs Cape Town) sold Agencypad bundled with Portfoliopad to their clients around the world.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   While take-up in the European market lagged, potentially because of privacy concerns, the bundle quickly became the Company's best-selling product overall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CDS Inc. Sales by Product/Service Summary, January-December 2013, Pl. Ex. 38 (showing sales of $269,521 for Agencypad and $467,946 for the older generation CDS6 software); CDS Inc. Sales by Product/Service Summary, January-December 2015, Pl. Ex. 40 (showing sales of $728,405 for Agencypad and $380,294 for the CDS6 software).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Zetler, however, was displeased with his share of the spoils. Increasingly, he argued to his colleagues that he was the driving force behind the Group's success, and that they needed to either step up their efforts or fork over more money to him and to Rapid Systems. Although Marechaux had long ago agreed that Zetler would not have to pay commissions on his sales of the Group's products in South Africa,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated November 10, 2005, Pl. Ex. 109, Zetler now objected to Marechaux earning as much money as him from the cDs Global business,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Email from Zetler to Marechaux dated October 23, 2013, Pl. Ex. 133 (\"In Cape Town we spoke about correcting the past on a 60/40 split, I have heard nothing from you about this again... I propose taking $150k from cDs NY to start to reduce the $380k and the rest we must discuss\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As Zetler supplied critical technological expertise and was an integral part of the Company, Marechaux increased Zetler's compensation in 2013 and 2014, approving one-off payouts to Rapid Systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II(C)(3),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Nonetheless, in 2015, Zetler began to siphon off business for himself and his companies, transfer the Company's property to his LLC, and plan for the possible termination of the Franchise Contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II(B)-(C),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Zetler also continued to complain about his compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Zetler to Marechaux dated March 2, 2015, Def. Ex. 197 (accusing Marechaux of taking advantage of him, of not working enough, and of doing a poor job running SARL);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"I want to be compensated financially for extra time I know I put in compared to you last year\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Maybe we stop the commission and you just run Paris and I take the rest\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By year-end 2015, it became clear to Marechaux and his colleagues that Zetler had diverted even more funds from the Company than they had previously known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1001-02 (Viollon). When Treat sought greater responsibility within the Company and Marechaux suggested to Zetler that Treat, who worked full time in New York, should be elevated to president, Zetler objected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Zetler to Marechaux dated January 21, 2016, Pl. Ex. 140. Zetler began demanding even higher commissions on sales of Rapid Systems products and claimed for the first time\n   that Agencypad was just an outgrowth of Portfoliopad and that Rapid Systems, therefore, owned Agencypad under the terms of the EDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Zetler to Viollon dated January 29, 2016, Def. Ex. 223 (stating that from \"February 1, 2016 we [the Company] must start paying what we should for AP commission which is same as PP 30%\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Left with little choice, Marechaux hired an attorney, appointed Racle, Viollon, and Riot as directors of the Company and, with their consent, on March 4, 2016, had the Board terminate Zetler as president of the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 819-21 (Marechaux). Thereafter, the Board appointed Treat as president and informed Zetler of the change in leadership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Treat reached out to Zetler to chart a path forward, Zetler was not cooperative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1389 (Treat). He refused to grant the Company administrative access to the accounts where Agencypad's source code and database were housed.

Mem. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As mentioned earlier, defendants initially argued that Rapid Systems owned Agencypad because Agencypad was an extension of Portfoliopad, and, under the EDA, Rapid Systems owned the rights to all \"new inventions, designs or processes which evolve in the Portfoliopad Software and/or the Source Code and/or the Portfoliopad System.\" EDA \u00a7 15.1; Tr. 1802 (Zetler). But the French courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising under the EDA, found that Agencypad was not an evolution of Portfoliopad, and that, therefore, the EDA does not govern the ownership of Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Delivered on 12/7/2016 at 8, Commercial Court of Paris, Dkt. 386, Ex. A (finding that the \"Agencypad software is not a 'Contractual Product' under the [EDA]\"); Judgment of July 5, 2017, Paris Court of Appeal, Dkt. 386, Ex. C (affirming the Commercial Court's decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants now argue that Rapid Systems owns Agencypad because Alex Gugnishev worked for Rapid Systems when he made his contributions to Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 8. Alternatively, defendants argue that Agencypad is a \"joint work,\" and, therefore, Rapid Systems owns an undivided interest in Agencypad; that Agencypad is a \"collective work\" and, therefore, Rapid Systems owns the parts of Agencypad written by Robert Nagel and a Rapid Systems software developer named Tiaan van Zyl; and/or that plaintiff should be equitably estopped from claiming ownership of Agencypad because plaintiff allowed Rapid Systems to sell Agencypad in certain countries without paying commissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Gugnishev also wrote the vast majority of the code,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 167 (Gugnishev), and oversaw the integration of the code written by Nagel, van Zyl, and Taylor Carr, an independent contractor paid by the Company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 163 (Gugnishev); Tr. 1951:5-7 (Nagel) (testifying that Gugnishev was the person tasked with creating Agencypad).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   If, as defendants contend, Gugnishev were a Rapid Systems employee when he did this work, then Rapid Systems would be the dominant author and sole owner of Agencypad. But there is little evidence in the record to support defendants' argument. At all times relevant, the Company, not Rapid Systems, paid Gugnishev's salary and benefits and provided Gugnishev with the instrumentalities of his work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 57-58 (Gugnishev). Indeed, Gugnishev had never heard of Rapid Systems until 2016 when this lawsuit was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 58:2-3 (Gugnishev).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nonetheless, defendants argue that Gugnishev was a \"loaned servant,\" nominally employed by C.D.S. Inc., but actually working for Rapid Systems pursuant to an unwritten agreement between Zetler and Marechaux.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 8;\n   <em>\n    Shenker v.

According to defendants, the relevant question is who had \"immediate control and supervision\" of Gugnishev, and they argue that Zetler did,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 260:8-261:13 (Gugnishev); and that Zetler exercised this control, not as president of the Company, but as managing member of Rapid Systems,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 9. In support of their argument, defendants point to Gugnishev's testimony that he thought he was working for the same organization as Nagel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 209:15-20 (Gugnishev), and that he was unaware that Rapid Systems was a distinct legal entity from C.D.S. Inc.,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 205:21-206:1 (Gugnishev). Defendants also cite Zetler's testimony that he believed Gugnishev was a common cDs resource whose services were regularly farmed out to other offices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1900:6-20 (Zetler).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants' carefully crafted narrative is, however, incomplete, at times fanciful, and highly misleading. It is true that Zetler directed many of Gugnishev's efforts on Agencypad, but the Court finds that he did so in his capacity as president of C.D.S. Inc. not as managing member of Rapid Systems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Zetler claims that his role as president was pro forma,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1646:1-2 (Zetler) (\"[s]omeone had to sign the documents as president, and that ended up being me\"), this testimony is inconsistent with the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1749 (Zetler) (testifying that he had management responsibilities, hired and fired employees, and signed contracts on behalf of the Company). Zetler himself argues that the Company compensated him for his contributions to the Company by,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , defraying Rapid Systems' business expenses with the Company's funds. Indicating just how important a position he actually considered president to be, Zetler refused to agree when Marechaux suggested elevating Treat to president.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1802 (Zetler).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds nothing in Gugnishev's highly credible testimony to support defendants' version of events. Although Gugnishev testified that he thought that he worked for the same organization as Nagel, this is likely because Gugnishev thought, incorrectly, that Nagel, who was an independent contractor, worked for the Company, C.D.S. Inc. (not because he, Gugnishev, thought that he worked for Rapid Systems). After all, Zetler was the president of the Company, and, as mentioned earlier, Gugnishev had never heard of Rapid Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, the facts adduced at trial clearly establish that Gugnishev was not a loaned servant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Langfitt v.

Among other things, the Company never\n   expressly transferred control over Gugnishev to Rapid Systems. Rapid Systems was in no way responsible for paying Gugnishev and never compensated the Company for his services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1754:19-21 (Zetler). (During the relevant time period, in fact, large sums of money flowed from the Company to Rapid Systems.) Rapid Systems did not furnish Gugnishev with the equipment necessary for his work, and Rapid Systems did not have the right to terminate his employment on the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that Gugnishev was an employee of the Company when he made his contributions to Agencypad, and that, accordingly, the Company is the dominant author of Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    16 Casa Duse, LLC v.

Even Zetler, who now advances the joint ownership argument, testified at trial that it was his understanding that Rapid Systems was the sole owner of Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1802 (Zetler) (\"I believe that was our understanding\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, the underlying economics strongly suggest that at the time Agencypad was developed, all of the relevant individuals intended the Company to be the sole author of the product. Indeed, the Company paid for almost all of the incremental costs of developing Agencypad and bore almost all of the costs of maintaining Agencypad. While Zetler directed Rapid Systems to contribute to Agencypad's code, primarily by allowing the Company to adapt certain database tables and stored procedures originally developed for Portfoliopad, Rapid Systems received enormous benefits in exchange for these minimal,\n   practically costless contributions. For example, by fusing Agencypad's database with Portfoliopad's, Rapid Systems was able to offload the entire cost of maintaining the Portfoliopad database onto the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II(C)(1),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, Rapid Systems was able to increase the likelihood that the Company's booking software customers would also buy Portfoliopad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Additionally, \"[t]hough 'billing' or 'credit' is not decisive in all cases and joint authorship can exist without any explicit discussion of this topic by the parties, consideration of the topic helpfully serves to focus the fact-finder's attention on how the parties implicitly regarded their undertaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Childress\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522891\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/500/#p508\">\n    945 F.2d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the Company never paid commissions to Rapid Systems on the Agencypad portion of its sales of the Agencypad/Portfoliopad bundle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated February 1, 2016, Def. Ex. 223 (\"[i]t is not and it has never been our agreement\"). And the parties' communications reveal their implicit understanding that the Company, not Rapid Systems, was the sole author of Agencypad. Therefore, the Court finds that Agencypad is not a joint work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Whether Agencypad Is a Collective Work\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants argue in the alternative that, even if Rapid Systems is not the sole owner of Agencypad, it does not follow that the sole owner of Agencypad is C.D.S. Inc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 17. According to defendants, that is because, Agencypad is a \"collective work\" or a \"compilation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17 \u00a7 101 (defining terms), for which a \"dominant author\" analysis does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, defendants argue, the \"Agencypad source code that is stacked on top of the database subdivides into parts,\" including the \"front-end\" or \"client-side\" source code and the \"back-end\" or \"server-side\" source code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 18. Additionally, defendants argue, the back-end source code \"subdivides into twelve modules,\" and two of these modules, \"Statements\" and \"Talent,\" are fully functioning stand-alone works authored by Rob Nagel in South Africa.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522891\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/500/#p508\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Copyright Act defines a collective work as \"a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting\n   <em>\n    separate and independent works in themselves\n   </em>\n   , are assembled into a collective whole.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The fact that defendants registered five different copyrights in Agencypad's code has little or no bearing on whether Agencypad is a collective work, absent evidence that one or more of these five portions is separate and independent from the whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    16 Casa Duse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275596\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/247/#p260\">\n    791 F.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"a director's contribution to an integrated 'work of authorship' such as a film is not\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   a 'work of authorship' subject to its own copyright protection\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, defendants point to no evidence that the front-end code and the back-end code are separate and independent, or that the back-end code and the database code are separate and independent. Indeed, the testimony of defendants' expert establishes precisely the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 604 (Lobel) (testifying that Agencypad is a stacked application). Plainly, the front-end code\n   and back-end code are not freestanding works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nor is the Talent Module a separate and independent work. Although Gugnishev testified that the module was \"[f]ully functioning to itself\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 225:1 (Gugnishev) ), defendants take this statement out of context. The Talent module was never a freestanding application, nor could it function without the other parts of Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 224 (Gugnishev) (testifying that the Talent Module \"was pieces of code that could run standalone ... but I cannot define it as a functioning application ... that module is useless without other parts of Agencypad\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As regards the Statements module, although defendants point to evidence that it\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a separate and independent work before being incorporated into Agencypad, the issue is moot as the Court finds that the Company, not Nagel or Rapid Systems, is the module's dominant author.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 183:16-17 (Gugnishev).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Agencypad (as defined in footnote 8,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8279\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/374/1/#p5\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) is an integrated work of authorship subject to a dominance analysis: its authors envisioned it as a single work, sold it as a single product, and its various components function as an interconnected whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Equitable Estoppel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, defendants argue that the Court should estop the Company from claiming ownership of Agencypad in this suit because the Company \"never claimed to own Agencypad even while Rapid Systems sold Agencypad ... and made no payment\" to the Company for those sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 20. But Rapid Systems' failure to make payments to the Company for sales of Agencypad in South Africa does not establish that the Company acquiesced in Rapid Systems' claims of ownership in Agencypad. To the contrary, the Company fired Zetler as soon as Zetler started advancing those claims in early 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Company did not seek to collect commissions on Agencypad sales in South Africa for the same reason the Company did not seek to collect commissions on CDS5 and CDS6 sales in South Africa: as a concession to Zetler who was constantly seeking to increase his share of the pie. This concession dates back to 2005, when Zetler and Marechaux explicitly agreed that Zetler could sell the Group's products in South Africa\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   paying a commission (Rapid Systems was contractually obligated under the FC to pay a commission on SARL's products). In a writing entitled \"cDs Inc-cDs Paris-cDs Cape Town financial relationship,\" Marechaux memorialized this agreement with Zetler.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated October 6, 2005, Pl. Ex. 108 (stating that \"cDs Paris is not going to charge cDs 5 commission to cDs Cape Town anymore\"); Tr. 1636:9-10 (Zetler) (conceding that Rapid Systems owed commissions on sales of CDS5 to SARL under the Franchise Contract); Tr. 1650 (Zetler) (testifying that Marechaux agreed to \"stop charging Rapid Systems\" a commission on sales of CDS5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Unsurprisingly, this understanding regarding cDs5 extended to the next two iterations: CDS6 and Agencypad (\"CDS7\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1699 (Zetler) (testifying that \"we broke each office up into being responsible for certain geographical regions\"); Tr. 1660 (Zetler) (explaining that \"CDS7\" was an early name for the online booking software). Moreover, Marechaux's failure to charge Rapid Systems for the Group's property was consistent with Marechaux's efforts to appease Zetler until the very end.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated February 2, 2016, Def. Ex. 271 (responding to Zetler's increasing demands that \"[w]e have always found a balance and agreed things together,\" offering\n   to \"review everything [again] at some point\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thus, Zetler's defense of equitable estoppel to plaintiff's ownership claim fails because Zetler was not infringing on the Company's copyright in Agencypad when he sold it in South Africa; he was selling it with permission. The Court also notes that it was plainly Rapid Systems' practice to charge the Group commissions on Rapid Systems products; the fact that Rapid Systems did not do so in the case of Agencypad suggests that Zetler was not \"ignorant of the true facts,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.

Ex. 541 (showing that CDSGLOBAL.COM was registered to \"cDs\" in Cape Town as of September 14, 2011 and that it was registered to \"CDS INC\" in New York as of August 29, 2012). Zetler claims that this change was a \"mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1868:17 (Zetler). But it was a mistake that persisted until Zetler and Marechaux's business partnership ran aground, and, during that time, the Company, not Rapid Systems, paid the corresponding domain fees to Expert Host.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the Company, not Rapid Systems, paid Rackspace for the server that hosted these emails accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1860: 10-14 (Zetler) (testifying that \"there was a reseller e-mail account, which was in the name of CDS, Inc., which CDS, Inc. was paying for\"); Def. Ex. 267. Although defendants may have owned this domain name in 2004, when Zetler transferred the registration to the Company in 2012, he transferred ownership of the domain and the corresponding information as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, when, in 2015, Zetler transferred the domain registration to his LLC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1003:6-7 (Viollon); Tr. 1868:12-17 (Zetler), and, subsequently, cut off the Company's access to the cdsglobal.com email accounts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1394:19 (Treat) (testifying that she received nothing from Zetler when she asked for,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , passcodes to the email accounts), he converted the Company's property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1862 (Zetler) (testifying that he removed the cdsglobal.com email accounts and information from the Company's account). Accordingly, the Court finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count IX for converting the Company's possessory interest in the cdsglobal.com email accounts and related information stored on the Rackspace server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Domain Names\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Zetler and the LLC wrongfully converted three domain names: creativefile.com, agencypad.com, and cdsglobal.com.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 74;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-45. Defendants do not address this issue in their briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As regards the creativefile.com domain name, Zetler registered it to \"cDs\" at Marechaux's request in January 2008, listing\n   an address in South Africa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Domain Report-CreativeFile.com dated June 23, 2017 (\"CF Report\") at 51, Def. Ex. 539. On August 16, 2012, the registrant was changed to \"cDs Inc.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. The Court finds, for reasons elaborated elsewhere in this opinion, that, it is more likely than not, that the Company began to pay for the use of this domain name at that time. Thereafter, the domain was used to host a website for a joint venture between the Company and Michael Bunker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 803-13 (Marechaux).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Zetler terminated this venture in March 2015, believing that the company should no longer do business with Bunker. Tr. 809:18-20 (Marechaux). Thereafter, sometime between April 14, 2015 and July 15, 2015, Zetler changed the registrant from \"cDs Inc.\" to \"CDS LLC.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CF Report at 21, 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between April and July, Zetler also reconstituted the venture with a new partner, Steve Ullman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Zetler argues that the \"cDs\" in the original registration referred to Rapid Systems (d/b/a cDs Capetown), that it was a mistake that the domain was registered to the Company beginning in 2012, and that he was only correcting that mistake when he transferred the registration to the LLC in 2015. This argument is not credible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The strongest supporting evidence for Zetler's contention is that the domains for various Rapid Systems products were also transferred to the Company at around the same time and that even, at one point, Lizzie Hayat, an employee of SARL, was listed as the registrant for certain Rapid Systems products like Castingpad.com.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Domain Report-CastingPad.com dated June 22, 2017 at 37, Def. Ex. 545. But it is more likely than not that these \"mistakes\" were the result of Zetler's efforts to offload onto the Company the costs of paying for Rapid Systems' domains.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2072 (Lerner) (testifying that registrations change when there is a change in billing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Regardless of who the registrant was prior to 2012, during the time that the domain was used for the joint venture it was registered to the Company and paid for by the Company. Therefore, the Company, which indisputably owned the Creative File business via a contract between the Company and Michael Bunker, owned the creativefile.com domain name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 809:13-15 (Marechaux). When Zetler changed the registration of that domain to his LLC in 2015, he improperly interfered with plaintiff's property. Therefore, the Court finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count IX for converting the domain name creativefile.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Turning to \"agencypad.com,\" Zetler registered this domain on July 18, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Domain Report-AgencyPad.com dated June 22, 2017, Def. Ex. 547. Regardless of any belief Zetler may or may not have had that he was registering this domain in his capacity as managing member of Rapid Systems, he points to no supporting evidence. As the Company owned Agencypad, the Court finds that the Company had a\n   possessory interest in this domain name, which Zetler should have registered in the Company's name in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As of September 23, 2012, the domain\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   registered in the name of the Company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48. Thus, Zetler interfered with the Company's possessory interest in this domain when he transferred the registration to his LLC in 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Accordingly, the Court finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count IX for converting the domain name agencypad.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Turning, finally, to the cdsglobal.com domain, the Court, as mentioned earlier, finds that the Company is the rightful owner of this domain. Accordingly, when Zetler transferred the registration of the domain to his LLC in 2015 without telling anyone else at the Company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2064 (Lerner) (testifying that the domain was transferred to the LLC), he interfered with the Company's possessory interest in this property. The Court therefore finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count IX for converting the cdsglobal.com domain name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Social Media Accounts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Zetler converted passwords and access codes for the Company's social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 74. Zetler does not address these accounts in his post-trial briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Here, the social media accounts were \"cDs\"-branded accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1378-9 (Treat). During his time as president of the Company, Zetler controlled access to these accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As Zetler had no right to use the \"cDs\" brand in his personal capacity, his creation of these accounts and subsequent management of them must have been either a function of his role as managing member of Rapid Systems or his role as president of the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In. Tr. 25-27 (Marechaux) (testifying that he owned the CDS Global trademark).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Rapid Systems was permitted to use the \"cDs\" brand pursuant to the terms of the Franchise Contract. This agreement clearly specifies that the brand belongs to CDS SARL, FC \u00a7 1, and it confers upon Rapid Systems the exclusive right to use the brand only in South Africa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3, 6. Rapid Systems has no right to use the brand outside of South Africa. Additionally, the marketing efforts for Agencypad were run by the Company using the social media accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In. Tr. 42:14-15 (Marechaux). Therefore, the Court finds that Zetler set up these accounts and controlled them in his capacity as president of the Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the Company had a possessory interest in these accounts, which interest Zetler interfered with when he failed to turn over passwords and administrator access codes after he was terminated as president of the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 156; Email from Treat to Zetler dated March 8, 2016, Pl. Ex. 148 (requesting \"all information regarding [ ] cDs Inc., which you as the previous president handled\"); Tr. 1394:19 (Treat) (testifying that she received \"nothing\" from Zetler in response to her Email dated March 8, 2016). Thus, the Court finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count IX for converting the three social media accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Development Tools\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Zetler converted passwords and access codes to five\n   software development tools used by the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 74. These tools are a Bitbucket source code management tool and account, a Jira development tool, an FTP account, a Microsoft SQL server, and an AP2XLS tool.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff provides little argument on this point in its brief and defendants do not mention the issue at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It is apparent from earlier proceedings in this case that Bitbucket is a service to store and manage source code.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Proposed Recommendation of Special Master Daniel Garrie, Dkt. 59. Jira is a service to track \"bugs\" in software and to manage edits to the software. Microsoft SQL is a software license that one can buy and use to operate a database server. The Amazon account houses a Microsoft SQL database server, which is used by Agencypad. An FTP account allows one to transfer files back and forth from various computers. AP2XLS tools are used to convert data from the Agencypad database into excel spreadsheets, which can be sent to clients or other individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As part of the preliminary injunction, these tools were duplicated so that the Company could continue to access and operate Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some of these tools house data regarding Agencypad, which information belongs to the Company either in its own right or on behalf of its clients. Accordingly, Zetler had no right to prevent the Company from using the Bitbucket account in so far as it included Agencypad source code and related information that he chose to house on that account during his time as president of the Company. Similarly, Zetler had no right to cut off the Company's access to Agencypad source code on the Jira development tool, the Microsoft SQL server running on the Amazon account, FTP accounts used to access Agencypad data on the Amazon account, or the AP2XLS tools used to download data from the Agencypad tables and fields. As Zetler cut off the Company's access to these tools,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1398:13-16 (Treat), the Court finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count IX for converting the Company's possessory interest in the use of these tools to access Agencypad, its source code, and its client information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     The Business Records\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Finally, plaintiff contends that Zetler wrongfully converted the Company's business records and access codes for accounts containing certain information belonging to the Company and its clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 161-63; Pl.

Mem. at 67; Compl. \u00b6 130. Specifically, plaintiff contends that Zetler, without authorization, hosted various Rapid Systems products and services on accounts with Amazon Web Services and Rackspace, which accounts belonged to, and were paid for by, the Company. Plaintiff seeks money damages (Count VII) as well as injunctive and declaratory relief regarding the Company's ownership of the Amazon and Rackspace accounts (Count VI).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123; Joint Consent Pre-Trial Order at 4, Dkt. 404 (seeking injunctive relief requiring defendants surrender all of the Company's rightful property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Zetler contends that his LLC is the rightful owner of the Amazon account, in which name the account is registered, and that Marechaux agreed that the Company would shoulder various Rapid Systems costs and expenses in lieu of paying Zetler a salary. Thus, although Zetler does not mention these data storage charges specifically in his post-trial briefing, according to Zetler all of the various charges challenged by plaintiff were part of \"an ongoing agreement to share costs between the companies, which was never reduced to writing.\" Def. Mem. at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In order to defeat liability on this claim, Zetler must show that his decision to host Rapid Systems' products and services on the Amazon and Rackspace accounts was entirely fair to the Company. In this regard, certain facts are uncontested and clearly established. For many years, Zetler housed a database called \"Portfolio\" on space leased from Rackspace and from a company called Expert Host, the leases of which his wholly-owned companies owned, controlled, and, it appears, paid for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 267. In or about 2013, when the parties began developing Agencypad, Zetler opened a new account at Amazon to house Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At all times relevant (i.e. until after Zetler was terminated as president of the Company), plaintiff, not Rapid Systems or the LLC, paid for this Amazon server space.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 992:10-14 (Viollon) (testifying that \"C.D.S.

Ex. 146 (stating his view that the Amazon account has \"always been\" a CDS LLC account), this testimony is not credible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Zetler points to no documents supporting his position that, while he was president of the Company, he was authorized to register an account that would be paid for by the Company and that would house the Company's primary asset, in effect, in his own name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In. Tr. 35 (Marechaux) (testifying that Zetler did not have permission to open the Amazon account in the name of his LLC);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   37 (Marechaux) (testifying that Zetler had no permission to transfer LLC expenses to the Company).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Moreover, when Zetler opened the Amazon Account, his colleagues believed that the\n   <em>\n    Company\n   </em>\n   owned the account, which was why the Company was paying for it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 992:12 (Viollon) (testifying that he thought C.D.S. Inc. owned the Amazon account); Email from Jerome Viollon to Bradley Zetler dated April 4, 2016, Pl. Ex. 146 (noting his understanding that, after Zetler was terminated, Zetler \"transferred accounts such as Rackspace and Amazon\" to his name from CDS Inc.). Thus, the Company, not the LLC, is the rightful owner of the Amazon account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The court turns next to the question of whether Zetler violated his fiduciary duties to the Company by hosting Rapid Systems' products and services on the Amazon account. It is undisputed that Zetler housed more than just Agencypad and its database on the account: Zetler integrated Agencypad into his existing \"Portfolio\" database and migrated that entire database including, the entire Portfoliopad product, from Rackspace to the new Amazon server. From a technical standpoint, integrating Agencypad with Portfoliopad allowed clients of both programs to access certain information used by both programs. For example, an agency's list of models could be stored once on the Amazon server and be available to the agency's users regardless of whether they were using Portfoliopad's functions to manage the model's images, or Agencypad's functions to manage the model's bookings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Although it may have been possible to house Agencypad's unique data separately from Portfoliopad's unique data, with Rapid Systems and the Company splitting the storage costs, this possibility was not addressed at trial. What we know is that the Amazon servers ended up running all of Rapid Systems' products and therefore the Company ended up paying all of the bills (i.e. the Company paid for Agencypad's and Portfoliopad's data storage costs as well as the data storage costs for several other Rapid Systems' products and services including Castingpad and Productionpad).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1860:15-19 (Zetler) (testifying that the Amazon server housed Castingpad, Portfoliopad, Productionpad, and Agencypad).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The question with respect to plaintiff's breach claim, then, is whether, by hosting the entire \"Portfolio\" database on the Company's account, Zetler improperly used the Company's funds to pay Rapid Systems' expenses and, if so, what damages are owed. Putting to one side whether Zetler met his burden to show that he disclosed all material information related to his decision to host the entire \"Portfolio\" database at the Company's expense, as regards Portfoliopad's data, even if Zetler breached his fiduciary duty by hosting it on the Company's account his affirmative defenses to this claim are sound. Treat and Gugnishev, for example, knew that Agencypad and Portfoliopad shared a database and that both were hosted on the Company's account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Treat to Zetler dated March 8, 2016, Pl. Ex 148 (stating that she is legally entitled to \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   log in and password for the [Amazon] account as an administrator\") (emphasis added); Tr. 133:3-6, 134:16-25 (Gugnishev) (testifying that Zetler decided that Agencypad would share the same database with Portfoliopad). While Marechaux may not have understood that the Amazon account was hosting Portfoliopad, he should have. Zetler had every reason to believe, based on the way these programs worked, that\n   Marechaux knew that Portfoliopad was housed on the Company's Amazon account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As regards Productionpad, Castingpad, and the other Rapid Systems' products and services on the Amazon account, Zetler failed to carry his burden to show that he disclosed that the Company was paying for these storage costs and failed to show that the Company benefited from his decision to house these programs on the Company's account. Moreover, Zetler's affirmative defenses with respect to these programs are unavailing. Although Marechaux should have known, because of the way Agencypad was designed, that it shared a database with Portfoliopad, there is no reason Marechaux would have thought that the Company was paying for other Rapid Systems' products that were not sold with Agencypad unless he had been explicitly told so. Although Zetler claims that he had permission to offload these costs on the Company, his own emails suggest he did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Bradley Zetler to Jerome Viollon dated Wednesday April 6, 2016, Pl. Ex. 146 (noting that \"you and Jerome Marechaux have been unaware that CDS INC was paying certain expenses for CDS LLC/Rapid Systems\"). Therefore, the Court finds Zetler liable on Counts VI and VII for hosting certain Rapid Systems' products and services on the Company's Amazon account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Nonetheless, plaintiff fails to marshal evidence of how much these additional services cost the Company. Plaintiff seeks either the full amount of the Amazon bill paid by the Company, $228,224.06, or, in the alternative, for Zetler to \"pay back cDs Inc. for the remaining losses.\" Pl. Mem. at 79. Thus, as plaintiff appears to concede, a substantial portion of the bill was properly paid by the Company. Additionally, plaintiff never supplied a calculation of damages pursuant to Rule 26(a) despite multiple requests from defendants. Accordingly, with respect to the Amazon account, the Court awards plaintiff declaratory and injunctive relief on Count VI, as set forth in Part IV,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , but no damages on Count VII.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Separately, plaintiff argues that Zetler breached his fiduciary duty by hosting Rapid Systems products and services on the Company's Rackspace account. Zetler, without mentioning this account in particular, argues that the Company properly paid for various Rapid Systems expenses as part of an oral agreement with Marechaux regarding cost-shifting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   By way of brief background, in or about 2011 Zetler set up an account with Rackspace known as the \"Reseller Account.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 267. The account was established in the Company's name and was used to host the cdsglobal.com email addresses as well as email accounts for modelling agency clients, which was a Rapid Systems service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At all times relevant, the Company paid the bills for the Reseller Account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1860: 10-14 (Zetler) (testifying that \"there was a reseller e-mail account, which was in the name of CDS, Inc., which CDS, Inc. was paying for\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   There is no evidence in the record supporting Zetler's contention that the Company knew that this account was hosting the email accounts for Rapid Systems' modelling\n   agency clients. Moreover, there is no business reason why the Company would need its email accounts to be hosted on the same account used to host Rapid Systems' client email business. To the contrary, the record plainly demonstrates that the Company did not know it was paying for these other email services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Bradley Zetler to Jerome Viollon dated Wednesday April 6, 2016, Pl. Ex. 146 (noting that \"you and Jerome Marechaux have been unaware that CDS INC was paying certain expenses for CDS LLC/Rapid Systems\"). Zetler fails to establish acquiescence or waiver because the Company did not even know that it was paying these expenses until after Zetler was terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds Zetler liable on Counts VI and VII for hosting Rapid Systems' email services on the Company's Rackspace account at the Company's expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Nonetheless, plaintiff fails to establish its damages. Again, plaintiff seeks the full amount the Company paid to Rackspace over the life of the account: $218,958.98. While Viollon testified that this was the sum of three separate amounts charged for three different accounts ($150,514.68; $41,315.91; and $27,128.39), the record does not reveal which of these charges was for the cdsglobal.com emails (and they may have been part of all three).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1003:21-25, 1004:1-2 (Viollon). As it surely was proper that plaintiff be charged for the cdsgloal.com emails, and plaintiff does not establish which portion of these bills were attributable to Rapid Systems expenses, the Court awards no damages on Count VII as regards the Rackspace account. The Court does, however, award declaratory and injunctive relief on Count VI as set forth in Part IV,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Invoices\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   While president of the Company, Zetler paid a variety of Rapid Systems' bills using the Company's funds.

While Marechaux and the Company were aware of these transactions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1093:13-1094:17, 1105:12-1106:14 (Viollon), they were not aware of what products they were for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Zetler to Viollon dated September 19, 2014, Def. Ex. 187 (stating that one of these charges was to pay Rob Nagel for \"development costs\"); Email from Zetler to Viollon dated November 19, 2014, Def. Ex. 191 (stating that\n   one of these charges was to pay Rob Nagel for \"development work\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Marechaux and Viollon were under the misimpression that these bills were for work relating to Agencypad or other Company business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1001:8-10, Tr. 1005 (Viollon) (testifying that he only learned later what this work was for); Tr. 1001-1002 (Viollon) (testifying that when he received the actual invoices for the sales tax audit he saw that the bills were for Rapid Systems products). Zetler did not turn over these invoices at the time, but only during an audit in November 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1852-53 (Zetler). As Zetler cannot show that he disclosed all material facts regarding these transactions and these transactions served no business purpose for the Company, he is liable on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Although some evidence suggests that the Company paid some Rapid Systems bills as part of an agreement to compensate Zetler for his efforts on behalf of the Company, Zetler has failed to establish his defenses of acquiescence, waiver, and ratification with respect to these Guava Software invoices. Importantly, the Company paid these expenses before Marechaux or Viollon knew that they were for Rapid Systems' products and services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, a few months after Marechaux and Viollon learned of their true nature, he terminated Zetler as president of the Company. Therefore, the Court finds that Zetler breached his fiduciary duty by paying these expenses with the Company's funds. Accordingly, the Court awards plaintiff money damages in the amount of $47,277.44 on this aspect of this claim. Tr. 999 (Viollon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   However, with respect to the miscellaneous expenses, which total $18,577.21, plaintiff has failed to establish that Marechaux and the Company were unaware of them at the time, or even when the bills were paid. The relevant expenses include charges to the Company's credit card at a restaurant in South Africa in the amount of $977.76, a phone purchase of $478.50, a press \"touchup\" for 1,445.88, a service called PSD2 HTML for $11,209.40, and two website-related expenses for $216 and $291.73.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1002, 1004 (Viollon). Viollon knew of these purchases around the time they were made and there is no evidence that he was under any misimpression about what they were for. Therefore, even if Zetler failed to carry his burden to show entire fairness, he prevails on his affirmative defenses on this aspects of this claim. Accordingly, the Court finds against plaintiff with regard to the miscellaneous expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Consulting Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Zetler breached his fiduciary duty to the Company by paying himself two consulting fees totaling $260,000. The first fee for $150,000 was paid on October 31, 2013. See C.D.S. Inc. Citibank Account Statement dated October 26-November 27, 2013, Pl. Ex. 163. The second fee for $110,000 was paid in March 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1138-49 (Viollon). While Zetler admitted that these fees were not for services rendered to the Company, but for equalizing income with Marechaux,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1859 (Zetler), the record is clear that Marechaux approved of these payments and waived his right to challenge them now,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated November 14, 2013, Pl. Ex. 133; Tr. 1857 (Zetler) (approving the \"150k\" payment); Tr. 1138-49 (Viollon). Thus, even if these payments were not entirely fair to the Company, Zetler prevails\n   on his affirmative defenses. Accordingly, the Court finds Zetler not liable on Count VII as regards these fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Michael Bunker Venture\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Michael Bunker is an old colleague of Marechaux's from when he was a model.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 763:18 (Marechaux). In 2013, Bunker approached Marechaux about a joint venture in the \"comp card\" business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 764:1 (Marechaux). Bunker and the Company agreed to split the profits of the venture 50-50.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 766:9 (Marechaux). Plaintiff argues, first, that Zetler improperly entered into a side project with Bunker called \"TMU\" that benefited Zetler and his companies solely,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 68; Tr. 795:7-16 (Marechaux); second, that Zetler improperly terminated the Company's joint-venture with Bunker,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 809:20 (Marechaux), because the TMU project had gone badly,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 795 (Marechaux); and third, that Zetler subsequently set up a new version of the comp card joint-venture with Steve Ullman and kept all of the profits for himself,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 810 (Marechaux); Pl. Mem. at 72. Zetler addresses this issue in one sentence in his brief, arguing that even if the relevant business opportunity in comp cards existed, plaintiff's breach claim is supported by nothing but speculation about lost profits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   First, with regard to the TMU project, Marechaux was entirely aware that Zetler set up this side venture with Bunker. Marechaux testified that he did not want the Company to be a part of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 795 (Marechaux) (\"TMU was another project that I refused to be a part of it because it was far from the core business of CDS\"). Therefore, Zetler is not liable for breach on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, with regard to the termination of the \"comp card\" joint-venture, it may be true that Zetler terminated the venture after his relationship with Bunker soured as a result of the TMU project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 795 (Marechaux) (testifying that \"the fact that Mr. Zetler got an issue with Michael Bunker [in the TMU project], it stopped everything [the comp card project]\"). But Zetler told Marechaux that the Company needed to terminate its venture with Bunker because Bunker was a liar. Plaintiff, therefore, fails to rebut the presumption that Zetler was acting in good faith when he broke off this business with Marechaux's full knowledge. Accordingly, Zetler did not breach his duties to the Company when he terminated the Company's joint-venture with Bunker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Third, with regard to the comp card venture with Steve Ullman, Zetler plainly told Marechaux that it would be done on the same terms as the Bunker venture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Zetler to Marechaux dated August 6, 2015. Pl. Ex. 29 (stating \"as we discussed a few months ago I would try to make a deal with Steve from Depicture for us to carry on the printing\" and that that \"deal is basically done on the same terms we had with Bunker\"). Under the old agreement, the Company received 50% of the proceeds,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Venture Agreement-Letter of Intent, Pl. Ex. 174, amounting to approximately $15,000 per year at the time Zetler terminated the venture,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1076 (Viollon); Email from Viollon to Zetler and Marechaux dated August 4, 2015, Pl.

But the Ullman venture was conducted to the exclusion of the Company, even though it used the Company's asset, creativefile.com,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 810-813 (Marechaux); none of the profits from the new venture were shared with the Company. Therefore, the Court finds that Zetler breached his fiduciary duty to the Company by usurping the Ullman business opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Nonetheless, plaintiff has not marshalled sufficient relevant evidence on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Plaintiff points only to \"lost profits\" from the Bunker venture, an estimate of the damages for Zetler's misappropriation of the business opportunity with Ullman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. 79. But these historical profits are wholly inapposite, as they do not establish one way or the other whether the Ullman venture generated profits. Plaintiff, here, is entitled only to damages in the amount of profits Zetler earned by misappropriating the Ullman venture. In the absence of any evidence regarding the profits Zetler earned from the Ullman venture, plaintiff cannot recover damages on this claim. However, plaintiff is entitled to equitable relief as set forth in Part IV,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Domain Ownership\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Zetler breached his fiduciary duty to the Company by secretly transferring ownership of three domain names-cdsglobal.com, creativefile.com, and agencypad.com-to his LLC while he was president of the Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 123. The evidence suggests that the Company has been paying for these domain names for years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 998 (Viollon) (testifying that the Company paid the Expert Host bills). Zetler argues,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , that he owns creativefile.com and cdsglobal.com because he originally registered both domains and because the other evidence presented at trial regarding the registrants of these names is unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

In 2015, while he was still president, Zetler transferred the registration of these domains to his LLC. He points to no evidence that he informed Marechaux of this transfer or otherwise received approval for his decision to shift the Company's assets to his LLC. Nor does he explain how his affirmative defenses apply here. Accordingly, the Court finds Zetler liable on Count VI for transferring ownership of three domain names to his LLC.

Among other things, this information was not otherwise protected under the contract and the agreement contemplates its use by defendants. Moreover, the EDA has a binding forum selection clause in favor of the French courts, requiring such disputes to be adjudicated in Paris.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11572698\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/188/38/#p44\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26 (stating that \"[a]ll disputes arising with the present Agreement shall be finally settled by the Paris Commercial Court\").

In other words, in so far as the contracts for the Agencypad/Portfoliopad bundle include specific terms regarding the use of Portfoliopad or the cost of Portfoliopad, the Court finds that Zetler\n   and the LLC are not liable on Count VIII because they used that information to sell Portfoliopad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EDA requires that this information be shared with Rapid Systems and puts no restrictions on its use by Rapid Systems following the EDA's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   As regards the use of information in the Company's contracts,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   their substantive terms including pricing, defendants are not entitled to use this information in so far as it relates to the Agencypad portion of the Agencypad/Portfoliopad bundle. Although the Company's contracts for the Agencypad/Portfoliopad bundle were provided to Rapid Systems pursuant to the EDA, the EDA says nothing about Rapid Systems' right to receive and use information regarding products other than Portfoliopad. Indeed, Rapid Systems' receipt of this information was an incidental byproduct of the Company's decision to sell Portfoliopad alongside other products in a single contract. Defendants have identified no provision of the EDA which would give Rapid Systems a right to use such superfluous information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court finds Zetler and the LLC liable on Count VIII for misappropriating the Company's trade secrets by using information in the Company's contracts not relating to Portfoliopad to sell products and services other than Portfoliopad, including Agencypad, to the Company's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Count V: Computer Fraud\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Plaintiff argues that defendants violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"), including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C), which prohibits,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , persons from accessing a protected computer or computer system without authorization (or in a way that exceeds authorized access), causing any impairment, however slight, to the integrity or availability of any data, program, information, or code on a computer or computer system, causing a loss of at least $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The relevant computers here are the Amazon and Rackspace servers hosting Agencypad and the cdsglobal.com emails.

In so far as plaintiff seeks a trust over various monies that the Court did not award plaintiff in connection with one of the first nine counts, the Court finds against plaintiff for the same reasons as stated previously. As regards the consulting fees, the Court finds that it is not unjust to permit Zetler to retain this benefit from the Company where Marechaux, the Company's only other shareholder, agreed that the Company should provide it.

By and through the relief the Court grants plaintiff in connection with the other claims in this case, Zetler will be stripped of property he stole and the property rights of the parties will be restored to what they would have been had Zetler fulfilled his obligations as the Company's president. Where the Court has not ordered monies return to plaintiff, it is either because plaintiff failed to show that Zetler was not entitled to the monies or because plaintiff failed to establish the amount of monies it was owed in damages. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Count XI as moot in so far as it overlaps with prior counts in plaintiff's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   As regards Zetler's 45 shares in the Company, in\n   <em>\n    Guth v.

As the Company, not Rapid Systems, is the sole and rightful owner of Agencypad, including the four copyrights registered by Rapid Systems in the application code,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II (A),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds the Marechaux Parties not liable with respect to the first kind of alleged infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As regards the second kind of alleged infringement, Rapid Systems' argument, briefly, is as follows: Agencypad and Portfoliopad share a database, parts of which (the shared tables) are used by both applications to store and retrieve information. These shared tables were originally developed for Portfoliopad in 2001. After Rapid Systems terminated the Company's right to sell Portfoliopad under the EDA, the Company \"unbundled\" Agencypad from Portfoliopad and continued to sell Agencypad to its clients. But even though Portfoliopad's functions were disabled, every such sale of \" 'unbundled Agencypad' was a sale of Portfoliopad\" because behind \"the Agencypad user-interface lies the machinery of Portfoliopad's database [i.e. the shared tables], without which Agencypad cannot operate.\" Def Mem. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In response, the Marechaux Parties argue that they are not liable because,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , Rapid Systems gave the Company permission to use the shared tables.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 29. The Marechaux Parties also argue that the shared tables are, at best, a \"thin\" copyright interest,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38, and that, on the facts of this case, counterclaim plaintiffs should be equitably estopped from suing for infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendants' Answer to Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff's Second Amended Counterclaims at 22, Dkt. 157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   To establish infringement, counterclaim plaintiffs must prove that (1) they hold a valid ownership interest in Portfoliopad; (2) the Marechaux Parties \"actually copied\" Portfoliopad; and (3) the Marechaux Parties' copying is illegal because a \"substantial similarity\" exists between Agencypad and the \"protectable elements\" of Portfoliopad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v.

Mem. at 21. Zetler is a sharp-elbowed businessman with a 45% interest in the Company and therefore in Agencypad. Zetler earned a lot of money from his investment in Agencypad and the development of Agencypad allowed him to shift the costs of supporting Portfoliopad onto the Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Third, although Marechaux used the word \"equal\" to describe his relationship with Zetler, the Court finds that he did not mean that the two men were equal owners but, rather, something more like peers in the overall cDs business enterprise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Marechaux to Zetler dated November 14, 2013, Pl.

You are the president, you have the complete control of the bank, the signature (I cannot access to the bank online, have no CB and its fine like that, I don't need it)\"). Indeed, Marechaux and Zetler never reached an agreement to create a global holding company because Marechaux never agreed to a 50/50 ownership split. In fact, it likely was their failure to reach such an agreement that led Marechaux and Zetler's informal \"partnership\" to collapse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 23 Email (\"... you don't want a 50/50 partnership, you want a partnership where you can do what you want, when you want and not be accountable to anyone.

Mem. at 24. As regards\n   <em>\n    sales\n   </em>\n   of the new software, all Zetler says is that \"while this lawsuit has been pending the Marechaux Parties have avoided creating evidence of significant quantities of sales of their next-generation booking application.

As a result, Zetler seeks an award of attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   But Zetler's argument blurs the question of remedy with the question of breach. The Company and SARL have always been in the same general business. Indeed, for most of its existence, the Company sold software owned by SARL. The difference between the Company and SARL is that the Company sells to the North American market and SARL sells to the European market. Thus, the relevant opportunity is software sales, not software development (which is expensive and generates no income). In so far as Zetler is arguing that assisting in SARL's development of new booking software constitutes breach, his breach claim fails because the Company has no interest or expectancy in developing new booking software. The Company already owns online booking software, Agencypad, which was enormously successful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1371:14-15 (Treat) (testifying that the Company had an 85% U.S. market share).\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   As regards the Company's interest in selling booking software to its clients and to customers in the Americas, although Zetler points to some evidence of the Company's efforts to market the new software,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Email from Riot to Treat dated July 8, 2016, Def. Ex. 279 (regarding a meeting to demo the new software for a European client); Email from Treat to Marechaux dated July 28, 2016, Def. Ex. 285 (regarding a European client); Email from Treat to Marechaux dated July 28, 2016, Def. Ex. 286 (same), he does not argue that this evidence establishes that SARL or the fiduciaries sold the new software to the Company's clients. Nor does not Zetler contest the fiduciaries' claim that the new software remains unfinished. Thus, the Court declines to speculate what SARL is going to do with the product once it is completed and whether SARL will allow the Company to sell the product in North America without paying a commission to SARL in much the same way that SARL allowed the Company to sell other products in North America over the past two decades. Accordingly, the Court finds Marechaux, Racle, Riot, Viollon, and Treat not liable on Count XII and Racle, Riot, Viollon, Treat, and SARL not liable on Count XIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Counts VIII and IX: CDS6\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Zetler claims derivatively on behalf of the Company that Marechaux, Racle, Riot, Viollon, and Treat wasted the Company's assets because, if the Company owns Agencypad, then the Company must also own CDS6 (because Gugnishev wrote both applications), and the above-mentioned individuals allowed SARL to keep all of the proceeds from sales of CDS6 in Europe (Count VIII).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Gugnishev was the primary software developer on the CDS6 upgrade; and Zetler was president of the Company at the time. Both the Company and Zetler agreed SARL would own CDS6, despite Gugnishev's role in developing it. As part of that agreement, the Company accepted over $100,000 from SARL for Gugnishev's development work and SARL did not charge the Company for commissions on sales of CDS6 in the United States (as it had not\n   charged the Company for commissions on sales of prior iterations of the CDS booking software).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email dated October 6, 2005 from Marechaux to Zetler, Pl.

SARL's ownership of CDS6 is also reflected in the end-user license agreement for the software,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 303 (Horowitz), and prior to this lawsuit, no party in this case had ever asserted that the Company owned CDS6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Zetler contends, nonetheless, that it would be inequitable if SARL owned the CDS6 upgrade but the Company owned Agencypad, as Gugnishev was employed by the Company when he made his contributions to both applications. But Zetler essentially admits that it was his understanding that Gugnishev had been \"farmed out\" to SARL for purposes of creating CDS6,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1900 (Zetler), and there is no evidence (aside from Zetler's testimony at trial) that anyone, even Zetler at the time, thought that Gugnishev had been farmed out to Rapid Systems for purposes of developing Agencypad. Accordingly, Zetler cannot now claim on behalf of the Company that the fiduciaries are liable for ceding ownership of CDS6 to SARL when Zetler himself is the one who agreed that Gugnishev would work on CDS6 for SARL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The Court further finds that the fiduciaries have not breached their duties to the Company by failing to \"assert rights over CDS6 software,\" SAAC at 38, in the period beginning on March 4, 2016 when Zetler was terminated as president and when Racle, Riot, Viollon, and Treat became fiduciaries of the Company for the first time. Among other things, were the Company to have claimed ownership of CDS6 after March 4, 2016, SARL would have had many definitive defenses including waiver, ratification, laches, and assignment.

Additionally, even if the Company currently held the copyright in CDS6, which it does not, Zetler has failed to establish an \"absence of justification\" for SARL's failure to pay commissions on its sales of the software.

Accordingly, the Court finds SARL not liable on Count IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Counts X and XI: Agencypad\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Zetler claims in the alternative and derivatively on behalf of the Company that Marechaux, Racle, Riot, Viollon, and Treat wasted the Company's assets because, if CDS Inc. owns Agencypad, it is CDS Inc.'s asset, and the above-mentioned individuals allowed SARL to keep all the proceeds from the (albeit limited) sales of Agencypad in Europe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAAC \u00b6\u00b6 300-305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   But when Zetler ran the Company, he never tried to collect commissions on sales of Agencypad in Europe, even though, at the very least, he knew that everyone else at the Company and at SARL thought that the Company owned Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1699 (Zetler) (testifying that \"we broke each office up into being responsible for certain geographical regions\"). Now, of course, Zetler claims that Rapid Systems owns Agencypad, but, when he was president, Zetler did not try to collect commissions for Rapid Systems on sales of Agencypad in Europe either. This, the Court finds, is because Zetler understood that the companies had an unwritten agreement that Rapid Systems was permitted to sell CDS5, CDS6, and Agencypad in South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia without paying a commission to SARL or the Company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=351%20N.E.2d%20721\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (testifying that \"any sales in Australia, New Zealand eventually ended up under a Rapid Systems contract\"); the Company was permitted to sell all those products in North America without paying a commission to SARL,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=351%20N.E.2d%20721\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (testifying that \"if there's any contract to be signed in North and South America, it would be signed by CDS, Inc.\"); and SARL was permitted to sell all those products in Europe without paying a commission to the Company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=351%20N.E.2d%20721\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"CDS Paris would sell in Europe, eastern Europe and Asia\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   If it was not corporate waste when Zetler declined to charge SARL a commission for Agencypad, either from the Company or from Rapid Systems, then it cannot be corporate waste now that the Company's Board has terminated him from his role as president. Moreover, the Court finds that the Company allows SARL to sell Agencypad in Europe without paying a commission as part of a larger agreement which plainly redounds to the Company's benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III (D),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   (cataloging various free services provided by SARL to the Company). Accordingly, Zetler also fails to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case of waste. Therefore, the Court finds Marechaux, Racle, Riot, Viollon, and Treat not liable on Count X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   For the same reasons, the Court further finds SARL not liable on Count XI (unjust enrichment). SAAC \u00b6\u00b6 306-310. SARL secured the right to sell Agencypad in Europe without paying a commission in exchange for valuable consideration pursuant to oral agreements between all the relevant parties prior to this lawsuit, including the right to sell CDS6 in North and South America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Count XIV: Bad Faith\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Zetler claims that Riot, Viollon, Racle, and Treat breached their duty of good faith to the Company, consciously disregarding their responsibility to the Company by deliberately promoting SARL's interests at the expense of the Company's interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAAC \u00b6\u00b6 320-322. By its plain terms, this claim relates only to the fiduciaries' alleged failure \"to take any steps to remedy Marechaux's wrongful development\n   of an online software application intended to compete with Agencypad.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 322. Thus this claim is duplicative of Counts XII and XIII and fails for the same reasons discussed in Part III (C) (among other things, Zetler has failed to show harm to the Company, he only hypothesizes potential harm).

That contract, as well as related log-in information, properly belongs to plaintiff, as it was paid for by plaintiff on the understanding that Zetler had set it up on behalf of plaintiff. Although Zetler continues to maintain that he entered into this contract on behalf of Rapid Systems, he points to no evidence that he disclosed this to his colleagues at the Company or secured permission from them to do so. As discussed previously, since Zetler paid the bills for these services with the Company's funds and put the Company's assets on the account he cannot now claim that it is Rapid Systems' or the LLC's account.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"45\">\n   <p id=\"p-279\">\n    Defendants argue that pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202202\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2202\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , after the Court has determined the parties' rights by a declaratory judgment, they are entitled to reasonable notice and a hearing before the Court issues permanent injunctive relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Letter dated March 14, 2018. The Court finds, however, that there is no such requirement in these circumstances. Among other things, plaintiff sought the instant injunctive relief in its initial complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 96 (requesting the Court order defendants to provide the Company with passwords and access codes to the Account);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202202\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202202\">\n     \u00b6 125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (requesting the Court order Zetler to provide the Company with \"all the necessary access codes, passwords, and administrative access rights to all of [the Company's] accounts as set forth above and to permanently enjoin him from exercising any administrative rights as set forth above\"). Accordingly, defendants have been on notice for nearly two years. Additionally, the Court held a hearing prior to issuing a preliminary injunction regarding the Amazon Account, and, thereafter, a three-week trial on the merits. Moreover, plaintiff is entitled to this injunctive relief in conjunction with Count VI, which does not arise under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Further still, even after the trial, the Court heard argument on this issue,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Transcript dated March 27, 2018, and permitted defendants to submit two letter briefs with accompanying factual allegations. In substance, defendants request permission to leave their information on the Amazon Account and instead remove plaintiff's information. According to defendants, this would be \"the most efficient way\" to disentangle their property from plaintiff's property. But the costliness to defendants of recognizing plaintiff's rights is of minimal importance under the circumstances. The server space, which was paid for by plaintiff prior to this lawsuit, belongs to plaintiff. It must therefore be promptly returned to plaintiff, although without prejudice to plaintiff negotiating an alternative, \"more efficient\" arrangement with defendants. As regards defendants' concerns about plaintiff interfering with their information, by and through this Order, the Court hereby prohibits plaintiff from accessing or altering defendants' information on the Amazon account, including data uploaded by Portfoliopad's users, or from interfering with defendants' ability to access that information for the limited purposes discussed herein. Unless and until the parties show otherwise, the Court views clients as the proper owners of the data they upload. Therefore, as long as clients remain under contract with defendants, their data remains properly under the control of defendants. However, if, in the coming weeks, defendants' clients decide to terminate their contracts with defendants and switch to C.D.S. Inc.'s alternative imaging software, then defendants shall not be permitted to remove those clients' data from the Amazon account. (Similarly, over the past few weeks, the Court has permitted defendants to remove data belonging to Agencypad clients from the server where clients have opted to switch to defendants' alternative booking software.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
