JORGE L. ALONSO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this diversity case, plaintiff, Sentinel Insurance Company (\"Sentinel\"), has filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a declaration that it owes no duty to defend and indemnify Walsh Construction Company (\"Walsh\") or Genesis Structures, Inc. (\"Genesis\"), for claims brought against them in a recent lawsuit stemming from the accidental death of James Quigley, an ironworker. Walsh opposes Sentinel's motion and moves for summary judgment on its counterclaim. For the following reasons, Sentinel's motion is denied and Walsh's motion is granted in part. Sentinel had a duty to defend Walsh, and because Sentinel breached its duty, it is estopped to assert policy defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Walsh served as the general contractor on a construction project (\"the Project\") that lowered the streets that intersect at South Brainerd Avenue, South Torrence Avenue, and East 130th Street in southern Chicago and simultaneously realigned and\n   raised the railroad tracks so traffic could pass beneath them. (Walsh LR 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 9, 2012, James Quigley, an ironworker for S &amp; J Construction Company, Inc. (\"S &amp; J\"), one of the subcontractors hired to perform work on the project, was crushed by a steel post that fell out of its rigging during the erection of a steel truss system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10) His estate filed suit (\"the Quigley suit\") against Central Contractors Service, Inc., the subcontractor that was operating the crane from which the truss post was suspended at the time of the accident, and Walsh on April 12, 2012, asserting three counts against Walsh: negligence under the Wrongful Death Act, 740 ILCS 180/1\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ; negligence in premises liability; and a claim under the Illinois Survival Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The estate alleged that Walsh was \"present during the course of [the] erection and construction\" during which Quigley was killed; it \"participated and coordinated in the work being done and designated various work methods, maintained and checked work progress and participated in scheduling of the work and the inspection of the work\"; it \"had the authority to stop the work, refuse the work and materials and order changes in the work\"; it \"managed, supervised and oversaw the erection of a steel bridge truss system consisting of numerous pieces of steel beams, plates and truss posts\"; it bore responsibility for \"management, supervision and oversight of the construction site and work being done thereon to prevent injury to those engaged in work upon said construction site\"; and it committed negligent acts and omissions, including failing \"to ensure the steel components of the truss system, in particular the truss posts, had erection aids or holes bored into the post for purposes of assisting in the erection of said component pieces when [Walsh] knew, or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, that these were necessary components of the truss posts for the safety of the ironworkers during the erection of the truss system\" and failing \"to coordinate with the architect and engineers of record regarding the erection aids, erection manual, erection plans or procedural outline for the erection of the various components of the bridge truss system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1-A, Quigley Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, 8, ECF No. 35-1 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Walsh tendered its defense of the Quigley suit to Old Republic Insurance Company (\"Old Republic\"), claiming coverage as an additional insured under a policy Old Republic issued to S &amp; J. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Old Republic did not immediately respond to the tender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Walsh reviewed its records pertaining to the Project and discovered that its subcontract with Genesis Structures, Inc. (\"Genesis\"), an engineering firm that had been involved in the preparation of the steel truss system, required Genesis to obtain primary and non-contributory insurance covering Walsh for\n   the Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Walsh then tendered its defense to Genesis's insurer, Sentinel Insurance Company (\"Sentinel\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sentinel issued Genesis a \"Spectrum Policy,\" which provided several different types of coverage. Under the terms of the policy's \"business liability coverage,\" Sentinel promised to (a) \"pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence\" (or accident), and (b) \"defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.\" (Compl. \u00b6 19, ECF No. 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The term, \"the insured,\" refers not only to Genesis, the policyholder identified as the \"named insured\" on the policy's declarations page (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G, Sentinel Policy, Declarations, ECF No. 1-7 at 6), but also potentially to other persons or organizations, \"when [Genesis has] agreed, in a written contract [or] written agreement[,] ... that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on [its] policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G, Business Liability Coverage Form, Part C.6., ECF No. 1-7 at 102-03.) When there is such an agreement, the policy covers the \"additional insured,\" but, as relevant here, \"only with respect to liability for bodily injury ... caused, in whole or in part, by [Genesis's] acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of those acting on [its] behalf ... in the performance of [its] ongoing operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G, Part C.6.f., ECF No. 1-7 at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted).) A general condition of the business liability coverage is that \"this insurance applies ... [s]eparately to each insured against whom a claim is made or suit is brought.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G, Liability and Medical Expenses General Conditions, Separation of Insureds, Part E.5, ECF No. 1-7 at 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Sentinel policy contains a number of provisions that exclude coverage for \"professional services\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cow.%206438\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1-E, ECF No. 35-1 at 42-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 9, 2013, in the Quigley suit, the Quigley estate filed a first amended complaint (\"FAC\"), this time naming Genesis as a defendant and asserting a negligence claim against it, and on June 4, 2013, Genesis tendered the FAC to Sentinel for defense and indemnity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) In November 2013, having received no further communication from Sentinel since the December 27, 2012 letter, Walsh filed a declaratory judgment action against Old Republic and Sentinel in the Circuit Court of Cook County, seeking to resolve the coverage issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) Walsh twice attempted\n   to effect service via the Cook County Sheriff and the Illinois Department of Insurance, but in February 2015, Sentinel filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that service was improper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The Circuit Court of Cook County granted Sentinel's motion on July 23, 2015, and Sentinel filed this action on the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Walsh and Genesis filed counterclaims. Walsh's counterclaim consists of three counts, seeking (1) a declaration that Sentinel owes it a duty to defend and indemnify for the Quigley lawsuit, and an award of costs, prejudgment interest, and other appropriate relief, (2) a declaration that Sentinel is estopped to assert policy defenses against Walsh, and an award of costs, prejudgment interest, and other appropriate relief, and (3) relief under Section 155 of the Illinois Insurance Code, which penalizes insurers for vexatious or unreasonable actions or delays in handling claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To prevail on a summary judgment motion, \"the movant [must] show[ ] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Walsh contends that the professional services exclusion does not apply and Sentinel breached its duty to defend by refusing Walsh's tender. According to Walsh, because Sentinel wrongfully denied Walsh's claim without timely seeking a declaratory judgment of no coverage, Sentinel is estopped to assert policy defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXCLUSION AND THE DUTY TO DEFEND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A commercial general liability insurer owes two essential, overarching duties to its insured: a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify. The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify because it arises when the insured faces a suit in which the complaint contains allegations falling \"within or\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   within policy coverage ... even if the allegations are groundless, false or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    Gen.

According to Sentinel, the exclusion bars Walsh's claim, even if Walsh did not perform engineering services itself, because the underlying claim against Walsh arose out of the engineering services Genesis performed and therefore fell within the PSE. According to Sentinel, the exclusion's \"any insured\" language serves to \"bar coverage for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   insureds when\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     one\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   insured commits an act falling within the policy exclusion.\" (Sentinel Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ.

These decisions reason that, when the policy contains a \"separation of insureds\" clause, which provides that the policy applies \"separately to each insured against whom a ... suit is brought,\" then the critical question in determining whether the PSE applies is not whether the underlying claim arises out of \"professional services\" performed by \"any insured,\" but whether the underlying claim or suit against the particular insured seeking coverage arises out of\n   <em>\n    that particular\n   </em>\n   insured's rendering of or failure to render professional services, regardless of whether the underlying accident arose out of another insured's professional services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Sentinel replies that these cases are either distinguishable based on the policy language, which in all but\n   <em>\n    Shorenstein\n   </em>\n   , did not include the \"by any insured\" language that the PSE in the Sentinel policy contains, or inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Thoele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526793\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/39/724/#p727\">\n    39 F.3d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that where a policy contained an exclusion barring coverage for claims arising out of the \"business pursuits\" of \"any insured,\" \"the choice of the word 'any' broadened the exclusion to include injuries triggered by one insured in connection with the business pursuit of another.\" Similarly here, according to Sentinel, the use of the phrase \"any insured\" broadens the PSE to exclude coverage for bodily injury claims against Walsh \"in connection with\" the professional services performed by Genesis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Sentinel is correct that consideration of the separation of insureds clause would not have altered the result in\n   <em>\n    Thoele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does\n   not follow that Sentinel should prevail.\n   <em>\n    Thoele\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case. In\n   <em>\n    Thoele\n   </em>\n   , the Court had \"no doubt\" that the exclusion applied because the policy specifically cited \"home day care services\" as an example of an excluded \"business pursuit,\" and the underlying harm had unquestionably arisen out of home day care services provided by an insured. But from the allegations of the complaint in the Quigley suit, it is not clear whether Quigley's accident genuinely arose out of excluded \"professional services\" such as engineering activities.

As the Court has explained, Walsh's tender of its defense to Sentinel in October 2012 triggered Sentinel's duty to defend because Walsh was at least potentially covered under Sentinel's policy based on the allegations against it in the Quigley suit. Sentinel's first action that might be construed as a step toward seeking a judicial resolution of the coverage dispute was its appearance in the coverage action Walsh filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County in January 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Walsh LR 56.1 Stmt.,\n   Ex 2, Morrissey Aff., Ex. 2-B, ECF No. 35-2 at 10-11.)

However, after the settlement of the Quigley suit, Old Republic filed a motion for leave to assert a crossclaim in this case, attaching its policy as an exhibit to the motion. Now that it has knowledge of the terms of the Old Republic policy, Sentinel seeks leave to file a supplemental brief and additional statement of facts, arguing that it never had a duty to defend Walsh because (a) by the terms of the Old Republic policy, Old Republic provided Walsh with primary insurance, (b) by its own terms, Sentinel's policy was always excess over any \"other insurance\" that might be applicable on a primary (rather than excess) basis, and (c) by the terms of its policy, Sentinel had no duty to defend when its policy was excess, so (d) Old Republic alone bore the duty to defend Walsh in the Quigley suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sentinel's motion is denied as futile. Its argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, Sentinel has not demonstrated that the Sentinel policy is excess over the Old Republic policy.

Further, the Old Republic policy contains \"additional insured\" and \"other insurance\" provisions that are materially similar to the ones in the Sentinel policy, in the sense that they provide (a) that the policy covers as an additional insured any entity for whom the named insured is required by contract to procure insurance coverage and (b) that the insurance is primary, but excess over other available primary insurance.

Critically, even if the \"other insurance\" provisions and \"excess\" clauses \"do not contain identical verbiage,\" so long as the effect of both policies is that they essentially provide primary insurance that is only excess in the event that other primary insurance is available, then the \"excess\" clauses \"are mutually repugnant and cancel each other out since the only way to give effect to one insurer's intention would be arbitrarily to read one policy's excess clause first and undermine the intention of the insurer whose policy's 'excess' insurance clause was read second.\"\n   <em>\n    Oak Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Ill.%20Dec.%201\">\n    312 Ill.Dec. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=869%20N.E.2d%20992\">\n    869 N.E.2d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sentinel points to \"excess\" and \"other insurance\" language in Old Republic's policy and baldly asserts that this language can be reconciled with the \"other insurance\" language in Sentinel's policy to provide that Sentinel's policy was excess over Old Republic's. While, as in\n   <em>\n    Oak Builders\n   </em>\n   , the \"verbiage\" of the excess clauses may not be \"identical,\" the Court fails to see any material difference in effect. It appears that both policies provided primary coverage, and therefore the insurers shared the duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Sentinel also cites Part E.2.e of its policy, the Additional Insured's Other Insurance provision, which states, \"If we cover a claim or 'suit' ... that may also be covered by other insurance available to an additional insured, such additional insured must submit such claim or 'suit' to the other insurer for defense and indemnity.\" But Sentinel does not cite the second paragraph of Part E.2.e., which states, \"However, this provision does not apply to the extent that [the named insured has] agreed in a written contract, written agreement or permit that this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional insured's own insurance.\" That is precisely what Genesis and Walsh agreed in Exhibit D of the Genesis/Walsh Subcontract. (Walsh LR 56.1 Stmt., Ex. 1-B, ECF No. 35-1 at 33.) Thus, when read in light of the terms of the relevant policies and subcontracts, Sentinel's proposed supplemental brief does not demonstrate that Sentinel had no duty to defend Walsh because it provided Walsh only with excess insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But in the end none of this makes any difference. Even if Sentinel correctly interprets the policies' \"other insurance\" provisions, it is only raising a policy defense of the sort it is estopped to assert because it breached its duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.R.

Sentinel had a duty to defend, and it was therefore required either to defend under a reservation of rights or bring a timely declaratory judgment action.

OLD REPUBLIC'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSSCLAIM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After the parties resolved the underlying Quigley suit, Old Republic moved this Court for leave to file a crossclaim against Walsh for reimbursement of amounts it contributed to Walsh's defense and settlement of the Quigley suit, in the event that Walsh prevails on its counterclaim against Sentinel. (Old Republic Mot., ECF No. 90.) Walsh opposes the motion, arguing that it will be prejudiced by Old Republic's undue delay in waiting to file its crossclaim until over two years after this lawsuit was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(g), \"[a] pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim.\" The rule does not prescribe any particular time frame for filing crossclaims, so when a party seeks to file a crossclaim at an advanced stage of the case, the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, must determine whether to allow the crossclaim by balancing competing interests and harms against one another:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Rule 13(g) does not prescribe a time limit within which a party must present a crossclaim. The decision whether to allow a crossclaim that meets the test of subdivision (g) is a matter of judicial discretion. No precise standards have been formulated.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Generally, most courts balance the interests of judicial economy and the general policy of avoiding multiple suits relating to the same events against the possibilities of prejudice or surprise to the other parties and decide the question of timeliness accordingly.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   As stated by one Pennsylvania district court judge:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   It is true, of course, that this court can and will control third-party actions and cross-claim actions in such a way that justice will be done to all the parties and the bringing of the original action to trial will not be retarded by them, but in the absence of a showing of injustice to someone or a delay of the trial, no arbitrary time limitation without an express rule of court will be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   6 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

Pa. 1963) ). In this case, balancing the general public policy in favor of judicial economy and avoiding multiple suits relating to the same events, on the one hand, against the potential for prejudice to Walsh, on the other hand, the Court concludes that concerns of judicial economy predominate over concerns of prejudice. Although the Court concludes that Sentinel breached its duty to defend and is estopped to assert coverage defenses, no award of damages or other monetary relief has been made-or indeed sought, in any specific amount. The Court fails to see why Walsh is prejudiced by the need to reduce any recovery it may obtain by any amount that may be due to Old Republic if Old Republic has paid for more than its share of its coverage obligations in this matter. Even if there is any prejudice, it is outweighed by the Court's concern for judicial economy, which is served by resolving as much of the parties' dispute as possible in this proceeding, rather than requiring Old Republic to file a separate case. Old Republic's motion for leave to file a crossclaim is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court denies Sentinel's motion for summary judgment [25] and grants in part Walsh's motion for summary judgment [31]. Walsh's motion is granted in part as to the declaratory relief requested in Counts I and II of its counterclaim. Sentinel had a duty to defend Walsh, and because Sentinel breached its duty, it is estopped to assert policy defenses. Walsh's motion is otherwise denied. Walsh's motion to strike [33] is denied. Sentinel's motion to strike [58] is denied. Sentinel's motion for leave to file a supplemental brief and additional statement of facts [94] is denied.

The motion is partially mooted by Old Republic Insurance Company's disclosure of the policy it issued to S &amp; J Construction Company, which is attached to Old Republic's motion for leave to file a cross-claim. (ECF No. 90-2.) As for the remaining paragraphs, paragraphs 8, 11, 13-15, 18, 24, and 36 of Walsh's Local Rule 56.1 Statement, the motion is denied because the facts asserted in these paragraphs are not material to the Court's decision. To the extent the Court cites these paragraphs in this Opinion, it does so only as background and additional context. The Court will disregard these paragraphs to whatever extent, if any, they contain any material fact as to which there might be a genuine dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The parties do not dispute that Illinois law applies.\n    <em>\n     Land v.

In this case, the record of proceedings in the state-court coverage action is fuzzy, and given that Sentinel opposes summary judgment on this issue, the Court must interpret the facts in the light most favorable to Sentinel, so it assumes without deciding that Sentinel's appearance in the state-court coverage action was a manifestation of Sentinel's \"desire[ for a] determination of rights under the policy.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    As stated above, Walsh's counterclaim contains a section 155 claim for unreasonable and vexatious delay, but it does not discuss this claim in its briefs, and at this stage the record does not show that Sentinel acted not only slowly but in bad faith.
