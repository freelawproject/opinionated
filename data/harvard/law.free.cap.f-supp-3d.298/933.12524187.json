BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from the circumstances surrounding the death of Daniel Antonio Ramirez (\"Mr. Ramirez\"). Plaintiffs are the parents of Mr. Ramirez. Compl. at 1. Officer Escajeda was employed as a police officer by the City of El Paso Police Department (\"EPPD\") at the time of Mr. Ramirez's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. On June 23, 2015, Mr. Ramirez's mother, Maria Ramirez, called 911 to report that her son was threatening to hang himself and needed help.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Escajeda was the first officer to respond to the call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After arriving at the house, Officer Escajeda proceeded to the backyard to look for Mr. Ramirez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After entering the backyard, Plaintiffs allege that Officer Escajeda saw that Mr. Ramirez was in the process of hanging himself from a basketball net.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Plaintiffs assert that Officer Escajeda saw Mr. Ramirez grabbing the rope with both hands and touching the ground with his tiptoes to try and save his own life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After seeing Mr. Ramirez struggling to save himself, Plaintiffs contend that Officer Escajeda deployed his taser on him, striking him in the chest and abdomen, which caused his body to go limp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After deploying the taser and watching Mr. Ramirez's body go limp, Plaintiffs aver that Officer Escajeda finally removed him from the noose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By the time Officer Escajeda removed Mr. Ramirez from the noose, other officers had arrived, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted to no avail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, Mr. Ramirez was transported to Del Sol Medical Center where efforts to resuscitate him continued, but he was eventually pronounced deceased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 22, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint before this Court alleging that Officer Escajeda and the City of El Paso are liable for the deprivation of Mr. Ramirez's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20. By their complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Officer Escajeda used excessive force against Mr.\n   Ramirez and further make six distinct allegations asserting that the City of El Paso was \"directly responsible\" for Officer Escajeda's alleged misconduct by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A) maintaining a policy or custom of excessive force by officers that is so common and widespread as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   B) maintaining a policy or custom of excessive force by officers when the officer is on notice of a victim's mental health problems that is so common and widespread as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   C) failing to properly train, supervise, or discipline members of the [EPPD], including Defendant Escajeda, not to use intermediate force, such as a taser, against an individual who does not pose a threat to the officer or others and does not display active aggression or defensive resistance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   D) failing to properly train, supervise, or discipline members of the [EPPD], including Defendant Escajeda, on mental health issues and how to properly assess the situation and take action to de-escalate the situation and bring the crisis to a non-violent conclusion where their officers have notice and knowledge that the person for whom they are called has mental health issues;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   E) failing to institute proper procedures to ensure that EPPD officers use appropriate de-escalation tactics so as to bring the crisis to a non-violent conclusion in situations in which it is known that an unarmed resident has mental health issues; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   F) failing to pursue criminal or disciplinary charges or support criminal or disciplinary action against officers, including Escajeda, who have deprived citizens and residents of El Paso of their constitutional rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Conversely, both Officer Escajeda and the City of El Paso filed Motions to Dismiss alleging that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

These six failures can be distilled down to four distinct customs or policies, which are the City of El Paso's failure to discipline officers who used excessive force against mentally ill persons, the City of El Paso's failure to train officers on how to handle mentally ill persons in crisis, the City of El Paso's failure to institute proper procedures for deescalating officer encounters with mentally ill persons in crisis, and the City of El Paso's custom of using excessive force against mentally ill persons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280394\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/559/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court will analyze each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, first, the Court will analyze the grounds upon which Plaintiffs' claims against the City of El Paso rest.

First, Plaintiffs have included a number of statistics creating a reasonable inference that a crisis intervention team could have handled the situation differently; at this stage in the litigation, this is sufficient to plausibly state causation. Second, Plaintiffs have included a number of statistics and eight similar incidents that have occurred over the past four years indicating that Chief Allen was on notice of his officers' problem with using excessive force on mentally ill persons. Thus, Chief Allen's failure to adopt a policy to attempt to rectify those issues, despite allegations that he was aware of successful policies adopted elsewhere, is sufficient for the Court to draw a reasonable inference of liability here.

Nevertheless, while the eight incidents are not factually identical to what happened to Mr. Ramirez, they all involved the alleged use of excessive force by the City of El Paso\n   against mentally ill persons in crisis.

However, the crux of Plaintiffs' claim is that Chief Allen's refusal to discipline officers acquiesced to their use of excessive force. The Court generally accepts well-pleaded facts as true, so Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged wrongful conduct on the part of the officers involved in those incidents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gines\n   </em>\n   , 699 F.3d at 816. Next, the City of El Paso argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient factual allegations to prove a pattern, El Paso Mot. at 14, but the Court has already rejected that argument in this Order. Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient factual allegations to allow the Court to draw a reasonable inference that Chief Allen had knowledge of his officers' custom of using excessive force against mentally ill persons, did not act to remedy the problem, and that inaction resulted in the alleged constitutional deprivation at issue here. Therefore, Plaintiffs have plausibly stated all three elements of a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim for excessive force.
