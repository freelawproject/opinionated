Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A. The Original Complaint and Injunction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 21, 2001, the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (\"The Tribe\") filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief (doc. #1) against the State of Texas (\"The State\") and a handful of its officials seeking injunctive and declaratory relief under the provisions of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act (\"The Restoration Act\"), the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (\"IGRA\"), and case law. Specifically, the Tribe sought injunctive relief allowing the Tribe to govern gaming activities on its Indian lands, free from interference. In the original complaint, the Tribe cited the imminent threat presented by Texas potentially interfering in the Tribe's exercise of its sovereign and statutory rights to offer certain gaming activities on Tribal lands. The Tribe also cited background information about its circumstances at the time, including a 46% unemployment rate, poor health conditions, and a median household income for the Tribe of $10,809.\n   <em>\n    See Complaint\n   </em>\n   (doc. #1), at p. 6. The Tribe stated that it is responsible for stewardship of its 4,593 acre Reservation, the external boundaries\n   of which fall within Polk County, Texas. The land lies in the Big Thicket area and is generally unsuitable for raising crops or cattle. The Tribe claims that it was wrongfully dispossessed of over two million acres of its original Reservation, but acknowledges that it was seeking a declaration of its rights only regarding the current acreage held by the United States in trust for the benefit of the Tribe. The complaint goes on to explain the background regarding the Restoration Act of 1987 and the resulting sovereign authority of federally recognized tribes to govern gaming activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By means of the Restoration Act of 1987, Indian tribes were restored to federally recognized status. Through the Restoration Act, all rights or privileges lost to the tribes under the Termination Act of 1954, codified in Title 25, United States Code, were restored to the tribes, including the tribes' authority to manage their own affairs, govern themselves, regulate internal matters and substantive law, and have territorial boundaries.\n   <em>\n    See Complaint\n   </em>\n   (doc. #1), at \u00b6 17. In this case, the Tribe avers that certain members of Congress threatened to block passage of the Restoration Act unless the Tribe agreed to language which would forever prevent it from engaging in gaming activities on its lands.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tribe claims that under duress, it was coerced into passing a tribal resolution supporting such language, which if passed into law, would have precluded gaming.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Congress passed the governing Restoration Act in 1987, and the Tribe's Resolution was incorporated into the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20737\">\n    25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (LexisNexis 2010 &amp; Supp. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaint also discussed the United States Supreme Court's decision\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California v.

In 1999, the General Council for the Tribe voted for the Tribe to offer gaming activities as a source to generate badly-needed tribal government revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The Tribe constructed and opened an Entertainment Facility for members of the Tribe's private gaming club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. The Entertainment Facility maintained a number of gaming devices, including random number generators, electronic ticket dispensers, electronic pull tabs, spinning reel slots, and video lottery devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Tribe cited a number of other gaming activities that are protected in Texas, including the State Lottery, a horse racing industry, an extensive \"slot parlor\" market, charitable carnival or casino nights, high-stakes bingo, raffles, casino cruises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The Tribe also claimed that the State had embraced a policy of \"willful blindness\" when it came to non-enforcement as thousands of \"eight-liner\" games were being used in hundreds of establishments throughout Texas, despite the State's official policy against allowing such private, non-governmental \"lottery\" games.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. The complaint notes\n   that the Texas State Lottery and Texas State Horse Racing Commission have the regulatory/discretionary authority over gambling/gaming devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. In conclusion, the Tribe filed their initial complaint seeking a declaration and injunctive relief from the court permitting it to possess authority to regulate gaming activities on its own Indian lands and to authorize and regulate forms of gaming on its own lands.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the Tribe filed the original complaint, the following course of events ensued. The State filed an answer with a competing motion for injunctive relief. The presiding judge at the time, The Honorable John Hannah, Jr., stayed the case pending a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a related case\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Texas v. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the Fifth Circuit handed down its January 17, 2002, order affirming the district court in the\n   <em>\n    Ysleta\n   </em>\n   case, the Court lifted the stay in this case. Judge Hannah then conducted a four (4) day hearing on the requested relief, and issued his findings of fact and memorandum opinion after receiving the parties' post-hearing proposed findings of fact and briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Hannah issued his ruling on June 25, 2002, in a 22-page memorandum opinion and order in which he granted relief to the State of Texas in the form of a permanent injunction (doc. #36),\n   <em>\n    Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas v. Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412008\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/208/670/#p674\">\n    208 F.Supp.2d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674 (E.D. Tex. 2002). In sum, he held that \"the Tribe should be permanently enjoined from operating its casino because (1) under the plain language of the Restoration Act, as codified in Title 25 of the United States Code, Section 737(a), and Texas law the Tribe is prohibited from conducting casino gaming and (2) the Tribe's resolution not to engage in gaming in exchange for restoration of its federal trust status was \"incorporated into the Restoration Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412008\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/208/670/#p674\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412008\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/208/670/#p674\">\n    at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He concluded that the Tribe's activities in operating the Entertainment Center (to include gaming activities) violated provisions of the Texas Penal Code which prohibit certain manners of gambling and that the Entertainment Center was a public nuisance under law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 678-79 (citing the applicable versions of TEX.

Based on this conclusion, and after weighing the appropriate factors to consider before issuing injunctive relief, Judge Hannah ordered the Tribe to cease and desist in operating its gaming and gambling activities on the Tribe's reservation which violate state law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 682.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 17, 2002, Judge Hannah entered final judgment and denied the Tribe's request to stay his ruling pending appeal (doc. #47, doc. #48). On September 11, 2002, while the appeal was pending, he also granted the State's request for an award of attorney's fees and awarded $62,828.50 in attorneys' fees and $3,816.00 in non-taxable litigation expenses to the State as the prevailing party pursuant to the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n   <em>\n    See Order\n   </em>\n   (doc. #52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 16, 2003, the Fifth Circuit issued a per curiam opinion in which a three-judge panel upheld Judge Hannah's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fifth Circuit Order (doc. #53),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Fed.%20Appx.%20525\">\n    66 Fed.Appx. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2003). The Fifth Circuit concluded that it was bound by\n   <em>\n    Ysleta I\n   </em>\n   and further noted that \"[h]owever sympathetic we may be to the Tribe's argument, we may not reconsider\n   <em>\n    Ysleta\n   </em>\n   , even if we believed that the case was wrongly decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.

The Tribe further contends that the NIGC's decision is a reasonable interpretation of IGRA and the Restoration Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10. The Tribe relatedly argues that IGRA's text and history, along with the subsequent applicable case law, support the NIGC's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16. Accordingly, the Tribe contends that the Court should defer to the NIGC's determination and dissolve the 2002 injunction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 16, 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Tribe also avers that the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ysleta I\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the issues before the Court here because it was not a decision about the text of IGRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ysleta I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531354\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1325/\">\n    36 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1329-31 ).

The contempt finding would necessarily require an evidentiary hearing about the activities at Naskila as well as any civil contempt penalties, but is dependent upon the Court's determination of the preliminary issue regarding the application of the Restoration Act versus IGRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On February 8, 2017, the parties also filed competing motions for summary judgment pursuant to an agreed briefing schedule. The State's motion for summary judgment reasserts its position that the Restoration Act applies to the Tribe, thus prohibiting gaming on the Tribe's lands.\n   <em>\n    See State's Motion for Summary Judgment of Contempt\n   </em>\n   (doc. #96), at pp. 13-14. Predicated on a finding to this effect, the State next argues that the second issue for resolution is whether the Tribe's current gaming activities violate the Texas Penal Code's prohibition on gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Tribe's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (doc. #99) again argues that IGRA, not the Restoration Act, governs the gaming activities conducted on the Tribe's land.\n   <em>\n    See Motion\n   </em>\n   (doc. #99), at p. 1. The Tribe also argues that under IGRA, state law is inapplicable to the operation of Class II gaming and that the electronic bingo games conducted at Naskila constitutes Class II gaming rather than Class III gaming, contrary to the State's contention that the Tribe is in fact conducting Class III gaming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1, 9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D. Issues for Consideration\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As referenced in the parties' briefs, the Court is tasked with determining two principal questions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, does IGRA, 25 U.S.C. 2701\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , apply to the Tribe, as the NIGC's October 2015 letter concluded, or does the Tribe's Restoration Act control,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20731\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 737, as the State argues?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, if IGRA controls, do the operations at Naskila consist of \"Class II\" gaming?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Both parties submit evidentiary support for their competing positions on the second issue-whether the Tribe is conducting Class II or Class III gaming on its lands. In the Court's view, however, this evidentiary dispute need not be reached until the Court makes its determination on whether the Restoration Act or IGRA applies. This is because, as discussed herein, the application of the Restoration Act would govern all gaming under Texas law, whether Class II or Class III, perhaps rendering moot any analysis of Class II versus Class III gaming under IGRA. The only remaining issue would be the State's request for contempt, which would require certain evidentiary findings. At the May 11, 2017, motion hearing before the undersigned, the parties agreed that the evidentiary issues regarding the State's contempt request and the classification of the gaming conducted at Naskila would be dependant on the Court's determination of the initial Restoration Act versus IGRA issue.\n   <em>\n    See Transcript of May 11, 2017, Hearing\n   </em>\n   (doc. #115), at 40:20-41:23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also indicated that they were amenable to taking up the evidentiary issues related to the State's contempt motion and the enforcement of the 2002 injunction, if necessary, at an evidentiary hearing at a later date.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20731\">\n    at 41:25-43:6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties briefed all issues thoroughly and the Court has read and considered the numerous filings in full.

However, given the procedural posture of the case and the parties' discussion on the record at the motion hearing, the undersigned finds it appropriate to focus the Court's analysis on the initial legal issue of whether the Restoration Act or IGRA applies to the Tribe's situation at hand.

The letter from the NIGC to the Tribe grounds its content in analysis of both IGRA and the Restoration Act, along with federal regulations promulgated under IGRA.\n   <em>\n    See NIGC Letter\n   </em>\n   (doc. #76-1),\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo\n   </em>\n   , at *11. The NIGC letter to the Trive interprets the Restoration Act: \"the Restoration Act must be taken into consideration as part of this ordinance review;\" \"we must first examine... whether the Tribe's Restoration Act lands are exempt from IGRA's domain.\"\n   <em>\n    See NIGC Letter\n   </em>\n   , at p. 2. Although IGRA does specifically task the NIGC with enforcing and interpreting IGRA as noted above, there is no indication\n   that Congress delegated similar authority to IGRA to do the same for the Restoration Act. The NIGC also relies on the DOI letter at issue in the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo case and notes that \"because the Tribe and Pueblo share the same Restoration Act, with nearly identical language, that same jurisdictional analysis applies to the Alabama-Coushatta's portion of the Restoration Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The NIGC letter to the Tribe further relies on the DOI letter for the conclusion that \"IGRA impliedly repeals the portions repugnant to IGRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the NIGC's opinion at issue here is dependant upon the very same analysis employed by the NIGC and the DOI in the Pueblo Tribe's case, to which Judge Cardone declined to afford\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. The Court is unpersuaded that the NIGC's opinion in this case is distinguishable to the extent that it is entitled to deference. In fact, it relies on identical analysis to that employed by the NIGC and the DOI in the Pueblo case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Like Judge Cardone, this Court \"cannot take it upon itself to assume, without any evidence, that Congress intended to entrust the NIGC with reconciling IGRA and the Restoration Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo\n   </em>\n   , at *10 (internal quotations omitted). Thus, the undersigned must also conclude that the NIGC's letter to the Tribe and findings therein do not merit\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference on this basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Judge Cardone further concluded that to the extent the Pueblo Tribe asked her to \"defer to the NIGC's...conclusion that IGRA impliedly repealed the Restoration Act, the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework remains untenable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11.

L. No. 115-90 ). No such provision delegating this broad authority to IGRA is available in the Restoration Act, and the law remains that the Restoration Act, not IGRA, applies to the Tribe. For these reasons, the Court overrules the Tribe's reliance on\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that it somehow \"rejected\" the governing law in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Tribe relatedly argues that the NIGC's opinion regarding the Tribe's gaming ordinance, along with\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brand X,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   constitute a change in controlling law which would support the Court\n   (1) giving deference to the NIGC decision and (2) dissolving the 2002 injunction. Again, this line of reasoning is flawed because it presumes that the NIGC has the authority to interpret the Restoration Act in the first place, which it does not. The Tribe has not established that Congress intended for the NIGC to interpret the Restoration Act or promulgate regulations pursuant to the Restoration Act. As discussed above, the NIGC's authority flows from IGRA, not the Restoration Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (D) The Fifth Circuit's Decision in\n   <em>\n    Ysleta I\n   </em>\n   : Binding Precedent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the Court also agrees with Judge Cardone in concluding that the undersigned is bound by the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ysleta I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit found that Congress had spoken to the issue of whether the Restoration Act or IGRA governs gaming on the Tribe's reservation because IGRA did not impliedly repeal the Restoration Act, and because the two statutes establish \"fundamentally different regimes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531354\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1325/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531354\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1325/\">\n    at 1334-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"With regard to gaming, the Restoration Act clearly is a specific statute, whereas IGRA is a general one. The former applies to two specifically named Indian tribes located in one particular state, and the latter applies to all tribes nationwide. Congress, when enacting IGRA less than one year after the Restoration Act, explicitly stated in two separate provisions of IGRA that\n   <em>\n    IGRA should be considered in light of other federal law. Congress never indicated in IGRA that it was expressly repealing the Restoration Act.\n   </em>\n   Congress also did not include in IGRA a blanket repealer clause as to other laws in conflict with IGRA. Finally, we note that in 1993, Congress expressly stated that IGRA is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   applicable to one Indian tribe in South Carolina, evidencing in our view a clear intention on Congress' part that IGRA is not to be the one and only statute addressing the subject of gaming on Indian lands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531354\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1325/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531354\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1325/\">\n    at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted; emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Thus, the Fifth Circuit identified a congressional intent that IGRA did not repeal the Restoration Act and that therefore the Restoration Act-and not IGRA-applies to the Tribe's gaming activity.\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

Concluding Statements and Order of the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Given the complex history of this matter and its importance to the Tribe, the undersigned must take the time to express the Court's understanding and sympathy for the Tribe's position. The Tribe is bearing the brunt of a conflicting statutory scheme, the result of which is arguably undesirable to its interests and, many would say, unjust. Counsel for both sides have done a thorough and excellent job in advocating for their clients and presenting the best case possible, especially given the context and the complicated historical, legal, social and economic issues at stake. The fact remains, however, that the Tribe submitted itself to the gaming laws of the State when it certified Tribal Resolution No. T.C.-86-07 in exchange for passage of the Restoration Act. This may have indeed taken effect under duress, but that issue is not up for consideration by this Court thirty years after the fact. The plain language of the Restoration Act stands, as does the Fifth Circuit's undisturbed interpretation of the application of that Act to the restoration tribes of Texas. Until Congress can be persuaded to amend or repeal the Restoration Act, the Court is obligated to abide by the plain language of the statute and the Tribe must conform to the gaming laws and regulations of Texas as provided by the Restoration Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tex. v. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=431%20Fed.%20Appx.%20326\">\n    431 Fed.Appx. 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam),\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ysleta I\n   </em>\n   , at 1335.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on the findings legal conclusions stated herein, the Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   -the State of Texas'\n   <em>\n    Amended First Motion for Contempt for Violation of the June 25, 2002, Injunction, and Alternatively for Equitable Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n   </em>\n   (doc. #74) and\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment of Contempt and to Enforce the Court's June 25, 2002, Permanent Injunction\n   </em>\n   (doc. #96) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Those motions are granted with respect to the State's request for a declaration from the Court that the Restoration Act and, consequently, Texas law, applies to the Tribe's gaming activities. At this time, the Court defers ruling on the State's other requests for relief regarding contempt findings and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that the Tribe's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Relief from Judgment\n   </em>\n   (doc. #76) and\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (doc. #99) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Having concluded that the Restoration Act applies, the Court finds it unnecessary to reach the question of whether the activities conducted at Naskila constitute Class II or Class III gaming under IGRA at this juncture. To the extent that the parties' motions seek relief on this issue, that relief is denied as moot, without prejudice to reassert. As indicated above, the Court further defers any finding on the State's contempt allegations and corresponding request for damages and fees until after\n   conducting a hearing and making proper evidentiary findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In the course of researching the Restoration Act, the Court discovered that the publishers of the United States Code Service (LexisNexis) and United States Code Annotated (West) opted to omit the statutory language of the relevant Restoration Act provisions found in Title 25 from their respective publications.
