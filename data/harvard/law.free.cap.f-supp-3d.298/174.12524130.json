With respect to the first element, Harrison has alleged that during his previous periods of incarceration, he was extremely litigious and frequently utilized BOP grievance procedures to raise the PSF and other issues. During his most recent period of incarceration, those efforts focused on his continuing effort to remove the erroneous PSF designation. Harrison alleges that in retaliation for his persistence in pursuing litigation and using the grievance process, the individual defendants slow-walked his most recent attempt to utilize the BOP grievance framework to remove that PSF, purportedly manipulating the administrative procedure in such a manner as to deny him any chance\n   at a transfer.

As noted above, Defendants' only argument with respect to that claim is that it is barred by qualified immunity. Dkt. 9 at 13-15. On the present record, the Court cannot conclude that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. They argue only that they acted reasonably in declining to transfer Harrison on April 15, 2016. Dkt. 9 at 15. In support of that contention, they provide (1) a declaration from Christina Kelley, a BOP attorney with access to records from the prison where Harrison was incarcerated, which describes what occurred during the administrative grievance process from March 14, 2016 to May 12, 2016, Dkt. 9-2 at 1-2; (2) BOP records showing the receipt of an administrative appeal from Harrison on March 14, 2016, providing a response deadline of April 23, 2016,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6; (3) BOP records showing a further appeal from Harrison on April 26, 2016, providing a response deadline of May 26, 2016,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; (4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   BOP records showing that the warden denied Harrison's March 14, 2016 appeal on April 15, 2016, Dkt. 9-3 at 2; (5) BOP records showing that a regional BOP official denied Harrison's April 26, 2016 appeal on May 12, 2016, Dkt. 9-4 at 2; and (6) a BOP program statement describing the \"Inmate Security Designation and Custody Classification\" system, which governed the application-but not removal or modification-of the PSF to Harrison's file, Dkt. 9-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the Court has explained above, however, Harrison's allegations of retaliation extend beyond the decision not to transfer him. He alleges that, among other things, delays in the initial response to his grievance were retaliatory, Dkt. 1 at 6-7 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-24), as were delays in transmitting his appeal to the warden,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Compl. \u00b6 26), and the decision by the warden's office to invoke an internal regulation allowing additional time to respond to his appeal,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30-31). The records produced by BOP regarding the processing of Harrison's\n   <em>\n    appeal\n   </em>\n   to the warden and regional BOP official are not responsive to these claims.

The alleged fraud occurred in the course of the individual defendants' recordkeeping responsibilities as prison administrators and therefore falls within the scope of their employment. The United States must, accordingly, be substituted as a defendant for any prison officials sued in their individual capacity.

Finally, the Court has now addressed in greater detail Harrison's equal protection and retaliation claims, holding that the former fails to state a claim independent from the latter and that the latter raises material issues of fact that are in dispute. The Court, accordingly, concludes that Harrison's motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Renewed Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 14, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.

First, Harrison argues that the government's reply in support of its first motion to dismiss was untimely.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934970\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/952/48/#p52\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Given the minor nature of the delay and lack of prejudice to Harrison, however, the Court rejects that argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cooper v.

Second, he opposes the government's challenge to his\n    <em>\n     in forma pauperis\n    </em>\n    status.
