Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On or about March 7, 2016, plaintiff Gerver Lopez (\"plaintiff\") commenced this action against defendant Rutgers Casualty Insurance Company (\"defendant\") in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau (\"the state court\"), seeking to convert an unsatisfied judgment entered in the state court on October 21, 2015 against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , # 1 Realty and Development, Inc. (\"# 1 Realty\"), in an action entitled\n   <em>\n    Lopez v. Coldwell Banker Meadow Realty, Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Index No 13022/2007 (\"the underlying action\"), into a judgment against defendant pursuant to New York State Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. On April 15, 2016, defendant filed a notice of removal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), removing the action to this Court on the basis that this Court has original subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) based upon the diversity\n   of citizenship of the parties. Pending before the Court is defendant's motion pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seeking summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims against it in their entirety. For the reasons set forth below, defendant's motion is granted to the extent set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Factual Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1. The Complaint\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (i) that on or about May 22, 2007, plaintiff was injured while working at premises located at 1605 Dale Avenue, East Meadow, New York (\"the Premises\"); (ii) that in the underlying action, plaintiff recovered a judgment against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , # 1 Realty; and (iii) that # 1 Realty is an additional insured under a policy of insurance issued by defendant to Cavallaro Contracting, Inc. (\"Cavallaro\"). (Def. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The Underlying Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about July 27, 2007, plaintiff commenced the underlying action against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , # 1 Realty and Cavallaro seeking to recover damages for personal injuries he allegedly sustained on May 22, 2007 when he fell from a scaffold while working at a construction project at the Premises. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By decision and order dated November 20, 2009, the state court in the underlying action found,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (i) that Cavallaro had been hired by # 1 Realty to act as the general contractor for the construction project; (ii) that on the date of the accident, plaintiff was employed by Lauterio Arevelo, a subcontractor hired by Cavallaro to do work at the Premises; and (iii) that # 1 Realty was liable to plaintiff for the injuries he sustained on May 22, 2007. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following an inquest before the state court on August 5, 2014, judgment was entered in the underlying action against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , # 1 Realty and Cavallaro in the amount of twelve million thirty-one thousand, four hundred three dollars and forty-four cents ($12,031,403.44). (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. The Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant issued Commercial General Liability insurance policy number SKP 3106931 12 to Cavallaro, effective for the period from April 29, 2007 to April 29, 2008 (\"the Policy\"), (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 11), which provided liability limits of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence and a\n   general aggregate limit of two million dollars ($2,000,000.00). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The coverage provided by the Policy is limited to individuals or entities that qualify as either an insured or an additional inured thereunder. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 12). The Policy provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION II-WHO IS AN INSURED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. If you are designated in the Declaration as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a. An individual, you and your spouse are insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of a business of which you are the sole owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   b. A partnership or joint venture, you are an insured. Your members, your partners, and their spouses are also insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of your business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   c. A limited liability company, you are an insured. Your members are also insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of your business. Your managers are insured, but only with respect to their duties as your managers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   d. An organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company, you are an insured. Your \"executive officers\" and directors are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors. Your stockholders are also insureds, but only with respect to their liability as stockholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   e. A trust, you are an insured. Your trustees are also insureds, but only with respect to their duties as trustees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. Each of the following is also an insured:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   a. Your \"volunteer workers\" only while performing duties related to the conduct of your business, or your \"employees\", other than either your \"executive officers\" (if you are an organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company) or your managers (if you are a limited liability company), but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Affidavit of Stephen A. Reilly [\"Reilly Aff.\"], Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Cavallaro is the only insured identified in the Policy itself, (Def. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 45), although plaintiff contends: (i) that a certificate of insurance names # 1 Realty as an additional named insured, (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of David M. Schwarz, Esq., in Opposition to Defendant's Motion [\"Schwarz Decl.\"], Ex. A); and (ii) that the Policy \"must be read in conjunction with\" that certificate of insurance. (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 45). Indeed, certificates of insurance, dated April 1, 2007,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , twenty-eight (28) days before the inception of the Policy, were issued by the Yvette Korell Agency, the broker for Cavallaro, that identify the Policy and indicate, in relevant part, that # 1 Realty is an additional insured thereunder. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 46). Those certificates of insurance contain the following standard language in the top right hand corner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"This certificate is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder. This certificate does not amend, extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies below.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48). Plaintiff contends, however, that that language is \"modified by law and principles of estoppel.\" (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 48). In any event, it is undisputed that # 1 Realty is not referenced anywhere in the Policy, (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 21), and that the April 1, 2007\n   certificates of insurance are the only evidence suggesting that # 1 Realty is an insured under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When the Policy was issued, it contained an endorsement, form CG 20 10 03 97, entitled \"Additional Insured-Owners, Lessees or Contractors-Scheduled Person or Organization,\" which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    Who Is An Insured (Section II)\n   </strong>\n   is amended to include as an insured the person or organization shown in the Schedule, but only with respect to liability arising out of your ongoing operations performed for that insured.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Reilly Aff., Ex. C). The Schedule contained in that endorsement is blank. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 17). The endorsement further provides that if no entry appears in the Schedule, \"information required to complete this endorsement will be shown in the Declarations as applicable to this endorsement.\" (Reilly Aff., Ex. C). The declarations of the Policy only identify Cavallaro as the insured thereunder. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A form attached to the Policy, GLDEC 0696, entitled \"Commercial General Liability Additional Coverage Declarations,\" provides additional coverage declarations information and identifies 346 Broadway, Carle Place, New York 11514, as an insured location under the Policy. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 19). However, the accident at issue in the underling action did not occur at that address; it occurred at 1605 Dale Avenue, East Meadow, New York, which is not an insured location under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Policy identifies Buckingham Badler Associates, Inc. (\"Buckingham\") as defendant's agent. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 22). The retail broker involved in the placement of the Policy was the Yvette Korell Agency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23). According to Stephen A. Reilly, who is employed by defendant as a claims examiner and is responsible for handling the claims asserted by plaintiff against defendant in this action, (Reilly Aff., \u00b6 1), the Yvette Korell Agency is not defendant's agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20). Although plaintiff \"disagrees\" and \"will contend\" that the Yvette Korell Agency was an agent of defendant, (Plf. 56.1 at p. 6 and \u00b6 24), \"by reason of apparent agency and for other reasons,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24), he cites to no admissible evidence in support of those contentions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Attached to the Policy is the following endorsement, numbered RCG 00 06, entitled \"Exclusion of Injury to Employees, Contractors and Employees of Contractors\" (\"Injury to Employees of Contractors Exclusion\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   This insurance does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I. \"bodily injury\" to any \"employee\" of any insured arising out of or in the course of: a) Employment by any insured; or b) Performing duties related to the conduct of any insured's business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   II. \"bodily injury\" to any contractor or any \"employee\" of any contractor arising out of or in the course of the rendering or performing services of any kind or nature whatsoever by such contractor or \"employee\" of such contractor for which any insured may become liable in any capacity; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   III. Any obligation of any insured to indemnify or contribute with another because of damages arising out of such \"bodily injury\"; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   IV. \"bodily injury\" sustained by the spouse, child, parent[,] brother or sister of any \"employee\" of any insured, or of a contractor, or any \"employee\" of any contractor as a consequence of any injury to any person as set forth in paragraph (i) [sic] and (ii) [sic] of this endorsement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   This exclusion applies to all claims and suits by any person or organization for damages because of such \"bodily injury\", including damages for care and loss of services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   As used herein the definition of \"employee\" includes a \"leased worker\" and a \"temporary worker\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This exclusion replaces the exclusion relating to \"bodily injury t o [sic] employees and relatives of \"employees\" [sic] contained in the Exclusions Section of the policy to which this endorsement is attached and the definition of \"employee\" in said policy[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Reilly Aff., Ex. A, RCG 00 06). However, plaintiff contends that the Injury to Employees of Contractors Exclusion \"does not apply\" and \"is irrelevant based upon the principle of law that insurance contracts are to be strictly construed against the drafter and that [sic] fact that the plaintiff was not an employee of the additional named insured # 1 Realty against which a judgment was obtained which has not been paid and which is the subject of this direct action.\" (Plf. 56.1 at 6). As set forth above, it is undisputed: (i) that one of the allegations in plaintiff's complaint is that # 1 Realty is an additional insured under the Policy, (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 25a); and (ii) that the state court in the underlying action found,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (i) that Cavallaro had been hired by # 1 Realty to act as the general contractor for the construction project; and (ii) that on the date of the accident, plaintiff was employed by Lauterio Arevelo, a subcontractor hired by Cavallaro to do work at the Premises. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 25b). It is also undisputed that plaintiff was the employee of a subcontractor hired by Cavallaro, the insured under the Policy. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Policy also contains the following provision under \"Section I-Coverages,\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Policy contains the following endorsement, CG 21 39 10 93, entitled \"Contractual Liability Limitation,\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS LIABILITY COVERAGE PART\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The definition of \"insured contract\" in the DEFINITIONS Section is replaced by the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Insured contract\" means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   a. A contract for a lease of premises. However, that portion of the contract for a lease of premises that indemnifies any person or organization for damage by fire to premises while rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner is not an \"insured contract\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   b.

Any easement or license agreement, except in connection with construction or demolition operations on or within 50 feet of a railroad;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   d.

An elevator maintenance agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (Reilly Aff., Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The work Cavallaro did for # 1 Realty was undertaken pursuant to contract, (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 29), and that contract is not an \"insured contract\" under the Policy, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30), although plaintiff contends that this fact is \"[i]rrelevant.\" (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 30). Plaintiff also claims that the fact that the Policy \"does not provide coverage for any of the contractual obligations of Cavallaro pursuant to Cavallaro's contract with # 1 Realty,\" (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 31), is \"[i]rrelevant.\" (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, the Policy contains the following provision in \"Section IV-Commercial General Liability Conditions,\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Duties In The Event Of Occurrence, Offense, Claim Or Suit\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   a.

A). Plaintiff contends that that provision is \"[i]rrelevant.\" (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Although the accident at issue in the underlying action occurred on May 22, 2007, (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 33), defendant did not receive notice of the accident or claims asserted against Cavallaro until on or about August 7, 2007, approximately seventy-seven (77) days later. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 42). Plaintiff contends, however, that the lack of timely notice is irrelevant because defendant did not disclaim coverage on that basis. (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6 34). Plaintiff also contends that the following facts, all of which are undisputed, are irrelevant because defendant did not disclaim coverage based upon a lack of timely notice, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 35-37): (i) that the \"General Liability Notice of Occurrence/Claim\" form defendant received was prepared by the Yvette Korell Agency and forwarded to Buckingham Badler Associates, Inc., (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 35); (ii) that the Yvette Korell Agency was the retail broker involved with the issuance of the Policy, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 36); and (iii) that defendant did not receive timely notice of the occurrence at issue in the underlying action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The contract between Cavallaro and # 1 Realty called for Cavallaro to act as the general contractor for the construction of a new home at the Premises. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 39). However, the Policy was issued to Cavallaro based upon the representation that the work of Cavallaro was limited to \"Carpentry-Interior Residential Including Bathrooms, Kitchens, etc.\" (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 38). If Cavallaro had disclosed to defendant that it did new home construction as a general contractor, defendant would not have issued the Policy to it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40). Plaintiff contends, however, that those facts are irrelevant since defendant did not disclaim coverage on the basis that the Policy was issued based upon a material misrepresentation of fact. (Plf. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40-41). Plaintiff refers to a \"Notice of Disclaimer\" letter, dated August 8, 2007, sent by defendant to Cavallaro which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \"...
