The January 6, 2017 Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published a report entitled \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (the \"2017 Assessment\"). The 2017 Assessment was \"drafted and coordinated\" by the CIA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It found that Russia's activity in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election was \"the new normal\" because Russia had also \"sought to influence elections across Europe.\" Plaintiff argues that this conclusion proves that the CIA \"conducted (or at least participated in) some type of assessment\" regarding Russia's attempt to influence European elections. Pl.'s Cross Mot. Summ. J. at 4. This inference is both unsupported and inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, the 2017 Assessment was based on information compiled from three intelligence agencies, so it does not definitively prove that the CIA was the agency responsible for the particular conclusion about Russia's influence on European elections. But even if the 2017 Assessment did prove that the CIA was responsible for that information, it still does not amount to a public acknowledgment that can overcome a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. This is because Plaintiff requested a\n   <em>\n    specific document\n   </em>\n   : \"a copy of the unclassified assessment or report identified in the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article.\" December 14, 2017 FOIA request. And nowhere does the 2017 Assessment acknowledge the existence of a CIA report assessing Moscow's interference in foreign elections. The only person alleged to have acknowledged the existence of that report is Congressman Mike Turner when he spoke to the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   . Needless to say, this does not constitute a public acknowledgment\n   <em>\n    by the Agency\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiffs sought\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   records pertaining to the use of drones by the CIA and the U.S. military.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the Court found that it was \"implausible that the CIA does not possess a single document on the subject of drone strikes\" given the President, CIA-director, and other administration officials' ample comments on the subject.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 429-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here Judicial Watch has not requested all documents related to a particular topic; rather, it has requested\n   <em>\n    one, particular\n   </em>\n   document. And the 2017 Assessment's brief reference to Russia's interference in European elections is not \"an agency record\" that acknowledges the existence of that particular document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Statute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Judicial Watch next points to a statute that requires the Director of National Intelligence to submit an assessment by the intelligence community to relevant congressional committees regarding the Russian Secret Service's funding of political parties and nongovernmental organizations in former Soviet states and countries since 2006 (the \"June 2016 Report\"). Pub. L. No. 114-113, \u00a7 502\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%202924\">\n    129 Stat. 2924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The statute requires that the report be submitted in unclassified form and imposes a June 2016 deadline.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%202924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, like the 2017 Assessment, the statute's requirement that the June 2016 Report be submitted to Congress cannot serve as an official acknowledgment of the specific document Plaintiff requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, like the 2017 Assessment, the June 2016 Report was compiled by the \"intelligence community\" rather than the CIA specifically. So its existence does not prove that the CIA in particular had any information relevant to Russian interference in European elections. In fact, because the June 2016 Report was submitted to Congress and not released publicly, it is unclear whether it contains\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   information about Russian interference in European elections. And it certainly does not prove that the CIA has the specific report\n   assessing Russia's interference in foreign elections referenced in the 2016\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article. Judicial Watch offers no evidence that the June 2016 Report acknowledges the existence of the specific document requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In short, while it may be that the CIA does in fact have the report referenced in the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article, the Court's inference that a record exists cannot stand in for a Plaintiff's showing of an official acknowledgement.\n   <em>\n    James Madison Project v.

Participating in intelligence community-wide assessments about related topics does not amount to a public acknowledgment that the CIA has a specific document.
