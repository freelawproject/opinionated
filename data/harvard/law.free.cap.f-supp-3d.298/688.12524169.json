(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At GFI, Plaintiff was a \"well respected, senior human resources employee responsible for managing, developing, and administering strategies for employee relations, talent acquisition, performance management, HR compliance, payroll, compensation, and benefits supporting all back and front staff in the Americas region.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Plaintiff started working at either BGC or Cantor Fitzgerald after the acquisition announcement, she met with senior personnel in the human resources group, including: (1) Lori Pennay, Cantor Fitzgerald's Global Head of Human Resources; (2) Stephen Merkel, Cantor Fitzgerald's General Counsel; (3) Dan Aiken, a Cantor Fitzgerald \"Vice President, Human Resources Generalist\" and \"Human Resources Business Partner who supported Accounting, Finance, and Operations;\" and (4) Patricia Dreste, another senior-level Cantor Fitzgerald executive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 28-35, 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiff worked closely with Pennay, who \"relied heavily on [Plaintiff] to serve in a global capacity working with other GFI Human Resources Directors in the [Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions] and Asia Regions in order to streamline ... countless global headcount reports, global payroll reports, and information on GFI's global benefits and policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) The Puente Action alleged that Cantor Fitzgerald was systematically misclassifying certain categories of employees as exempt from overtime and failing to pay these employees their overtime wages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) It also alleged that Cantor Fitzgerald was (1) systematically trying to force misclassified employees into signing a contract that would give away their rights to overtime, (2) failing to notify employees of the FLSA and NYLL overtime provisions, and (3) failing to keep adequate records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Discovery of Misclassifications\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In connection with Plaintiff's work with Pennay and Aiken, Plaintiff looked into how GFI and Cantor Fitzgerald classified employees for the purpose of overtime-i.e., exempt or non-exempt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39-40, 46-57.) For example, during a telephone call Pennay asked Plaintiff how GFI had classified employees working at its helpdesk, and Plaintiff told her that when she started working at GFI employees had been \"misclassified as exempt employees; but that, following an FLSA audit that was completed in conjunction with the guidance of the law firm Epstein, Becker &amp; Green, 'Helpdesk' employees were properly re-classified as non-exempt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) Separately, in connection with the work she was doing with Aiken, Plaintiff began \"investigating the manner in which Cantor was classifying different employees in the Operation/Accounting department\" for Aiken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the Puente Action commenced, Plaintiff helped with reviewing classes of employees at Cantor Fitzgerald to determine whether they were being misclassified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) She found that Cantor Fitzgerald was misclassifying employees in the Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and Junior Accountant departments, and as she identified the erroneous classifications, Plaintiff brought them to the attention of both Aiken and Pennay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) When she described the misclassifications to Aiken he was \"repeatedly dismissive,\" and \"deflected\" telling Plaintiff that he would raise the issue with Dreste but that he \"did not think that anything would change, as that's the way they have always been paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff also offered solutions to these issues based on her \"vast experience reviewing the employment duties of all staff at GFI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) She told Pennay of her experience \"investigat[ing] GFI's classification of other employee classes\" and informed Pennay that \"in order to remediate GFI's unlawful classification, [she] had worked with GFI's legal department to hire outside FLSA experts from [a] law firm ... to assist with her investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Plaintiff told Pennay that in addition to overseeing this audit, she managed an internal FLSA audit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pennay responded by displaying \"her apparent relief that [Plaintiff] clearly had extensive experience with FLSA legal and compliance matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Pennay also stated that she would rely on Plaintiff to conduct investigations to \"help determine ... which classifications of employees would be exempt and which would be non-exempt from mandatory overtime.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Pennay told Plaintiff that she \"had been mandated\" by Cantor Fitzgerald's CEO to \"clean up the mess right away\" and was counting on Plaintiff to help her do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.) Pennay also informed Plaintiff that she was interviewing law firms to help with the process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Cantor Fitzgerald's Response\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on her conversations with Pennay, Plaintiff continued to look into Cantor Fitzgerald's employee classifications and bring misclassifications to Pennay and Aiken's attention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    \u00b6 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) According to Plaintiff, however, Cantor Fitzgerald resisted changing the way it classified employees and continued using the same classification mechanisms without implementing Plaintiff's suggestions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 58-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In October 2015, Aiken talked to Plaintiff about a Junior GFI Accountant who was working overtime regularly, and told Plaintiff that Cantor Fitzgerald was going to change the employee's classification from non-exempt to exempt because the Finance Manager was becoming \"angry about all of [the] submitted overtime.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Aiken further stated that he would \"prepare a new offer letter for [the employee] to sign\" so that it would be \"legit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Plaintiff told Aiken that the employee was properly classified as a non-exempt employee and that Aiken should discuss this decision with Pennay and Dreste. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Aiken stated that he was \"confident\" that members of management would agree with the decision to re-classify the employee as exempt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later that month, when Plaintiff was on the phone with Pennay, she told Pennay her concerns, and although Pennay told Plaintiff she would look into it, Plaintiff did not hear back from her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   61-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February 2016, Plaintiff was directed to terminate the employment of two GFI Operations employees, Sujit Chakravarty and Kevin Mullen, because they were working too much overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) She was told to tell them that their employment was being terminated as part of a \"reduction in force\" (\"RIF\"), rather than due to overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) In conversations with Chakravarty and Mullen's managers, the managers told Plaintiff they were surprised that Chakravarty and Mullen were getting paid overtime because they thought that \"none of Cantor's Operations employees were overtime eligible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) Plaintiff informed the managers that this was not the case, and that at GFI, Operations employees similarly situated were always paid overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Despite this, both Chakravarty's and Mullen's employment was terminated, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70), and Cantor Fitzgerald started interviewing replacements for the two positions immediately following the terminations, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff was alarmed by this incident and spoke with Aiken to discuss her concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Aiken responded by telling her that \"[t]his is the way it has always been done at Cantor\" and that Operations employees were never paid overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Even after this incident, Plaintiff \"consistently expressed and voiced her concerns to multiple supervisors in human resources as well as co-workers at Cantor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) She told her supervisors that she was concerned with Cantor Fitzgerald's classification system and urged managers to adopt the method used at GFI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) \"[E]ach time [Plaintiff] raised concerns to Aiken about these matters, Aiken decided against addressing them with management.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Rather, Cantor Fitzgerald terminated employees who worked too much overtime or opposed their classification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Termination of Plaintiff's Employment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff believes as a result of her continued opposition to Cantor Fitzgerald's classification system, she was retaliated against and ultimately her employment was terminated. She did not receive a bonus in 2015, despite \"specific promises\" of a bonus and satisfying all conditions for a bonus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) On March 17, 2016, Dreste and Pennay visited Plaintiff in her office and told her that \"they were receiving pressure to cut costs in the human resources budget\" and were thus \"eliminating her role.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) At that time, they told her that she would receive her $50,000 bonus for 2015 before she left, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90), and that she should start transitioning her work to Dyanne Rosado, who would be handling Plaintiff's job responsibilities moving forward, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A few days after Plaintiff was told that her position was going to be eliminated, Cantor Fitzgerald promoted Rosado from Vice President to Senior Vice President of Human Resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.) Because of the increased work load that came with her promotion Rosado could not handle on-campus recruiting-one of the responsibilities transitioned to her from Plaintiff-and Dreste and Pennay were required to hire a recruiter to focus solely on on-campus recruiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.) Thus, Cantor Fitzgerald \"increased spending and decreased efficiencies\" by terminating Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) Further, managers at GFI did not know that Plaintiff's employment was being terminated and were \"unaware of any issues\" regarding Plaintiff's employment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 100-01), and the termination was not formally designated as a RIF, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff initiated the instant action by filing the Complaint.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7.) Specifically, Plaintiff repeatedly states that she asked to work on or was given the responsibility to investigate and report on Cantor Fitzgerald's employee classifications, and that senior-level employees were \"relying on [her] expertise in reviewing FLSA compliance\" and had asked her to \"conduct ... investigations\" into the employee classification issues. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 55-56, 58, 63.) She characterized as part of her job responsibilities a \"mandate to investigate, report and remedy Cantor's labor law violations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Although she did indicate that she spoke to Aiken and Pennay several times regarding Cantor Fitzgerald's misclassification of employees, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49, 51), she was bringing these problems to their attention as part of her \"mandate\" to look into these issues, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). Pennay and Aiken were also human resource professionals at Cantor Fitzgerald with whom Plaintiff was working on issues related the FLSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In fact, Pennay, as Global Head of Human Resources, was a senior level executive that Plaintiff characterizes as either one of her supervisors or in a supervisory role.

In this context, Plaintiff was merely investigating these violations as part of her job-an activity that was \"neither adverse to the company nor supportive of adverse rights under the statute which are asserted against the company.\"\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347217\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/1478/\">\n    94 F.3d at 1486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, as in\n   <em>\n    Rodridguez\n   </em>\n   , the Complaint does not indicate that Plaintiff \"actively assisted another employee in asserting\" claims under the FLSA or NYLL, or that she \"otherwise engaged in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by the FLSA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201875261\">\n    2014 WL 1875261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Puente Action had already been commenced before Plaintiff began investigating employee classifications, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-41), and Plaintiff merely notified her managers and/or superiors of potential violations of the FLSA after the Puente Action brought some of these purportedly problematic classifications to light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When Plaintiff was asked to terminate the employment of two Operations employees-Chakravarty and Mullen-allegedly because they were working too much overtime, she spoke to the employees' managers about how similarly situated employees at GFI were classified differently, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). Although it is unclear whether Plaintiff herself terminated the employment of Chakravarty and Mullen, it is clear that their employment was ultimately terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) There is no indication that Plaintiff stood in the way of their termination-at most, the allegations support the notion that she disagreed with the decisions of her superiors. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-70 (stating that Plaintiff was \"directed\" to terminate employees based on the fact that they \"submitted too much overtime,\" and that Cantor Fitzgerald terminated them).) There are no allegations that Plaintiff assisted these employees to assert any FLSA claims against Cantor Fitzgerald, or even that she encouraged them to file such claims on their own.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does Plaintiff claim that she reported Cantor Fitzgerald's purported FLSA violations to the\n   Department of Labor or other appropriate government authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Thus, the actions Plaintiff took at Cantor Fitzgerald were as an employee and did not assert any adverse rights. Stated differently, Plaintiff did not \"step outside ... her role of representing the company\" since she never \" 'actively assist[ed] other employees in asserting FLSA rights, or otherwise engage[d] in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodridguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201875261\">\n    2014 WL 1875261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347217\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/1478/\">\n    94 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1486 ).

In accordance with my holding below, I find that it is one's job responsibilities coupled with the actions taken by the employee related to the FLSA, and whether those job responsibilities and actions sufficiently put an employer on notice, \"in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection,\" that is the relevant inquiry.\n    <em>\n     Greathouse\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181394\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/105/\">\n     784 F.3d at 107\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Kasten\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457890,5910239\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/1/\">\n     563 U.S. at 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457890,5910239\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/1/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 1325\n    </extracted-citation>\n    );\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McKenzie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347217\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/1478/\">\n     94 F.3d at 1486-87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that the relevant inquiry is whether a plaintiff \"step[s] outside his or her role of\n    <em>\n     representing the company\n    </em>\n    and either file[s] (or threaten[s] to file) an action adverse to the employer, actively assist[s] other employees in asserting FLSA rights, or otherwise engage[s] in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by the FLSA.\" (emphasis added) ). \"Defs.'
