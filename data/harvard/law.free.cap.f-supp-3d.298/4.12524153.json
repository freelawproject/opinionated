INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Juanishia Lee, acting on behalf of her minor child, J.K., seeks an award of attorneys' fees and costs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\") for her counsel's successful representation of J.K. during administrative proceedings and in the instant litigation. Plaintiff contends that she is entitled to $103,097.75 in fees and costs. Defendant District of Columbia does not contest Plaintiff's status as a prevailing party under the IDEA or the number of hours spent by her counsel to represent J.K., but does assert that the proposed hourly rates for Plaintiff's counsel are not supported by adequate evidence and therefore are unreasonable. Defendant asks the court to award Plaintiff no more than $77,415.44 in fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After considering the parties' submissions and the relevant law, the court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney Fees. The court awards attorneys' fees and costs to Plaintiff, calculated at an hourly rate of 75% of the USAO Matrix, in the amount of $77,616.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Pl.'s Mot. at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9-1\n   at 20-21.

Mot., Ex. 4, Decl. of Charles A. Moran, ECF No. 22-6 [hereinafter Moran Decl.]; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 5, Decl. of Carolyn Houck, ECF No. 22-7 [hereinafter Houck Decl.], \u00b6 2; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 6, Decl. of Stevie Nabors, ECF No. 22-8 [hereinafter Nabors Decl.]. From the lawyers' billing records, it appears that Houck primarily represented J.K. in the administrative proceedings and that Moran and Nabors represented J.K. only in the federal court litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 2, ECF No. 22-4 [hereinafter Houck Billing Invoice]; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 3, ECF No. 22-5 [hereinafter Moran Billing Invoice]. Plaintiff seeks an hourly rate of $504 for Houck, $568 for Moran, and $315 for Nabors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868028,7414415\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/1101/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These rates align with the rates for lawyers of comparable years of experience as reflected in the United States Attorney's Office (\"USAO\") Attorney's Fees Matrix [hereinafter \"the USAO Matrix\"].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 7, ECF No. 22-9 [hereinafter USAO Matrix].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant makes two basic objections to the fees sought by Plaintiff, although the two merge into one. First, Defendant argues that \"the proposed hourly rates for Plaintiff's attorney are unreasonable and Plaintiff offers an insufficient factual basis to support these rates.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant proposes that Plaintiff's attorneys' hourly rates should not exceed 75% of the USAO Matrix rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Second, Defendant asserts that \"Plaintiff's invoice has a number of [travel] entries which are not reimbursable under the IDEA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. But that contention actually is no more than a plea that the court apply the 75% hourly rate to the allowable fees for counsel's travel time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. So, the court considers the two issues in tandem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To be reasonable, an IDEA fee award must be based on \"rates prevailing in the community in which the action or\n   proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(C). \"Whether an hourly rate is reasonable turns on three sub-elements: (1) 'the attorney['s] billing practices,' (2) 'the attorney['s] skill, experience, and reputation' and (3) 'the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.' \"\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277058,6785367\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/97/\">\n    793 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Covington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868028,7414415\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/1101/\">\n    57 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1107 ).

Houck says only that she \"match[es] [her] hourly rates to those in what is known as the [USAO] attorney's fees matrix.\" Houck Decl. \u00b6 4. Presumably that is Houck's practice in IDEA cases, but she does not say so specifically. Moreover, assuming she is referring to IDEA representations, Houck does not say whether her practice of tying her rate to the USAO Matrix is only for contingency fee clients or all clients, including those who pay their way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moran's and Nabors' declarations are only slightly more detailed. Moran explains that his firm's billing practice since 2014 has been to adjust rates according to various fee matrices. Moran Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 23. Before January 1, 2014, the firm pegged its rates to the USAO's\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix, but after that date set them according to the Legal Services Index-based\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. After the Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   , however, Moran says that his firm switched back to the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix to \"ensure that our fees were based on 'rates prevailing in the community.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(C) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nabors Decl. \u00b6 4.

Like Houck, neither lawyer details whether their firm uses the USAO Matrix rates for hourly-paying IDEA clients. Although Nabors attests that, in 2017, he \"ha[s] been paid [USAO Matrix] rates by clients on matters concerning\n   education law, employment law, and labor rights,\" Nabors Decl. \u00b6 6, that statement does not distinguish between judicial fee awards and hourly-paying IDEA clients. Thus, the court has no evidence before it that any of Plaintiff's counsel charge, and receive from, their hourly-paying IDEA clients the USAO Matrix rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In summary, Plaintiff's counsel attest to aligning their rates with the USAO Matrix in IDEA cases, but offer no more specifics about their billing practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

On this factor, the evidence is limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Other than reciting her educational background, Houck says nothing about her experience in IDEA cases. Houck Decl. \u00b6 5. She does not disclose, for instance, the number of years she has worked on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia, the percentage of her practice devoted to IDEA cases, nor the percentage of her IDEA practice that is paid clients versus contingency-fee cases. In short, the court knows little about Houck's \"skill, experience, and reputation\" other than her educational background and that she successfully represented J.K. in his administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court knows even less about Nabors. His declaration contains no information about his education or his experience or practice with regard to IDEA cases. The most the court can decipher about Nabors is that he successfully represented J.K. in this case, he has been with Moran &amp; Associates since at least 2014, and he likely has done some IDEA work in the District of Columbia from 2014 until the present. Nabors Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff offers more substantive information about Moran. Moran has been a member of the District of Columbia bar since 1968 and has practiced in the field of \"special education law\" for approximately 25 years, \"especially\" on matters brought under the IDEA. Moran Decl. \u00b6 5. It is also apparent that Moran has significant experience with the D.C. Attorney General's office in litigating IDEA cases in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At bottom, Plaintiff has offered some evidence about her lawyers' skill, experience, and reputation, but she unquestionably could have presented more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Prevailing Market Rate in the Community\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Last, but far from least, the court arrives at the contentious issue of the prevailing market rate for similar services in the community.

In\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit explained that litigants have relied on \"two separate, but inter-related,\n   approaches to providing evidence of prevailing market rate.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, a litigant can show that IDEA litigation \"fall[s] within the bounds\" of \"complex federal litigation\" and therefore the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix-now the USAO Matrix,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 5-presumptively sets forth the prevailing market rate for IDEA representation.\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 521, 524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, if an IDEA practitioner shows that IDEA litigation qualifies as \"complex federal litigation,\" then absent compelling contrary evidence, the USAO Matrix rates will be deemed reasonable. Alternatively, a fee applicant can \"establish the prevailing market rate by providing evidence of the fees charged, and received, by IDEA litigators.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, the Circuit has said that this second way of establishing the prevailing market rate \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   conceptually linked to the\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, in the absence of a finding that IDEA cases command the same rates as complex federal litigation, the \"\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix rates are\n   <em>\n    irrelevant\n   </em>\n   to the prevailing-rate determination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275666,4279781\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/112/\">\n    792 F.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Brown, J., concurring)). So, according to\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , if a litigant is intent on seeking a fee using the USAO Matrix, she must show that IDEA cases are complex federal litigation, but if the litigant fails to do so, she still may succeed by offering proof of the prevailing market rate that is independent of the USAO Matrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Perhaps because she does not cite\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has not taken either of these two paths. First, although two Circuit judges have expressed their view that IDEA cases categorically are complex federal litigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tatel, J., concurring);\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277058,6785367\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/97/\">\n    793 F.3d at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kavanaugh, J., concurring), the law of the Circuit requires fees applicants to demonstrate complexity on a case-by-case basis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the court was not \"rul[ing] out the possibility that future fee applicants may be able to demonstrate that IDEA cases are 'complex federal litigation,' \" but adding that \"[i]t will not be easy\"). Here, Plaintiff has not offered\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence to show that IDEA cases \"fall within the bounds\" of \"complex federal litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Houck Decl.; Moran Decl.; Nabors Decl. Moreover, while some judges in this District have applied the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix in the \"unusual case\" where the applicant is able to show that\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   particular case is \"unusually complex,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

All Plaintiff provides is a brief synopsis of this case's procedural history and its outcomes, without more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 3-4. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not shown that the USAO Matrix rates presumptively apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having failed to establish that IDEA litigation qualifies as complex federal litigation, Plaintiff's remaining option is to demonstrate the prevailing market rate based on \"the fees charged, and received, by IDEA litigators.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . None of the evidence that Plaintiff relies upon, however, accomplishes that task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Starting with Plaintiff's counsel's declarations, each lawyer says that he or she now charges the USAO Matrix rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Houck Decl. \u00b6 4; Moran Decl. \u00b6 24; Nabors Decl. \u00b6 5. Moran and Nabors add that their firm's managing partner has twice surveyed fellow IDEA practitioners and they too charge rates consistent with the USAO Matrices. Moran Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nabors \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. But after\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   those representations carry little weight absent a showing that IDEA litigation is complex. Additionally, the survey results noted by Moran and Nabors are too indefinite, as their representations lack any supporting\n   details about the rates IDEA practitioners actually charge and receive. Plaintiff's counsel's declarations therefore do not aid her cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, Plaintiff points to the market survey conducted by Dr. Laura Malowane in the\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   case post-remand. Dr. Malowane made two relevant findings. First, based on a review of 77 IDEA cases decided within a five-year period in this District Court, she found that the court awarded fees at or below the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix rates or not at all in 93% of those cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Stmt. at 3, 5-6; Malowane Decl. \u00b6 62. Second, using a 2014 national billing rate survey as her starting point, Dr. Malowane determined that the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix was in line with or even exceeded the median rates in the District of Columbia market for \"federal litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Stmt. at 9-13; Malowane Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-25. Neither of those conclusions, however, helps Plaintiff in this case. Although Dr. Malowane's case survey showed that courts in this District typically award fees in IDEA cases at or below the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix, more than three quarters of those cases involved fee awards\n   <em>\n    below\n   </em>\n   the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Malowane Decl., Ex. 7. Thus, Dr. Malowane's case survey actually undermines Plaintiff's position that the full USAO Matrix reflects the prevailing market rate in IDEA cases. Additionally, Dr. Malowane's observation that the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix is in line with \"federal litigation\" rates in the District of Columbia carries little weight because Dr. Malowane's methodology involved equating \"federal litigation\" with a catch-all \"other litigation\" category used in the survey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Malowane Decl. at 8 n.8. The prevailing rate in the District of Columbia for a generic \"other litigation\" category tells the court nothing about the prevailing rate specific to IDEA cases in this jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff cites post-\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   cases in this District granting full USAO Matrix rates, but none are persuasive. In each of those cases, courts relied in large part on affidavits from IDEA practitioners to establish the prevailing market rate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wimbish v.

More importantly, the probative value of the other-practitioner declarations in the cited cases is questionable in light of\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   .

Finally, Plaintiff's reliance on recent decisions awarding full USAO Matrix rates is offset by Dr. Malowane's survey showing that a significant majority of cases have awarded below the full USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix rates in IDEA cases. As one judge of this District Court recently observed: \"[B]ased on recent case law from this district, the 'prevailing rate' for IDEA fee awards in this community seems to be seventy-five percent of\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264854\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/131/#p143\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in the end, having done little more than show that her lawyers' practice is to harmonize their rates to the USAO Matrix, the court concludes that Plaintiff has not established the prevailing market rate for IDEA cases in the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In summary, having considered the evidence submitted by Plaintiff concerning her (1) attorneys' billing practices; (2) their skill, experience, and reputation; and (3) the prevailing market rates for IDEA representation in the District of Columbia, the court finds that Plaintiff has not carried her burden to show the reasonableness of the hourly rates she requests. Having failed to establish that the full USAO Matrix rates are reasonable, the court will award fees in this case at 75% of the USAO Matrix rate, as the Circuit affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 523, 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
