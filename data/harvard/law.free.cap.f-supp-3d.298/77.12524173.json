COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Ronald Lee Blake, Jr. brings this action under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution against the Federal Bureau of Investigation for declining to hire him because of two state felony convictions that had been pardoned and expunged from his record. Because neither the Full Faith and Credit\n   Clause nor its implementing statutes provide a private right of action, Blake has not stated a valid claim. The Court will therefore grant the FBI's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court, as it must, accepts as true the following facts drawn from Mr. Blake's complaint. In 1992, Blake pled guilty to two armed robbery offenses in Indiana state court. Compl. at 1; Opp'n Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1. After completing his sentence, he went on to graduate from Indiana University and the Quinnipiac University School of Law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The sole basis for suit identified in Blake's complaint is the Full Faith and\n   Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution. In moving to dismiss, the FBI principally argues that the Clause does not create a private right of action, which is a prerequisite for stating a valid claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P 12(b)(6) ;\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414062\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/678/#p682\">\n    327 U.S. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414062\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/678/#p682\">\n    66 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees. As the Supreme Court held over 100 years ago, the Clause\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   only prescribes a rule by which courts, Federal and state, are to be guided when a question arises in the progress of a pending suit as to the faith and credit to be given by the court to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of a state other than that in which the court is sitting . . . [A]nd to invoke the rule which it prescribes does not make a case arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v. N.
