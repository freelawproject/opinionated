In the first and second causes of action, they assert\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims alleging defendants routinely place juveniles in solitary confinement and then deny them access to educational opportunities in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (the proposed \"juvenile class\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In plaintiffs' third cause of action, they assert a claim under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\") alleging a subclass of juveniles placed in solitary confinement are being denied the special education and related support services to which they are entitled under the statute (the proposed \"IDEA subclass\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In plaintiffs' fourth and fifth causes of action, they assert claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\") alleging a separate subclass of qualifying juveniles are being denied access to certain programs, services, and benefits without first receiving the individualized assessment mandated by these federal laws (the proposed \"disability subclass\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 23. Plaintiffs have also moved for a preliminary injunction under Rule 65. Defendants oppose both requests. The parties have exchanged limited discovery on an expedited basis and the motions were fully briefed in advance of oral argument, which was heard on March 23, 2018 in Utica, New York. Decision was reserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs have submitted declarations and other evidence in support of their request for class certification,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cotter Class Cert. Decl. (detailing supporting submissions), and in support of their motion for preliminary injunctive relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cotter Prelim. Inj. Decl. (same); Weisman Decl. (including supporting exhibits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In opposition, defendants have submitted selected records from current or former members of the proposed juvenile class,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Behnke Class Cert. Aff. (detailing submissions), information about proposed regulatory changes, Behnke Prelim. Inj. Decl. Ex. A, reports from the New York State Commission of Correction and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, Behnke Prelim. Inj. Decl. Exs. B &amp; C, and a series of two- and three-page affidavits from Broome County Jail staff members Sean Bell, James Borchardt, Marcus DeAngelo, Jeff Katen, Jason Kirk, Dennis Rowe, Daniel Snyder, Jennifer Vasquez, and Adam Wilcox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   All of these materials have been considered and the particularly relevant portions will be summarized below. Notably, however, neither party has sought an evidentiary hearing in connection with either of plaintiffs' motions, and an independent review of the submissions has not revealed any genuine disputes over the facts essential to resolve the pending requests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Matter of Defend H2O v. Town Bd. of the Town of E. Hampton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270535\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/80/#p96\">\n    147 F.Supp.3d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96-97 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (discussing circumstances where an evidentiary hearing on a preliminary injunction may prove unnecessary). Accordingly, while disputes over certain factual matters remain outstanding, their resolution is unnecessary at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Broome County Jail\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Broome County Jail is a 563-bed correctional facility located in Dickinson, New York that houses pre-trial detainees, convicted individuals serving sentences, and technical parole violators. The Jail primarily holds an adult inmate population. However, the facility is also used to house juveniles, many of whom suffer from mental health or intellectual disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Generally speaking, juveniles being held at the Broome County Jail are housed in their own pod (\"F-Pod\"), where they are permitted outside their cells for about 12 hours a day for recreation, showers, library use, class time, and other programming. The average length of time a juvenile spends at the Jail is 37 days, and the vast majority of the juveniles held at the Jail are pre-trial detainees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Solitary Confinement at the Jail\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants' policies contemplate several different forms of disciplinary isolation or segregation: (1) \"informal discipline,\" where an inmate waives the right to a hearing and simply accepts the corrections officer's proposed sanction, which is usually a 24-hour period of confinement in a cell; (2) \"administrative segregation,\" where an inmate is confined to their cell or to the Secure Housing Unit (\"SHU\") for up to 15 business days pending a disciplinary hearing; (3) \"protective custody,\" a form of administrative segregation that can exceed the 15-day limit; and (4) \"disciplinary segregation\" or \"keep-lock,\" an additional period of lock-in or SHU time imposed as a punitive measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In each instance, the inmate is confined to a sparsely furnished cell measuring about 8 by 10 feet for approximately 23 hours a day. Plaintiffs contend these measures are routinely imposed by Broome County Jail staff on members of the proposed juvenile class regardless of mental health history and even for minor misbehavior, such as horseplay, engaging in a water fight, tossing paper into a waste basket, or failing to clean their cell to a guard's satisfaction. Plaintiffs assert that once a juvenile is placed in any of these forms of solitary confinement, defendants deny them access to education or special education instruction and related support services in violation of state and federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition, plaintiffs contend the Broome County Jail's practices and policies fail to distinguish between adults and juveniles, between pre-trial detainees and post-conviction prisoners, or even between normal juveniles and those with mental or intellectual disabilities. As a result, juveniles at the Jail often come in visual or physical contact with members of the adult inmate population, who among other things have been known to try to attack them, to throw urine at them, and to shout threatening messages to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Andrea Weisman, Ph.D\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In support of their request for preliminary relief, plaintiffs have submitted a detailed declaration from Andrea Weisman,\n   Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist. Dr. Weisman visited the Broome County Jail, interviewed two of the five juveniles being held there at the time of her visit, reviewed the Jail's written policies, examined the records of various juveniles who were held at the facility, and interviewed various members of the Jail staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dr. Weisman opines in relevant part that \"the policies and practices guiding the placement of youth in solitary confinement are extraordinarily harsh and are extremely damaging to youth so confined\" and concludes that defendants' \"adherence to these policies place all juveniles who are, or will be, incarcerated at the Jail at substantial risk of serious harm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Opposition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants' submissions can be divided into three categories: (1) an explanation of the salient features of a proposed amendment to state corrections law; (2) reports from supervisory or accrediting bodies; and (3) a series of short affidavits from Broome County Jail staff members offering context for defendants' penological decision-making vis-\u00e0-vis certain juveniles who have submitted declarations in support of plaintiffs' pending requests for relief or who are otherwise involved in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Proposed Regulatory Amendment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On November 1, 2017, the New York State Commission of Corrections proposed certain amendments to the current regulations \"regarding inmate cell confinement and essential services deprivation.\" According to defendants, these proposed changes will \"require any disciplinary or administratively segregated inmate who is under eighteen years of age [to be] allowed out of their cell for a minimum of four hours per day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under the proposal, this four-hour requirement is not in stone but rather may be denied to a juvenile any time the \"chief administrative officer determines that [ ] denial is necessary to preserve the safety, security or good order of the facility.\" The proposed changes will provide for weekly review of this kind of denial, which must also be memorialized in writing and maintained in a centralized database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition, the proposed regulations permit facility staff to restrict or even deny educational services to juveniles provided that the denial is reviewed by the chief administrative officer \"within one school day and every school day thereafter while such restriction or denial is in effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Reports from Supervisory or Accrediting Bodies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants submitted two reports in an attempt to rebut certain of plaintiffs' claims. First, defendants submitted a February 14, 2018 New York State Commission of Correction Report entitled \"The Worst Offenders.\" As defendants explain, this report does not include the Broome County Jail even though Dr. Weisman opined in her report that the Jail was \"the worst facility she has seen in her thirty years.\" Second, defendants submitted a September 25, 2017 accreditation report from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (\"NCCHC\"). According to defendants, this submission establishes that the Broome County Jail is in compliance with NCCHC standards for \"restraint and seclusion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Affidavits from Broome County Jail Staff\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Sean Bell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Officer Bell states that he currently works in D-pod, the SHU. He asserts that inmates in the SHU \"are able to exercise and jog around the perimeter of the yard.\" In addition, Officer Bell explains SHU inmates\n   have access to legal papers and a bible during the first 24 hours in the SHU. After that, they are \"permitted three books and three magazines in their cells.\" These inmates also have \"daily access to three newspapers\" if they want to read them. According to Officer Bell, he passes the newspapers \"from cell to cell each day so any inmate who signs up for a paper has the opportunity to read it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Officer Bell denies ever assaulting any inmates or witnessing any corrections officer assault any inmate in his presence. To the contrary, Officer Bell claims that A.T., one of the named plaintiffs, \"would target any new person\" in SHU and has previously assaulted another inmate. According to Officer Bell, he also observed D.K., another juvenile, \"throw urine through the window of an adult's cell in F-pod\" while the adult inmate was asleep. Officer Bell states that he did not observe any adult inmates harassing any juveniles, and opines that juveniles \"were more likely\" to harass the adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     James Borchardt\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Officer Borchardt is the Inmate Grievance Coordinator at the Broome County Jail. He explains that inmates are free to file grievances and appeal any decisions he makes, but asserts that \"[n]o juvenile inmates have filed a grievance regarding the issues raised in this litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     Marcus DeAngelo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In his affidavit, Officer DeAngelo explains that he penalized C.J., a juvenile inmate, with \"seven day keeplock\" after he refused to \"stand for a count.\" According to Officer DeAngelo, C.J. claimed he was going to the bathroom but \"was observed sitting on the toilet with his pants up.\" Officer DeAngelo explains that C.J. was also uncooperative on other occasions \"during the count.\" Further, Officer DeAngelo denies ever observing C.J. talking to himself or asking for help with his worksheets. Finally, Officer DeAngelo asserts that he never witnessed any inmates \"spying on the juveniles in the shower.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.\n    <em>\n     Jeff Katen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Officer Katen's affidavit confirms Officer Bell's claim that an inmate is not permitted to have anything other than legal materials and religious belongings during the first 24 hours they spend in SHU. Officer Katen also recounts an incident with D.K., who was placed in keeplock because \"he informed the staff his listed birth date was wrong.\" According to Officer Katen, staff placed D.K. in keeplock so they could investigate this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Jason Kirk\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Officer Kirk recounts an instance in which he was present for a \"shakedown\" in F-pod. According to him, O.C., a juvenile, was restrained because he refused to \"put his head down\" and became argumentative. Officer Kirk states that named plaintiffs A.T. and B.C. were \"given multiple chances ... to comply with facility rules\" but repeatedly violated them. Like Officer DeAngelo, Officer Kirk denies being informed \"of any complaints that the adults were watching the juveniles in the shower.\" Officer Kirk also denies ever observing any adults throwing urine or feces on the cell walls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    vi.\n    <em>\n     Dennis Rowe\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Like Officer Kirk, Sergeant Rowe recalls the \"shakedown\" where O.C. refused to comply, but adds to it by denying that Jail staff \"slammed\" O.C.'s head on the floor. As with Officer Bell, Sergeant Rowe opines that the juveniles are the instigators of any harassment involving the adults. Finally, Sergeant Rowe denies hearing any complaints about adult inmates watching juveniles in the showers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    vii.\n    <em>\n     Daniel Snyder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Officer Snyder offers information about the discrepancy with D.K.'s date of birth described in Officer Katen's affidavit. According to Officer Snyder, he was instructed to lock D.K. in his cell until they could confirm his date of birth-it took seven days of keeplock to confirm that D.K. was, in fact, correct about his own date of birth. Nevertheless, Officer Snyder explains that this was necessary for D.K.'s protection and for the protection of other inmates. Finally, Officer Snyder denies ever observing any adults threatening juveniles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    viii.\n    <em>\n     Jennifer Vasquez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Officer Vasquez recounts an incident on November 23, 2016 with O.C., who \"persistently continued to make noise and was screaming\" between the hours of one and two in the morning. Officer Vasquez concluded that O.C. \"was being intentionally disruptive and seeking a physical altercation with an officer.\" After O.C. refused to comply with various commands, staff removed him from F-pod.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    ix.\n    <em>\n     Adam Wilcox\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Officer Wilcox's familiarity with the \"shakedown\" of O.C. comes through his review of incident reports. According to Officer Wilcox, staff needed to control O.C.'s head for his own protection and for the protection of other corrections officers. Officer Wilcox, like several other officers, denies ever observing any adults \"spying on the showers.\" In addition, Officer Wilcox explains that inmates are only \"shackled in the recreation yard\" if they are \"a threat to themselves or another inmate or officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The fact pattern and procedural posture presented in this case are remarkably similar to a matter addressed just last year in\n   <em>\n    V.W. v. Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268112\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/554/\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   \"). There, the named plaintiffs were juveniles who sought relief on behalf of themselves and a proposed class of minor detainees suffering virtually identical treatment at the hands of Onondaga County officials. After plaintiffs' requests for class certification and preliminary injunctive relief were granted, the parties entered into an interim agreement before negotiating the terms of a final class action settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The parties to the present case are well familiar with\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs' counsel in this action successfully litigated the\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   matter, and they have relied heavily on the reasoning and conclusions set forth in\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   in making the requests for class certification and preliminary injunctive relief that are under consideration now. At oral argument, defendants were tasked with articulating how the facts of this case could be understood to give rise to the kind of meaningful distinctions that might ultimately warrant a series of legal conclusions different from those reached in\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   . Defendants struggled to do so, and for good reason: a careful review of the parties' submissions makes it clear that justice is best served by treading\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   's path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Class Certification\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to certify (1) a class composed of \"[a]ll 16- and 17-year-olds who are now or will be incarcerated at the Broome County Correctional Facility\"; (2) a subclass of \"[a]ll 16- and 17-year-olds with disabilities, as defined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, who are now or will be incarcerated at the Broome County Correctional Facility, who are in need of special education and related services\"; and (3) a subclass of \"[a]ll 16- and 17-year-olds with psychiatric and/or intellectual disabilities, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section\n   504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, who are now or will be incarcerated at the Broome County Correctional Facility, who are at risk of being placed in disciplinary segregation because of their disability.\" Pls.'

Pls.' Reply Mem. at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs clearly have the better of this argument. They are correct that in circumstances such as these, courts routinely certify\n   classes that encompass not only those members who have actually been subjected to a challenged policy or practice but also to similarly situated individuals at reasonably foreseeable risk of facing the same fate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268112\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/554/\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (certifying class of all juveniles held at the facility now or in the future);\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Cal. 2015) (certifying class of all inmates held at the facility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Various contextual factors also point toward the appropriateness of certification. For instance, plaintiffs' proposed class includes all future juveniles who will be detained at the Broome County Jail, precisely the sort of revolving population that often makes joinder of individual members impracticable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clarkson v.

But nothing about that fact would bear on the issue of whether it was the worst facility plaintiffs' expert psychologist has ever seen in her many years of professional practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Finally, and relatedly, defendants' submissions seek to establish a variety of minor factual disputes surrounding the imposition of various forms of confinement on various juveniles at various times. But as discussed at the outset, any such disagreements are immaterial to the question presented at this juncture; i.e., whether plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on their claim that the Jail's widespread, excessive usage of solitary confinement on juveniles is unconstitutional. In sum, defendants' arguments are insufficient to undermine plaintiffs' clear and persuasive showing on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Fourteenth Amendment Due Process &amp; the IDEA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \"In a \u00a7 1983 suit brought to enforce procedural due process rights, a court must determine (1) whether a property interest is implicated, and, if it is, (2) what process is due before the plaintiff may be deprived of that interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Singh v.
