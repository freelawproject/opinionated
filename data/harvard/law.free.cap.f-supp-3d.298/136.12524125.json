MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n   This case involves a uniquely Washingtonian question: when can a federal employee act in the place of an absent agency or unit head? This issue becomes acute during presidential transitions, when thousands of senior political appointees exit the government, often leaving their positions vacant for months or even years. Congress addressed this question through the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (\"FVRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203345\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and federal agencies have also developed complicated succession and delegation regulations. As a result, it turns out that, in practice, there are very few duties that cannot be delegated to an \"acting\" officeholder, the second-in-command (the \"first assistant\" to use the FVRA's term), or even another official who acts in the place of the principal pursuant to agency regulations or orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Here, Stand Up for California!, Patty Johnson, Joe Teixeira, and Lynn Wheat (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") challenge the decision of the United States Department of the Interior, its Secretary of the Interior and Acting Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs in their official capacities, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (collectively, \"Federal Defendants\" or the \"Department\") to acquire land in trust for the Wilton Rancheria Tribe of California (\"Wilton Rancheria\" or the \"Tribe\"). The Plaintiffs allege that in delegating to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs and the Special Assistant to the Director of the BIA the authority to act in the place of the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, the Department violated its own regulations and the FVRA. This Court granted the Wilton Rancheria's motion to intervene. Minute Order, Feb. 24, 2017. Now pending before the Court are the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and the Department's and Wilton Rancheria's (collectively, the \"Defendants\") cross-motions for summary judgment. As jurisdiction and venue is proper in this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, related legal memoranda in opposition and in support, the parties' representations at oral argument, and the entire record, I find that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the actions taken by Department employees in lieu of the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (a vacant office at the time) were not in violation of departmental regulations or the FVRA. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment will be denied, and the Defendants' cross-motions for summary judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mot. for Summary J. and in Supp. of Wilton Rancheria, California's Cross-Mot. for Summary J. (\"Tribe's Cross-Mot. for Summary J.\") 5, ECF No. 41. In 2013, the Tribe applied for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") to acquire land in trust on its behalf, identifying a 282-acre parcel near Galt, California as the proposed site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

As the Plaintiffs understood for the significant majority of the years-long process that the land to be acquired was in Galt, not Elk Grove, the Plaintiffs immediately sought to delay the acquisition of title to the Elk Grove land by making several requests to the Secretary of the Interior (\"Secretary\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203345\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But of course the AS-IA himself does not personally inform the applicant of his decision, publish a notice of the decision in the Federal Register, or acquire the land in trust.

Surely no one would contend that a fee-to-trust decision would be void if some administrator rather than the AS-IA himself published the requisite notice in the Federal Register or if the BIA acquired the land in trust at the direction of the AS-IA. If these administrative tasks-which by the strict language of the regulation are assigned to the AS-IA-can be delegated to others, then it is hard to see why the Department cannot also re-delegate other responsibilities of the AS-IA that are discussed in the same subsection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <em>\n     Third\n    </em>\n    , while there do not appear to be any cases directly addressing the issue of whether the authority to issue final fee-to-trust decisions is exclusive, delegation case law more broadly is consistent with the AS-IA's authority being delegable in this instance.

Here, the Secretary's 2013 rulemaking expressed no similar intent. To start, the statute in\n    <em>\n     Giordano\n    </em>\n    generally served to restrict an action, whereas Section 151.12 and its subsection (c) do not share the same overall goal to restrict. Rather than a prohibitive regulation, Section 151.12 is procedural in nature, describing how fee-to-trust application requests are actioned and setting forth the effects of those actions. Further, the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Giordano\n    </em>\n    extensively analyzed the statute's legislative history and identified specific instances where Congress intended \"the authority to apply for court orders [ ] to be narrowly confined but also declare[d] that it is to be limited to those responsive to the political process.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84471\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/505/#p513\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84471\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/505/#p513\">\n     at 520\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84471\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/505/#p513\">\n     94 S.Ct. 1820\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, not only is there a fundamental difference in the nature of the regulation, but the Secretary's commentary around the rulemaking did not explicitly or implicitly approach the topic of delegation, much less display an intent that final fee-to-trust decisions should be an exclusive power. And, as explained above, Section 151.12 is neither a delegation regulation, nor can any of the Secretary's comments in promulgating the rulemaking be construed as such.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84471\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/505/#p513\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The \"affirmative evidence of a contrary [ ] intent\" is not present.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     U.S. Telecom Ass'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722988,9285325\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/554/\">\n     359 F.3d at 565\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Second Circuit in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The significance that Plaintiffs ascribe to the 2013 modifications is prejudiced by their overemphasis on the finality/non-finality of the action. As previously explained, the overall purpose of the 2013 revisions focused on which trust decisions are subject to judicial review, and when they become so subject. This necessarily implicates finality insofar as that only final decisions are immediately reviewable, but the greater context of the 2013 revisions indicates that the Secretary sought to clarify the applicable procedures and timelines for challenging agency action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C928\">\n     78 Fed. Reg. at 67,929\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To that end, the revisions added subsections (c) and (d), deleted a 30-day waiting period for final decisions, required BIA officials' decisions to be published, and reiterated that BIA officials' decisions must be internally administratively appealed before becoming judicially reviewable.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C928\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C928\">\n     at 67,929-67,930\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This broader context shows an emphasis on a decision's impact on the procedures to follow after a decision is rendered. Thus, while Plaintiffs stress that the final nature of the decision informs who should be making the decision (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , only the Secretary or the AS-IA), the opposite is true: Section 151.12 clarifies that it is the decision-maker (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the Secretary, his authorized\n    representative, the AS-IA, an individual acting for the AS-IA under delegated authority, or a BIA official) who drives whether the decision is final. When appropriately understood in this light, Section 151.12(c)'s phrase \"[AS-IA] pursuant to delegated authority\" works to clarify that decisions made by the AS-IA, or those that have properly stepped into his shoes, are final, but that decisions made at the BIA-level are not. Consequently, the 2013 revisions do not evidence intent to make the authority exclusive, and the Plaintiffs' use of interpretive canons does not prove otherwise.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Understanding the \"[AS-IA] pursuant to delegated authority\" as someone who is properly carrying out the AS-IA's delegated authority further comports with the background and purpose of the 2013 amendments, and particularly the acknowledgement that the \"vast majority of trust acquisition decisions are delegated to and issued by BIA officials.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C928\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C928\">\n     at 67,929\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

As the Plaintiffs themselves recognize, in Section 8.1, the AS-IA is delegated the authority to \"exercise all of the authority of the Secretary,\" with one limitation not relevant here. Department Manual 209 DM 8 \u00a7 8.1; Pls.' Mem. for Summary J. 16. Chapter 8 also describes the role and duties of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, who, \"[i]n the absence of [the AS-IA] ...may exercise the authority delegated in [Section 8.1 to the AS-IA],\" with one limitation not relevant here.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20151.12\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; Department Manual 209 DM 8 \u00a7 8.4(B).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    On January 19, 2017, Mr. Roberts' term as the Acting Secretary pursuant to the FVRA had expired, and he was the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. The AS-IA position remained vacant, with no acting or confirmed officer in the role. Thus, Mr. Roberts, as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, was authorized to exercise the AS-IA's non-exclusive authority, including the authority to make final fee-to-trust\n    decisions. The Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are mistaken. The Plaintiffs primarily challenge the Department Manual as incapable of \"displac[ing] the contrary provisions of Section 151.12(c),\" which the Plaintiffs proffered as mandating final fee-to-trust decisions only to the Secretary or AS-IA. Pls.' Mem. for Summary J. 17.

Neither section is applicable here, as Mr. Roberts, in his role as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, stepped into the shoes of the AS-IA to exercise the AS-IA's non-exclusive authority to make final fee-to-trust decisions. As this authority is clear from the Department Manual, I need not consider whether the Deputy Secretary's letter of January 19, 2017 independently authorized Mr. Roberts' actions.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Pls.'
