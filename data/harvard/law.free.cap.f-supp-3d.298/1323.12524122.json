The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since September 25, 2012, the application date ( 20 CFR 416.971\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2.

After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 416.967(b), i.e., lift/carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, stand/walk for six out of eight hours, and sit for six out of eight hours, except the claimant should avoid concentrated exposure to hazards and not climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds.

Dr. Stricker prescribed long-term antibiotic treatment with Amoxicillin for plaintiff's Lyme disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently was seen by Dr. John Bakos. Dr. Bakos treated plaintiff for chronic pain, including back, neck, joint, and \"overall body\" pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 536-52, 561-66. In addition to chronic pain syndrome, Dr. Bakos diagnosed plaintiff with migraines, insomnia, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 532, 550, 552.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After the administrative hearing, the ALJ served interrogatories on Dr. Don Clark, a non-examining physician who reviewed plaintiff's medical records.

None of the physical examinations report synovitis of the joints which is characteristic of chronic Lyme disease. A recent study shows that chronic fatigue occurs in only about 3% of chronic Lyme disease patients. Antibiotic treatment does not seem to have changed symptoms. I am unable to make the diagnosis of Lyme disease. The electrocardiogram (2F) is normal and I don't find any cardiac complications of Lyme disease.

She noted that plaintiff's treatment records show a \"history of Lyme disease,\" but concluded that the impairment, as well as other impairments, \"caused only transient and mild symptoms and limitations,\" were well controlled, persisted for less than a year, or were otherwise not adequately supported by medical evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specific to plaintiff's history of Lyme disease, the ALJ stated that \"later records do not confirm [Lyme disease,] so [it is] not currently medically determinable from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ALJ further addressed evidence of Lyme disease in her step-four finding in\n   relation to weighing the medical opinion evidence.

The ALJ noted that Dr. Clark is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and is qualified to render a medical opinion on plaintiff's impairments, including Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also repeated Dr. Clark's findings that there was no evidence of cardiac complications from Lyme disease or synovitis of the joint, and that lab results alone could not support a diagnosis of Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. The ALJ then provided the following discussion regarding Dr. Stricker's diagnosis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   While Dr. Clark found that antibiotics did not seem to change her symptoms, it was noted that she was post Lyme disease, which indicates resolution but it is not clear to what this resolution should be credited. Nonetheless, Dr. Clark was unable to make a diagnosis of Lyme disease for these reasons. This weakens Dr. Stricker's diagnosis based solely on lab results. Although treatment with antibiotics is consistent with Lyme disease, there are minimal records from Dr. Stricker and they indicate improvement by July 2013 [sic].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The ALJ also relied on her finding that Lyme disease was not a medical determinable impairment to discount Dr. Bakos's treating opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.

The ALJ explicitly noted that Dr. Clark was a board certified internist and qualified to render an opinion, but failed to acknowledge that Dr. Stricker is a hematologist. Aside from his status as a treating physician, Dr. Stricker's specialty entitles his opinion to greater weight.\n   <em>\n    Smolen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7643067\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/1273/#p1290\">\n    80 F.3d at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he opinions of a specialist about medical issues related to his or her specialization\n   are given more weight than the opinion of a non specialist.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Lastly, plaintiff argues that the ALJ's conclusion that her Lyme disease did not cause functional limitations is based on an erroneous finding that her Lyme disease had resolved by July 2014. ECF No. 20-1 at 43-44. Plaintiff claims that the ALJ's finding that her Lyme disease had resolved is due to misinterpretation of a treatment note's reference to \"post Lyme disease.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7643067\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/1273/#p1290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff contends that statement \"post Lyme disease\" does not establish that her symptoms have resolve. Rather, she contends that it is shorthand for \"post Lyme disease syndrome,\" which is used to refer to patients that continue to experience symptoms after completing treatment for Lyme disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In her decision, the ALJ found that by July 2014, plaintiff was considered \"post lyme disease.\" AR 19. The treatment note referenced by the ALJ provides that plaintiff's medical conditions include chronic pain, anxiety, \"post Lyme disease,\" and 7 months pregnant. AR 561. The ALJ interpreted the statement to mean that plaintiff either no longer had Lyme disease or no longer had any symptoms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (evidence of record \"suggesting resolved Lyme disease\" (\"it was noted that she was post Lyme disease, which indicates resolution....\"), 21 (\"treatment notes are limited and indicated the claimant's Lyme disease resolved).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although the ALJ's interpretation of phrase \"post Lyme disease\" superficially appears reasonable, other evidence contradicts the ALJ's reading of the treatment note. According to the Center for Disease Control, physicians describe patients who have non-specific symptoms-including fatigue, pain, and joint and muscle aches-after treatment as having \"post treatment Lyme disease syndrome\" or \"post Lyme disease syndrome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   With that knowledge in mind, the appropriate interpretation of the July 2014 treatment note is that plaintiff was diagnosed with post Lyme disease syndrome. This is especially true considering plaintiff's symptoms, which included fatigue, muscle weakness, and muscle and joint pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 541-42 (severe fatigue, no energy, joint pain); 545-47 (back, neck, and joint pain); 549-50 (fatigue, muscle weakness, and back, neck, and joint pain). Such symptoms are consistent with post Lyme disease syndrome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   More significantly, the ALJ's interpretation is not plausible in light of other medical records. The July 2014 treatment record noting \"post lyme disease\" is from Dr. Bakos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 561. The following month, Dr. Bakos completed a Medical Source Statement, which reflects a diagnosis of Lyme disease as well as significant limitations resulting from the disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 532-35. It cannot reasonably be concluded that Dr. Bakos found that plaintiff's Lyme disease was resolved in July, but resulted in debilitating impairments the following month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, the ALJ's finding that plaintiff's Lyme disease was resolved, and thus not a severe impairment, is not supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the ALJ's error is not harmless. In assessing the medical opinion evidence, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Bakos and Dr.\n   Stricker's opinions deserved less weight than Dr. Clark's because their opinions are not consistent with the entire medical record. AR 21. But to support that finding, the ALJ consistently noted that plaintiff's Lyme disease had resolved and medical records reflected \"normal to mild sings on physical examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. As just discussed, substantial evidence does not support the ALJ finding and plaintiff's Lyme disease resolved and medical records reflect severe symptoms consistent with Lyme disease.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 541-42; 545-47; 549-50; 570; 575; 582.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206074119\">\n    2013 WL 6074119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 n.6 (\"Lyme disease can cause long-term symptoms such as loss of muscle tone on one or both sides of the face, severe headaches and neck stiffness due to meningitis, shooting pains, heart palpitations and dizziness, pain that moves from joint to joint, numbness and tingling in the hands or feet with concentration or short term memory.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In assessing plaintiff's ability to work, the ALJ was required to consider all impairments.\n   <em>\n    Smolen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7643067\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/1273/#p1290\">\n    80 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
