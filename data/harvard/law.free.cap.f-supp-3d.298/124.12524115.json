On February 2, 2018, this Court granted a partial Motion for Summary Judgment in favor of Defendants FBI and Department of Justice, holding that the Government was not required to disclose the Memos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cable News Network, Inc. v.

With that revelation, the \"Comey Memos\" entered the American lexicon and, subsequently, this Court's docket. Five Plaintiffs submitted FOIA requests to the FBI and/or DOJ seeking the Memos. In addition, USA Today and Freedom Watch sought other records related to the former Director. USA Today requested from both the FBI and DOJ \"[a]ny records reflecting discussions\" between Comey and FBI or DOJ staff regarding the Comey Memos.\n   <em>\n    Gannett Satellite Info. Network, LLC v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-1175, ECF No. 9 (Amended Complaint), \u00b6 27.

Defendants and the Court have construed that latter request to include (1) the Comey Memos themselves; (2) other records that relate to the Memos; and (3) any Comey-penned memoranda or related documents concerning Obama, the Clintons, or Flynn. The Government denied all of Plaintiffs' requests, claiming that release of any responsive documents would interfere with the Special Counsel's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Undeterred, Plaintiffs separately brought suit, which the Court consolidated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of July 26, 2017.
