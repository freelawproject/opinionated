(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs maintain that from January 1, 2012 through February 29, 2016, Defendant underpaid and failed to pay for emergency and other health care services that Plaintiffs provided to Defendants' commercial health plan members (\"CP Members\") and MA health plan members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 32.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Such billing manipulation allegedly resulted in reduction of payments for the actual services provided by Plaintiffs to Defendant's CP Members and MA Members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 33) Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant \"failed to properly pay Plaintiffs for the inpatient services rendered to Defendants' health plan members at the appropriate inpatient rates\" and that \"Defendants were improperly recouping their payments for Plaintiffs' services in breach of the aforementioned contracts.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action on May 25, 2016 (Doc. No. 1) and filed the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") on August 32, 2016 (Doc. No. 19). The FAC contains the following six claims: (1) breach of written contract; (2) breach of oral contract; (3) breach of implied-in-fact contract; (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (5) negligent misrepresentation; and (6) violation of California Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200. (FAC at 9-14.) On September 14, 2016, Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss the FAC (Doc. No. 22), which the Court granted on November 4, 2016 (Doc. No. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff filed their Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") on November 18, 2016, re-alleging the same claims as those contained in the FAC. (Doc. No. 31.) On December 2, 2016, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the SAC, which the Court\n   granted on January 27, 2017 (Doc. No. 43). In its Order, the Court, the Hon. Beverly Reid O'Connell presiding, found that Plaintiffs' MA claims arose under the Medicare Act, and that the Court could only exercise jurisdiction over the MA claims if Plaintiffs adequately pleaded exhaustion of the Medicare Act's requirements. (Doc. No. 43 at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff filed their Third Amended Complaint (\"TAC\") on February 13, 2017, re-alleging the following claims: (1) breach of oral contract; (2) breach of implied-in-fact contract; (3) negligent misrepresentation; and (4) violation of the UCL. (Doc. No. 45.) On February 27, 2017, Defendant moved to dismiss the negligent misrepresentation claim in the TAC, which the Court granted on April 7, 2017 (Doc. No. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On December 18, 2018, the parties filed a Stipulation for Leave to File a Fourth Amended Complaint. (Doc. No. 78.) In the Stipulation, Plaintiffs indicated that new evidence demonstrates their claims are not subject to an exhaustion requirement under Medicare laws or regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Court approved the Stipulation on January 10, 2018, and as a result, the 4AC was deemed filed as of January 8, 2018. (Doc. No. 81.) Plaintiffs add the allegation that they \"have appealed the claims and either exhausted their administrative remedies (if any), or Defendants have refused to act on appeals, making the process futile\" (4AC \u00b6 35), and assert the following claims in the 4AC: (1) breach of written contract; (2) breach of oral contract; (3) breach of implied-in-fact contract; (4) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (5) violation of the UCL.

Cal. Nov. 4, 2016).) Defendants argue that all of Plaintiffs' claims in the 4AC are likewise inextricably intertwined with a claim for Medicare Benefits, and therefore, are preempted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) Plaintiffs raise one main point in their Opposition-they contend that because neither the Act nor CMS regulations \"set[ ] the standards for payment terms and disputes [between MAOs and contracted providers], state law applies.\" (Doc. No. 84 at 17.) \"Since there are no administrative remedies available to contracted providers to address disputes over payment under their contracts,\" and \"if state law does not apply, then Humana can breach its contracts with providers with impunity because\n   <em>\n    providers will have no avenue to address any such breach\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court again agrees with Defendant's position that Plaintiffs' claims are \"inextricably intertwined\" with claims for Medicare benefits, thus arise under the Medicare Act, and are subject to preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/#p614\">\n    466 U.S. at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/#p614\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). This conclusion is not altered by Plaintiffs' additional allegations regarding the futility of administrative exhaustion, as state law claims are not the proper mechanism by which to obtain relief for their Medicare claims. The weight of controlling authority-most notably the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Uhm v. Humana Health Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782925\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/1134/#p1148\">\n    620 F.3d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2010) and the district courts that have interpreted and applied\n   <em>\n    Uhm\n   </em>\n   -support Defendants' position. The authorities cited by Plaintiffs are either outdated, inapplicable, or non-binding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Uhm\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found that state law claims similar to those raised by Plaintiffs here were preempted by the Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782925\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/1134/#p1148\">\n    620 F.3d at 1148-1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Uhm\n   </em>\n   panel's reasoning applies to all of Plaintiffs' state law claims in this case. In each LOA, each plaintiff-hospital agreed to \"comply with all Medicare and other federal health care program laws, regulations and program instructions that apply to the service furnished to the Members including the Medicare Advantage Provisions Attachment to this Agreement.\" (Defendant's RJN, Declaration of Daniel M. Glassman, Doc. No. 83-2, Exs. A-N.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' allegations regarding downcoding or underpayment thus require analysis of the Medicare Advantage Provisions Attachments and the relevant provisions of the Act itself that define the Medicare rate for the provided service. As Defendant points out, these provisions include: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1394\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t), which defines Medicare allowable rates for outpatient hospital services; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww, which defines Medicare allowable rates for inpatient hospital services; and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1394w-22(k), which requires non-contracting providers to accept from the MAO the amount the provider could collect from the Medicare program if the member was not enrolled in the MAO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 83-1 at 13.) Indeed, the Act, which sets forth the reimbursement standards and rates for MA members, governs all of Plaintiffs' claims alleged in the 4AC. Other district courts confronting similar scenarios have found Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shakespeare v. SCAN Health Plan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:17-CV-568-BTM-MDD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20340422\">\n    2018 WL 340422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D. Cal.

The Court has reviewed the proposed sur-reply, which consists of one paragraph re-hashing an argument contained in the Opposition brief. Thus, although the sur-reply will be deemed filed, the Court finds that it does not alter the determination that Plaintiffs' claims are preempted.
