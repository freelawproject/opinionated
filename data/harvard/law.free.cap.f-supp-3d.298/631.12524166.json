Plaintiffs allege further that al Qaeda's development into a terrorist organization and its ability to carry out the 9/11 Attacks was made possible through the financial and operational support it received from charity organizations established and controlled by the Saudi government, including Defendant Saudi High Commission for Relief in Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"SHC\").

Plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 3075.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   During the pendency of Plaintiffs' appeal, Congress enacted the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\"JASTA\"), Pub. L. No. 114-222,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Stat.%20852\">\n    130 Stat. 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B ). As described more fully below, JASTA created, among other things, a new exception to the FSIA which does not incorporate the noncommercial tort exception's entire tort rule and, unlike the FSIA's terrorism exception, does not require that the defendant be designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the Secretary of State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B(b). In addition, JASTA now permits United States nationals to bring claims against foreign sovereigns under the Antiterrorism Act (\"ATA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provided that JASTA's requirements for withholding sovereign immunity are otherwise met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1605B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Recognizing that \"JASTA was intended to apply to this case[,]\" and that its enactment \"raise[d] numerous questions that have not yet been addressed by the district court[,]\" the parties jointly requested that the Second Circuit vacate this Court's September 29, 2015 Opinion and Order dismissing, under the FSIA, all claims against Saudi Arabia and the SHC and remand the case to this Court for further proceedings in light of JASTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Mot. to Vacate and Remand at 2,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001,\n   </em>\n   No. 15-3426 (2d Cir. Oct. 21, 2016), ECF No. 255-1. The Second Circuit granted that motion and remanded the case to this Court to consider how, if at all, JASTA affects the Moving Defendants' claim for immunity under the FSIA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mandate dated March 9, 2017 (\"3/9/17 Mandate\"), ECF No. 3457, at 1.) On remand, Defendants Saudi Arabia and the SHC have renewed their motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that their immunity under the FSIA remains intact even after JASTA's enactment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Mot. to Dismiss (\"KSA Mot.\"), ECF No. 3667, at 1-2; Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mot. to Dismiss (\"SHC Mot.\"), ECF No. 3670, at 1-2.) Saudi Arabia also contends that JASTA is unconstitutional since it infringes on the powers of the courts to decide cases and controversies free from congressional control. (KSA Mem. at 70-74.) Plaintiffs oppose the motions\n   to dismiss and seek leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery, claiming that many of the relevant facts necessary to establish jurisdiction are uniquely within Saudi Arabia's knowledge and control. (CAC Plaintiffs Mem. in Opp'n (\"CAC Opp'n\"), ECF No. 3782, at 72-73;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs Mem. in Opp'n (\"\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Opp'n\"), ECF No, 3781, at 4-6.) This Court heard oral argument on the Moving Defendants' renewed motions to dismiss on January 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because Plaintiffs' allegations, accepted as true for purposes of resolving the instant motions, narrowly articulate a reasonable basis for this Court to assume jurisdiction under JASTA over Plaintiffs' claims against Saudi Arabia, this Court will exercise its discretion to allow Plaintiffs limited jurisdictional discovery. Such discovery is be to be conducted under Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn's supervision and shall proceed in a prompt and expeditious manner by focusing only on those allegations of specific facts described below relevant to the FSIA immunity determination. Accordingly, Defendant Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss is DENIED. Plaintiffs' recycled allegations as to the SHC, by contrast, remain insufficient to overcome the presumption of immunity afforded to it by the FSIA. Defendant SHC's motion to dismiss is therefore GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiffs argue that this new exception to the FSIA \"readily encompasses [their] claims\" against Saudi Arabia and the SHC. (CAC Opp'n at 8.) The Moving Defendants, in\n   turn, dispute only whether Plaintiffs' allegations satisfy the second and third elements,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   whether their employees, officials, or agents engaged in a tortious act or acts within the scope of their employment, office, or agency that caused the 9/11 Attacks.

Although JASTA does not itself define what acts are considered tortious for purposes of satisfying the statute's FSIA exception, the parties agree that it at least includes the knowing or deliberately indifferent provision of material support to terrorists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KSA Mem. at 12-13; SHC Mem. at 14 15; CAC Opp'n at 9-10.) The congressional findings set forth in JASTA suggest that such acts were indeed intended to be covered by the statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   JASTA, \u00a7 2(a)(7) (\"The United States has a vital interest in providing persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks committed within the United States with full access to the court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, entities, or\n   <em>\n    countries\n   </em>\n   that have\n   <em>\n    knowingly or recklessly provided material support or resources,\n   </em>\n   directly or indirectly, to the persons or organizations responsible for their injuries.\") (emphases added). JASTA does, however, specifically preclude the exercise of jurisdiction over claims against foreign states on \"the basis of an omission or a tortious act or acts that constitute mere negligence,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scope of Office, Employment, or Agency\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   JASTA waives FSIA immunity for claims caused by the tortious acts of a foreign state, or of any official, employee, or agent of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B(b).

Second, as the Fourth Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Rux,\n   </em>\n   adopting a more stringent \"but for\" standard of causation \"would require a plaintiff to plead sufficient facts to chart a direct and unbroken causal line between a state's provision of material support and an ultimate act of terrorism.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671583\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/461/#p473\">\n    461 F.3d at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This inquiry will necessarily take into account the connections between Saudi Arabia and the SHC and the individuals and charity organizations identified in the complaints, as well as the extent to which, if at all, there exists an adequate causal nexus between their alleged tortious actions and Plaintiffs' injuries arising out of the attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tortious Acts Committed By SHC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the SHC is one of several organizations established by the Saudi government to conduct proselytizing activities and otherwise advance the Wahhabi sect of Islam. (CAC 59-60.) Plaintiffs also allege that SHC and similar organizations provided funding and other forms of material support to al Qaeda during the 1990s that enabled it to acquire the global strike capabilities employed with devastating effect on September 11, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) For example, they claim that from 1992 through 1996, SHC provided financial and logistical support to al Qaeda and its operatives fighting in the Bosnian War, and that from 1996 through 1999, SHC \"funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to al Qaeda\" under the pretext of doing construction work in Bosnia. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39(v), 43(s)-(t).) They also claim that in 1993, SHC provided arms to a Somali faction trained by al Qaeda, which were used to fight American military personnel providing security for a United Nations humanitarian mission in Somalia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43(u); Averment of Facts, ECF No. 3463-1, \u00b6 313.) Plaintiffs allege further that between 1992 and 1995, the head of the SHC transferred more than $120 million \"from his personal accounts and SHC accounts under his control\" to an organization that transferred the funds to al Qaeda fighters operating in the Balkans. (Averment of Facts \u00b6 530.) Based on SHC's activities in support of al Qaeda, United States counterterrorism officials included it in a group of terrorist fronts labeled as the \"dirty dozen.\" (CAC \u00b6 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs claim, al Qaeda members were \"broadly embedded\" in SHC offices and used SHC facilities \"to plot attacks against the West.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) They allege that a counterterrorism raid of the SHC's Sarajevo office conducted after the 9/11 Attacks uncovered evidence \"confirming the SHC's direct involvement in the portfolio of plots al Qaeda was developing ... to attack the American homeland[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) That evidence allegedly\n   consisted of photographs of the World Trade Center, before and after its collapse, as well as photographs of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the U.S.S. Cole. According to Plaintiffs, investigators also recovered photographs and maps of Washington, D.C. marking prominent government buildings and information on how to deploy chemical agents with crop dusters and create counterfeit \"State Department badges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also allege that in October 2001, Bosnian police arrested six members of the al Qaeda network, all of whom were on the SHC's payroll, for plotting to conduct terrorist attacks on United States targets in Bosnia. (Averment of Facts \u00b6 535.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   These allegations do not provide a basis to assert jurisdiction under JASTA over the claims asserted against the SHC. Plaintiffs fail to plead any specific, non-conclusory allegations that the SHC, or any of its employees or agents operating within the scope of their employment or agency, knowingly or with deliberate indifference provided material support directly to al Qaeda to aid in planning or facilitating the 9/11 Attacks. Nor do they plausibly allege that any of the SHC's conduct during the 1990s bears any reasonable connection whatsoever to the 9/11 Attacks. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the factual allegations as to SHC relate to its support of al Qaeda's activities far removed, both in time and place, from the 9/11 Attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The only apparent connection to the 9/11 Attacks are the photographs found in the SHC's Sarajevo offices depicting the World Trade Center before and after the terrorist attacks. But that fact, by itself, does not support the inference that the SHC, or any of its employees or agents, played a role-directly or indirectly-in funding, planning, facilitating, or otherwise participating in the 9/11 Attacks. Even if they suggest that the SHC generally supported al Qaeda's efforts, or had more than a fleeting association with the terrorist organization, they do not implicate the SHC's personal involvement, or that of any of its employees or agents, in any particular tortious act or acts that caused the 9/11 Attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because Plaintiffs' guilt-by-association allegations as to the SHC do not suffice to rebut the presumption of immunity afforded to it by the FSIA, Defendant SHC's motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Tortious Acts Committed By Saudi Arabia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Saudi Arabia is directly liable for its own tortious actions that proximately caused the 9/11 Attacks. These allegations largely focus on Saudi Arabia's alleged \"cleans[ing]\" of the 9/11 hijackers' Saudi passports and its issuance of a fraudulent Saudi passport in July 2001 to 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. (\n   <em>\n    See Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43(k), (m).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   These allegations do not establish a basis for this Court to exercise jurisdiction under JASTA. Plaintiffs' allegations as to Saudi Arabia's involvement in cleansing passports for the 9/11 hijackers are conclusory and entirely based on the incoherent and hearsay-within-hearsay testimony provided by former al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kreindler and Pounian Aff., ECF No. 3780, \u00b6 44.) With respect to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Plaintiffs' allegations do not plausibly suggest that Saudi Arabia knowingly issued a passport to him, as he had used a fake alias in applying for one, nor do they suggest that the passport was used in furtherance of the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Although Plaintiffs allege that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed used the Saudi passport to obtain a visa to enter the United States, they concede that \"[h]e never used that visa\" to do so, offering only that he \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have used the ... passport\n   to facilitate and hide travel related to the 9/11 plot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   9/11 and Terrorist Travel: Staff Report of the Nat'l Comm'n on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Kreindler and Pounian Aff.

To invoke the JASTA exception to FSIA immunity, Plaintiffs must show that these individuals are officials, employees, or agents of Saudi Arabia who, while acting within the scope of their office, employment, or agency, knowingly or with reckless indifference, provided material support to al Qaeda in a manner that bears some reasonable connection to the 9/11 Attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    a. Fahad al Thumairy and Omar al Bayoumi\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   From 1998 through 2001, Fahad al Thumairy was the imam at the Saudi-funded King Fahd Mosque near Los Angeles, California, where he was employed and appointed by Saudi Arabia's Head of Islamic Affairs in Washington, D.C. (CAC \u00b6 165;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(g).) During the same time period, Thumairy was an accredited Saudi diplomat working for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Islamic Affairs at the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles, a position in which he reported to more senior officials inside the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. (CAC \u00b6 166;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(g).) According to Plaintiffs, Thumairy was responsible for orchestrating the U.S.-based support network for two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar, upon their arrival in the United States in January 2000, at the direction of an unnamed senior Saudi official based in the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 160, 169;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(b).) As detailed in the 9/11 Commission Report, Hazmi and Mihdhar were \"ill-prepared for a mission in the United States\" as \"[n]either had spent any substantial time in the West, and neither spoke much, if any, English.\" (9/11 Comm'n Report, Decl. of Gregory G. Rapawy, ECF No. 3669, Ex. 1, at 215.) Accordingly, the 9/11 Commission Report concluded, \"it is unlikely that Hazmi and Mihdhar ... would have come to the United States without arranging to receive assistance from one or more individuals informed in advance of their arrival.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs, Thumairy and his associates were charged by more senior Saudi officials to provide Hazmi and Mihdhar with such assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On February 1, 2000, just two weeks after 9/11 hijackers Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in Los Angeles, Thumairy met with an individual named Omar al Bayoumi for an hour inside Thumairy's office at the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (CAC \u00b6 170; Averment of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 145, 161.) At the time, Bayoumi was a Saudi national living in San Diego, California, who had been employed by Saudi Arabia since at least the 1970s. (CAC \u00b6 170;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(j); Averment of Facts \u00b6 153.) Bayoumi moved to the United States in 1994 to study English at San Diego State University on a scholarship provided by the Saudi government and, one year later, he was granted a secondment by the Saudi government to work as an employee of the Dallah Avco Trans Arabia Company (\"Dallah Avco\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CAC \u00b6 158(h); Averment of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 153, 156.) Plaintiffs allege that Saudi Arabia continued paying Bayoumi approximately $3,000 per month, with a stipend of about $465, despite his failure to perform any work or enroll in classes. (CAC \u00b6 158(h);\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(j)-(k); Averment of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 184-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Following the meeting with Thumairy at the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles, Bayoumi traveled to a Middle Eastern restaurant in the Los Angeles area where he met with Hazmi and Mihdhar and offered to help them settle in San Diego, the city that al Qaeda leadership had designated as the preferred location for the hijackers to carry out their preparations for the 9/11 Attacks. (CAC \u00b6 172; Averment of Facts \u00b6 172.) Three days later, on February 4, 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in San Diego and sought out Bayoumi to take him up on his offer of help. (Averment of Facts \u00b6 173; 9/11 Comm'n Report at 219.) Bayoumi immediately assisted Hazmi and Mihdhar by finding them an apartment in San Diego, co-signing their lease as a guarantor, helping them open a bank account, and paying their rent on occasion. (CAC \u00b6 173;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(d); 9/11 Comm'n Report at 219.) Bayoumi also provided Hazmi and Mihdhar with his cell phone until a landline telephone was installed in their apartment. (9/11 Comm'n Report at 516 n.26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition, the same day Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in San Diego, Bayoumi put them in contact with Anwar al Aulaqi, an imam and covert recruiter for al Qaeda.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 174-76, 179-80.) Bayoumi also introduced Hazmi and Mihdhar to another individual, Mohdhar Mohamed Abdullah, whom Bayoumi enlisted to assist the hijackers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185.) Abdullah, who was a member of Aulaqi's mosque at the time, later told U.S. law enforcement that Bayoumi specifically tasked him with \"be[ing] the individual to acclimate the hijackers to the United States, particularly San Diego, California.\" (9/11 Comm'n Report at 516 n.20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CAC \u00b6 188.) At Bayoumi's instruction, Abdullah helped Hazmi and Mihdhar locate and apply to English language and flight schools and assisted them in translating between English and Arabic. (CAC \u00b6 189.) Abdullah also helped Hazmi and Mihdhar obtain\n   multiple fake driver's licenses and perform surveillance of Los Angeles International Airport, including through the use of video camera recording equipment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 189-92;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Based on these alleged facts, Plaintiffs claim that Thumairy and Bayoumi were directed by someone within the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. to help Hazmi and Mihdhar acclimate and settle in the United States to begin their preparations for the 9/11 Attacks. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 244-45;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(b).) According to Plaintiffs, around the same time that Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States, Bayoumi received a sharp increase in the stipend he received from Saudi Arabia of about $4,000, which Plaintiffs attribute to the assistance Bayoumi was providing to the hijackers. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl \u00b6 39(k); Averment of Facts \u00b6 186; 9/11 Comm'n Report at 515 n.18.) Also coincident with the hijackers' arrival in the United States, Bayoumi's telephone records reveal that he placed telephone calls to Saudi Consulates in the United States approximately seventy-four times between January and March 2000, including thirty-four calls to the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles, where Thumairy worked. (CAC \u00b6 226.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   These allegations, unrebutted by any contrary evidence from Saudi Arabia, are sufficient to create a reasonable basis for this Court to exercise jurisdiction over the claims Plaintiffs assert against Saudi Arabia to justify allowing jurisdictional discovery to proceed as to Thumairy and Bayoumi. The only apparent arguments advanced by Saudi Arabia in support of its motion to dismiss with respect to these two individuals are that this Court previously rejected similar allegations and that the 9/11 Commission Report's conclusions foreclose Plaintiffs' claims. (KSA Mem. at 26-28, 31-32.) Neither argument is availing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, this Court did, in fact, reject Plaintiffs' past attempts to assert jurisdiction over Saudi Arabia based on the alleged tortious acts of Thumairy and Bayoumi but only because there were insufficient allegations that they provided material support to Hazmi and Mihdhar \"within the scope of [their] employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks XI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160435\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/774/#p779\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 786-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, while Thumairy and Bayoumi may not have been acting within the scope of their employment, as imam and employee of Dallah Avco, respectively, Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to show that they and their agents were following instructions from more senior officials in the Saudi Embassy and, as such, their actions can be attributed to Saudi Arabia for purposes of satisfying JASTA's FSIA exception. At this stage, Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged that the assistance Bayoumi provided to Hazmi and Mihdhar, including the individuals he put them in contact with, bear at least some reasonable connection to the 9/11 Attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second, neither the 9/11 Commission Report, nor any other governmental report, adequately and specifically refutes Plaintiffs' allegations. As to Bayoumi, the 9/11 Commission Report found that Bayoumi was an \"unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamist extremists.\" (9/11 Comm'n Report at 218.) The 9/11 Commission Report further found that Bayoumi did not give money directly to Hazmi or Mihdhar, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219.) Saudi Arabia also cites a joint FBI and CIA report from 2005, which found \"no information to indicate that\" Bayoumi was an \"intelligence officer[ ] of the Saudi Govemment[.]\" (2005 FBI/CIA Report, Decl. of Gregory G. Rapawy, Ex. 4, at 2.) None of these findings, however, directly contradict Plaintiffs' allegations that Bayoumi was tasked by Thumairy, at the behest of a more senior Saudi official, with providing\n   substantial assistance to Hazmi and Mihdhar. The same is true of the 9/11 Commission Report's finding of no evidence that Thumairy provided assistance to the two operatives. (9/11 Comm'n Report at 217.) That finding does not specifically contradict Plaintiffs' allegation that Thumairy designated others, including Bayoumi, to carry out his directives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accepting Plaintiffs' well-pled allegations as true for purposes of resolving the instant motion, and in the absence of contrary evidence from Saudi Arabia, Plaintiffs have therefore articulated a reasonable basis for Saudi Arabia to be held responsible for the conduct of its agents, Thumairy and Bayoumi, as well as those whom they appointed as subagents.

Osama Basnan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Osama Basnan\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   was an \"employee and agent of the Saudi government engaged in performing undisclosed functions for and at the direction of the extremists in the Minishy of Islamic Affairs' offices in the United States and elsewhere.\" (CAC \u00b6 198.) According to Plaintiffs, Basnan told an FBI informant after the 9/11 Attacks that he did more to help the hijackers than Bayoumi. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 201.) Beyond that, however, the allegations tying Basnan to both Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 Attacks are sparse. For example, Plaintiffs claim that there were a series of transfers from a bank account associated with the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., to Basnan and his wife from 1998 to 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39(l), 44(h).) Plaintiffs also allege that Basnan worked for the Saudi Embassy in 1992 and that in that capacity, he hosted an event to honor the Blind Sheikh, who was later convicted as the mastermind behind a foiled terrorist attack targeting New York City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44(h).) Plaintiffs further claim that the FBI's 9/11 investigation has documented \"contact\" between Hazmi and Milidhar and a close friend of Basnan's,\n   who was a commercial airline pilot and certified flight instructor living in San Diego. (CAC \u00b6 203.) Finally, according to Plaintiffs, Basnan lived across the street from the apartment rented by Hazmi and Mihdhar in San Diego and he provided them with support and resources, including by putting them in touch with his friend, the flight instructor. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(g).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   These allegations are insufficient to permit this Court to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims against Saudi Arabia. Plaintiffs do not adequately allege that Basnan was an employee or agent of the Saudi government, or that he provided material assistance to Hazmi, Mihdhar, or any of the other 9/11 hijackers within the scope of his employment or agency. More specifically, there is no allegation or evidence that the funds transferred to Basnan and his wife were used to aid the hijackers or otherwise help facilitate the 9/11 Attacks. Nor is there any allegation or evidence that Basnan continued working for the Saudi Embassy after 1993, or that his contacts with Hazmi and Mihdhar were within the scope of his undefined relationship with the Saudi government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' allegations as to Osama Basnan are insufficient to permit jurisdiction under JASTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    c. Mohammed al Qudhaeein and Hamdan al Shalawi\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Like Basnan, Mohammed al Qudhaeein and Hamdan al Shalawi were also \"undeclared employees and agents of the Saudi government,\" who allegedly worked on behalf of Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Islamic Affairs. (CAC \u00b6 267.) Qudhaeein, who was in the United States as a student, was in contact with various Saudi government offices throughout the United States and received money from the Saudi government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268.) Shalawi was a \"long time employee of the Saudi government as well,\" and he, too, received a stipend from the Saudi government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 272.) Both are alleged to have conducted a \"dry run\" for the 9/11 Attacks by twice attempting to enter the cockpit on a 1999 flight from Phoenix to Washington, D.C. to test and learn airline security protocols and procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 270;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(k).) At the time, both were on their way to a symposium hosted by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. and had their travel expenses paid by the Saudi Embassy. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 273-74;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(l).) According to Plaintiffs, Shalawi had also trained in a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan in 2000, where several 9/11 hijackers were simultaneously receiving training. (CAC \u00b6 279;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(m).) Plaintiffs also allege that Qudhaeein and/or Shalawi met with 9/11 hijacker Hard Hanjour at some point between 1997 and 1999 at a Saudi-funded mosque in Tempe, Arizona. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(m).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   These allegations fail to support jurisdiction over the claims asserted against Saudi Arabia for two independent, but related, reasons. First, there is no specific, non-conclusory allegation that at any relevant time period, Qudhaeein and/or Shalawi were acting as officials, employees, or even agents of Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, their acts may not be used to establish jurisdiction under JASTA over Plaintiffs' claims against Saudi Arabia. Second, even if there were allegations adequately connecting the two individuals to Saudi Arabia, Plaintiffs do not allege or come forward with evidence showing that any of their actions provided material assistance to the 9/11 hijackers or otherwise caused the 9/11 Attacks. For example, even assuming that Qudhaeein and Shalawi did, in fact, conduct a dry run for the 9/11 Attacks, there is no allegation that they conveyed their knowledge or any information they obtained to the 9/11 hijackers, let alone that such information was used in some material\n   way to facilitate the 9/11 Attacks. There is also no specific, non-conclusory allegation or evidence to suggest that Shalawi provided assistance to the 9/11 hijackers at the terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs' allegations as to Mohammed al Qudhaeein and Hamdan al Shalawi fall short of demonstrating that this Court may exercise jurisdiction under JASTA over Plaintiffs' claims against Saudi Arabia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    d. Saleh al Hussayen\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Saleh al Hussayen was a senior Saudi cleric who held various positions in the Saudi government over many years, including as an employee of the Ministry of Interior. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 281, 285.) Plaintiffs allege that Hussayen was in the United States in the weeks before the 9/11 Attacks on a fundraising mission with members of the Islamic Association of North America, a \"radical Islamic organization\" based in Michigan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 282.) They allege further that on September 6, 2001, he arrived in Herndon, Virginia, and that just days before the 9/11 Attacks, he abruptly moved from his original hotel to the hotel where 9/11 hijackers Hazmi, Mihdhar, and Hanjour were staying on the evening of September 10, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 283;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44(o).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This Court previously held that it could not exercise jurisdiction over claims asserted against Saudi Arabia based on these allegations since they \"do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks XI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160435\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/774/#p779\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). For the same reasons, and because Plaintiffs still do not allege that he provided any of the 9/11 hijackers with any form of material assistance during his stay at their hotel, Plaintiffs' allegations as to Saleh al Hussayen fail to give rise to jurisdiction under JASTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    e. Muhammed Jaber Fakihi\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Muhammed Jabar Fakihi was employed by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Islamic Affairs and, beginning in June 2000, served as head of the Islamic Affairs Office in the Saudi Embassy in Berlin, Germany. (CAC \u00b6 288;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(m).) Plaintiffs allege that Fakihi was in direct contact with members of the al Qaeda cell in Hamburg, Germany, that coordinated the 9/11 Attacks. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 289 90; Averment of Facts \u00b6 258.) They also allege that Fakihi sought to turn the A1 Nur Mosque in Berlin into a center for Islamic missionary activity aimed at populations in Eastern Europe and that he arranged for Saudi charities to fund the expansion of the mosque. (CAC \u00b6 293; Averment of Facts \u00b6 257.) According to Plaintiffs, Fakihi ensured the delivery of at least $1 million from the Saudi Embassy in Berlin to support al Qaeda in Germany and the A1 Nur Mosque. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39(m)-(o).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   These allegations are also insufficient to give rise to jurisdiction under JASTA over claims against Saudi Arabia. Assuming Fakihi was acting at all relevant times within the scope of his office, employment, or agency, there is no allegation or evidence that the funds he diverted from the Saudi Embassy in Berlin were ever provided directly to al Qaeda, or that the funds were in any way used to help plan or facilitate the 9/11 Attacks. Nor is there any allegation or evidence that his contact with members of the al Qaeda cell in Hamburg consisted of assistance that he provided as an agent or employee of the Saudi Embassy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs' threadbare allegations as to Muhammed Jaber Fakihi are insufficient to create a basis for this Court to exercise jurisdiction under JASTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    f. Omar Abdi Mohamed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Omar Abdi Mohamed entered the United States in 1998 as a religious worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   (CAC \u00b6 302.) At the time, he was employed by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Islamic Affairs as a \"propagator\" of Islam, though he did not disclose that fact to United States immigration officials on his visa application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 303.) After he arrived in the United States, and while under the supervision of officials in the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, he established a charity organization in San Diego called the Western Somali Relief Agency (\"WSRA\") to serve as a fundraising front for al Qaeda. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 304-05;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Between December 1998 and May 2001, the WSRA issued 65 checks totaling nearly $400,000 to Dahab Shil, a money transfer agency whose office in Pakistan was controlled by 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. (CAC \u00b6 305;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39(d)-(c).) According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the 9/11 plotters spent between $400,000 and $500,000 over the two years preceding the 9/11 Attacks to plan and facilitate the attacks. (9/11 Comm'n Report at 172.) The Report indicates further that the 19 hijackers were funded through wire transfers or cash provided by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   After oral argument, Plaintiffs moved to supplement the record as to Omar' Abdi Mohamed with two newly discovered pieces of evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Leave to Supplement the Record, ECF No. 3926, at 1.) The first concerns statements made in a legal memorandum filed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), in connection with its removal proceedings against Mohamed (the \"ICE Memorandum\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICE Memorandum, Pounian Decl., ECF No. 3930, Ex. 1.) The ICE Memorandum states that Mohamed was \"tasked\" by the Saudi government to undertake \"intelligence gathering missions in his employment as a 'propagator' \" by, among other things, providing Saudi Arabia with information about converts to Islam living in the United States and monitoring media outlets to ensure that Saudi Arabia's views were represented in the media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The second is an investigative report prepared by the United States Customs Service (the \"Customs Investigative Report\"), which indicates that as of January 1998, an individual named Sheik Fahd bin Ibrahim Al-Thumairi was appointed \"to oversee the propagators working in the State of California.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Customs Investigative Report, Pounian Decl., Ex. 2, at 2.) Plaintiffs claim that this newly discovered evidence shows that Mohamed was part of the same Southern California al Qaeda cell as Thumairy and Bayoumi, among others, and that Mohamed provided money-laundering services for al Qaeda at the direction of senior Saudi officials. (Pls. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Supplement, ECF No. 3928, at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Even assuming that the funds the WSRA provided to al Qaeda were actually used to help plan and facilitate the 9/11 Attacks, Plaintiffs allege no non-conclusory facts, and provide no evidence, to support the claim that Mohamed did so within the scope of his employment as a missionary. Plaintiffs' newly discovered evidence does little to change that conclusion. Plaintiffs argue that the ICE Memorandum shows that Mohamed was not a \"propagator,\" but rather an undercover intelligence officer working for the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The ICE Memorandum,\n   however, shows just the opposite, and explicitly states that Mohamed\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a missionary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICE Memorandum at 4.) Moreover, none of the tasks that ICE described as \"intelligence gathering,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) included raising funds for al Qaeda, or anyone else for that matter. In addition, the Customs Investigative Report's conclusory statement that Thumairy supervised Mohamed's missionary activities-assuming that Thumairy is even the individual referenced in that report-does not support the inference that Mohamed was part of the cell that Thumairy directed to provide support to the 9/11 hijackers upon their arrival in California. Nor does it suggest, as Plaintiffs argue, that Thumairy, or any other Saudi official, directed Mohamed to deliver funds to al Qaeda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to jurisdictional discovery with respect to Mohamed because Saudi Arabia \"holds the key evidence sought... regarding [his] employment, authority and instructions, [Saudi Arabia's] involvement in the WSRA scheme, the WSRA's records[,] and the ultimate beneficiary of the covert funds sent to Dahab Shil.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 19.) While that may be the case, Plaintiffs must first demonstrate that a reasonable basis for jurisdiction exists based on Mohamed's alleged tortious acts. In this regard, Plaintiffs' allegations as to Omar Abdi Mohamed come up short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Charities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiffs identify several charity organizations, including Defendant SHC, that Plaintiffs allege operated as fundraising fronts for al Qaeda and provided financial and logistical support to al Qaeda during the decades preceding the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAC \u00b6\u00b6 75, 86;\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   Compl, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42-44.) These recycled allegations fail for two reasons. First, Plaintiffs do not articulate a valid basis for holding Saudi Arabia vicariously liable for the acts of the charity organizations. Second, even if the tortious acts of the charity organizations, or those of any of their officials, employees, and agents, may be attributed to Saudi Arabia, Plaintiffs still fail to adequately allege that those acts caused the 9/11 Attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    a.

Even accepting that factual allegation as true, it says nothing about whether Saudi Arabia can be held vicariously liable for the consequences of the charities' conduct.

Plaintiffs' allegations, however, still fall short because they do not show that the charities' provision of material support to terrorists was committed within the scope of their agency-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   providing humanitarian aid and propagating Wahhabi Islam-much less that their actions\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' injuries arising out of the 9/11 Attacks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, allowing Plaintiffs to hold Saudi Arabia liable for the acts of the charities, whom they describe as \"arms and components of the Saudi government,\" (CAC \u00b6 31), as ordinary\n   <em>\n    agents\n   </em>\n   would sanction an end-run around\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   and the significant public policy goals it serves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The acts of the charity organizations identified in Plaintiffs' complaints therefore cannot be attributed to Saudi Arabia or used to provide a basis under JASTA for this Court to exercise jurisdiction over the claims Plaintiffs assert against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    b.

For instance, the vast majority of Plaintiffs' allegations involve alleged acts by the charities to aid and support al Qaeda's efforts in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East during the 1980s and 1990s; none bear any definite and specific, articulable connection to the 9/11 Attacks or those who carried them out. Moreover, as the Second Circuit has held, allegations that the charities provided funding to entities that are known to support terrorism that, in turn, provided funding to al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are insufficient for proximate causation purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks IX,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864637\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/109/#p114\">\n    714 F.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate that any of the support the charities provided al Qaeda or its operatives was used to help fund or facilitate the 9/11 Attacks in any meaningful way.

Saudi Arabia's Constitutional Challenge to JASTA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendant Saudi Arabia challenges JASTA's constitutionality on two separate but related grounds. First, it argues that JASTA violates the separation of powers in attempting to direct a certain outcome in this case and thereby infringing on the judicial power of the courts under Article III. (KSA Mem. at 70-71.) Second, it claims that Congress overstepped its bounds by creating a new set of legal rules to apply to cases that had already been decided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-74.) More specifically, it claims that when the Second Circuit granted Plaintiffs relief from the final judgments entered by United States District Judge Casey in favor of Saudi Arabia and the SHC under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court determined that those judgments should be reopened to apply a particular set of legal rules established in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Bin Laden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882176\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/64/\">\n    663 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2011), and \"Congress was not free to step in and create another set of rules entirely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (KSA Mem. at 71.) Saudi Arabia's constitutional arguments lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As an initial matter, nothing in JASTA's text directs-or even purports to direct-a particular result in this case. JASTA is a statute of general applicability that, while perhaps motivated by this Court's and the Second Circuit's rulings in this multidistrict litigation, creates a new exception to the FSIA and leaves it to the judiciary to apply the new legal standards to the facts as it finds them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court recently affirmed, \"Congress may ... direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases ... [and] a statute does not impinge on judicial power [by merely] directing] courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Bank Markazi,\n   </em>\n   136 S.Ct. at 1325. Insofar as JASTA \"changed the law by establishing new substantive standards, entrusting to the District Court application of those standards to the facts (contested or uncontested) found by the court[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1326, it does not violate the separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Moreover, it is well established that the political branches, Congress included, enjoy wide latitude in exercising control over foreign affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zivotofsky ex rel.
