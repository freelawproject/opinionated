(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his constitutional rights under the First and Eighth Amendments of the Constitution, as more specifically stated in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently pending before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 4),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendants' motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 16). For the following reasons, both motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is an inmate in the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, and is presently housed at the Auburn Correctional Facility in Auburn, New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24 (Notice of Change of Address)). Plaintiff claims that he suffers from various mental and physical ailments, including \"liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, a low platelet count, asthma, claustrophobia, and auditory hallucinations.\" (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 31). Plaintiff also alleges that his mental condition has caused him to attempt to commit\n   suicide, \"repeatedly set fires in a number of [special housing unit] cells[,] ... repeatedly thr[o]w urine and fecal matter at certain guards,\" and self-mutilate himself by cutting \"his wrists, his penis, and his scrotum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff sets forth numerous assertions describing allegedly inadequate and unhealthy prison cell conditions, various physical assaults inflicted upon him, the deprivation of food provisions and other prison services, and that certain of the named and unnamed prison officials have deliberately ignored his acts of self-harm and claims of mental instability. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 44-46, 49-60, 64, 79, 82-86, 93, 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Many of these allegations are not relevant to the disposition of the pending motions. However, Plaintiff alleges that on October 6, 2016, Plaintiff's \"outside oncologist recommended that [he] be housed in the facility's infirmary for close monitoring while he [was] taking prescribed chemotherapy medication.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71). Plaintiff claims that Dr. Kenneth Ott (\"Dr. Ott\"), a physician employed at Elmira Correctional Facility, chose not to follow this recommendation because Plaintiff had filed grievances against the prison medical staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72). Plaintiff also alleges that between November and December of 2016, Candice Baker (\"Baker\"), a nurse employed at Elmira Correctional Facility, failed to respond to Plaintiff's \"sick call slips,\" and that she \"refused to provide him with prescribed medication for his liver diseases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97). Plaintiff further alleges that Baker was in \"an intimate relationship\" with Dr. Ott, and that she convinced him \"to refuse to comply with a number of medical recommendations made by [Plaintiff]'s outside treating specialists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 22, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 4). In his declaration in support of this motion, Plaintiff argues that Dr. Ott and Baker \"deliberately refused ... to provide [him] with medical treatment recommended by outside specialists for [his] liver diseases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). Specifically, Plaintiff affirms that \"from November 2016 to the date of the filing\" of his motion, Baker \"deliberately refused to respond to [his] sick-call slips and to provide [him] with prescribed medication for [his] liver diseases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Plaintiff further affirms that Dr. Ott refused to provide \"an examination of [Plaintiff's] esophagus,\" perform a \"sonogram examination of [Plaintiff's] testicals [sic] for evidence of cancer,\" place Plaintiff \"in the prison's infirmary during chemotherapy treatment,\" and provide Plaintiff with an \"Ensure\" nutritional drink \"to combat [his] lack of appetite for solid foods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff claims that as a result of Baker's and Dr. Ott's continued indifference to his outside physicians' recommendations, Plaintiff is \"suffering from internal bleeding from [his] esophagus; great pain in [his] swollen testicals [sic]; lack of appetite for solid foods; and a loss of body weight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Plaintiff requests that the Court issue a preliminary injunction \"requiring ... [D]efendants to carry out the treatment plan recommended by [his] outside specialists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 1, 2017, Plaintiff was granted\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status. (Dkt. 5). On August 4, 2017, Defendants filed a motion\n   for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 16). Defendants argue that each assertion in Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction is \"false or materially misleading.\" (Dkt. 16-3 at 1). Specifically, Defendants claim that Plaintiff received an examination of his esophagus two weeks before he filed his motion, Plaintiff was scheduled to receive a sonogram of his scrotum on two separate occasions, but he refused to submit to those procedures, and that, according to prison medical staff, Plaintiff does not require dietary supplements or housing in the prison infirmary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). Defendants argue that, \"[a]t a minimum,\" the instant matter should be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). However, Defendants further contend that the \"most appropriate sanction\" would be to impose a filing injunction, prohibiting Plaintiff \"from filing any additional actions, of any type, in this Court without first obtaining the prior approval of the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants also request that the Court grant them an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $1,050.00 pursuant to Rule 11(c)(4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff opposes Defendants' motion. (Dkt. 21). Since the disposition of Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction may influence the outcome of Defendants' motion for sanctions, the Court turns first to Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the defendants bore the burden on\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   motion for summary judgment of demonstrating that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that judgment should be entered in their favor as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968945\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/398/\">\n    412 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   403-04 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Amico v.

Accordingly, the fact that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   defeated the defendants' motion by raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants ignored the recommendations of the plaintiff's treating physicians is not akin to establishing a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits of an action. Furthermore, while the Second Circuit has stated that \"[p]rison officials are more than merely negligent if they deliberately defy the express instructions of a prisoner's doctors,\"\n   <em>\n    Gill v.

(Dkt. 16). Based upon the various assertions made by Plaintiff in his motion papers, Defendants request that the Court\n   dismiss this action and bar Plaintiff from commencing any subsequent actions in this Court without the Court's approval. (Dkt. 16-3 at 3). In support of their motion, Defendants submit the declaration of Lauren Davis (\"Davis\"), a registered nurse employed at the Elmira Correctional Facility. (Dkt. 16-1). Davis affirms that Plaintiff \"received an endoscopy of his esophagus on May 10, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). Davis also submits medical records indicating that this procedure was performed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 9-11). Furthermore, Plaintiff does not dispute this fact. Instead, Plaintiff responds that the procedure was conducted several months after his outside physicians first made the recommendation. (Dkt. 21 at \u00b6 4). However, outside his own self-serving allegations, Plaintiff provides no proof that Baker or Dr. Ott \"deliberately ignored these recommendations.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730357\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/192/#p196\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Davis also affirms that Plaintiff was scheduled to receive a sonogram of his scrotum on November 1, 2016, and then again, on December 8, 2016, but that he \"refused the test on both occasions.\" (Dkt. 16-1 at \u00b6 5). Davis submits medical records indicating that Plaintiff was approved for an ultrasound and/or a sonogram of his scrotum on both dates (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20), but that he refused to undergo those procedures (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Plaintiff does not submit any additional evidence to controvert Defendants' position, and merely states that he has \"not been afforded an opportunity to undergo the sonogram in question.\" (Dkt. 21 at \u00b6 5). This unsupported and misleading allegation does not establish a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff further claims that his outside physicians recommended that he \"be housed in the prison's infirmary during chemotherapy treatment,\" and that Dr. Ott has \"deliberately refused\" to follow-through with this recommendation. (Dkt. 4 at \u00b6 4). In his response papers, Plaintiff submits a medical record in which he informed his outside physicians that he \"feels he is falling [and] is dizzy.\" (Dkt. 21 at 14). After an evaluation, the consulting physician stated that Plaintiff \"should be monitored, if it is believed that what he is saying is accurate. [Plaintiff] requests monitoring/supervision given his dizziness/falling episodes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Davis affirms that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [t]here is no medical need for Plaintiff to be housed in the infirmary while he is undergoing chemotherapy. Inmates who require chemotherapy are not housed in the infirmary unless there is a medical need, and neither Plaintiff nor the significant majority of other inmates who are currently undergoing chemotherapy are so housed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Dkt. 16-1 at \u00b6 10). Davis also avers that no treating physician has recommended that Plaintiff be housed in the infirmary during his chemotherapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11).
