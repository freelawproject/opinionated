MOON, SENIOR JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is about soured financing for a municipal golf course in the City of Buena Vista, Virginia. Through agreements in 2005, the City procured funds to renovate and service debt on the golf course. For initial purposes, one can conceptualize these agreements as creating a mortgage. The City and its recreational authority (\"Authority\") received cash from a bank. In return, the City pledged, \"subject to appropriations,\" to repay the loan. The golf course property served as security to protect the bank from nonpayment. But the City also pledged unusual collateral: City Hall, the police department, and the local courthouse (collectively, \"City Hall\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Since 2015, the City has refused to make payments. But the plaintiffs here (the bank and the loan insurer) do not currently seek foreclosure on the secured properties. Rather, they filed this suit seeking damages under various contract, quasi-contract, and tort theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In truth, the story is much more complex. It involves a lease agreement, a trust agreement, two deeds of trust (one of which the City asserts is void), a forbearance agreement, and municipal bonds. And these documents frequently cross-reference each other. To orient the reader with the basic features of this case, a rough summary of the structure of the 2005 agreements follows. A diagram is attached as an appendix to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    The golf course\n   </strong>\n   . The Authority leased the golf course to the City in exchange for long-term rent payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    The money and the bonds\n   </strong>\n   . But the Authority-through a Trust Agreement-immediately assigned those long-term rent payments to Plaintiff UMB Bank (actually, its predecessor in interest SunTrust, but\n   henceforth \"UMB Bank\"). It did so to repay UMB Bank, because UMB Bank had agreed to purchase municipal bonds offered by the Authority, thus immediately injecting the outside cash (over $9 million) into the golf course project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    The collateral\n   </strong>\n   . To entice UMB Bank to provide this financing (and to protect it if the City failed to pay rent), both the City and the Authority executed deeds of trust for the benefit of UMB Bank. The Authority Deed of Trust offered the golf course property as collateral, and the City Deed of Trust listed city hall, the police department, and the courthouse as security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    The insurer\n   </strong>\n   . Finally, as added protection from nonpayment by the City, UMB Bank insured the bonds through Plaintiff ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation (\"ACA\"). So, if the City reneged on its rent (which, recall, effectively operated as loan repayments), ACA would pay off the bonds, and UMB Bank would not be left holding the bag. In return, ACA was made a third-party beneficiary of the Trust Agreement between the Authority and UMB Bank, thus giving ACA certain rights and remedies it otherwise lacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   So, the possibility the City might balk at its payments was widely contemplated. It now having done so, Plaintiffs sued for damages. Defendants assert that the Complaint fails to state a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two points suffice to resolve most of the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, contrary to the City's contention, its deed of trust is not void under Article 7, Section 9 of the Virginia Constitution, because the deed of trust is not a \"sale\" of the City's property. This conclusion negates the claims Plaintiffs pled in the alternative-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those contingent upon a finding of the deed of trust's invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, to the extent the contracts here purport to create obligations of payment, they do so expressly \"subject to appropriations\" by the City. Under Virginia law, this proviso makes the obligations only moral ones that are not legally enforceable and cannot support damages. Consequently, Plaintiffs cannot show a breach due to nonpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' sundry other theories of breach do not hold up against scrutiny. Nor are Plaintiffs seeking in this lawsuit a judicial foreclosure on the properties covered by the operative deeds of trust. Accordingly, this case will be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To determine whether a Complaint states a legal claim, the Court must accept as true all well-pled allegations, draw reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, disregard the Complaint's legal conclusions and arguments, and ensure the plaintiff offers more than a formulaic recitation of the elements.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The Court includes these allegations in recounting the Complaint to help familiarize the reader with this lawsuit and the full\n   scope of the contentions. The Court does not defer to these characterizations when undertaking its legal analysis, as legal conclusions-unlike properly pled facts-do not bind the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

(Complaint \u00b6 8). Although intended to boost the local economy, the golf course allegedly flopped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). So the Authority needed money to refinance the course and make improvements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). The City Council hence passed a resolution on April 4, 2005 \"which outlined the basic parameters for a bond financing transaction\" valued at over $9 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The 2005 Resolution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The resolution (which passed by a 4-0 vote, with three councilmembers absent) allegedly approved various \"Financing Documents\" for the golf course project. These documents included the Authority-City lease of the golf course, a trust agreement between the Authority and UMB Bank, and two deeds of trust securing UMB Bank-one from the Authority with the golf course as security, and the other from the City with the \"existing City Hall building and police station as security.\" (Dkt. 1-2 (Resolution), Recitals (a)-(d) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Trust Agreement (between UMB Bank and the Authority) and the Bonds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bonds were issued as contemplated by the Trust Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 13). Plaintiff UMB Bank was identified as the Trustee. The Trust Agreement assigned to UMB Bank (among other things) the Authority's right to receive the City's rent payments for the golf course due under the City-Authority Lease Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; Trust Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 101(a), 102(a) ). Functionally, then, the City would finance the bonds (issued by the Authority to fund the golf course) by paying the trustee (UMB Bank, who provided cash by initially purchasing the bonds) the City's rent over time (which otherwise would have been paid to the Authority).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff ACA also factored in: It insured the bonds, and the Trust Agreement made it a third-party beneficiary to both the Trust Agreement and, ostensibly, the \"Basic Agreements\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the City/Authority Lease, the City Deed of Trust, and the Authority Deed of Trust. (Trust Agreement, \u00a7 1606 &amp; Definitions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The City's Deed of Trust\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As security for bond payments and the City's lease obligations, the City executed a deed of trust for the benefit of UMB Bank. (Complaint \u00b6 19). The City agreed to \"pay all indebtedness secured by this Deed of Trust ... at the times and in the manner and amounts set forth in the Bonds, this Deed of Trust, and the Trust Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (citing \u00a7 1.1) ). The City also agreed to comply with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations governing the \"Secured Property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (citing \u00a7 1.11) ). The security offered by the City Deed of Trust included city hall, the police department, and the local courthouse facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Upon an event of default (as defined in Article III of the City Deed of Trust), UMB Bank could immediately accelerate \"all sums due on or by reason of the Trust Agreement, the Bonds or this Deed of Trust,\" and take possession of \"all or any portion of the Secured Property and sell\" it at auction. (Complaint \u00b6 24 (citing Article IV) ). The Deed of Trust also permitted UMB Bank to enter onto, take possession of, and operate the Secured Property without a court order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 4.4, 4.5) ). The City acknowledged the possibility\n   of being evicted from City Hall in an Essentiality Certificate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). The City Deed of Trust, however, excluded foreclosure on the courthouse facilities, on the grounds that state law vested local judges with ultimate control over those facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27 (citing Article IV) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Authority's Deed of Trust\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Authority also executed a Deed of Trust naming UMB Bank as the beneficiary. And again, the document was meant in part to secure compliance with the terms of the \"Bonds, this Deed of Trust, the Lease Agreement, and the Trust Agreement ...\" (Complaint \u00b6 30). The provisions of the Authority Deed of Trust are largely the same as the City's. The secured property for the Authority Deed of Trust, however, is the golf course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Citing both the City's and Authority's Deeds of Trust, Plaintiffs allege that, to induce them into providing the bond financing and insurance, the Authority and City granted them \"a comprehensive bundle of express assurances and security interests to protect [them] in the event the Bonds were not timely and fully repaid.\" (Complaint \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Opinion Letters\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that opinion letters from April 14, 2005 by the City's and Authority's attorneys \"provided further ... assurances\" that the Financing Documents are valid. (Complaint \u00b6 55). A letter from the City Attorney asserted that the April 4th resolution, the Lease Agreement between the City and the Authority, and \"the consummation by the City of the transactions contemplated by them\" are lawful, valid documents. (Complaint \u00b6 56 (quoting Kearney Letter) ). The letter emphasized that the \"City Resolution was duly adopted by the City Council of the City [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] and is in full force and effect.\" (Kearney Letter \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As special counsel for the City, law firm LeClair Ryan also wrote an opinion letter regarding the City Deed of Trust. The firm opined that the City Deed of Trust created a valid security interest; was \"duly authorized, executed and delivered[;] constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the City[;] and is enforceable in accordance with its terms\" regarding the City Hall property. (Complaint \u00b6 57 (quoting LeClair Ryan Letter for City \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2) ). LeClair Ryan further opined on other Financing Documents, similarly affirming the validity and enforceability of those agreements. (Complaint \u00b6 58 (quoting Second LeClair Ryan Letter \u00b6 1) ). But the letter stated that the City's obligation to pay rents under the Lease Agreement \"is subject to and dependent upon the City Council making annual appropriations for such purpose.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Forbearance Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 2010 and 2011, the City allegedly failed to make rent payments under the Lease Agreement sufficient to service the bond payments, and it appropriated only a portion of the rent payments for 2012. (Complaint \u00b6 38). Defendants requested Plaintiffs forbear their rights under the Financing Documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The City, the Authority, and ACA consequently executed the Forbearance Agreement on July 1, 2011, allegedly permitting the City to service 50% of its debt over five years and the other 50% five years after the bonds' maturity date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40). In the event of additional nonpayments, ACA allegedly had the right to terminate the Agreement and exercise any rights it\n   had under the Financing Documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). In entering into the Forbearance Agreement, both the City and the Authority ratified and reaffirmed \"the validity and binding nature\" of the original Financing Documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42 (citing Forbearance Agreement \u00a7 6) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The City's Subsequent Nonpayment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The City Council voted in January 2015 to cease payments altogether and has not made any since. (Complaint \u00b6 43). Plaintiffs, \"upon information and belief,\" contend that the City can afford to make payments, but that \"for political or other reasons-perhaps recognizing, in retrospect, that\" the golf course was a bad idea-it refuses to make appropriations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the City has asserted prior to initiation of this lawsuit that the City Deed of Trust is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because only four of seven councilmembers voted on and for it. (Complaint \u00b6 48). Plaintiffs alleged that the operative documents and other facts belie this assertion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on the foregoing allegations and the Financing Documents, Plaintiffs assert ten claims noted below, most of which sound in contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Threshold Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Before turning to the core claims presented by this case, the Court clears out some underbrush. By way of summary, Counts 1, 8, 9, and 10 will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Count 1 seeks a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the Financing Documents. But a declaratory judgment is a remedy, not a substantive claim. Moreover, the only Financing Document whose validity is in question is the City Deed of Trust. The Court must already pass upon its validity as a threshold question in assessing Count 3, alleging a breach of that deed. So it serving no purpose, the declaratory judgment count will be dismissed as explained further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court will then turn to the parties' arguments regarding the validity of the City Deed of Trust. Ultimately, the Court concludes that it is not void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs lodged claims for fraudulent constructive inducement (Count 9) and unjust enrichment/\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   (Count 10). These claims were pled alternatively in the event that the City Deed of Trust was void. Since it is not void, Counts 9 and 10 warrant dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   And Count 8, seeking appointment of a receiver over the golf course, involves a discretionary judicial remedy governed by federal common law and is not a freestanding, substantive, state law claim. So it too will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Declaratory Judgment (Count 1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In their first count, Plaintiffs ask the Court to \"declare that the Financing Documents are valid and enforceable.\" (Complaint \u00b6 71). The City observes that Plaintiffs already have six counts alleging various breaches of the Financing Documents, which will require actual resolution of their validity. (Dkt. 9 at 23). It contends Count 1 \"will not serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations or afford relief\n   from the controversy,\" because the \"validity of the Financing Documents is [already] an element that must be proven to establish Plaintiffs' breach claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , creates a remedy, not a substantive cause of action.

Validity of the City Deed of Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning to that squarely presented issue, as a defense to Count 3 the City asserts that its deed of trust covering City\n   Hall, the police department, and the local courthouse building is void under the Virginia Constitution. Its logic is as follows. First, Article VII, Section 9 states that \"[n]o rights of a city ... in or to ... public places ... shall be\n   <em>\n    sold\n   </em>\n   except by an ordinance or resolution passed by a recorded affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members elected to the governing body.\" Second, a deed of trust is a \"sale.\" Third, the City Council's Resolution authorizing the Deed of Trust was not made by three-fourths (or 75%) vote: Only four of seven members affirmatively voted for the proposal with three members absent, resulting in a four-sevenths, or 57%, vote. Therefore, the document is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The City's argument comes up short at the second step. A deed of trust is an encumbrance on real property akin to a mortgage; it is not a sale.

A deed of trust, like a mortgage, is not a \"sale\" of real property, but a method of encumbering the property to secure a debt. And that's precisely what the parties set out to do. Moreover, because a grantor of a deed of trust retains power to sell the property in question (subject only to the lien created by the deed of trust), the deed of trust cannot itself be a sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As an alternative to its constitutional voidness argument, the City posits a statutory one based on Va. Code \u00a7 15.2-1800(B), but it too falls flat. The statute grants a locality the power to \"dispose of its real property\" through the \"sale\" or \"pledge\" of it, as well as several other methods. That authorization is \"[s]ubject to any\n   <em>\n    applicable\n   </em>\n   requirements of Article VII, Section 9.\" (emphasis added). The City (over)reads this language as imposing the three-fourths requirement in Article VII, Section 9 throughout the entirety of \u00a7 15.2-1800(B). From this, the City then assumes that a deed of trust is a \"pledge,\" and thus its deed of trust is suddenly subject to the three-fourths requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The flaw with this view is that the constitutional three-fourths requirement applies only to property \"sold\" by a locality, Va. Const. Art. VII, \u00a7 9, and the statute's grant of power is limited only by the \"applicable\" requirements of the constitutional provision. As a result, the only transaction in \u00a7 15.2-1800(B) governed by the constitutional three-fourths requirement is the sale of a locality's \"real property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Said differently, the property transactions authorized by the statute (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , sales, leases, exchanges, mortgages, pledges, and other methods) are far broader than those limited by the constitutional three-fourths requirement. Because Article VII, Section 9 does not require a supermajority vote to approve a \"pledge\" of public property, the three-fourths requirement is not imported into \u00a7 15.2-1800(B) for that type of transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The City contends it was not, because the relevant agreements made the rent payments \"subject to appropriations\" by the City Council.

Rather, they say\n   <em>\n    Dykes\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because it involved whether there was a debt in a constitutional sense. (Dkt. 17 at 30-31). That is a distinction without a difference.

VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Virginia Constitution or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Returning to the contracts here, the Lease plainly makes the City's rent payments subject to the City's later decision to make future appropriations. Section 4.5 recognizes-perhaps as a nod to Section 10 of the Virginia Constitution-that the \"City is not empowered to make any binding commitment to make [rent payments] beyond the current Fiscal Year\" (although the City's \"intent\" at the time was to make the payments). Moreover, \u00a7 4.5 unambiguously provides that, \"[n]otwithstanding anything in this Lease Agreement to the contrary,\" the City's payment obligations under the Lease and Trust Agreements, \"including without limitation its obligation to pay all [rents],\n   <em>\n    shall be subject to and dependent upon appropriations\n   </em>\n   being made from time to time by the City Council for such purpose ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Faced with these provisions, Plaintiffs do not defend their nonpayment-as-breach theory as to Lease, but assert that \"the rent payments\n   <em>\n    became\n   </em>\n   mandatory by virtue of the Forbearance Agreement.\" (Dkt. 17 at 33 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   But the same stipulations apply to the 2011 Forbearance Agreement between ACA, the City, and the Authority. While the Forbearance Agreement created a new payment schedule after the City's first refusal to appropriate rent, that schedule remained \"subject to annual appropriation.\" (Forbearance Agreement, \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 5.3). Section 5.4 made the point doubly certain, stating that the City's obligations to make the adjusted and deferred rent payments were \"subject to annual appropriation by the City Council of amounts sufficient to make such payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Close scrutiny reveals that Plaintiffs' arguments to avoid this language, dkt. 17 at 28-30, are unavailing and unsupported by the Forbearance Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Section 2\n   </em>\n   . To begin, Plaintiffs quote the first sentence of \u00a7 2 as stating that Defendants were \"obligated to make payments of Basic Rent and Additional Rent[,] as Defined in the Lease.\" (Dkt. 17 at 28). In truth, this sentence provides that Defendants were \"obligated\n   <strong>\n    , subject to annual appropriations as provided in Section 4.5 of the Lease,\n   </strong>\n   to make payments of Basic Rent and Additional Rent, as Defined in the Lease.\" (Dkt. 1-7 at 2). That is, Plaintiffs omitted without specification an entire clause within the middle of the sentence, a clause which both cut to the heart of the issue and was unfavorable to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs then quote the last sentence of \u00a7 2 as reading that the City \"will continue to make all payments due under the Financing Documents in accordance with the terms of such documents.\" (Dkt. 17 at 28). What the sentence actually says is: The City \"will continue to make all payments due under the Financing Documents in accordance with the terms of such documents\n   <strong>\n    , except as provided by this Agreement\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Dkt. 1-7 at 2). Given that the Financing Documents and \"this Agreement\"-including \u00a7 2 itself-expressly made the rent payments \"subject to annual\n   appropriation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, Plaintiffs' reliance on \u00a7 2 is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Sections 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs-selectively quoting portions of \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4-cite those provisions as creating an enforceable obligation to pay. (Dkt. 17 at 28). Yet as detailed above, those sections include the qualifying \"subject to annual appropriations\" language. Courts construe words in a contract as a whole rather than in isolation, and attempt to give meaning to all of a contract's terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ott v. Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20Va.%20403\">\n    282 Va. 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20S.E.2d%20309\">\n    719 S.E.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Va. 2011). Hence, Plaintiffs' argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Sections 7(iv) and 8\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs do correctly observe that failure to make appropriations is an event of default under \u00a7 7(iv) of the Forbearance Agreement. Section 8 then defines ACA's rights and remedies upon default, which Plaintiffs assert-with virtually no analysis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 17 at 29-includes mandatory rent payments from the City. Plaintiffs are mistaken: Section 8 still includes, through incorporation by reference, the \"subject to appropriations\" limitation, because it adopts the limitations on rent payments imposed by the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Upon default for nonpayment, \u00a7 5.1 of the Forbearance Agreement-setting the schedule of adjusted rent payments themselves subject to annual appropriations-is \"of no further force and effect,\" and \"the City shall be obligated to make\" rent payments. (Forbearance Agreement, \u00a7 8(ii) ). However, such payments are made only \"on such terms set forth in the Lease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But recall that \u00a7 4.5 of the Lease admits that the City lacks authority to make future commitments of rent and thus payments are \"subject to and dependent upon appropriations being made from time to time by the City Council.\" The upshot, then, is that \u00a7 8(ii) of the Forbearance Agreement incorporates the payment terms of the Lease, which itself-in \u00a7 4.5-makes payments subject to appropriations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This same dynamic holds true of \u00a7 8(iii), providing reimbursement to ACA for insurance payouts it made to service the bond debt. However you slice it, any so-called obligations are still subject to appropriations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Start with \u00a7 4 of the Forbearance Agreement. It requires, as per the bond insurance policy, ACA to make payments to cover shortfalls caused by the City's failure to pay rent. \"All such payments made by ACA shall be reimbursed to ACA as deferred [rent] under the Lease, as set forth in [\u00a7] 5.4\" of the Forbearance Agreement, which once more includes the \"subject to appropriations\" limitation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5.4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Now turn back to \u00a7 8(iii). If the City fails to pay, \"all amounts paid by ACA pursuant to [\u00a7] 4 shall become immediately due and payable to ACA, as assignee of the Authority,\n   <em>\n    as Basic Rent under the Lease.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). Section 8(iii), in other words, says that the City should reimburse ACA for its insurance payouts, but those reimbursements are both subject to \u00a7 5.4 (which makes them \"subject to annual appropriations\") and treated as rent under the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This loops us back to the Lease, leading yet again to the \"subject to appropriations\" condition. Page 3 of the Lease defines \"Basic Rent\" as \"payments payable by the City pursuant to Section 4.2(a).\" In turn, \u00a7 4.2(a) states that the \"City shall pay the Basic Rent to the Trustee on\n   behalf of the Authority,\n   <em>\n    subject to Section 4.5.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). And \u00a7 4.5 of the Lease-as by now must seem repetitive-unambiguously provides that rent payments are \"subject to and dependent upon appropriations being made from time to time by the City Council.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   So, all roads of the Forbearance and Lease Agreements lead to the \"subject to appropriations\" condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, then, there is no breach of the Lease or Forbearance Agreements for the City's refusal to appropriate rent payments, because the City was not legally (as opposed to morally) obligated to make those payments in the first place. All this comports with what these sophisticated parties would have understood at the time, especially against the backdrop of the Virginia Constitution's prohibition on future financial commitments by municipalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Representation regarding validity of the City Deed of Trust\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   There remains, however, a residuum of Counts 5 and 6. Aside from the nonpayment theory, Plaintiffs identified only one other alleged breach of the Lease and Forbearance Agreements in response to Defendants' motions to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 17 (Pls' Br. against City) at 30, 33; dkt. 18 (Pls' Br. against Authority) at 9). The theory is that-because \u00a7\u00a7 2.2(c), (e), (i), and 6.1(a)(2) of the Lease, and \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7(i) of the Forbearance Agreements included representations affirming the validity of the City Deed of Trust, and because the City claims the Deed of Trust is void-the supposed voidness of the Deed of Trust establishes a breach of the Lease and Forbearance Agreements. As explained earlier, the City Deed of Trust is not void, so this theory does not prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Trust Agreement by the Authority (Count 2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Count 2 asserts a breach of the Trust Agreement by the Authority. In response to the Authority's motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs advanced two theories of this Count. Neither succeeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Failure to pay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Citing \u00a7\u00a7 1001(c) and 1101, Plaintiffs first say \"that the Authority breached the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement by failing to make interest and principal payments on the Bonds.\" (Dkt. 18 at 4). That single sentence is the extent of Plaintiffs' \"argument.\" They do not quote the Trust Agreement's text, discuss its meaning, or undertake any analysis explaining how the facts satisfy the contractual provisions. This failure alone justifies finding the matter conceded, and\n   the Court so holds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Prince George's Cty., Md.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034866\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/426/#p428\">\n    575 F.3d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428-29, n.* (4th Cir. 2009) (finding that mere assertion that a particular right was violated is waiver when party \"fail[s] to present an argument to that effect-indeed, even to discuss those provisions\"). Courts are not expected to fashion even a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant's arguments for it, much less one represented by counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In any event, the theory is incorrect. Section 1001(c) does covenant that the Authority will \"promptly pay the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that section continues: \"provided, however, that such obligations are limited obligations of the Authority, payable solely from the Payments of [rent] and the property secured by the Deed of Trust.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034866\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/426/#p428\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1703 (stating that Authority's obligations \"are not general obligations\" but \"are limited obligations payable solely from payments\" of the City's rent and \"property pledged pursuant to\" Defendants' deeds of trust).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   At this point, it is useful to keep in mind the overarching structure of the financing transactions: Recall that the Authority was simultaneously assigning to UMB Bank the golf course rent it received from the City. (Trust Agreement, \u00a7 101). Thus, \u00a7 1001(c) made bond payments due from the Authority only to the extent that the money came from (1) rent payments made by the City, or (2) the secured property (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the golf course secured by the Authority Deed of Trust, and City Hall secured by the City Deed of Trust).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   This reading-and resulting nonliability of the Authority for failure to make bond payments if such failure stemmed from the City's failure to make rent payments-is confirmed by \u00a7 1003. It commands that the \"Authority\n   <em>\n    shall have no obligation or liability\n   </em>\n   to the Trustee [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , UMB Bank] or the Bondholders with respect to the payment of the [rent] by the City when due or with respect to the performance by the City of any other covenant made by it in the Lease Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034866\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/426/#p428\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1703. As the Authority puts it, \"if the City fails to pay rent, the Authority is not in breach for failing to make [bond] payments\" (dkt. 20 at 2), since the Authority's money simply comes from the City's rent payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Various failures to act against the City\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \"Additionally,\" Plaintiffs write, \"the Authority failed to (a) ensure that the City complied with its obligations under the Lease Agreement, (b) cancel the Lease Agreement once the City defaulted on its rent obligations, and (c) exclude the City from possession of the golf course.\" (Dkt. 18 at 5). Once again, other than appending to this assertion a few citations to the record, Plaintiffs make no effort to expound or elaborate upon it. Their contentions are therefore ineffectually raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034866\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/426/#p428\">\n    575 F.3d at 428-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.* ;\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , 716 F.3d at 809 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   From what the Court can divine from these assertions, they fail on the merits as well. Section 1001(e) of the Trust Agreement states, in pertinent part, that the Authority \"will require to City to perform its duties and obligations under the Lease Agreement and that it will not agree to any abatement, reduction, abrogation, waiver, diminution or other modification of the obligation of the City to make rental payments and to meet any of its obligations under the Lease Agreement.\" So to breach this provision, the Authority had to fail to force the City to do something that the Lease required the City to do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Ensuring City's compliance with the Lease\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs' brief does not specify which of the City's obligations under the Lease that the Authority purportedly failed to \"ensure\" the City complied with. The crux of this case, of course, is Plaintiffs' contention that the City is legally obliged to appropriate rent payments, a point which has already been dispatched. Since the City had no legally enforceable obligation to pay rent, the Authority could not have breached the Trust Agreement by failing to make the City do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Cancelling the Lease for nonpayment; excluding the City from the golf course\n   </em>\n   . This reference alludes to \u00a7 6.2(b) of the Lease, permitting-upon an \"event of default\"-termination of the Lease, ejection of the City from the golf course, and sale of the course. There are several deficiencies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   To the extent this theory turns upon nonpayment of rent, \u00a7 6.1(c) reveals that nonpayment is not an event of default triggering the actions under \u00a7 6.2(b). Section 7.1 would instead apply, and while it grants the Authority \"the right\" to terminate the Lease, it does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the Authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   To the extent this theory relies on a non-rent obligation of the City, \u00a7 6.2 does not require the Authority to take action, and it indeed permits Plaintiffs-of their own accord-to perform the acts they complain the Authority has failed to take.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Whenever any event of default shall have happened and is continuing,\n   <em>\n    the Trustee\n   </em>\n   [Plaintiff UMB Bank] (or the Authority acting\n   <em>\n    at the direction of the Trustee\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   , with the prior written consent of the\n   <em>\n    Bond Insurer\n   </em>\n   [Plaintiff ACA], and\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    at the direction of the Bond Insurer\n   </em>\n   , take any one or more of the following remedial steps ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   (emphasis added). The Authority only \"may\"-not must-act upon Plaintiff UMB Bank's direction. It only \"shall\" act upon direction from Plaintiff ACA. The Complaint does not allege, and Plaintiffs have not argued, that either of these preconditions to action by the Authority have occurred. So it hardly could be a breach for the Authority to have failed to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Of course, if Plaintiffs wanted to take over the golf course, \u00a7 6.2 allows them to do so upon their own agreement.\n   <em>\n    See also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 8.1(a), 9.4.

Breach of City and Authority Deeds of Trust (Count 3 and 4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Counts 3 and 4 posit that Defendants breached the terms of their respective deeds of trust. But these counts also do not state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Environmental study and compliance with other laws\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Section 1.14.3 of the Authority Deed of Trust and \u00a7 1.15.3 of the City Deed of Trust require, under certain circumstances, Defendants to conduct an environmental study if reasonably requested by Plaintiff UMB Bank. The Complaint contained a single reference to these provisions, which is nothing more than a legal conclusion as to its content. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 22, 33). Despite nominally requesting injunctive relief on this score against only the City,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Prayer for Relief (m), the Complaint contains no facts supporting this theory (such as whether a request for a study has even been made), and Plaintiffs' brief does not defend it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 18 at 7-9). Therefore, the Court finds the theory conceded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Turning to \u00a7 1.11 of both deeds of trust, paragraphs 21 and 32 of the Complaint similarly contain solitary, conclusory references to its content, characterized by Plaintiffs as requiring Defendants to comply with all federal, state, and local laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). To defend this theory, Plaintiffs only meekly refer to their cursory legal conclusion that the Authority did not comply with federal law. (Dkt. 18 at 8-9). This is insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   As the Complaint contains no facts supporting a breach of \u00a7 1.11, this theory will be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Payments and other, unspecified breach of other agreements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs quote their Complaint's own legal conclusion that the Authority breached its Deed of Trust \"in a number of material ways, including, but not limited to, by breaching the covenant to faithfully observe and perform all the covenants in the Authority Deed of Trust.\" (Dkt. 18 at 7 (quoting Complaint \u00b6 97) ). That is, Plaintiffs\n   say the Authority has breached its covenant to abide by its other covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The substance of these \"other covenants\" remains a mystery. Plaintiffs merely refer to portions of the Deed of Trust, and parenthetically characterize them as defining a default as any failure of the Authority's covenants, duties, or warranties (or any event of default under the other financing agreements)-all without ever identifying the substantive content of whatever duty, warranty, representation was supposedly transgressed. This is little more than a shell game: Plaintiffs assert that the Authority Deed of Trust contains unspecified obligations intrinsic and extrinsic to it, but they never put a finger on what those supposed obligations are, or how they were violated. They do not craft an argument or advance a legal theory, but instead assert a bald conclusion. It is not the Court's role to do the former for Plaintiffs, and the Court declines the invitation to adopt the latter on faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiffs next recycle the argument that Defendants owe them payments. (Dkt. 17 at 25-26; dkt. 18 at 7-8). This is so under the Deeds of Trust, they claim, because these agreements incorporate the bond payment obligations in the Trust Agreement. As explained earlier, the Trust Agreement (and the Lease or Forbearance Agreements, for that matter) do not contain a binding obligation on the Authority to make payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs block quote sections of the City Deed of Trust in hopes of establishing an entitlement to payment. (Dkt. 17 at 25-27). Those quotations are accompanied by Plaintiffs' pattern of exerting no effort to identify an actual legal theory of their claim, explain why the contract entitles them to relief, or otherwise analyze the text of the operative documents.

By failing to do so, Plaintiffs waived the matter.\n   <em>\n    Ozmint\n   </em>\n   , 716 F.3d at 809 n.12 ;\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034866\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/426/#p428\">\n    575 F.3d at 428-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.* ;\n   <em>\n    Beaudett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41769\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/1274/#p1278\">\n    775 F.2d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For one, the portions they quote do not impose a freestanding obligation to pay on the City. Section 4.6 explains only that UMB Bank may, upon default, \"institute\" a lawsuit to seek \"collection of sums\n   <em>\n    so due\n   </em>\n   and unpaid\" before seeking foreclosure. That is unremarkable. In plain English, UMB Bank can file a lawsuit to seek money\n   <em>\n    owed\n   </em>\n   without having to first foreclose. But \u00a7 4.6 does not establish what, if anything, UMB Bank is actually owed. Similarly, \u00a7 4.10 makes cumulative whatever rights and remedies UMB Bank has, but it does not create or define the contours of those rights and remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Additionally, the documents cross-referenced in these provisions do not establish a binding obligation on the City to pay. Section 4.6 refers to defaults under \"the Bonds, this Deed of Trust or the Trust Agreement,\" and \u00a7 4.10 refers to securing the Bonds and obligations \"under the Basic Agreements\" (meaning the City Deed of Trust, the Trust Agreement, the Bonds, and the Lease Agreement). As explained throughout this opinion, those documents do not contain a legally enforceable obligation against the City to appropriate rent payments. The Bonds are the only such documents not discussed above. But unsurprisingly and in congruence with the other agreements, the Bonds make clear that the City is not obliged to make appropriations and that the Authority is not liable for the City's failure to appropriate. (Dkt. 103 at ECF 59-60, 63, 68-69, 72).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   So, to refresh, Plaintiffs cannot establish that the City had anything more than a moral obligation to repay them. Subjected to detailed examination, Plaintiffs' theory is like a defective Rube Goldberg device-a confounding, complicated web of contractual cross-references that ultimately fails to accomplish its goal.

Moreover, the Complaint does not contain facts identifying what conduct Defendants undertook after the 2011 Forbearance Agreement that unfairly forestalled action by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs complain that the City has \"unfairly and belatedly challenged the validity\" of unspecified Financing Agreements (by which they must mean the City Deed of Trust), notwithstanding legal opinions to the contrary provided by the City to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Complaint \u00b6 127) ). Plaintiffs cite no authority (much less controlling Virginia precedent) for the proposition that making legal arguments to defend one's position is a breach of good faith, and the Court has found none.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shibata v.

These are sophisticated parties: a national bank; an insurance company; municipal entities represented by in-house counsel and a prominent regional law firm. They entered into complicated (yet entirely rational) agreements, with calculated risks and benefits to each side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Through a bond purchase, a bank loaned several million dollars to a municipality for a golf course, to be repaid through \"rent\" payments (in truth, municipal appropriations) and backed by municipal property as collateral. The bank further protected itself from the danger of municipal nonpayment with bond insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The bond insurer received premiums from the bank but agreed to be on the hook for servicing the bonds if municipal appropriations ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Finally, the municipality got an infusion of cash for its golf course, with an unenforceable \"moral\" obligation to repay the funds, but one backstopped by the threat of the bank and insurer coming after its property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The parties' central arguments in this case would upset the delicate balance created by these interlocking agreements. Ultimately, the Court does not agree with Plaintiffs' position that the agreements imposed on Defendants a legally enforceable repayment obligation. But the Court also does not agree with Defendants' position that the City Deed of Trust is void. For those reasons and the additional ones set forth above, this case will be dismissed.

The intricacies of Virginia law governing localities may provide an answer. According to the City, localities generally are able to create debts, or \"bonds,\" by a mere resolution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2602, 15.2-2636 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Va. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 10 (setting limitations on localities' ability to accrue debt). But if a locality's charter mandates a referendum, the charter controls. Va. Code \u00a7 15.2-2661. As it turns out, the City's charter requires that \"any bonded indebtedness shall be by referendum and passed by a majority of the qualified voters voting in the referendum.\" City of Buena Vista (Va.) Charter, \u00a7 2.214. Thus, structuring a bonded debt as only a moral obligation avoids the additional (and perhaps politically challenging) task of referendum approval.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    One tradeoff of this arrangement is that the would-be creditor of a moral obligation debt exposes itself to significantly greater risk of nonpayment.

Article VII grants the Authority-and thus UMB Bank, per \u00a7 8.1(a)(4)-the right to terminate the City's leasehold, exclude it from the golf course with ACA's consent, and then sell or lease the course.

As already explained, none of those documents contains an enforceable payment obligation on the City regarding the loans. Indeed, as hopefully is by now apparent, the documents all contemplated the same overarching structure and function, as further illustrated by their matching, intertwined payment schedules of the City's rent flowing to the Authority (per the Lease Agreement) then to UMB Bank (per the Trust Agreement) to pay off the Bonds.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Lease Agreement, Ex.
