LAPORTE, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Miguel Valadez, Nora Ledesma, Manuel Ledesma, Anthony Green, Jr.,\n   and Eleaquin Temblador (\"Plaintiffs\") moved for partial summary judgment on their employment status in this wage and hour case. Defendant CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (\"Defendant\") moved to strike or dismiss Plaintiffs' representative Private Attorney General Act of 2003 (\"PAGA\") claims. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (\"CSXIT\"), a federally registered motor carrier, provides intermodal transport\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   services to shippers that use railroads to transport freight in and out of California. The portion of the intermodal move that takes place by truck is known as drayage. Defendant's customers request drayage services based on railroads' arrival and departure schedules. Drayage drivers (\"Drivers\") then drive a truck that is hooked up to a trailer or container (which may or may not contain freight) either (i) from a rail ramp to a location in California, or (ii) from a location in California to a rail ramp for later transport out of state. Dkt. 65-4, Hand Decl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant previously contracted with Drivers, whom it categorized as independent contractors. Defendant did not own its own trucks. Instead, Drivers owned trucks that they leased to Defendant pursuant to Contractor Operating Lease Agreements (\"COLAs\"). The COLAs provided for compensation per load (i.e., \"linehaul\"), as well as for other types of payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. As of September 15, 2016, Defendant ceased using Drivers, and now uses only third-party trucking companies to conduct drayage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The agent trucking companies operate under their own Department of Transportation authority. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 1 at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs worked as Drivers. Valadez performed drayage services for Defendant from approximately 2005 to October 2013. Dkt. 65-4, Hand Decl. \u00b6 16. Green performed drayage services for Defendant from approximately October 2013 to February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Nora Ledesma performed drayage services for Defendant from approximately 2003 to March 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Manuel Ledesma performed drayage services from approximately 2003 to March 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Temblador performed drayage services for Defendant from approximately 1994 to September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During their relationships with Defendant, each Plaintiff entered into successive COLAs with Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18-21. Plaintiffs did not negotiate rates with Defendant's customers for delivery or pickup. Plaintiffs never invoiced clients when they were working for Defendant. All Plaintiffs documented their deliveries and pickups on the application on the tablets or forms provided by Defendant. It was each Plaintiff's understanding that he or she needed to \"only use the tablet and/or forms provided by\" Defendant. Defendant required Plaintiffs to notify\n   <strong>\n    it\n   </strong>\n   in advance if Plaintiffs would not be able to perform drayage services at any time or for any reason. N. Ledesma Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-5, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; M.

N. Ledesma Decl. \u00b6 6. She did not receive any drayage assignments from Defendant after it notified her that her COLA was being terminated. N. Ledesma Decl. \u00b6 6. Manuel Ledesma states that he notified Defendant in March 2014 that he would no longer work for it on account of its treatment of Nora Ledesma. M. Ledesma Decl. \u00b6 6. Green states that Defendant notified him in February 2015 that it was terminating his COLA because his work was too slow. Green Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. He did not receive any drayage assignments from Defendant after it notified him that his COLA was being terminated. Green Decl. \u00b6 9. Valadez states that Defendant notified him in September 2013 that it was terminating his COLA because he refused to obtain a new truck. Valadez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. He did not receive any drayage assignments from Defendant after it notified him that his COLA was being terminated. Valadez Decl. \u00b6 9. Temblador asserts that Defendant notified her in August 2016 that it was terminating her COLA due to a change in its business model and that it was terminating the contracts of all other California Drivers at approximately the same time. Temblador Decl. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 24, 2011, Nora Ledesma entered a COLA with Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 at 1. The term of the COLA was 30 days, but the COLA provided that it would automatically renew for successive 30 day periods unless otherwise terminated. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 1. The COLA stated that the parties were forming an independent contractor relationship and not an employer-employee relationship. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 2. Accordingly, as the contractor, Nora Ledesma was responsible for all taxes she owed. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 2. The COLA provided that the parties' relationship would be in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The COLA provided Nora Ledesma with the \"sole discretion\" to accept any shipments from Defendant that Defendant made available to her but that she was required to perform any work she accepted \"in accordance with the terms\" of the COLA \"and in a manner that reasonably ensures continued satisfaction\" of Defendant's customers. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 4. Nora Ledesma was also required to provide \"all transportation, loading and unloading, and other services\" necessary in connection with the shipment. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The COLA required Nora Ledesma to furnish, at her discretion, all drivers and personnel required to operate any vehicle she used. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 5A. Defendant retained the right to \"disqualify any driver provided by\" her 'in the event that the driver is found to be unsafe, unqualified, unfit, uninsurable, or marginal, pursuant to federal or state law or the criteria established by the [Department of Transportation's] CSA DIRS, in violation of [Defendant's] minimum qualification standards, or in violation of any policies of [Defendant's] customers.\" N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 5C. The COLA specified that drivers \"with a recent history of accidents, traffic convictions and/or serious traffic offenses\" would not meet its minimum qualification standards. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 5C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The COLA required Nora Ledesma to provide a vehicle with a \"computer/satellite\n   communicating device that is compatible with the system utilized by\" Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 5D.

Pursuant to various laws, the COLA provided that she would have her vehicle inspected as often as federal, state, and local laws required, that she would submit her vehicle to safety inspections by Defendant, and that she would not have any passengers in her vehicle without prior permission from Defendant. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 6C, 6D, 6F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the event of an accident, the COLA required Nora Ledesma to immediately notify appropriate public safety agencies, immediately notify Defendant, and submit a written accident report to Defendant as soon as possible after the occurrence. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 6G. She also had to \"cooperate fully with [Defendant] with respect to any legal action, regulatory hearing or other similar proceeding arising from the operation of the Vehicle, the relationship created by [the COLA], or the Services performed thereunder.\" N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 6G. In addition, upon Defendant's request, she had to provide Defendant with \"written reports or affidavits, attend hearings and trials and assist in securing evidence or obtaining the attendance of witnesses.\" N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 6G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the COLA, she was responsible for her operating costs, including but not limited to \"fuel, oil, tires and all equipment and accessories and devises used in connection with the operation of the Vehicle,\" purchasing the vehicle, all mobile communications equipment and service costs, all insurance deductibles, costs that exceed insurance coverage, and costs that are not covered by insurance.

Green entered into a COLA with Defendant on October 2, 2013. Green Decl. Ex. 1. at 1. Valadez entered into a COLA with Defendant on September 26, 2011. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 6 at 1. Their COLAs were identical to Nora Ledesma's for all terms set forth above. Defendant's corporate designee testified that the language was consistent from COLA to COLA and that he was not aware of any driver negotiating any terms that were different than those initially presented to them. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 1 at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Temblador entered into a COLA with Defendant on April 21, 2015. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 at 1. The COLA provided that it would be for a term of one year. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 1. It also required that Temblador have a tablet computer that was \"(i) capable of hosting [Defendant's] then current mobile application (\"Application\"); and (ii) capable of providing real time communications from the time [Temblador] agrees to transport a shipment until delivery at destination for the reporting and recording of delivery status updates provided in accordance with customer requirements.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 5F. The COLA gave her the option of purchasing the tablet and services through Defendant and paying Defendant for them directly or providing her own tablet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 5F. She was required to carry the tablet in her vehicle at all times while providing services. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 5F. The tablet had to be functional and transmitting location information and delivery status information to Defendants \"on a real time basis from the time [Temblador] agrees to transport a shipment until ultimate delivery.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 5F. She was prohibited from viewing or accessing the tablet while the vehicle was in motion. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 5F. She acknowledged that the satellite device and tablet were capable of providing information regarding the location of her vehicle and the tablet itself, and consented to have that information made available to Defendant \"solely for purposes of ensuring compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to, verifying compliance with hours of service requirements), locating assets of [Defendant], identifying Vehicles available for dispatch and for providing delivery status updates as may be required by customers.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 5G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rather than providing that the parties would have to agree to any modifications to the Rate Schedule, Temblador's COLA stated that Defendant was allowed to unilaterally issue a new Rate Schedule upon 30 days' notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 7A. The COLA provided that either party could terminate the COLA upon 30 days' written notice by certified mail to the other party's last known address. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 8 \u00b6 14. In all other respects, the COLA signed by Temblador COLA was substantially similar to the one signed by Nora Ledesma and the other Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant's corporate designee described how the parties used \"Dispatch,\" an application built specifically for Defendants. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 1 at p. 18. Dispatch was loaded onto tablets, specifically different versions of the Galaxy Note tablet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Dispatchers working for Defendant would \"push\" offers to take loads to drivers via Dispatch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, 60. The driver could accept or decline a specific load.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Via Dispatch, the driver would\n   indicate when he was en route to the pickup location, when he had arrived at the pickup location, and any time a similar \"event happened.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Defendant retained the data from Dispatch for the entire claim period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Defendant also retained \"move history data\" for each driver, which showed \"each driver's name, tractor code, trip number, origin stop location, origin actual arrival date and time, origin actual departure date and time, destination stop name, destination stop location, destination actual departure date and time, and miles traveled, among other details.\" Def. Mot. at 19, note 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dispatch also had a messaging feature, by which dispatchers communicated with drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. Dispatchers were in contact with drivers routinely, either by text or phone call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. Message logs from Dispatch show that dispatchers frequently sent messages to all drivers at once about whether they had \"moves,\" \"loads\" or \"work\" available and communicated with drivers directly regarding particular jobs. Hand Decl. Exs. 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant paid drivers once a week. Hand Decl. Exs. 1-7. The statements show the amount the driver received for \"linehaul,\" and extras such as fuel surcharges and \"power detentions.\" Hand Decl. Ex. 1. at 1. They also show how much Defendant deducted from each driver's pay for liability insurance, accident insurance, and escrow payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs classified themselves as self-employed on their tax returns and deducted various business expenses. Sommerfeld Decl. Exs. 7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's Safety Handbook (the \"Handbook\") stated that the rules it contained must be observed by all personnel in the performance of their duties and all \"[v]endors, manufacturers' representatives, visitors, outside contractors, and others\" while on Defendant's facilities. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 at 1. It contained both \"safety rules,\" which were mandatory, and \"safe work practices,\" which were suggestions. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 at 1. It provided that a violation of the Handbook was grounds for termination. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It contained a specific section for \"Draymen.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L. The introduction to the Draymen section stated, \"Draymen are an integral part of Intermodal operations and must be aware of and comply with the following rules while operating on CSX Intermodal Terminals Inc. terminals. Willful negligence may result in draymen being banned from CSX Intermodal Terminals Inc. property.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L. The section contained numerous directions for how Draymen should open doors, where they should stand, and when to sound their horns, as well as safety guidelines to observe when raising landing gear. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L. For example, it prohibited Draymen from littering, and stated that failure to comply would result in disciplinary action. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L-10. It also prohibited Draymen from wearing open-toed shoes, sandals, or flip-flops on Defendant's facilities and recommended that they wear steel toe safety shoes. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L-14. It required that they keep the floors and dashboards of their vehicles clear. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L-23. It also prohibited Draymen from possessing or using personal bolt cutters while on Defendant's property. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant had an accident policy for independent contractors and their hired drivers that required drivers to report all accidents to Defendant, no matter how minor, and required drivers to prepare a Driver's Accident Report. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10. at 1. The report had to include a CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. Motor Carrier Accident Report, a description of the accident, including a narrative and\n   drawing, photographs of the accident scene, the police report and any citations issued, logs from the previous 24 hours and the day of the accident, and any other relevant information, such as witness statements. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10. at 1. A failure to make that report could result in the termination of the COLA. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10 at 2. Defendant also established an Accident Review Board to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an accident was \"Preventable\" or \"Non-Preventable.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10 at 2. Drivers could review a determination that the accident was Preventable. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10 at 2. Defendant could disqualify any driver who caused a Preventable accident. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10 at 3. Defendant also had a controlled substance use and alcohol testing policy that primarily mirrored federal regulations but established Post Accident Testing and Return to Work criteria that were \"Company Policy, above the requirements of the FMCSR.\" Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 13 \u00a7\u00a7 IV.C.4, 5 (CSXIT00856).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this case as a putative class action in Alameda Superior Court on September 30, 2015, and Defendant removed it to this Court under the Class Action Fairness Act on November 25, 2015. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on January 29, 2016, to which Plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on January 29, 2016. Thereafter, the Court granted the Parties' stipulations allowing Plaintiffs to file a second and then third amended complaint on March 7, 2016 and March 22, 2016, respectively. On December 16, 2016, the Court granted the Parties' stipulation allowing Plaintiffs to file a fourth amended complaint. This is the operative complaint. In it, Plaintiffs assert the following claims based on Defendant's alleged misclassification of its Drivers as independent contractors rather than employees: (i) reimbursement of business expenses ( California Labor Code Section 2802 ); (ii) unlawful deductions from wages ( California Labor Code Section 221 ); (iii) failure to provide off-duty meal periods ( California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512 ); (iv) failure to provide off-duty paid rest periods ( California labor Code Section 226.7 ); (v) failure to pay minimum wage ( California Labor Code Sections 1182.11, 1194 ); (vi) failure to timely provide wage statements ( California Labor Code Section 226 ); (vii) violation of the California Unfair Competition Law; and (viii) PAGA claims as representatives of similarly situated Drivers. On October 26, 2017, the Court granted the parties' stipulation to strike Plaintiffs' class claims from Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their current motion for partial summary judgment on employment status. That same day, Defendant filed a motion to strike or dismiss Plaintiffs' PAGA claims. On February 13, 2018, both parties filed their oppositions to each other's motions. On February 20, 2018, both parties filed their replies in support of their own motions. On March 6, 2018, the Court held a hearing on both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO STRIKE OR DISMISS PLAINTIFFS' PAGA CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (\"PAGA\"), an \"aggrieved employee\" may bring a civil action personally and on behalf of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties for Labor Code violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Lab. Code, \u00a7 2699(a). The Labor and Workforce Development Agency (\"LWDA\") receives seventy-five percent of the civil penalties recovered, and the aggrieved employees receive the remainder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2699(I). Defendant moves to strike\n   or dismiss Plaintiffs' PAGA claims on the grounds that, because Plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of 56 Drivers, adjudication of the claims on a representative basis would be unmanageable and would interfere with Defendant's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The COLA Defendant cites in support of that assertion provides for termination upon 30 days' notice. Hand MSJ Decl. Ex. G. Otherwise, the difference in notice are between 15 days and 30 days. More importantly, none of them required any reason for termination. Defendant also states that the Court will have to take into account the fact that some of the COLAs had different lengths than the others. For support, Defendant cites to the one COLA that provided for a one-year term. All the others provided for 30-day terms that automatically renewed. As the shorter COLAs automatically renewed and the Plaintiffs who performed drayage services under those COLAs all worked for Defendant for at least one year, these modest variations in the COLAs are not significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant also argues that, to determine employment status, the Court will have to inquire into each of the 56 Driver's \"day-to-day, week-to-week routines, activities and interactions\" with Defendant.

Plaintiffs respond that they do not need to show whether Defendant exercised its control by retaliating against Drivers for turning down loads because they will be able to show that Defendant had the power to do so, and differences in whether Defendant exercised that power do not matter. Defendant also argues points out that some Drivers made decisions to maximize their profits and that many Drivers subjectively believed they were creating independent contractor relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The differences that Defendant raises do not make the determination of whether all Drivers were independent contractors or employees unmanageable.

Plaintiffs assert claims for wage statement violations, missed meal periods, rest breaks, unreimbursed business expenses, and working unproductive time for which they were not compensated. Defendant acknowledges that the wage statement violation claim \"succeeds or fails\" based on employment status, but argues that the rest break, meal period, and business expense claims are not susceptible to common proof. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant imposed the same policies or lack of policies with respect to all Drivers relative to these wage laws, so Defendant's arguments as to variations in the frequency of violations or the penalties per Driver do not make the case unmanageable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briseno v.

Drivers supplied their own equipment and are not required to wear Grubhub clothes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They were not required to work in a particular location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They were allowed to work for other companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drivers believed that they were independent contractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court held that these factors were not dispositive and denied Grubhub's motion because there existed \"\n   <em>\n    at the very least\n   </em>\n   sufficient indicia of an employment relationship\" for a reasonable jury to find the existence of such a relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   After conducting a trial in that same case, the court found that Lawson was an independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    Lawson v.

Cal. Feb. 8, 2018). The evidence at trial showed that Grubhub had retained much less control than had appeared at summary judgment. An amended version of the agreement was in place during most of Lawson's tenure with Grubhub.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The amended agreement removed language suggesting that drivers had to sign up for weekly blocks and could not reject incoming orders during their blocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The amendment also changed the way that drivers were compensated by emailing them a service fee for each delivery, which they could accept or reject.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Grubhub provided uniforms and training videos, it was not mandatory that drivers wear them or watch them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. Drivers were not required to mark their vehicles with any Grubhub logo or use Grubhub insulated food warming bags.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Grubhub allowed delivery workers to make their deliveries by car, motorcycle, bicycle or scooter and never saw, let alone inspected, the vehicles that drivers used.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. Grubhub did not control whether anyone accompanied drivers on their deliveries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The court detailed how Lawson's individual experiences with Grubhub demonstrated Grubhub's lack of control. Although Lawson signed the initial contract in August 2015, Lawson did not begin making deliveries for Grubhub until two months after he signed the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. During those months, Grubhub did not contact Lawson when he did not sign up for any blocks or terminate his contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lawson determined when to work for Grubhub and for how long.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. Grubhub \"had no control over what blocks, if any\" Lawson signed up for.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. No Grubhub employee ever evaluated Lawson's performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   When Lawson did sign up to perform deliveries, Grubhub sent him offers through the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Grubhub would tell Lawson where to pick up the food and where to deliver it but Grubhub did not dictate any route to use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Grubhub also did not have rules for how quickly Lawson had to pick up or deliver the food.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Grubhub did not require that any delivery \"be made in a particular amount of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Grubhub established a system to guarantee that drivers who accepted 75% of the delivery offers they received during their blocks earned at least a $15 per hour wage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. However, Grubhub retained so little oversight of its drivers that \"[f]or weeks, if not months, Mr. Lawson was able to perform little to no deliveries and yet get compensated as if he had been available for entire blocks-and sometimes even past his scheduled blocks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Lawson also performed deliveries for Grubhub's competitors during his tenure with Grubhub including many times during the Grubhub blocks he had signed up for.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The court found that Grubhub controlled some aspects of Lawson's work, including how much he was paid, how much customers paid for delivery services, when to schedule blocks, and geographic boundaries of delivery zones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court also found that Grubhub's right to terminate the agreement with Lawson at will suggested an employment relationship but, as the right was mutual, Lawson did not work for Grubhub full time, and had no significant investment at risk, the right to terminate at will was neutral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The court held that the right to control, which is the most important factor, weighed heavily in favor of finding that Lawson was an independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15. The court distinguished the control that Grubhub retained from the control that the defendants retained in both\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   , where Federal Express controlled \"drivers' appearance, route, schedule, and even what truck they could drive,\" and\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , where the employer \"controlled the drivers' schedules, routes, equipment, including delivery vehicles, and even 'every exquisite detail\" of the drivers' appearance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The court also considered the secondary\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15. Several of those factors suggested an employment relationship. Lawson was not engaged in a distinct occupation or business; the occupation required little skill; Grubhub paid Lawson weekly based on a combined hourly wage and per delivery rate; and Lawson's servicers were part of Grubhub's regular business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15-18. Other factors weighed in favor of finding that Lawson was an independent contractor. Lawson's work was not performed under a principal's direction or supervision; Lawson provided his own tools and equipment; and the agreement reflected a \"lack of permanence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court found that the parties' intent was neutral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *18. After weighing all the secondary factors, the court determined that Lawson was an independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The following undisputed facts point toward classifying Plaintiffs as employees. The COLAs governing Plaintiffs' relationships with Defendant allowed Defendant to terminate Plaintiffs without cause, in most cases on 15 days' notice. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 14. The COLAs also required Plaintiffs to abide by Defendant's safety rules, which Defendant could amend unilaterally. N. Ledesma Decl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 6B. Defendant's safety rules, which were set out in the Handbook,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   had a specific section establishing rules for Draymen, which included requirements to keep the floors and dashboards of their vehicles clear and prohibitions on possessing personal bolt cutters or wearing open-toed shoes, sandals, or flip-flops. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7\u00a7 L-14, 23, 24. Plaintiffs were subject to \"disciplinary action\" if they violated Defendant's handbook. Kaufmann\n   Decl. Ex. 4 \u00a7 L-10. Plaintiffs were also subject to an accident policy, which required them to submitting detailed accident reports, with drawings and photographs of the accident. Defendant also reviewed, in its sole discretion, whether the accidents were preventable and could disqualify drivers who were involved in a preventable accident. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 10 at 3. Plaintiffs were also subject to Defendant's alcohol and controlled substance use policies, some of which were, by Defendant's own admission, \"Company Policy, above the requirements\" of federal regulations. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 13 \u00a7\u00a7 IV.C. 4, 5. Plaintiffs were also subject to insurance and inspection requirements, although it is not clear whether any of those exceeded the requirements of applicable law. Defendant required Plaintiffs to consent to Defendant's constant monitoring of their location through the Dispatch application, which was specifically designed for Defendant. Plaintiffs received all their offers through Dispatch. Defendant chose which loads to offer to which Plaintiffs at which time. Plaintiffs never negotiated directly with customers. Defendant paid Plaintiffs on a weekly basis at rates of pay established by Defendant unilaterally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   At the same time, other undisputed facts point toward Plaintiffs being independent contractors. Plaintiffs did not have to work on days that they did not want to. Plaintiffs could reject any load that Defendant offered them, although whether Defendant retaliated against Plaintiffs for doing so is disputed. When they did accept a load, Plaintiffs could choose the route they took from pickup to delivery. Defendant did not \"ride along\" with Plaintiffs or otherwise evaluate Plaintiffs. Defendant did not train Plaintiffs, other than on how to use Defendant's application. Defendant did not require Plaintiff to attend meetings. Defendant did not impose any grooming or uniform requirements. Plaintiffs could hire employees and work for other companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs were also able to terminate the COLAs without cause upon written notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Right to Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Court must first determine what level of control was necessary for the services that Plaintiffs' performed.

At the same time, customer service was an important aspect of the business relationship in those cases, whereas here Plaintiffs did not interact with members of the general public. The only customer service requirements that Plaintiffs were expected to meet were to be on time to pick up their loads and drop them off and to not damage their cargo en route. Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 2, Hand Depo. at 60:18-61:8. Furthermore, Defendant did not evaluate Plaintiffs' performance, which indicates a lack of control. Defendant exercised some control over Plaintiffs' work by offering Plaintiffs specific loads to carry, with the times and locations for pickup and delivery already set. Plaintiffs were free to choose their own routes although Defendant retained the right to track Plaintiffs' location at all times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendant did not control Plaintiffs' appearance as in\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Villalpando\n   </em>\n   . However, interacting with the public was not a part of Plaintiffs' responsibilities, unlike the drivers for FedEx and furniture delivery, so controlling Plaintiffs' appearance through uniforms and grooming requirements was not necessary. Similarly, because Plaintiffs' trucks are tractors to which they attach the large cargo containers, it was not necessary to control the interior of their trucks, as FedEx did in\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Kaufmann Decl. Ex. 12 at CSXIT 00842-43.

Thus, Defendant's policies exceed those legally required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   A reasonable jury could infer from these strict requirements that Defendant retained significant control over the manner in which Plaintiffs drove and maintained their trucks by subjecting Plaintiffs to discipline for causing preventable accidents or having safety violations and requiring them to have no measurable alcohol concentration while on duty. However, a reasonable jury could also infer that Defendant's policies, even the ones that exceed the exact requirements set out in the regulations, do not evince significant control because they are designed to implement the regulations' more general direction that motor carriers have \"adequate safety management controls\" in place in order to make sure that their drivers are meeting the regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20385.5\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

There, the plaintiff established his own schedule and decided which policies he wanted to sell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1100.

They had the freedom not only to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   work on certain days or at certain times, but also the freedom\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   work at times of their choosing. By contrast, Plaintiffs controlled their schedules only by deciding whether or not to accept loads when Defendant offered them. Although dispatchers attempted to accommodate Plaintiffs' preferences, that is evidence of Defendant's exercise of its right to control. Moreover, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff could go months without working for the defendant or contacting the defendant at all, Defendant could expect Plaintiffs to be available to work unless it heard otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs stated in their declarations that they had to notify Defendant if they wanted to take a day off. Defendant agrees that Plaintiffs notified Defendant before taking time off. Opp. at 8 (citing Hand Opp. Decl. Ex. 8). Accordingly, Defendant retained a greater right to control Plaintiff's schedule than the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Hennigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Beaumont-Jacques\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   While Plaintiffs make a strong case that Defendant retained all necessary control over their work and might well prevail on this issue at trial, drawing all inferences in Defendant's favor, the evidence is not so strong that a reasonable jury could not determine that Defendant did not do so. For example, the jury could give significant weight to the facts that Plaintiffs chose their own routes, could reject specific offers, and did not have their performance evaluated. Because the right to control is the most important part of the multi-factor test, the fact that it does not necessarily point in one direction is a strong indication that summary judgment is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Secondary Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Similarly, the secondary factors are mixed and do not so clearly favor a finding that Plaintiffs are employees that no reasonable jury could disagree. Several factors support a finding that Plaintiffs are employees. Plaintiffs' work was integral to Defendant's business. The relationships were fairly permanent, with each lasting at least over a year. Defendant provided some of the\n   <strong>\n    i\n   </strong>\n   nstrumentalities of the work, although it required Plaintiffs to pay it for them. Defendant supplied the location of the work, dictating to Plaintiffs where they should pick up loads and where they should deliver them. Defendant had a broad right to terminate Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Yet several factors favor a finding that Plaintiffs are independent contractors. The strongest of these is that Plaintiffs must make a substantial investment in their trucks. The next strongest, especially when taken in the light most favorable to Defendant, is that Plaintiffs have an opportunity for profit or loss depending on their managerial skill. Further, Plaintiffs are engaged in a distinct occupation or business. Other factors weigh slightly in favor of an independent contractor status. For example, Plaintiffs must have some specialized training, although the overall skill level of the work is not high. Defendant paid Plaintiffs by the job rather than the hour. However, since it is undisputed that Defendant paid Plaintiffs every week, which is more like an employment relationship, this factor does not weigh strongly in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs entered into COLAs that stated that they were independent contractors and several Plaintiffs and other Drivers testified that they subjectively intended to form an independent contractor relationship. However, neither a contract label nor the parties' subjective beliefs are dispositive when the parties' conduct establishes a different relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055730\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1093/#p1105\">\n    754 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1105 ;\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186225\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/981/#p988\">\n    765 F.3d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Because some of the secondary factors weigh in favor of finding an independent contractor status, and the right to control, which is the most important factor, could support a finding of either status, a reasonable jury could that Plaintiffs are independent contractors. Accordingly, while Plaintiffs make a strong argument, the Court cannot determine that Plaintiffs are employees as a matter of law. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on employment status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    V. DEFENDANT'S RULE 56(D) REQUEST\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Defendant sought relief under Rule 56(D), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   (1) defer considering the motion or deny it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   (3) issue any other appropriate order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). Because the Court is denying Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's request as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. PLAINTIFFS' EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Plaintiffs object to the Declaration of Paul Hand, Defendant's corporate designee, filed in support of Defendant's Opposition, on the ground that Hand lacks personal knowledge of the matters in his declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 602 ; Pltf. Rep. at 3-4, notes 4-6. In the declaration, Hand states that he has personal knowledge of the matters he describes and explains why. Hand Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-5. Plaintiff argues an earlier deposition by Hand shows that he does not have personal knowledge of those matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kaufmann Decl. Ex. C. That deposition shows that Hand did not personally supervise Defendant's operations in California, but does not establish that Hand did not have knowledge of the practices in California from ten years of working for Defendant. The Court\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' objections to this declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. ADMINISTRATIVE MOTION TO FILE EXHIBITS UNDER SEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Plaintiffs initially moved to file six exhibits to the Declaration of Aaron Kaufmann\n   under seal, on the grounds that Defendant had designated them confidential. On February 5, 2018, Defendant filed a declaration withdrawing their confidentiality designation for one of the exhibits but retaining the confidentiality declaration for the other five. On February 6, 2018, Defendant filed an amended declaration withdrawing their confidentiality designation for all six exhibits. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' administrative motion to file those exhibits under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.
