The alert of the canine to the vehicle, then to the specific location in the vehicle where the drugs were located\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The first piece of circumstantial evidence that the Government cites is the alert of the canine, Lady, to the vehicle and trapdoors. Resp. 10. Specifically, the Government argues that Lady's alert to the vehicle and then to the specific location of the bundles within the vehicle is evidence that the bundles contained marijuana. Defendant contends, instead, that the odor for which Lady alerted was linked to the trapdoor compartment, and not necessarily to the bundles secreted therein. Br. 2. Further, Defendant persuasively argues that Lady's alert provides no evidence that the contraband to which she alerted was marijuana, and not any of the other various items that she is trained to detect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"889179\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/563/1242/#p1244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Although Lady's alert provides some circumstantial evidence that the vehicle may have contained contraband, either at the time of the search or sometime before, the Government failed to show that the alert was the result of\n   <em>\n    marijuana\n   </em>\n   contained within the bundles and\n   <em>\n    marijuana\n   </em>\n   alone. Trial testimony revealed that Lady was trained to alert to the smell of numerous types of contraband emanating from a vehicle. Tr. vol. 1, 125:4-18. Lady was also trained to alert to all of these items in the same way, meaning that an alert to any of the aforementioned items would be indistinct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125:19-23. A rational trier of fact could thus not conclude that Lady's alert alone established the presence of marijuana as opposed to any of the other items that she is trained and able to detect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, Agent Cortez testified that Lady is trained to detect the\n   <em>\n    odor\n   </em>\n   of drugs, rather than the presence of the substance itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:17-18. Consequently, Lady has alerted to the smell of contraband emanating from a vehicle at the checkpoint even when no contraband was ultimately found inside.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:9-11. This is because the smell of drugs previously contained within a vehicle may linger, causing Lady to alert in the same manner whether contraband is contained within the vehicle or not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:19-23. Thus, when Agent Cortez was asked whether he \"would bet on it that there were drugs in the car\" in this case, he responded \"[e]ither at one point in time or another or still in the car at that time, yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128:12-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   If Agent Cortez-who assisted in removing, weighing and field-testing the bundles-cannot say for certain whether Lady alerted to marijuana in the vehicle, no rational trier of fact could find that this evidence, either in isolation or considered with the evidence below, proves the identity of the charged substance beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The lack of any other drugs or concealed humans in the car to which the canine may have been alerting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Government also contends that the absence of any other drugs or concealed\n   humans in the car is circumstantial evidence that the substance was marijuana. However, this argument suffers from the same defect as the Government's previous argument; that is, that it\n   <em>\n    assumes\n   </em>\n   without proving that the substance contained within the bundles was marijuana. While Lady's alert provides circumstantial evidence that contraband may have been contained within the bundles, it again has little bearing on whether that contraband was marijuana or any of the other substances to which Lady is trained and able to detect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The identification of the substance by its smell and appearance as marijuana by an Agent with fifteen years' experience\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Government contends that the smell of the substance is circumstantial evidence identifying it as marijuana. Specifically, the Government claims that Agent Cortez \"smelled the odor of marijuana\" upon opening the trapdoors, which is a \"distinct odor with which he was familiar through training and fifteen years' experience as a Border Patrol Agent.\" Resp. 3. At trial, however, Agent Cortez testified that he could not smell any marijuana outside the vehicle, or even inside the vehicle before the trapdoors were opened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129:23-130:3. Once the trapdoors were opened, Agent Cortez could smell marijuana \"a little bit,\" leading him to \"assume [ ]\" that the substance was marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:5-6. Agent Cortez did not testify, however, that he smelled the physical bundles and that they smelled of marijuana. He also provided no testimony that the smell of marijuana disappeared once the bundles were extracted from the vehicle, which would have shown that the smell was not lingering from marijuana previously contained within the compartment. Thus, although Agent Cortez's testimony of a slight smell of marijuana within the vehicle is some evidence that the bundles possibly contained marijuana, a rational trier of fact would find the weight of this evidence enfeebled by Agent Cortez's limited testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, regarding the substance's \"appearance as marijuana,\" the Government informed the Court on three occasions that Agent Cortez testified that the substance contained within the bundles was a \"green, leafy substance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 3; Tr. vol. 1, 204:14-15; Tr. vol. 2, 7:14-15. The Government also referred to such evidence during its closing argument. Tr. vol. 2, 28:1-3 (\"It was a green, leafy substance that was put in a hidden compartment ....\"). As the Government has now acknowledged, however, the record is devoid of such testimony from Agent Cortez. Government's Suppl. Br. 1-2 (stating that \"[h]aving reviewed the testimony ... the United States acknowledges ... that its representation was in error\"). Further, the Court finds no witness, other than the Government's expert witness (whose testimony was stricken), to have testified regarding the appearance of the substance as charged. Accordingly, the Government's circumstantial evidence does not include any description of the appearance of the substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The manner of packaging of the marijuana and its location in a hidden compartment within the vehicle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Government argues that the packaging of the bundles and their location beneath the trapdoors of the vehicle is circumstantial evidence that the substance was marijuana. The bundles were packaged in PVC tape and wrapped again in clear plastic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138:10-11. The bundles were also found in a hidden compartment located underneath seats, plastic rocker panels, a layer of carpet, and a layer of foam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:1-22. The Court finds that a trier of fact could find that this evidence supports the Government's assertion that the bundles contained contraband.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1544114\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/783/499/#p505\">\n    783 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   505 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the Government did not present evidence that the manner in which the bundles were packaged or hidden was unique to marijuana and thus could not have contained another type of contraband inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The smell of marijuana coming from the hidden compartment in which the substance was located and which the Agent only detected after the trap doors were opened\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court extends the same analysis here as discussed above, and concludes that although the smell of marijuana emanating from the hidden compartment is some circumstantial evidence that the bundles contained marijuana, a rational trier of fact would find Agent Cortez's limited testimony to provide only nominal support of this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The field-test of the substance as positive for marijuana\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, the Government contends that the field-test performed by Agent Cortez on the bundles was positive for marijuana, and that this evidence supports the identity of the substance as charged. The Government offered no evidence, however, regarding the field-test itself, and, significantly, failed to establish a chain of custody to prove that the bundles tested were the same bundles extracted from the vehicle that Defendant was driving. As such, a rational trier of fact would find the fact that a field-test was performed to be of limited value in proving the substance's identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The field-test performed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During its opening statement, the Government informed the jury that it would hear evidence regarding the \"field-test\" performed on the bundles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, the jury would hear from \"an expert DEA chemist,\" who would discuss the multiple tests that he ran on the bundles which came up positive for marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:8-10. During trial, however, the testimony of the DEA chemist was stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   During trial, the Government provided only the following testimony regarding the field-test. Agent Cortez testified that, sometime after the bundles were removed from the vehicle and weighed, Agent Cortez \"conducted a field-test of the bundles which revealed marijuana.\" Tr. vol. 1 at 114:19-23. During direct examination, the Government followed up on this testimony by asking: \"The field-test was positive for marijuana?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:22. Agent Cortez responded: \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:23. The Government presented no further evidence regarding the field-test performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Despite Agent Cortez's testimony that a \"test\" was performed, no information about the test was provided. This includes any information regarding the precise nature of the \"test\" itself. As far as the jury was aware, the test could have included a chemical analysis, a sight test, a smell test, or even a taste test of the substance contained within the bundles. There is no testimony regarding whether this \"test\" was routinely performed by border patrol agents, or whether it was reliable in determining the identity of a controlled substance. Even assuming arguendo that a\n   test was performed with some degree of reliability, the record is further bereft of any evidence regarding how the results of the test were reached or read, and how Agent Cortez concluded from the results that the bundles \"tested positive for marijuana.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:19-23. This is especially true since Agent Cortez provided no testimony as to whether one, some, few, many or all of the bundles were \"tested.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"841038\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/586/1052/\">\n    586 F.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1978) (where the witness performing the field-test testified that the cocaine was contained in a number of small plastic bags, each separate bag was field-tested, and each of them tested positive for cocaine). Instead, the record contains only the testimony of a single witness that a \"test\" was performed on one or some of the bundles, and that the test yielded a positive result for marijuana. Such glaring omissions regarding the performance of the field-test undermine the Government's contention that the field-test serves as circumstantial evidence that the substance was marijuana. Although jurors may accept the Government's simple assurance that the bundles were \"tested,\" despite the Government providing no evidence to corroborate this statement, the Court finds that the Government failed to present sufficient evidence to allow this piece of circumstantial evidence to meet the high standard required by law to convict an accused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The chain of custody\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In addition to the Government's lack of evidence regarding the field-test, the Government also failed to establish any chain of custody linking the bundles removed from the vehicle to those that Agent Cortez tested. During trial, Agent Cortez testified that, once the bundles were found, they were removed from inside the vehicle. Of the bundles removed, Agent Cortez stated that \"[s]ome were placed immediately outside of the door, trapdoor, where we found them and then put them in an orange bin to be able to take them inside of the checkpoint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115:6-8. No testimony was provided as to why only \"some\" of the bundles were placed outside of the trapdoors and put into the orange bin, and where the bundles not put within the orange bin were placed. Of the bundles placed within the orange bin, it is similarly unclear when these specific bundles were taken within the checkpoint building, to where, and by whom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Government's Exhibit 3 (showing only the orange bin being pushed away from the vehicle before disappearing from the video).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Assuming\n   </em>\n   that all of the bundles were ultimately taken from the removal area into the checkpoint building to be weighed, the only testimony regarding the weighing of the bundles again came from Agent Cortez. Agent Cortez testified that he \"helped\" to weigh the bundles, and that the weight of the bundles totaled ninety-nine pounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:16-21. This testimony was corroborated by Government's Exhibit 4J, which shows a stack of numbered bundles on a scale and a white board behind the scale listing the weight of the bundles as 45.2 kilograms, or roughly ninety-nine pounds. Curiously, the name listed on the white board in Government Exhibit 4J was that of Agent Roetlin, the Case Agent at trial. Despite his presence at the Government's counsel table throughout the trial, however, Agent Roetlin never testified. As such, he offered no insight into to how the bundles were moved from the vehicle to the weighing area, and from the weighing area to the area where the bundles were ultimately tested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, the limited testimony provided by Agent Cortez regarding the chain of custody of the bundles after their removal from the vehicle was that he \"took them inside, and [ ] helped weigh the bundles, and [ ] conducted a field[-]test of the bundles which revealed marijuana.\" Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   vol. 1, 114:19-21. There is no evidence in the record, however, as to where the bundles were tested. If the bundles were not tested at the weighing area, there is no testimony as to where the bundles were transported, when and by whom. As such, the Government failed to establish a chain of custody for the bundles not only from the removal area to the weighing area, but also from the weighing area to wherever the bundles were tested. A rational trier of fact would thus not be able to discern whether the bundles that Agent Cortez tested were the same bundles extracted from the vehicle. Consequently, the Government's scant evidence of a \"field-test\" is further limited by its failure to establish a sufficient chain of custody regarding the bundles on which the test was performed. While breaks in chain of custody generally go to weight rather than admissibility,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414712\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/899/#p903\">\n    68 F.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (5th Cir. 1995), this standard does not excuse the Government from laying any chain of custody evidence at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Notwithstanding the deferential standard for which the Court examines the Government's evidence, a conviction must nevertheless be based on more than \"mere suspicion, speculation, or conjecture, or on an overly attenuated piling of inference on inference.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Moreland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863634\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/137/#p149\">\n    665 F.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (5th Cir. 2011) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the Government provided no chain of custody for the bundles from the vehicle to the weighing area to the testing area, and no information regarding the field-test itself, the Court finds that a rational trier of fact would find that the positive field-test is, at best, only limited circumstantial evidence of the identity of the substance as marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   When considering the evidence presented at trial, the Court finds that the Government adduced only the following circumstantial evidence to prove the substance's identity: the canine's alert to the vehicle and to the specific compartment of the vehicle with the bundles; Agent Cortez's testimony that he could smell marijuana \"a little bit\" once the trapdoors were opened, which he recognized based on his training and experience; the manner of packaging and location of the bundles within the vehicle; and the field-test performed on an unspecific number of the bundles for which no information was provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Even in judging all evidence in the light most deferential to the verdict, the Court cannot find that a rational trier of fact would conclude that the Government proved that the substance that Defendant possessed was marijuana. The Government bears the burden of proving each element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Court cannot overlook the Government's failure to fully and carefully present its evidence at trial.
