The drug layer is then covered by a seal coat, then a DR Polymer Layer. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 18:11-19; Trial Ex. 26 at 34. The DR Polymer Layer is made up of Eudragit L30D-55, triethyl citrate, and talc. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 18:13-19; Trial Ex. 26 at 28. Eudragit L30D-55 is used for the enteric coating. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 21:1-5; Trial Exs. 26 at 38; 32 at 22; 26 at 39; 2 at 10:59-11:1. According to the '096 Patent, enteric polymers include Eudragit L30D-55 and can be used in enteric coatings. Trial Ex. 1 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The purpose of the enteric coating is to prevent release of the drug in the stomach, while still ensuring that drug release from the dosage form will occur at some point in the digestive tract distal to the stomach. Trial Exs. 5 at 36; 6 at 13. Eudragit L30D-55 is designed to delay release of active ingredients until the pH of gastric juices reaches above 5.5, indicative of the small intestine. Trial Ex. 15 at 6; Trial Tr. Day 8 at 19:20-20:1, 28:6-14; Trial Ex. 12 at 6; Namburi 2016 Dep. 80:9-15, 81:21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Eudragit L30D-55 in Abhai's ANDA Product is manufactured by Evonik. Trial Ex. 30 at 32. Evonik describes Eudragit L30D-55 as an \"effective and stable enteric coating[ ] with a fast dissolution in the upper Bowel.\" Trial Ex. 7 at 1. During his deposition, Ranga Namburi, Ph.D. (\"Dr. Namburi\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   admitted that the Eudragit L30D-55 in Abhai's ANDA Product was used as an enteric coating. Namburi 2016 Dep. 114:12-15. Therefore, the DR Polymer Layer in Abhai's ANDA Product, comprising Eudragit L30D-55, constitutes an \"enteric release coating.\" Trial Tr. Day 8 at 22:12-14; Trial Ex. 1 at Claim 1. This \"enteric release coating\" covers the one or more pharmaceutically active amphetamine salts in the DR Beads of Abhai's ANDA Product. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 22:17-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The parties agree that \"delayed pulsed enteric release\" as used in the patent means \"rapid and complete release of drug (after a first dose by immediate release) designed to be delayed until the drug has\n   passed through the stomach into the intestines.\" Am. Joint Claim Construction Statement at A-1, ECF No. 77. Testifying for Shire, Jennifer Dressman, Ph.D. (\"Dr. Dressman\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   explained that she applied a standard for complete release that required release of 75-80% from the enteric coated dosage form, based on guidance from the FDA and chapters from the U.S. Pharmacopeia (\"USP\"), as well as the specifications and claims of the asserted patents. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 31:2-8; Trial Exs. 5, 19, 21. The FDA allows manufacturers to end sampling from their dissolution testing after 80% drug release. Trial Ex. 5 at 10. This threshold is applied to dissolution testing of enteric-coated dosage forms. Trial Ex. 5 at 35-36; Trial Tr. Day 8 at 31:21-32:24. This suggests that complete release has occurred. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 32:25-34:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The FDA's guidance, provided to the PTO during prosecution of the '096 Patent, anticipates that enteric-coated dosage forms need to release 80% of the drug in order for the release to be considered \"complete\" as required in \"delayed pulsed enteric release.\" Trial Tr. Day 8 at 31:18-20, 32:25-33:13; Trial Ex. 3 at 3168-3219. According to the USP, 75-80% of the label claim is the typical acceptance value for dissolution specifications. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 35:16-36:1; Trial Ex. 19 at 8. This represents an essentially complete release of the drug.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C605%2C300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the FDA and USP guidance confirm that \"complete\" release means that at least 75-80% of the enteric coated drug has been released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In its Claim Construction Order, the Court construed the term \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration,\" as \"a dosage form that provides rapid and complete release of drug (after a first dose by immediate release) intended to be delayed until the drug has passed through the stomach into the intestines after oral administration.\" Claim Construction Order at 13, ECF No. 85. The term occurs in Claims 1, 11, and 13 of the '148 patent and parallels the construction of \"delayed pulsed enteric release\" in the '096 Patent. The Court specifically noted that Figure 6 of the '096 and '148 Patents supports a pulsed release invention. Claim Construction Order at 11-12. The Court rejected Shire's argument that Figure 6 supported a sustained release invention in the '148 Patent. Claim Construction Order at 11-12. Therefore, Figure 6 of the asserted patents illustrates the rapid and complete (\"pulsed\") release claimed in both the '096 and '148 Patents. Claim Construction Order at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The '096 and '148 Patents describe Figure 6 as \"illustrat[ing] the drug release profile of coated pellets described in Example 4 which exemplifies the delayed release components of the present invention.\" Trial Ex. 1 at 6:49-52; Trial Tr. Day 8 at 41:18-24. Example 4 of the '096 Patent describes the formulation for enteric-coated mixed amphetamine salts pellets. Trial Ex. 1 at 11:45-12:13. Figure 6 shows a staged in vitro dissolution test where the pellets were exposed to pH 1.1 for two hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Ex. 1 at Fig. 6; Trial Ex. 1 at 11:45-12:13; 6:49-52; 11:45-12:13. The pH was then increased to pH 6.0 for one hour to represent the movement of the dosage form from the stomach into the intestines, initiating the delayed enteric release. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 41:25-42:5. The pH was increased to 7.5 for the remainder of the test. Trial Ex. 1 at Fig. 6;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C605%2C300\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C605%2C300\">\n    at 11:45-12:13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The enteric release continues for at least six hours after it is initiated, and over time about 80% of the enteric-coated drug is released. Trial Ex. 1 at Fig. 6; Trial Tr. Day 8 at 42:9-16. Therefore, a \"rapid and complete\" release according to the construction for \"delayed pulsed enteric release\" may take as long as six hours and is consistent with release of about 80% of the enteric-coated drug. Trial Ex. 1 at Fig. 6; Claim Construction Order at 11-12. The term \"delayed pulsed enteric release\" does not require release of 100% of the drug within about 30-60 minutes. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 38:6-13, 40:13-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Claim 13 of the '096 Patent, which claims a \"protective layer over the enteric release coating,\" also requires that the composition provide a \"rapid and complete release,\" regardless of the protective layer, because the construction of \"delayed pulsed enteric release,\" which is part of Claim 13, requires \"rapid and complete release.\" Trial Tr. Day 6 at 40:9-18; Trial Tr. Day 7 at 23:19-24:4; Trial Ex. 1 at Claim 13. Abhai claimed that Figure 6 is an embodiment of Claim 20 of the '148 Patent, which requires \"a protective coating layer.\" Trial Tr. Day 7 at 25:10-14; Trial Ex. 2 at Claim 20. Claim 20 is a dependent claim that depends from Claim 1. Trial Ex. 2 at Claim 20. Claim 1 requires \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration,\" and the Court has construed it to include a \"rapid and complete\" release. Trial Tr. Day 7 at 26:12-21; Trial Ex. 2 at Claim 1. Therefore, as a dependent claim, Claim 20 of the '148 Patent requires a rapid and complete release. Thus, by admitting that Figure 6 embodies Claim 20, Abhai has admitted that \"rapid and complete\" release is shown in Figure 6. The Patents' specifications and Abhai's expert Diane Burgess, Ph.D. (\"Dr. Burgess\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   recognize that the recited \"protective layer\" can provide for rapid and complete release. Trial Tr. Day 6 at 40:22-25; Trial Ex. 2 at 5:44-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The data submitted at trial shows rapid and complete release. The parties first \"normalize\" the data to measure the amount of drugs released from the DR Beads. Trial Tr. Day 6 at 14:23-15:9. \"Normalization\" refers to the calculations that experts from both parties performed to estimate the amount of amphetamine in the DR Beads and the percent released from those beads, while excluding the amount of amphetamine released from the IR Beads.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C605%2C300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In order to calculate the amount of drug released from the DR Beads in the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0, Dr. Dressman\n   first divided the amount of drug released after the first hour in pH 6.0 by the amount of the label claim released over the full two hours in pH 6.0. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 6:17-7:17. The results were multiplied by 100% to calculate the percentage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C605%2C300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is referred to as \"4-hour normalization.\" Trial Tr. Day 9 at 5:22-6:1; Trial Tr. Day 6 at 63:5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Both parties' experts use the \"Assay Normalization\" when dissolution data is not available at the four-hour mark. Trial Ex. 399; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 51:19-20. An assay is a method of determining the percentage of label claim or the amount of drug present (on average) in a given batch, compared to the amount of drug listed on the label. Trial Tr. Day 1 at 124:14-19. The assay value is used to calculate the amount of drug released from the DR Beads in the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 399. This type of normalization method assumes that the assay amount for a given batch of product is the actual amount of drug contained in each capsule of that product. Trial Tr. Day 2 at 13:25-14:2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dr. Burgess also used a different of four-hour normalization method where time points subsequent to three hours indicate that a plateau has been reached. She then chose the highest release value observed and treated it as the capsule content. Trial Tr. Day 6 at 17:22-18:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"Label claim normalization\" is also used when no four-hour dissolution value is available. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 20:1-3. Using this method, normalization is achieved by dividing the amount of release in the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0 by 50%, which represents the expected amount of amphetamine in the DR Beads. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 19:24-20:4; Trial Ex. 394.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The most appropriate method to normalize release data from extended release mixed amphetamine salt dosage forms is to use the four-hour normalization method. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 8:14-20. Observed release data after four hours shows that a drug release plateau is reached at the beginning of the fourth hour. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 7:20-8:21. This means that drug release will be complete by the end of the fourth hour.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C605%2C300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The result of Dr. Dressman's four-hour normalization and Dr. Burgess's \"highest percentage release\" normalization methods thus will be approximately the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Trial Tr. Day 6 at 18:1-10, 63:4-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In May of 2017, Dr. Luk performed dissolution testing on each strength of Abhai's ANDA Product. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 12:24-13:4. His testing showed a plateau that began at four hours, which meant that release from the DR Beads in Abhai's ANDA Product had finished after four hours. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 7:20-8:20. Dr. Luk's testing of Abhai's ANDA Product back in October 2016 also showed a drug release plateau starting at four hours. Trial Ex. 199. Shire's testing of NDA batches of Adderall XR also showed a similar amount of release at the end of four hours (two hours in pH 6.0) as at the end of five hours. Trial Exs. 25 at 231, 236, 241; 382 at 34, 39, 44. Teva's testing of Adderall XR in 2006 also showed a similar amount of drug release at four hours (two hours in pH 6.0) as at 4.5 hours. Trial Ex. 358 at 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 43:6-10. Andrx's testing of Adderall XR in 2007 similarly showed a plateau in drug release between four hours (two hours in pH 6.0) and 6 hours. Trial Ex. 390 at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 44:11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Abhai claims that the four-hour normalization is not accurate because, after conducting a dissolution test on the 20 and 30 mg strengths of Abhai's ANDA Product, with the second stage conducted at a pH of 6.8 instead of the FDA-recommended pH of 6.0, the total release observed was higher than the release observed in other tests\n   conducted according to the FDA-recommended two stage method. Trial Tr. Day 6 at 92:5-93:1. Therefore, Abhai argues, there must have been additional, unreleased drugs in the capsules that were tested according to the FDA-recommended method. Trial Tr. Day 6 at 92:5-93:1. The pH 6.8 testing, however, was conducted on different capsules than those used in the testing that Dr. Luk performed according to the FDA-recommended two-stage method, and the contents of each individual capsule varied substantially. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 111:13-112:5. As Dr. Dressman explained, it is not a fair comparison, and it is misleading to compare the two sets of data because the content of each capsule was different. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 103:20-104:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Abhai's testing of its ANDA Product shows rapid and complete release. Abhai tested 12 capsules of each strength of its ANDA Product using the FDA's recommended in vitro dissolution method. Trial Exs. 9 at 3, 8; 10 at 5, 13; 11 at 23. Applying four-hour normalization to Abhai's batch dissolution data, the results showed rapid and complete release from the DR Beads. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 12:14-17. For the 10 mg strength, the percent release was 84.9%; for the 15 mg strength, the percent release was 85.7%; for the 20 mg strength, the percent release was 76.1%; for the 25 mg strength, the percent release was 87.5%; and for the 30 mg strength, the percent release was 73.8%. Trial Exs. 26 at 98, 89, 80; 32 at 55, 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Abhai's retest of its ANDA Product also shows rapid and complete release. Abhai normalized its results using the four-hour, assay value, and label-claim normalization methods. Trial Exs. 394; 240 at 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 19:19-24:4, 22:6-15. Under these methods, Abhai obtained many values exceeding both 75% and 80%, and over 90% in some instances. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 19:19-20:4, 20:16-22:1, 22:6-15, 22:25-23:4; Trial Exs. 330; 240 at 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32; 394. These numbers show rapid and complete release of the drug from the DR Beads over the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 22:2-5, 23:5-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Dr. Luk's dissolution testing also shows rapid and complete release. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 10:22-25. In May of 2017, Dr. Luk performed dissolution testing on six capsules of all strengths of Abhai's ANDA Product using steel sinkers conforming to the USP dissolution monograph specification. Trial Ex. 319 at 3, 7, 10, 13, 17, 26; Trial Tr. Day 5 at 37:17-24, 39:18-40:1; Trial Ex. 20 at 4. Dr. Luk placed the capsules in a dissolution media, first prepared on May 12, 2017. Trial Ex. 319 at 1. He also used a USP II (Paddle) dissolution apparatus, set to 50 rmp. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 16:12-15, 61:1-24. The dissolution bath was started at pH 1.1, and one capsule was added. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 18:25-19:12; Trial Ex. 319 (Lab Notebook 3004) at 8, 11, 14, 18, 27. Capsules were then added at intervals of five minutes. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 19:13-19. A five-minute interval was used to allow sufficient time for the addition of the 200 mM phosphate buffer and adjustment of pH to 6.0 at the two-hour time point. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 20:4-14, 22:2-4. The testing mirrored Abhai's dissolution testing procedures. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 21:7-9; Trial Exs. 40 at 18; 284 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Dr. Luk took samples at additional time points beyond those required by the FDA prior to the pH being adjusted to 6.0, and then again after it was adjusted. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 23:2-7. The results from each sample collected were compared against the results from a standard solution with a known concentration of amphetamine. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 25:8-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Dr. Luk conducted two dissolution tests on Abhai's ANDA Product. Trial Ex. 392. His first test, conducted on October 2016,\n   showed rapid and complete release from the DR Beads for the 20 mg and 30 mg strengths. Trial Tr. Day 1 at 57:11-16, 64:15-20; Trial Exs. 195; 8 at 1. Over 90% of the drug from the DR Beads was released after the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 10:22-11:5. It is of no consequence that the samples tested by Dr. Luk were beyond the 2-month shelf life because all the testing performed met the dissolution specifications provided in Abhai's ANDA Product. Trial Tr. Day 2 at 109:4-110:22; Trial Exs. 199; 130 at 57-59, 67-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Dr. Luk's second test, performed on May of 2017 on all dosage strengths, showed rapid and complete release of the drug from the DR Beads for the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0. Trial Ex. 392. He obtained values for percent release of drug from the DR Beads that exceeded 90% for the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0 for each strength. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 11:2-5. Using sinkers to perform the dissolution testing did not distort the results because industry standard dictates that a sinker should be used whenever the dosage form would float without the use of the sinker, and Abhai's ANDA Product floats when placed in dissolution media. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 32:18-33:6, 33:14-18, 34:2-4, 41:8-20; 42:1-6, 44:22-45:7; Trial Exs. 20 at 4; 324 at 7; 318 at 11; 289 at 3; 306 at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Moreover, using HPLC instead of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (\"UPLC\") as the analytical method when performing dissolution testing did not affect the results because both are based on the same process, and by using HPLC, Dr. Luk used the same methods of USP. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 13:15-22; 51:23-52:2; 52:22-24. Using a different dissolution media did not have an effect on the analysis. Trial Tr. Day 5 at 49:6-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Abhai's dissolution testing results are unreliable. Abhai conducted dissolution testing on commercial batches of Adderall XR, in accordance with the FDA-recommended testing methods for its ANDA submission. Trial Exs. 26, at 80, 89, 98; 32 at 55, 64; 11 at 15, 19; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 39:9-15, 40:20-23. Other generic drug companies also conducted dissolution testing on commercial batches of Adderall XR for their own submissions. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 42:18-46:23. When compared to the dissolution rates obtained by the other generic drug companies testing Adderall XR, Abhai's dissolution rates were lower. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 46:13-23, 48:12-18; Trial Ex. 397. Abhai also obtained lower dissolution testing results than Shire when testing Adderall XR.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 396; 26 at 98, 89, 80; 32 at 55, 64; 30 at 6; 121 at 6,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 25 at 231, 234, 236, 239, 241; 382 at 31, 34, 36, 39, 41, 44. When applying the four-hour and assay normalization to Abhai's dissolution testing results for Adderall XR, the normalized percent release of drugs from the DR Beads during the first hour of exposure to pH 6.0 is as follows: 85.4% and 90.9% for the 10 mg strength; 83.7% and 86.1% for the 15 mg strength; 79.2% and 82.1% for the 20 mg strength; 81.3% and 81.3% for the 25 mg strength; and 76.1% and 73.5% for the 30 mg strength.

Trial Ex. 2 at Claims 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Abhai's ANDA Product contains \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   thus infringing on claims 1, 11 and 13 of the '148 Patent. This Court construed the language \"delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration\" as \"a dosage form that provides rapid and complete release of drug (after a first dose by immediate release) intended to be delayed until the drug has passed through the stomach into the intestines after oral administration.\" Claim Construction Order at 13. The construction of \"delayed pulsed enteric release\" and the construction of \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration\" mirror each other. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 27:3-11; Am. Joint Claim Construction Statement at A-1; Claim Construction Order at 13. Both require a rapid and complete release of the drug from the enteric coated dosage form in Abhai's ANDA Product (the DR Beads), following a dose by immediate release, that is intended or designed to be delayed until the drug has passed into the intestines. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 27:12-14; Am. Joint Claim Construction Statement at A-1; Claim Construction Order at 13. As stated above, Abhai's ANDA Product has \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 30. The term \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration\" does not require release of 100% of the drug within 30-60 minutes. Trial Tr. Day 8 at 38:6-13; Trial Ex. 2 at Claims 1, 12. There is no requirement that \"essentially all\" of the drug be released within an hour of exposure to pH 6.0. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 27:15-21. As explained above, Figure 6 in both asserted patents supports a pulsed release invention.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   When applying assay normalization to Abhai's revised stability data, the percent release from the DR Beads after two hours of exposure to pH 6.0 shows rapid and complete release. Trial Exs. 395; 130 at 43, 50, 54, 60, 64; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 28:18-29:2, 30:2-4. At the initial storage age, the percent release from the DR Beads was 100.59% for the 10 mg strength; 96.27% for the 15 mg strength; 93.36% for the 20 mg strength; 96.71% for the 25 mg strength; and 86.42% for the 30 mg strength. Trial Exs. 395; 130 at 43, 50, 54, 60, 64; Trial Tr. Day 9 at 28:18-29:2. For the 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months storage age, the percent values were above 75% for each of the dosage strengths, except for those where the release was not measured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For some of the dosage strengths for some of the sample ages, there is over 95% release from the DR Beads during the first two hours of exposure to pH 6.0, and in some cases 100% release or more. Trial Tr. Day 9 at 29:12-19. Therefore, Abhai's ANDA Product has \"a delayed enteric release dosage form that provides delayed release upon oral administration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Abhai's ANDA Product also meets the \"effective level\" imitation in claims 1, 11, and 13 of the '148 Patent. The \"effective level\" limitation of the '148 Patent requires that the pharmaceutical formulation be \"sufficient to maintain an effective level of amphetamine base salts in the patient over the course of at least 8 hours without further administration of amphetamine base salt.\" Trial Ex. 2 at 13:42-45. Abhai's ANDA Product infringes on this claim for the following reasons: (1) Abhai's label demonstrates that its ANDA Product is a long-acting, once-daily product that can be substituted for a twice-daily dosing regimen of Adderall and has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms over the course of at least 8 hours; (2) Abhai's ANDA Product is a therapeutic equivalent of Adderall XR, which has been shown to reduce ADHD symptoms over the course of 8 hours; and (3) Abhai's studies show that its ANDA Product will have a rapid onset of effects that will continue for at least 4\n   hours after maximum concentration is reached, meaning that the product will reduce ADHD symptoms over the course of at least 8 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Abhai's proposed label for its ANDA Product states that it is an \"extended-release\" product, with direction to the patient to take the medication \"once daily.\" Trial Ex. 31 at 8; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 8:22-9:6. It also states that those patients who are \"taking divided doses of immediate-release\" Adderall \"may be switched [to Abhai's ANDA Product] at the same total daily dose taken once daily.\" Trial Ex. 31 at 8; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 9:7-10:3. In its initial form, before Adderall XR came to be, Adderall treatment required multiple doses throughout the day in order to provide relief from ADHD symptoms for at least 8 hours. Trial Ex. 2 at 3:16-40; Trial Tr. Day 2 at 143:22-147:4; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 16:12-18:7 Trial Ex. 86. Therefore, the proposed label demonstrates that one daily dosage of Abhai's ANDA Product would provide the same relief from ADHD symptoms for at least 8 hours, as two dosages of Adderall. The proposed label confirms that Abhai's ANDA Product is created to produce long-lasting effects after it is administered. Trial Ex. 31 at 8; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 9:2-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Abhai's ANDA Product is also the therapeutic equivalent to Adderall XR and meets the \"effective level\" limitation. When submitting its ANDA to the FDA, Abhai stated that \"[t]he active ingredient, indications, including route of administration, dosage form and qualitative composition [of its ANDA Product] are the same as that of Adderall XR.\" Trial Ex. 145 at 1; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 4:14-5:19. Abhai also requested that FDA designate its product as a \"therapeutic equivalen[t]\" to Adderall XR and represented that its product \"is of the same pharmacological and therapeutic class as that of [Adderall XR] and can be expected to have the same therapeutic effect as [Adderall XR] when administered per label claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In doing so, Abhai represented to the FDA that its product will have the same duration effect as Adderall XR. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 4:14-5:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Abhai's ANDA Product is also bioequivalent to Adderall XR, meaning the two produce plasma concentration versus time curves that are sufficiently equivalent. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 7:5-17; 8:13-18. In its proposed label, Abhai cites to studies, also cited in Adderall XR's label, that report a reduction of ADHD symptoms over the course of at least 8 hours. Trial Ex. 117; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 22:24-23:5. The FDA allows Abhai to cite to those studies without requiring it to perform its own safety and efficacy clinical trials, because the similarity between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the two products means that Abhai's ANDA Product will have the same therapeutic effect as Adderall XR. Trial Ex. 31 at 29-31; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 9:7-10:3. Being therapeutically equivalent means that both products will have the same duration of efficacy in humans and will be treated interchangeably. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 9:7-10:3, 54:19-55:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Abhai cites to a number of studies in its proposed label including James T. McCracken et al.,\n   <em>\n    Analog Classroom Assessment of Once-Daily Mixed Amphetamine Formulation, SLI381 (ADDERALL XR), in Children with ADHD\n   </em>\n   , 42 J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 673-683 (2003) (the \"McCracken study\"), and Joseph Bierderman et al.,\n   <em>\n    A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study of SLI381 (ADDERALL XR) in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n   </em>\n   , 110 Pediatrics, 258-266 (2002) (the \"Bierderman study\"). Trial Ex. 117; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 22:24-23:5, 51:16-53:17; Trial Ex. 118;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 119 at 2, 3, 5-6, 9, 12; 120. The McCracken study stands for the proposition that Adderall\n   XR provides efficacy over the course of the entire day. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 31:14-33:7. Abhai cited the McCracken study in its proposed label without citing any alleged design flaws or issues. Trial Ex. 31 at 30; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 36:7-12. The Bierderman study stands for the proposition that Adderall XR reduces ADHD symptoms over the course of 8 hours. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 46:22-51:15; Trial Ex. 118. The authors state that \"SLI381 [Adderall XR] is a safe and effective once-daily dosage form of stimulant medication that lasts throughout the school day and into the early evening\"; that \"dosing the morning before the child left for school would ensure protection against ADHD symptoms during and beyond the school day\"; and that \"the duration of action of SLI381 should allow for pharmacological support of homework activity, after school athletic and social activities, as well as family life.\" Trial Ex. 118 at 7; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 48:17-50:11. Other studies cited by Abhai in its proposed label indicate that Adderall XR is an effective once-daily treatment, designed to reduce ADHD symptoms over the course of an entire day. Trial Exs. 119 at 2; 120 at 1; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 51:19-53:7; Trial Ex. 31 at 30. Therefore, like Adderall XR, Abhai's ANDA Product reduces ADHD symptoms over the course of 8 hours. Trial Tr. Day 4 at 19:3-22:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Abhai argues that these studies are not relevant to the analysis of whether its ANDA Product meets the \"effective level limitation\" claim because the claim requires the \"pharmaceutical formulation\" to provide an effective level of amphetamine over the course of 8 hours without the assistance of residual amphetamine in the blood stream, and the studies cited did not account for residual amphetamine in the blood stream.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. Day 3 at 150:10-151:4. This argument is without merit. It is contrary to the plain language of the claim, standard clinical practice, and the '148 Patent itself. The plain language of the claim does not contain any wording which requires that the pharmaceutical formulation provide efficacy over the course of eight hours on the first day of treatment, nor does it contain language that requires efficacy without the aid of residual amphetamine from previous administrations. Trial Ex. 2 at 13:42-45; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 109:17-110:24. Moreover, the recognized practice of dose titration contemplates that the first administration of the product may not provide an optimal effect, and that efficacy may be achieved after administering a higher dosage until \"optimal response is obtained, suggesting the first day of administration is negligible.\" Trial Ex. 138 at 3; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 43:22-44:11, 85:13-23; Trial Tr. Day 4 at 30:23-31:20, 32:7-12. There is nothing in the '148 Patent to suggest that the \"effective level of amphetamine\" must be achieved on the first day of administration. See Trial Ex. 2 at 21:12; Trial Tr. Day 3 at 109:17-110:24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Pharmacokinetic data from Abhai's bioequivalence studies, which tracks the concentration of the drug in the plasma over time, also demonstrates that Abhai's ANDA Product satisfies the \"effective level\" limitation. The mean plasma concentration versus time curves from all three of Abhai's bioequivalence studies show that the ANDA Product's plasma profile matches the plasma profile of Adderall XR. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 55:9-56:19; Trial Exs. 68 at 47-48; 69 at 48-49; 70 at 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies of Adderall XR show that once ingested, Adderall XR has a rapid onset effect and continues to reduce ADHD symptoms for at least four hours after the maximum concentration is reached. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 59:25-60:18, 63:1-16. Pharmacokinetic data from Abhai's biostudies show that after ingestion, its ANDA Product will produce a maximum concentration\n   at four hours, and in many instances a maximum concentration at eight hours after ingestion. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 59:25-60:18, 63:1-16. Because Abhai's ANDA Product, like Adderall XR, will have a rapid onset of effect that continues for 4-6 plus hours after the maximum concentration is reached, the mean maximum concentration values from Abhai's ANDA studies indicate that Abhai's ANDA Product will reduce ADHD symptoms for the course of at least 8 hours and in many instances up to 12 plus hours. Trial Tr. Day 3 at 63:17-64:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For all these reasons, Abhai's ANDA Product meets the \"effective level\" limitation of the '148 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Abhai's ANDA Product meets the \"peak plasma concentration\" limitation in Claims 1, 11, and 13 of the '148 Patent. Each of the asserted claims requires that Abhai's ANDA Product results in a \"peak plasma concentration of amphetamine base salts reached after release of said delayed enteric release dosage form\" that \"exceeds the peak plasma concentration previously reached after release of said immediate release dosage form.\" Trial Ex. 2 at 13:46-50, 14:41-45. Specifically, the claim, known as the \"additive effect,\" states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   the levels of drug in blood plasma of the pharmaceutically active amphetamine salts will reach a peak fairly rapidly after about 2 hours, and after about 4 hours a second pulse dose is released, wherein a second fairly rapid additive increase of plasma drug levels occurs which slowly decreases over the course of the next 12 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Trial Ex. 2 at 10:21-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   After administration, the amphetamine in the immediate release dosage form will release, dissolve, and begin to be absorbed into the blood plasma, until the concentration of amphetamine in the plasma reaches a \"peak plasma concentration\" \"after release of the immediate release dosage form.\" Maggio Opening \u00b6\u00b6 118-19. The delayed enteric release dosage form then enters the small intestines where it releases another burst of amphetamine, which dissolves and is then absorbed into the plasma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Trial Tr. Day 1 117:17-21. Dr. Maggio\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   used two pharmacokinetic analyses on Abhai's ANDA Product to test this claim: (1) superposition principle, illustrating the additive concept; and (2) percent absorption analysis, using the Wagner-Nelson method. Maggio Opening \u00b6\u00b6 51-68, 124-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Using the superposition principle, Dr. Maggio compared the plasma concentration versus time curves plotted after administration of Abhai's ANDA Product, which contained both immediate release and delayed enteric release dosage forms, to a plasma concentration versus time curve from a formulation containing only an immediate release dosage form of the same mixed amphetamine salts used in Abhai's ANDA Product. Trial Exs. 75 at 30-55; 201 at 43-44; Maggio Opening \u00b6\u00b6 129-34. Dr. Maggio found that the peak\n   plasma concentration reached after the release of the delayed enteric release dosage form, around five to six hours, exceeded the peak plasma concentration reached after the release of the immediate release dosage form. Maggio Opening \u00b6\u00b6 129-34. This analysis suggests that the plasma concentration versus time curve for Abhai's ANDA Product continues to rise further than the peak plasma concentration from the immediate release only dosage form. Maggio Opening \u00b6 133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Dr. Maggio then used the Wagner-Nelson method to analyze the percent of drug absorbed over time, and correlated the percent drug absorbed to plasma concentration over time and release of the two dosage forms in Abhai's ANDA Product.

Abhai is incorrect when it defines the \"peak plasma concentration\" as \"the point where the plasma concentration reaches a high-point before declining.\" Bergstrom Decl. \u00b6 36. Abhai claims that this definition requires a declining concentration after reaching a high-point in the plasma concentration. Bergstrom Dep. 109:14-109:22. Such an assertion is not based on anything included in the patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the claim requires a decrease in plasma concentration after the peak plasma concentration reached after release of the drugs from the delayed enteric release dosage form.

Abhai is incorrect. The term \"a human patient\" means one or more human patients. See Maggio Rebuttal Claim Construction Dec. \u00b6 53. The claim does not require a look at the mean data, but rather an examination of individual data. Trial Ex. 2 at Fig. 7, 8.

On October 14, 2016, Shire deposed Dr. Namburi as Abhai's Rule 30(b)(6) witness. Namburi 2016 Dep. at 6.8. There, Dr. Namburi confirmed that Abhai's dissolution data were accurate and that the measure of dissolution was taken at appropriate times, meaning 1 hour after the sample was exposed to a buffer medium (3 hours after the start of the entire test). Namburi 2016 Dep. at 210:13-21. He further explained that \"as long as the dissolution does meet to the specifications,\" there was no cause for concern that the 24 month samples showed a faster rate of release than samples tested at earlier dates.

Trial Ex. 220 at 1. That afternoon, Thomas Saboe and Dr. Namburi concluded that the 24 month dissolution data for Abhai's 30 mg strength was incorrect because the second dissolution measurement had been taken after four hours of exposure to the buffer medium. Trial Ex. 247. At some point prior to October 21, 2016, investigators found that testing for all five dosage strengths-the 24 month data for the 10, 20, and 30 mg, and the 18 month data for the 15 and 25 mg-were affected by the error in testing. Trial Ex. 220 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   On October 17, 2016, KVK's investigation review board met and determined that the error in the stability dissolution data was a result of ambiguities in KVK's method of analysis.

Proposed Trial Ex. 412. At this time, Dr. Namburi was aware that there were errors with the data and that Abhai had retested the 18- and 24-month Products using KVK's revised dissolution testing and methods of analysis. Namburi 2017 Dep. 140:6-141:17; Trial Tr. Day 7 at 129:9-14. Abhai also failed to supplement any of its prior discovery production with the revised methods of analysis or any other documents relating to the errors in its stability testing. Abhai also failed to notify the FDA of the errors in its testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Importantly, neither Vepuri nor Dr. Namburi notified Abhai's attorneys of the errors in the dissolution data, despite their\n   awareness of the error and the ongoing litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   There matters rested during the run up to trial. Not surprisingly, Shire's experts, unfortunately, had already relied on the incorrect data produced by Abhai. From March 27 into March 28, 2017, Dr. Burgess, Abhai's expert, testified about Abhai's dissolution testing of its ANDA Product. Unbeknownst to Dr. Burgess, however, her testimony was based on the old (and now discredited) dissolution data. Trial Tr. Day 1 at 106:7-127:4, Day 2 at 5:3-124:20. At the time of Dr. Burgess's testimony, Vepuri, Dr. Namburi, Dr. Late, and Panchal had determined that Abhai's 24 month stability data did not show a faster release than other time points as the older data had previously stated. Trial Tr. Day 7 at 68:4-69:18. At this point, Tabasso, though aware of the retesting, was not yet aware of the material discrepancies in the results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   On Thursday, March 30, 2017, the Court shared its \"musings\" about the strength of Shire's case, specifically stating that it was contemplating interpreting the \"essentially all\" dissolution claim element as something more than 75 percent but less than 100 percent. Trial Tr. Day 4 at 62:20-67:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   On Friday, March 31, KVK created an \"Escalation to Management Form\" to inform Tabasso of certain issues. Trial Ex. 234. The form stated that \"On 3-31-17 it was identified that the 24 month data was revised in 11/2016 and not reported to Regulatory.\" Trial Ex. 234 at 2. Later that same day, Abhai finally informed its counsel of the errors in its data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   On Monday, April 3, 2017, Abhai informed Shire of the errors in its data.

Trial Ex. 238. Abhai also indicated to the FDA that the \"[d]issolution test results at incorrect time point (3 hours in phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) [for the 18- and 24-month products,] [were] replaced with reanalyzed and corrected time point (1 hour in phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) dissolution test results (16-LIR-054).\" Trial Ex. 240 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On April 4, 2017, Abhai filed a Motion to Amend Pretrial Memorandum where it admitted to errors in its dissolution testing and that further dissolution retesting was conducted to update the 18 and 24-month data. Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Amend Pretrial Mem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The conduct of Abhai and KVK reflects an appalling lack of awareness of a litigant's responsibility to our justice system-in Dr. Namburi's case conduct laced with mendacity as well.
