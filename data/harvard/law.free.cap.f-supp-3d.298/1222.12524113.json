Intervenors have responded, (Doc. 68), and Plaintiff has replied (Doc. 69). Plaintiff has also filed a motion to supplement her reply (Doc. 71). The Court now rules on the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 13, 2014, Vahik Alaverdyan fell asleep at the wheel of his tractor and collided into Vincent Guerden. (Doc. 48 at 2). Geurden died as a result of this collision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During settlement negotiations, Plaintiff Yves Guerden (\"Plaintiff\"), demanded $7 million from Defendants Vahik Alaverdyan and Quantum Transportation L.P. (\"Defendants\"). (Doc. 66-4 at 2). Following this demand, Hallmark American Insurance Company (\"Hallmark\"), one of Defendants' insurers, sent a letter to the Greenwich Insurance Company (\"Greenwich\") on February 3, 2017, demanding that Greenwich \"tender its policy limits for settlement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 9, 2017, Greenwich wrote two letters denying that it had any \"duty to defend and/or indemnify\" Defendants at that time. (Doc. 66-1); (Doc. 66-2). Greenwich further asserted that its insurance policy was excess to policies of other insurers that were currently providing a defense in this litigation. (Doc. 66-1 at 6). In response to Greenwich's letters, Plaintiff and Defendants agreed to enter into a stipulated judgment on June 26, 2017. (Doc. 42). In this stipulation, the parties acknowledged that they were entering into a \"Damron\n   Agreement\" and requested that the Court grant default judgment. (Doc. 42). On June 28, 2017, the Court inquired whether it had the duty to inquire into the reasonableness of the settlement agreement before entering judgment. (Doc. 43). On July 12, 2017, Greenwich Insurance Company and XL Specialty Insurance Company (\"XL\") (together, \"Intervenors\") moved to intervene in this matter, opposing the Court's entry of the stipulated judgment. (Docs. 46 and 47). Believing that neither party's briefs adequately addressed whether Intervenors were entitled to a reasonableness hearing, the Court denied the stipulated judgment without prejudice and ordered supplemental briefing on two issues: (1) when is an excess insurance carrier's duty to defend triggered? And (2) even if such an insurer had no duty to defend, may they recant a prior decision on which the parties relied in reaching a settlement?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff contends that the third sentence in this passage defines the word \"reasonable,\" used in the second sentence, as \"neither fraudulent, collusive, nor otherwise against public policy.\" (Doc. 69 at 6).

It is certainly difficult to see how a letter from Hallmark's representative demanding that Greenwich tender its policy limits could be construed as an offer from Hallmark to pay its policy limits. In fact, the letter still claims that Hallmark's coverage was excess to Greenwich's policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Moreover, the letter provides that \"the value of the case [was] possibly ... in excess of Wesco's and Greenwich's policy limits,\" but states nothing about Hallmark being prepared to offer its own policy limits to defend the insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).

If this letter triggered any duty at all, it triggered the implied duty to treat settlement offers with equal consideration and the breach of that duty only authorizes an insured to enter into a\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   agreement.\n   <em>\n    Safeway Ins.

That the excess insured has no right or ability to control its insured's defense while the primary insurer is still involved in the case, implicates a core tenet of the\n   <em>\n    Damron\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

The letter states that \"Plaintiffs' last settlement demand was $ 7 million.\" (Doc. 66-4 at 2). But, the stipulated judgment in this case totals $25 million. (Doc. 66-7 at 2). That amount is five times the policy limit of Greenwich's excess insurance policy. (Doc. 66-1 at 4); (Doc. 66-2 at 3).

Furthermore, the timing of Greenwich's denial letters is more indicative of a refusal to settle the case, not a refusal to defend the matter altogether-the only circumstance under which a\n   <em>\n    Damron\n   </em>\n   agreement is permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that neither waiver nor estoppel apply to preclude the Intervenors from recanting a prior denial of coverage and now defending under a reservation of rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Windt,\n    <em>\n     Insurance Claims and Disputes\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 5:26 (4th ed. 2001) ). But this standard only applies to the duty to settle, not to the duty to defend.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Allan D. Windt,\n    <em>\n     Insurance Claims and Disputes\n    </em>\n    ch. 4 (6th ed. 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Although Intervenors appear to argue that exhaustion requires actual payment, they do not contend that their duty to defend arose on August 31, 2017, when it became clear that the policies had been exhausted. (Doc. 62 at 4). Rather, Intervenors contend their duty arose on June 21, 2017, and that they did nothing to breach their duty after that point. (Doc. 68 at 9).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Indeed, the letter does contain some evidence that a large settlement valuable may be reasonable, specifically that the defense counsel advised that a jury could award over $24 million in punitive damages alone. (Doc. 66-4 at 2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plaintiff seeks to supplement her motion for entry of stipulated judgment with evidence of Intervenors March 09, 2017, letter to Dole, which contained \"reservation of rights language ... [that] is clear and unequivocal.\" (Doc. 71-1at 2). Because of this difference in language, Plaintiff argues that Intervenors' letters to Quantum and Alaverdyan cannot be considered \"reservation of rights\" letters. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The Court's analysis does not at all rely on characterizing the Intevenors' letters to Quanum and Alaverdyan as \"reservation of rights\" letters. Therefore, although the Court grants the motion to supplement, the Court finds that the supplemental evidence does not alter its analysis. Furthermore, because the supplemental evidence does not alter the Court's analysis, the Court need not wait to allow Intervenors to respond.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
