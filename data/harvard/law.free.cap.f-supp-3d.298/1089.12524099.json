Maloney, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs are four women who allege they were sexually harassed or assaulted by other students while they were students at Michigan State University (MSU). Each plaintiff alleges she reported the assault to the MSU, which did not adequately respond. Plaintiffs assert claims for violations of Title IX and Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (ELCRA). Through \u00a7 1983, Plaintiffs also assert claims for violations of their constitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. (ECF No. 28.) The Court held a hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The motion will be granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs have conceded several of the claims, including the violations of Due Process and violations of the ELCRA. The Title IX claim brought by Jane Roe 2 will be dismissed, as the allegations in the complaint do not establish deliberate indifference. Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim against MSU Board of Trustees has been withdrawn, and the motion will be granted for the Equal Protection claims against Defendants Simon and Youatt. The complaint does not allege sufficient facts to show how those individuals violated the constitutional rights of any of the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the outset, the Court must clarify the individual defendants in this case. In the caption for the initial complaint, Plaintiffs named the Michigan State University Board of Trustees (Trustees); Lou Anna Simon, the president of the university; and Denise Maybank, the vice president of student affairs. With leave of the Court, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which is the controlling pleading. (ECF No. 25.) Plaintiffs did not alter the caption,\n   but did add defendants. In the \"Parties and Jurisdiction\" portion of the complaint, Plaintiffs named Trustees (Compl. \u00b6 1), Maybank (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2), and Simon (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). As a defendant, Plaintiffs added June Pierce Youatt, the acting Provost, or the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiffs also added Paulette Granberry Russell, who at \"all times relevant was MSU's appointed Title IX Coordinator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Plaintiffs have not requested any additional summonses since their initial complaint was filed. Defendants Youatt and Russell made appearances in this lawsuit when the motion to dismiss was filed on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the portion of the complaint where Plaintiffs identify and outline their causes of action, Plaintiffs list the defendants against which each claim is brought as part of the heading and also identify the defendants within the claim itself. Count 1 is Plaintiffs' claim for violations of Title IX, and is brought against Defendant Trustees only. (Compl. PageID.257-58.) Count 3 is Plaintiffs' claim for violations of the ELCRA, and is brought against Defendant Trustees only. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID. 359-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The confusion about the individual defendants arises in Count 2, Plaintiffs' constitutional claims. (Compl. PageID.258-59.) Plaintiffs name as the defendants for this count the Trustees, Maybank, Simon and Youatt. Plaintiffs also name as a defendant Amanda Garcia-Williams. In paragraph 32 of the complaint, Plaintiffs identify Garcia-Williams as MSU's Title IX Coordinator, the same position held by Russell \"at all times relevant.\" Then, in paragraph 84, Plaintiffs describe Russell as the Senior Advisor to the President for Diversity and as the Director of the Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives. Plaintiffs also describe Russell as Garcia-Williams's supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Garcia-Williams is mentioned in the factual allegations for each of the individual plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on this brief summary, the Court reaches two conclusions. First, Plaintiffs have not asserted a claim against Defendant Paulette Russell. Plaintiffs do not identify Russell as a defendant for any of their counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no claim for which Russell must file an answer. The confusion about Russell's title does not affect this conclusion. Second, Garcia-Williams is not currently a named defendant in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs did not identify Garcia-Williams as a defendant in the \"Parties and Jurisdiction\" portion of their complaint. Plaintiffs have never requested a summons for Garcia-Williams. Garcia-Williams has not made an appearance in this lawsuit. This Court does not currently have personal jurisdiction over Garcia-Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, relying on Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Plaintiffs describe the events giving rise to the claims brought by all four students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Plaintiff Kollaritsch\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   John Doe attempted to rape Plaintiff Kollaritsch in his dormitory room in October 2011. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) On October 15, John Doe sexually assaulted Kollaritsch in the stands at an MSU football game. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Kollaritsch reported the assaults to the MSU Police on January 30, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) On February 3, Kollaritsch met with Garcia-Williams to formally commence an investigation against John Doe by MSU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) While the investigation was occurring, MSU did not restrict John Doe or accommodate Kollaritsch so that she would not encounter John Doe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Sometime in August, some 200 days later, Kollaritsch received the Investigation Report from MSU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) The report concluded that John Doe violated the MSU Sexual Harassment Policy, but did not identify the specific policies or provisions that were violated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) The report did not conclude that John Doe sexually assaulted Kollaritsch. John Doe accepted responsibility (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41), and, on November 13, 2012, was placed on probationary status, and was issued a no-contact order (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). Garcia-Williams did not inform Kollaritsch that she had a right to appeal the sanction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   John Doe thereafter violated the no-contact order and began stalking, harassing, and otherwise intimidating Kollaritsch. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) After reporting his conduct in February, on March 11, 2013, Kollaritsch filed a formal complaint with MSU about John Doe's retaliatory harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   50 and 53.) On March 13, Kollaritsch sought a Personal Protection Order against John Doe in the East Lansing District Court, which was issued the next\n   day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) In May 2013, Garcia-Williams issued a report concluding that John Doe had not retaliated against Kollaritsch and had not further violated MSU's Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Kollaritsch was not informed that she could appeal the conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Between June and August, Kollaritsch pressed the matter with MSU, complaining that the investigation was inadequate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B. Plaintiff Jane Roe 1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   John Doe 2 sexually assaulted Jane Roe 1 in November 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 70.) The assault occurred on the MSU campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jane Roe 1 \"immediately\" reported the assault to the MSU Police and also went to Sparrow Clinton Hospital to have a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) perform an exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) In February 2014, Jane Roe 1 filed a formal complaint with Garcia-Williams, who promised to interview two witnesses before Spring Break. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Jane Roe 1 contacted Garcia-Williams in March and April. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73 and 74.) Both times she was told that MSU was waiting for the SANE report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In late April and again in May, Jane Roe 1's mother contacted MSU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75 and 76.) Both times she was told that MSU was still waiting for the SANE report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In April, the mother was told that John Doe 2 had not yet been interviewed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) After the telephone call in May, the mother called Sparrow Hospital and was told that the SANE report had been sent to MSU on March 14, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Jane Roe 1's mother made several attempts over the next few months to speak with Garcia-Williams and her supervisor, Defendant Russell, with varying success. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-85.) In November, MSU informed Jane Roe 1 that it had completed its investigation and that the report was available for Jane Roe 1 to pick up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Jane Roe 1 did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On December 15, 2014, Garcia-Williams emailed Jane Roe 1 and informed her that MSU had concluded there was insufficient evidence to find that John Doe 2 violated MSU's Sexual Harassment Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. Plaintiff Jane Roe 2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   John Doe 3 sexually assaulted Jane Roe 2 on August 23, 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 92.) Jane Roe 2 reported her assault on August 26. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) Garcia-Williams interviewed John Doe 3 on September 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) On December 10, 2013 MSU issued a report finding John Doe 3 violated MSU's Student Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) John Doe 3 was expelled on January 29, 2014, after a hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) John Doe 3 appealed his suspension, which was upheld by Defendant Maybank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While the investigation and appeals occurred, John Doe 3 was able to complete the semester, and he subsequently transferred to another school. (Compl. \u00b6 104.) John Doe 3 was allowed to remain on campus throughout the investigation and appeal, subject to a personal protection order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Nevertheless, Jane Roe 2 did encounter John Doe 3 on at least one occasion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.) On May 5, 2014, MSU contacted Jane Roe 2 to let her know that John Doe 3 received permission to return to campus on May 10 to attend a graduation ceremony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) Jane Roe 2 was not consulted about the decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   D. Plaintiff Gross\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff Shayna Gross was an acquaintance of, and was friendly with, John Doe. (Compl. \u00b6 139.) In February 2013, John Doe invited Gross to hang out at the Kappa Sigma fraternity house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140.) Gross made clear to John Doe that they would be hanging out only as friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gross and a friend went together to the fraternity house that night, where John Doe served Gross alcoholic drinks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141.) Gross can only remember flashes of the evening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142.) The next morning,\n   John Doe informed Gross that they had sex in the fraternity house, in her dorm room, and also in his dorm room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Approximately one year later, Gross reported the sexual assault to MSU on February 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.) Gross contacted Garcia-Williams multiple times for status updates about the investigation, and never received a timely response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.) MSU completed the investigation on October 14, 2014, concluding that John Doe had sexually assaulted Gross. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147.) A hearing occurred in January 2015, and John Doe was expelled in February. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 150-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   John Doe filed two appeals. His first appeal was denied on March 2, 2015, by MSU's appellate board. (Compl. \u00b6 153.) After he filed a second appeal, Defendant Maybank informed Gross that MSU's conclusions would be set aside and that an outside law firm would be hired to conduct a new investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155.) The law firm issued a report on May 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157.) The report concluded that John Doe and Gross had sexual relations that night, but could not conclude that the relations were non-consensual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gross appealed the decision, which was denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 159-60.) Throughout the investigation and appeals, John Doe was allowed to remain on campus, without restrictions.

During the investigation, MSU did not put in place any accommodations to prevent Kollaritsch from encountering her harasser. The final report did not accurately describe the allege assaults and Kollaritsch was not informed of her right to appeal the sanctions that were imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A no-contact order was imposed on John Doe as part of the sanctions against him.

Kollaritsch was not permitted to be involved in the retaliation investigation, no hearing was held, and when MSU concluded its investigation, Kollaritsch was again was not informed of her ability to file an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that MSU's deliberate indifference deprived Kollaritsch of educational opportunities.

The explanations for the delay provided by the investigator appear questionable. Jane Roe 1 and her mother had to reach out to the investigators every few weeks to check on the status of the investigation.

Plaintiffs allege Jane Roe 1 reported the assault to appropriate MSU officials. (Compl. \u00b6 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Taken as true, the complaint does not allege facts establishing that MSU's actions were deliberately indifferent. The investigation took approximately six months. During the investigation, John Doe 3 was subject to a personal protection order granted to Jane Roe 2. Plaintiffs do allege that Jane Roe 2 did encounter her assailant once during the investigation, but provide no context or description of the encounter. Plaintiffs do not allege that Jane Roe 3 suffered any additional harassment after she made her initial report. John Doe 3 was ultimately expelled. After he was expelled, MSU allowed him to return once to attend a graduation ceremony. And, MSU warned Jane Roe 2 that John Doe was allowed to be there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, taking the allegations in the complaint as true, Jane Roe 2 has not alleged sufficient facts to show that she was deprived of educational opportunities because of MSU's deliberate indifference.

Although the final decision was initially upheld after an appeal, John Doe's expulsion was subsequently set aside and second investigation was permitted. Throughout the investigation, John Doe remained on campus, although the complaint does not allege whether John Doe was subject to any restrictions on his contact with Gross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, Plaintiffs have established that Gross was deprived of educational opportunities because of MSU's deliberate indifference. Because of the manner in which MSU investigated her report, she stopped participating in extra-curricular activities. Because of the stress caused by the investigation, Gross had problems in classes and had to seek accommodations from professors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   E. Claims Arising from the DCL, the Resolution Agreement, and a Policy of Inaction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To the extent Plaintiffs' Title IX claims rely on standards identified in the DCL, in the Resolution Agreement, or by a policy of inaction, those claims must be dismissed. In various parts of the complaint, Plaintiffs assert that MSU's investigations violated standards identified in the DCL or in MSU's own policies, as reflected in the Resolution Agreement. In their response to the motion, Plaintiffs argue their Title IX claims can be based on a policy of inaction in response to known risks of sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   An institution's failure to follow published procedures will not necessarily establish deliberate indifference.

Paragraph 103 provides background for Jane Roe 2's claim. Simon is alleged to have said that it was a mistake to allow John Doe 3 to return to campus. Plaintiffs have not alleged that Simon made the decision to allow John Doe 3 to return to campus. Plaintiffs have not alleged that Simon participated in the investigation. Paragraph 148 provides background information for Gross's claim. In that paragraph Plaintiffs allege that Gross emailed Simon to express concerns about how MSU handled the investigation. This allegation does not establish that Simon participated in the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   2.

In paragraph 173, Youatt is identified as one of the defendants to Count 2. The complaint contains no allegations about any action taken by Youatt. The complaint does not allege that Youatt had knowledge of any of the events giving rise to any of the claims brought by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   3. Defendant Maybank\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts for an Equal Protection claim against Defendant Maybank for her deliberate indifference to Gross's report, but not for deliberate indifference to either Kollaritsch's report or Jane Roe 2's report. Maybank is mentioned in paragraphs 64 and 65 (Kollaritsch background), 97 and 102 (Jane Roe 2 background), and 155 (Gross background).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the Equal Protection claim brought by Gross, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that Maybank was deliberately indifferent. In paragraph 155, Plaintiffs allege, in November 2015, Maybank informed Gross that the initial investigation and conclusion would be disregarded and a new investigation would be opened into Gross's allegations against John Doe, which would be conducted by outside counsel. At least in the complaint, no explanation for this decision is provided. Assuming the allegations in the complaint to be true, including the allegation that John Doe sexually assaulted Gross three times and that the initial appeal was denied, this decision was unreasonable under the circumstances as a response to Gross's allegation of a sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For the Equal Protection claim brought by Kollaritsch against Maybank, Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to show deliberate indifference. Kollaritsch contends she met with Maybank in August 2013 and told Maybank she did not feel safe on campus. Two weeks later, Maybank emailed Kollaritsch, \"effectively refused to do anything,\" and told Kollaritsch to contact MSU Police. The meeting occurred after John Doe had been disciplined, after Kollartisch's retaliation complaint and been resolved, and after Kollaritsch's appeal was denied. These allegations do not show deliberate indifference; Maybank's response was not clearly unreasonable under the circumstances. The investigation and appeals process had been completed, and Maybank was relying on those proceedings. The Court will not second guess Maybank's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the Equal Protection claim brought by Jane Roe 2 against Maybank, Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to show deliberate indifference. In paragraph 97, Plaintiffs allege as Maybank upheld the expulsion of John Doe 3. This allegation cannot be the basis of a claim for deliberate indifference. Plaintiffs' claim must arise from the decision to allow John Doe 3 on campus for a graduation ceremony, the allegation in paragraph 107. It is not clear if Maybank made the decision to allow John Doe 3 on campus, or if Maybank denied Jane Roe 2's appeal of that decision. Neither decision amounts to deliberate indifference. MSU alerted Jane Roe 2 that John Doe 3 had been given leave to be on campus. Jane Roe 2 does not allege that she encountered John Doe 3 during this brief window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants assert that they are immune from Plaintiffs' constitutional claims.

In 2012, before any of these incidents occurred, the Sixth Circuit issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Port Huron School District\n   </em>\n   . Although that case involved racial discrimination, the panel addressed a claim that individual government officials may violate a plaintiff's Equal Protection claim through deliberate indifference to claims of peer harassment. The defendants raised qualified immunity as a defense, and the court found that each defendant was not deliberately indifferent.

In their response, Plaintiffs' concede that their ELCRA claims are improper and voluntarily dismiss the claims. (ECF No. 39 Pl. Resp. at 1 n.1 PageID.417.)

Because Plaintiffs have conceded their Due Process claims, their ECLRA claims, and their claim against the Trustees for Equal Protection, those claims will dismissed. Jane Roe 2's Title IX claim must be dismissed because the complaint does not allege facts to show that MSU's response to her report was deliberately indifferent or that she was deprived of educational opportunities as the result of deliberate indifference. Plaintiffs' Title IX claims based on the DCL, the Resolution Agreement, and a policy of inaction in response to known dangers are dismissed. The DCL does not set forth standards that can be used for a Title IX claim and the Resolution Agreement was not issued when these events occurred. Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support a claim based on a policy of inaction in response to known dangers, as that theory has been described in other Title IX opinions. The Equal Protection claims brought against Simon and Youatt are dismissed. The complaint does not plead sufficient facts to show either defendant acted with\n   deliberate indifference. For the same reason, the Equal Protection claims brought by Kollaritsch and Jane Roe 2 against Maybank are dismissed. Because the law was clearly established at the time, Defendant Maybank's request for qualified immunity for the Equal Protection claim is denied. The following claims are not dismissed: (1) Kollartich's Title IX claim against MSU Trustees, (2) Jane Roe 1's Title IX claim against MSU Trustees, (3) Gross's Title IX claim against MSU Trustees, and (4) Gross's Equal Protection claim against Maybank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the reasons provided in the accompanying Opinion, Defendants' motion to dismiss (ECF No. 28) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The following claims are DISMISSED with prejudice: (1) Plaintiffs' Due Process claims, (2) Plaintiffs' ELCRA claims, (3) Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim against Defendant Trustees, (4) Jane Roe 2's Title IX claim against Defendant Trustees, (5) Plaintiffs' Title IX claims arising from the DCL, the Resolution Agreement, and MSU Trustee's policy of inaction, (6) Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claims against Defendant Simon, (7) Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claims against Defendant Youatt, (8) Plaintiff Kollaritsch's Equal Protection claim against Defendant Maybank, and (9) Plaintiff Jane Roe 2's Equal Protection Claim against Defendant Maybank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Also, Defendant Maybank's request for qualified immunity is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Plaintiffs also asserted a claim for negligence against a campus fraternity and the national chapter.

It states \"[f]or the first time, she did mention that John Doe 2 had withdrawn from MSU for the time being.\" (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Jane Roe 1 filed her report on February 25.
