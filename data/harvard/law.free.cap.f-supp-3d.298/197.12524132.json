In addition, defendant seeks dismissal of plaintiff's race discrimination and hostile work environment claims to the extent that they are based on conduct that does not rise to level of an adverse employment action. Plaintiff admits that the retaliation claim was not raised at the administrative level, and the Court agrees that certain claims should be dismissed. So the motion will be granted for the reasons explained more fully below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Work History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is an African American woman who worked for FEMA as a GS-7 legal secretary from October 2011 through April 2013. She was assigned to the Office of General Counsel's Mission Support Division and supervised by Ashley Darbo. The gravamen of plaintiff's complaint is that Darbo \"harassed, discriminated, retaliated and wrongfully terminated her after she engaged in protected activity twice[.]\" Compl. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint sets out the following facts, which are accepted as true for purposes of this motion. Plaintiff alleges that she complained about Darbo to Darbo's supervisor, Joshua Stanton, on June 5, 2012 and November 28, 2012, and she \"consulted with Mr. Doug Goudy, EEOC President,\" on October 24, 2012 and April 19, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff told both Stanton and Goudy that she was \"being harassed and\n   treated differently than Caucasian employees in the office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff talked to Stanton about Darbo in particular. She told Stanton that Darbo \"was cold and distant towards her ... was unapproachable[,] ... failed to interact with her, [and] would single her out, which made her feel unwelcomed when she had asked questions concerning her work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Stanton informed Darbo's immediate supervisor, Leigh Hoburg, about plaintiff's complaints on June 5, 2012, and Hoburg, in turn, notified Darbo of the complaint that same day by email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the plaintiff, \"after the complaints, ... Darbo got mad and got even and further mistreated [plaintiff] as she was singled out continuously[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Plaintiff lists a number of actions that her supervisor then took against her; the complaint alleges that Darbo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 told plaintiff that she did not have two 15 minute breaks;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 reduced her lunch break to 30 minutes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 ordered her to submit a weekly timed work summary;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 used her flexible schedule against her;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 issued a Letter of Reprimand (LOR) for sending an overnight mail request to a judge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 brought her to tears when instructing her to use her personal sick leave for visiting the FEMA agency nurse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 \"rebelled against excused absence/administrative leave for visiting the FEMA nurse;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 \"adversely withheld [ ]her annual performance rating on April 19, 2013, including a review; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 finally terminated plaintiff that day on the basis of \"poor performance\" without producing any performance appraisal identifying deficiencies in her work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. With respect to the events resulting in termination, plaintiff alleges that Darbo \"maliciously interfered with [her] work performance numerous times and employment productivity which created a hostile offensive work environment to deliberately withhold her performance evaluation from view.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. She adds that \"all of the Caucasian staff was provided their performance evaluation\" while plaintiff's evaluation \"was withheld even on the date she was terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff received an annual performance appraisal and formal termination letter on April 23, 2013, when she alleges that she learned for the first time \"that she was terminated for reasons of communication, articulation and solution oriented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's EEO Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The EEOC Final Order attached to the complaint [Dkt. 1-1, ECF pp. 17-21] establishes that plaintiff contacted an EEO Counselor on April 19, 2013, and filed a formal complaint on August 7, 2013. Plaintiff requested a hearing, but the Administrative Judge issued a decision on September 7, 2016 without a hearing, concluding that plaintiff \"failed to prove she was discriminated against as alleged.\" Final Order at 2. The \"Claims at Issue\" were whether plaintiff was discriminated against and subjected to a hostile work environment based on race when: (1) she was issued a letter of reprimand on March 7, 2013; (2) her supervisor \"did not sit with her to review her performance evaluation [in April 2013], despite sitting with other employees\"; (3) her supervisor refused to approve her time sheet on April 9, 2013; and (4) she was removed from federal service on April 19, 2013. Final Order at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The agency issued its Final Order on October 4, 2016, and plaintiff filed this\n   action on January 4, 2017. Plaintiff styles her four claims as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Count One: Harassment and Retaliation Discrimination in Violation of Title VII, \"based on race in whole or in part[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Count Two: Reprisal for Engaging in Protected Activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Count Three: Employment Non-Sexual Harassment, based on Darbo's \"severe and pervasive\" conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Count Four: Hostile and Abusive Working Environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Compl. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"To survive a [ Rule 12(b)(6) ] motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The plaintiff fully expressed ... that Ms. Darbo's demeanor was cold and distant towards her and she was unapproachable. She also informed [the supervisor] that Ms. Darbo didn't interact with her, would single her out, which made her feel unwelcomed when she had asked questions concerning her work.\" Compl. \u00b6 5. Those are the only allegations that relate to the discrimination that led plaintiff to complain in the first place, and they say little that would make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on those allegations alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In paragraph 6, plaintiff alleges that \"after the complaints, Ms. Darbo got mad and got even and further mistreated her ....\" She recites a number of actions taken by Darbo, culminating in a bad performance rating and plaintiff's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Count One is entitled \"harassment and retaliation discrimination in violation of Title VII,\" but it states that all of the \"intentional conduct as asserted at length herein,\" which would include the performance review and termination, \"constitutes discrimination based on race\" in violation of Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Count Two-\"reprisal for engaging in protected activities\"-appears to be a retaliation claim in violation of Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Count Three-\"employment non-sexual harassment\"-appears to be a hostile work environment claim alleging that plaintiff was subjected to intimidating, hostile and abusive treatment by her supervisor. She does not specify whether it was driven by discriminatory or retaliatory animus, though, nor does she cite Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Count Four also alleges \"hostile and abusive working environment.\" This claim is based on Title VII, but again, it does not specify if plaintiff is predicating the claim on retaliation or discrimination.
