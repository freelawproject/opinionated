(Doc. No. 34.) Plaintiff opposed OTB's motion. (Doc. No. 37.) For the reasons discussed below, OTB's motion for summary judgment is granted in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff began working at OTB as a server in September of 2009 at the Airport Road restaurant in Allentown, Pennsylvania. (JA 0032.) Defendant, Walker was a cook for OTB. (JA 0444.) At the time of the incident, Walker was out of work on medical leave as a result of a serious health condition. (JA 0494.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    OTB's Policies and procedures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   OTB's Employee Handbook identifies its policies and procedures regarding all forms of discrimination and harassment. (JA 0319-21.) OTB's policy prohibits sexual harassment and \"applies to everyone involved in [its] operations (including guests) and prohibits harassment by any Team Member of the Company.\" (JA 0319-20.) OTB's policy expressly prohibits \"[r]etaliation against any person who voices a concern, files a complaint with Human Resources or participates in any subsequent related investigation....\" (JA 0320.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   OTB Team Members who are subjected to any form of harassment or discrimination, or who have witnessed harassment or discrimination, are obligated to report it immediately to any of the following: supervisors, managers, Area Directors, or Human Resources. (JA 0320.) OTB Team Members are free to pick from among those listed without any requirement that they follow a specified chain of command in reporting the harassment or discrimination. (JA 0320.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The employee handbook sets forth the Complaint Resolution Procedure available to employees experiencing any work related issues such as harassment. (JA 0320.) OTB maintains an \"Open Door Policy\" that \"encourages an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or question receives a timely response.\" (JA 0316.) Team Members can also file a complaint anonymously by calling the Team Member hotline or utilizing the website at www.MySafeWorkplace.com. (JA 0314.) In addition to the policies outlined in the Employee Handbook, the subject OTB restaurant had a poster on the door of the managers' office which provided information about reporting complaints. (JA 0228-29; JA 0345.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The March 23, 2015 Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 23, 2015, plaintiff was working the opening shift from 11:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. (JA 0056.) Shortly after 11:00 a.m., Walker arrived at the restaurant with a co-worker, Sherwood Sanders, to submit a physician's note authorizing him to return to work effective March 30, 2015. (JA 0727-28; JA 061; JA 0494.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff was walking with two soda cups in her hands when she first saw Walker. (JA 0063.) Walker approached plaintiff and leaned very close to her face. (JA 0064-65.) Plaintiff stopped walking and was holding the soda cups in her hands directly in front of her body at chest level. (JA 0070.) Walker leaned into her, reached over the cups and used both of his hands to grab and hold onto her breasts. (JA 0066; JA 0070.) Plaintiff alleges that while Walker groped her breasts he said \"my God, I miss these....\" (JA 0066.) Plaintiff claims that Walker held onto her breasts for ten seconds. (JA 0067-68.) Walker did not touch her anywhere other than her breasts. (JA 0066-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she left the kitchen and served the sodas she was carrying to her customers. (JA 0073.) After she served the sodas, plaintiff approached a co-worker, Caitlin Premich and said \"you won't believe what Willie [Walker] just did to me\" and she described how Walker\n   allegedly touched her. (JA 0077.) During this conversation, another co-worker, Toni Trunzo, approached and asked what they were talking about. (JA 0077-78.) Plaintiff described the incident to Ms. Trunzo. (JA 0078-79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Approximately an hour after the incident occurred, plaintiff went to report it to a manager. (JA 0449-450.) She walked into the kitchen and saw her co-worker Sherwood Sanders, who accompanied Mr. Walker to OTB that morning. (JA 0082.) Plaintiff asked Sanders if he saw what Walker did to her, but he replied that he did not see anything. Plaintiff then described the incident to Sanders. (JA 0087-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff proceeded to the managers' office. (JA 0088.) Plaintiff saw the two managers, Nick Clowers and R.J. Cabrera standing near an exit and described the incident. (JA 0089-90.) Clowers took plaintiff to the managers' office and she described the incident again. (JA 0091.) Clowers recommended that they contact Human Resources, but plaintiff said that she wanted to wait before contacting Human Resources. (JA 0092.) Plaintiff testified that she was \"still in shock\" and that she wanted to make sure her tables were in order. (JA 0092.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   About thirty minutes after their first conversation, Clowers approached plaintiff again, asked if she was okay, and asked who witnessed the incident. (JA 0094.) Plaintiff identified Sanders and Premich as having witnessed the incident. (JA 0340; JA 0447-48.) Clowers prepared a written statement that the plaintiff reviewed and signed. (JA 0055.) Clowers followed-up with plaintiff several times throughout the day, trying to calm her down and assuring plaintiff that her tables would be taken care of while they handled this. (JA 0095.) Plaintiff testified that Clowers was caring and concerned, and that he did everything she asked him to do. (JA 0095.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Approximately three or four hours after the incident, at the urging of Clowers, plaintiff contacted Human Resources. (JA 0450.) Plaintiff spoke with Debra Blackmon, Senior Regional Resources Manager for OTB who is responsible for the eastern region. (JA 0099; JA 0351-52.) Clowers was present for the conversation. (JA 0102-03.) Ms. Blackmon asked plaintiff to describe the incident, and asked what plaintiff would like to have as a resolution. (JA 0103.) Blackmon also asked if there were any witnesses. (JA 0495; JA 104-05.) Plaintiff identified Sanders and stated that other team members were also present. (JA 0495; JA 104-05.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Blackmon thanked plaintiff for reporting her concerns and asked plaintiff to refrain from speaking with anyone about the incident. (JA 0495; JA 0105.) Ms. Blackmon advised plaintiff that she would conduct an investigation into the allegations of harassment against Mr. Walker, and that she would stay in contact with plaintiff. (JA 0106.) Plaintiff believed that Ms. Blackmon was concerned about her allegations, and plaintiff testified that the conversation was professional. (JA 0106.) Ms. Blackmon noted that plaintiff was defensive and angry when questioned about the incident. (JA 0494-95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 24, 2015, the day after the incident, Ms. Blackmon received an email from Clowers that plaintiff attempted to reach her. Ms. Blackmon called plaintiff and said she \"wanted to be certain she understood exactly what happened,\" and asked plaintiff to describe the incident again. (JA 0495; JA 0112-13.) Ms. Blackmon also asked if there were any other witnesses to the incident. (JA 0495; JA 0112-13.) Plaintiff identified Ms. Trunzo. (JA 0495.) Blackmon asked if plaintiff had any previous concerns about, or incidents with, Mr. Walker. (JA 0495; JA 0114-15.) Plaintiff responded that Walker was \"very\n   moody on [the] grill\" but she had no prior problems with him. (JA 0495, JA 0447; JA 0115-16.) Ms. Blackmon advised plaintiff that she would speak with Mr. Walker as part of her investigation, but that due to his leave of absence she would need to wait until he was released to return to work. (JA 0495; JA 0116.) Plaintiff stated, \"I want to feel safe and it makes me angry and mad.\" (JA 0495.) Ms. Blackmon replied that Mr. Walker would not be permitted to return to work while the investigation was pending. (JA 0495; JA 0116-17.) Ms. Blackmon reiterated OTB's open door policy and assured plaintiff she had done the right thing in reporting the incident. (JA 0495; JA 0116-117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Blackmon next spoke to plaintiff on March 27, 2015. (JA 0496.) Plaintiff expressed frustration with the investigation and Ms. Blackmon explained that they would be unable to reach a resolution until they had an opportunity to speak with Mr. Walker. (JA 0496.) Ms. Blackmon discussed the benefits of the Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") and encouraged plaintiff to take advantage of their services. (JA 0496; JA 0118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 1, 2015, Ms. Blackmon received notification from the Area Director, Ed Jarvis, that plaintiff resigned. (JA 0496.) Ms. Blackmon called plaintiff to see how she was doing. Plaintiff stated, \"I don't feel comfortable here.\" (JA 0496.) Ms. Blackmon reminded plaintiff that she had access to the EAP services, which she had yet to utilize. (JA 0496.) Ms. Blackmon also asked what else she could to do help her and plaintiff replied, \"You guys have done everything you can do...you offered something I have not taken advantage of (EAP).\" (JA 0497.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During this call, plaintiff also expressed concerns that she would be treated differently. (JA 0497.) Ms. Blackmon assured plaintiff that she was correct in reporting the incident, and reminded her that the investigation was confidential. (JA 0497.) Ms. Blackmon stated that they were working towards a resolution, but advised that it takes time to speak with all those involved and to obtain all the pertinent information. (JA 0497.) Plaintiff asked Ms. Blackmon when she anticipated the investigation would be over, and Ms. Blackmon said she hoped to have a resolution by the end of the week. (JA 0497.) Plaintiff decided not to resign at that time. (JA 0497.) Ms. Blackmon told plaintiff to reach out at any time, and said she would call her on Friday with either an outcome or an update. (JA 0497.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As part of Blackmon's investigation, she conducted phone interviews and obtained statements from all potential witnesses. (JA 0498-500; JA 0393-96; JA 0406.) Ms. Blackmon requested a written statement from Ms. Premich and interviewed her over the phone on April 3, 2015. (JA 0393-94; JA 0499.) During this interview, Ms. Premich said that she did not witness the incident, and knew only what plaintiff told her about the incident. (JA 0499; JA 0699.) Also on April 3, 2015, Ms. Blackmon interviewed Mr. Sanders. He explained that he accompanied Mr. Walker to OTB on the date of the incident so that Mr. Walker could submit a doctor's note to management. (JA 0497.) Mr. Sanders did not see Mr. Walker touch plaintiff. (JA 0497-98.) Ms. Blackmon also obtained statements from Ms. Trunzo, Mary Sook and Teresa Larson. (JA 0500; JA 0700-03.) These individuals did not witness the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 3, 2015, Ms. Blackmon contacted plaintiff to update her on the progress of the investigation. (JA 0498; JA 0133.) Ms. Blackmon informed plaintiff that none of the individuals identified by plaintiff witnessed the alleged incident. (JA 0498; JA 0134.) Plaintiff then suggested that Lisandra Saez may have witnessed the incident. (JA 0498; JA 0134.) That same day, Ms. Blackmon interviewed Ms. Saez on the\n   phone. (JA 0500.) Ms. Saez informed Ms. Blackmon that she did not witness the incident, and that her knowledge was based only on what plaintiff told her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Blackmon then interviewed Mr. Walker on April 3, 2015. (JA 0499.) Defendant stated that he exchanged hugs with many Team Members, including plaintiff, who were welcoming him back from his leave of absence. (JA 0499; JA 0735; JA 0779-80.) Mr. Walker denied touching plaintiff's breasts. (JA 0499; JA 0776-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 3, 2015, Ms. Blackmon concluded the investigation. (JA 0438; JA 0501.) She determined that there were no witnesses to the alleged incident, there were no prior complaints about Walker from plaintiff or anyone else, and that plaintiff's allegations could not be corroborated. (JA 501; JA 0391-92; JA 0446.) Ms. Blackmon recommended that Walker be returned to work. (JA 0501; JA 0391-92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to OTB's policies and procedures, Ms. Blackmon submitted her recommendation to her immediate supervisor, Jacque Shensky. (JA 0387.) Ms. Shensky agreed with the recommendation. (JA 0403.) The investigation was concluded and on April 3, 2015 the decision was made to return Walker to work. (JA 0414.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The final step in the investigation required Ms. Blackmon to speak with plaintiff to discuss the results of the investigation. (JA 0439.) On April 3, 2015, Ms. Blackmon left a voicemail for plaintiff stating that they reached a conclusion in the investigation, and asking plaintiff to contact her any time over the weekend. (JA 0501; JA 0438-41; JA 0136-37.) Plaintiff did not return Ms. Blackmon's call. (JA 0439-40.) In light of the fact that Ms. Blackmon was unable to reach plaintiff, she asked the Area Director to advise Mr. Walker that the investigation was ongoing and that he could not return to work until it was concluded. (JA 0440-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ms. Blackmon spoke with plaintiff on April 6, 2015. (JA 0442.) She informed plaintiff that the investigation was concluded and OTB was unable to substantiate her claim against Walker. (JA 0442; JA 0137-38; JA 501.) Ms. Blackmon stated that Mr. Walker would be returning to work and then plaintiff hung up the phone. (JA 0442.) Ms. Blackmon testified that, had plaintiff not ended the call she would have advised plaintiff how OTB intended to ensure that she would have only limited contact with Mr. Walker, and that any such contact would be monitored so that she felt comfortable. (JA 0444.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Remedial Measures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 6, 2015, Ms. Blackmon called Walker to advise him of the results of the investigation. (JA 0501.) Ms. Blackmon informed Walker that he could return to work, but that all future contact and communication between him and Plaintiff were limited to business-related subjects. (JA 0501.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Blackmon contacted Mr. Jarvis and directed all Allentown managers to monitor the interactions between plaintiff and Mr. Walker. (JA 0444; JA 0501; JA 0536.) Under their existing schedules, Walker and Plaintiff only worked together twice a week for approximately three to four hours per shift. (JA 0443; JA 0707.) Based on their job duties and responsibilities, plaintiff and Walker were only required to interact when plaintiff picked up fajitas. (JA 0240-41; JA 0538.) General Manager Jim Martin\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   approved plaintiff's request to have another server pick up fajitas near\n   where Walker worked. (JA 0707; JA 0241; JA 0538.) This eliminated all work-related interactions between Walker and plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (JA 0203.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pursuant to Ms. Blackmon's recommendation, General Manager Martin directed the managers to keep a \"close watch\" on plaintiff's interactions with Walker to ensure plaintiff was comfortable with Walker's presence. (JA 0502.) In addition, when Walker returned to work on April 7, 2015, Mr. Martin reviewed OTB's anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies with Walker. (JA 0706-07; JA 0747-48; JA 0800-01; JA 0502; JA 0538.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff resigned on April 17, 2015. Between April 7, 2015 and April 17, 2015, plaintiff worked three shifts with Walker. (JA 0202.) Plaintiff had no interaction with Walker during these shifts and she testified that he did not do anything inappropriate. (JA 0202-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On May 7, 2015, plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC. (JA 0342.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff filed an initial complaint on March 18, 2016. (Doc. No. 1.) Plaintiff's complaint alleged four claims against OTB: (1) hostile work environment based on sexual harassment under Title VII; (2) retaliation under Title VII; (3) negligence under Title VII; and (4) negligent retention under Pennsylvania State law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-57.) Plaintiff alleged two claims against Walker for assault and battery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-64.) Plaintiff also sought the imposition of punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-69.) On June 20, 2016, defendants filed their Answer with affirmative defenses. (Doc. No. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On June 16, 2017, following the close of discovery, defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 34.) On June 28, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file excess pages (Doc. No. 36) and on June 30, 2017, plaintiff filed a response in opposition to defendant's motion. (Doc.

(JA 0450.) She inquired into the incident and whether there were any witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Blackmon spoke with and obtained written statements from each employee identified by plaintiff as having possibly witnessed the incident. (JA 0498-500; JA 0393-96; JA 0406.) None of the individuals witnessed the incident. Ms. Blackmon interviewed Mr. Walker who denied the allegations. (JA 0499.) During this 14-day investigation, Ms. Blackmon spoke with plaintiff six separate times. (JA 0448.) Ms. Blackmon made the following findings: (1) that there were no witnesses to the alleged incident; (2) there were no prior complaints about Walker from plaintiff or anyone else, and (3) plaintiff's allegations could not be corroborated. (JA 0501; JA 0391-92; JA 0446.) Ms. Blackmon's conclusion that Walker was permitted to return to work was based, in part, of the fact that during Walker's fairly lengthy term of employment with OTB, he had no history of this type of behavior and there was no documentation of prior inappropriate conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (JA 0429; JA 0464.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although Ms. Blackmon was unable to make a finding that the harassment occurred, she nevertheless took remedial action to \"ensure that ...

Walker was reissued the Employee Handbook, and specifically the section pertaining to sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Blackmon also limited plaintiff's\n   contact with Walker. Plaintiff and Mr. Walker both had long-established schedules, which overlapped on only two shifts per week for approximately three or four hours per shift. (JA 0443.) During the limited time when their shifts overlapped, General Manager Martin approved plaintiff's request to designate another server to pick up her fajita orders. (JA 0707.) In doing so, OTB eliminated the only business-related interaction plaintiff and Walker would have over the course of a shift. (JA 0240-41; JA 0538; JA 0203.) Ms. Blackmon also directed the managers to monitor any interactions between Walker and plaintiff to ensure her safety. (JA 0444.) I find that these remedial measures were prompt and appropriate to prevent future harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knabe\n   </em>\n   , 114 F.3d at 413 (holding that the employer's remedial action was adequate where the evidence demonstrated that the employer discussed the company's policies concerning sexual harassment with the alleged harasser, and informed plaintiff of her rights in the case of future improper conduct.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In her opposition, plaintiff sets forth alternative remedial measures that should have been taken by OTB.

Plaintiff testified that no one witnessed any prior harassment by Walker (JA 0219-22), and she never experienced any inappropriate behavior from Walker before March 23, 2015. (JA 0446-47; JA 0501.)

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 37.) The Employee handbook, which is provided to each new hire, expressly prohibits sexual harassment and explains the multiple avenues for filing complaints. (\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    , JA 0316 (explaining that OTB has an open door policy for any \"problem, complaint, suggestion, or question\" and encouraging employees to speak to their Manager, General Manager, Area Director, or any member of the Human Resources team.);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    JA 0316 (providing an option for filing an anonymous complaint by calling the Team Member Hotline or utilizing the website, www.MySafeWorkplace.com.).)

(Doc. No. 34 at 3-6.) I agree. Plaintiff alleged in her EEOC complaint that she was subjected to Walker's sexual harassment for a period of years leading up to the incident on March 23, 2015. Plaintiff knew of OTB's various avenues for reporting complaints, (\n    <em>\n     see e.g.\n    </em>\n    , JA 0052-53; JA 0231), and failed to report these alleged prior instances of harassment. Plaintiff was also unable to identify any witnesses to Walker's alleged prior harassment or inappropriate behavior. (JA 0219-22.) Tellingly, plaintiff does not oppose this portion of defendant's motion. In fact, plaintiff told Ms. Blackmon that other than the alleged incident on March 23, 2015, Walker never acted inappropriately towards her. (JA 0446-47; JA 0501.) I find that plaintiff cannot establish that OTB knew or should have known of any prior misconduct by Walker. Therefore, my analysis focuses only on whether OTB \"took prompt and adequate remedial action\" after receiving notice of the March 23, 2015 incident.\n    <em>\n     Knabe v.

First, plaintiff argues that the investigation was flawed because Ms. Blackmon did not interview any witnesses in person. Ms. Blackmon testified that she was able to assess credibility over the phone based on voice inflection, demeanor, and emotional state. (JA 0402.) The evidence also establishes that she spoke with each person identified by plaintiff, including those not initially mentioned by plaintiff, and obtained written statements. Conducting these interviews over the phone rather than in person does not render the investigation flawed. Equally unconvincing is plaintiff's second argument that the investigation was somehow flawed because Ms. Blackmon did not obtain Walker's statement until he returned from medical leave, eleven days after the incident. Ms. Blackmon testified that it was OTB's policy not to contact employees while on medical leave (JA 0417), and Walker was scheduled to return on March 30, 2015. (JA 0494.) I find that it was reasonable to wait until Walker's return from medical leave to obtain his statement, especially where every other aspect of the investigation was promptly handled. Finally, plaintiff argues that a remedial measure is inadequate if it places the burden on the victim to report future harassment. First, plaintiff relies only on Ninth Circuit case law for this proposition. Even if this were controlling authority, plaintiff's argument ignores the other remedial measures in place: specifically, all contact between plaintiff and Walker was eliminated during their two weekly shifts, and all managers were directed to monitor any interactions. The fact that OTB also reiterated the open door policy to plaintiff does not negate these remedial measures, but instead demonstrates their commitment to ensure plaintiff's safety. I find that no reasonable jury could conclude that Ms. Blackmon's investigation was so flawed as to render the remedial action inadequate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Plaintiff argues that there is a question of fact whether the handbook was actually reviewed with Walker. (JA 0755.) It is undisputed that prior to Walker's return to work, he was reissued the Employee Handbook. (JA 0709-10.) It is also undisputed that those portions of the handbook addressing sexual harassment were highlighted for Mr. Walker. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Mr. Walker signed and dated the Employee Handbook immediately below the highlighted portions that addressed sexual harassment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) I am satisfied that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Walker was reissued the employee handbook and that the relevant portions were brought to Mr. Walker's attention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Plaintiff submits that Ms. Blackmon had the ability to modify their work schedules but declined to do so.
