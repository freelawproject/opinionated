Therefore, it was reasonable that the ALJ did not give controlling weight to Dr. Sabharwal's opinion. T. 21. However, while the ALJ states she gave \"some\" weight to Dr. Sabharwal's opinion,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344179\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/98/588/#p595\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds the ALJ's explanation of that weight lacking given the vast difference between Dr. Sabharwal's opinion and the ALJ's RFC finding. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed below, the case must be remanded to the ALJ for further consideration of Dr. Sabharwal's opinion in light of this Court's analysis.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balodis v.

(remanding case for failure by ALJ in providing good reasons for not crediting the opinion of treating physician and not discussing how much weight, if any, would be given to the opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Given that the ALJ did not give Dr. Sabharwal's opinion controlling weight, the ALJ was required to address the six factors outlined above in determining how much weight to give to Dr. Sabharwal's opinion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Dr. Sabharwal had an on-going doctor-patient relationship with Plaintiff and saw Plaintiff periodically during the relevant period, which the ALJ notes in her opinion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , T. 492-93, 510-13, 539-40, 551-54. Second, regarding the nature and extent of the treatment, Dr. Sabharwal was Plaintiff's primary care physician during the relevant time period, and the Administrative Transcript contains several records of visits Plaintiff had with Dr. Sabharwal in which Plaintiff's back complaints were discussed.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, regarding supportability, Plaintiff's medical records show x-rays and MRIs ordered and considered by Dr. Sabharwal during the relevant time period.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , T. 481-82, 508-09. Notably, however, the ALJ never discusses Dr. Sabharwal's opinion from November 2, 2013, following an MRI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. 475-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The ALJ focuses primarily on the fourth factor, consistency with other medical evidence, when evaluating the weight to give Dr. Sabharwal's opinion and notes areas where she finds Dr. Sabharwal's opinion inconsistent with medical evidence. First, the ALJ notes, \"[a]lthough the record indicates positive findings on MRI studies and indication of pain and tenderness, the record indicates that the claimant's pain started progressing in the latter part of 2013 and the claimant's treatment has been conservative.\" T. 20. However, \"[n]either the trial judge nor the ALJ is permitted to substitute his own expertise or view of the medical proof for the treating physician's opinion,\" and the use of conservative medical interventions and over-the-counter, rather than prescription, medications is not \"substantial evidence that plaintiff was not physically disabled during the relevant period.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243925\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/126/#p134\">\n    221 F.3d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, there is evidence that Plaintiff was suffering from back pain prior to 2013 and was first diagnosed with \"severe disc degenerative changes ... including disc narrowing, increased sclerosis and large spur production\" in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. 360.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, the ALJ states the \"[t]he record is replete with physical examinations where the claimant's gait and stance are normal, there is no motor dysfunction, nor muscle atrophy, or sensory or reflect abnormalities.\" T. 21. However, Dr. Sabharwal's report is not inconsistent with these records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. 205 (indicating no muscle atrophy or normal gait).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, the ALJ's decision also points to Plaintiff's daily activities as inconsistent with Dr. Sabharwal's findings, noting that \"claimant indicated her daily activities include taking care of [her] mother including errands with and for her, driving, and shopping. Additionally, treating\n   notes indicate Plaintiff should exercise.\" T. 21. Without more explanation, it is not clear from the ALJ's decision how these activities are inconsistent with Dr. Sabharwal's findings. \"Exercise\" means drastically different things to different people, based on age, ability, and medical conditions. The same could be said of \"errands.\" \"Driving\" could span from a length of a few minutes over the course of a few blocks to virtually any length of time or distance. The citations to these activities, without more, do not necessarily render Dr. Sabharwal's findings inconsistent, nor, for that matter, do they necessarily support an RFC finding that Plaintiff \"could sit, stand, and walk for a maximum of 6 hours each.\" T. 13. To the extent the ALJ was unsure about the nature and extent of Plaintiff's activities and whether they were inconsistent with Dr. Sabharwal's findings, the \"ALJ may not reject a treating physician's conclusions for lack of clear findings without first attempting to fill in the gaps in the administrative record.\"\n   <em>\n    Kane v.
