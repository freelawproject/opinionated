In its single-count Complaint, plaintiff McAllister Olivarius alleges that defendant Mermel registered the domain name mcallisterolivariustruth.com in order to divert potential clients and others seeking information about the firm and, having done so, to induce plaintiff to reduce the amount it was seeking from him in unpaid legal fees by threatening to publish allegedly damaging documents about plaintiff on the website. Defendant thereby, in plaintiff's view, violated the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. Before the Court is defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

Mermel has earned postsecondary degrees from the University of Vermont, Columbia University, and the Divinity School at Yale University.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.2 \u00b6 2. Mermel retained plaintiff as counsel on or about May 15, 2012 in connection with a dispute with Yale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.5 \u00b6 8. The terms of plaintiff's representation in connection with this dispute were memorialized in a written engagement letter, which was signed by Mermel on May 15, 2012 (the \"Engagement Letter\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.5 \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex.

Defendant refused, and continues to refuse, to pay plaintiff as required by the terms of the Engagement Letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.6 \u00b6 11.

Mermel subsequently removed the website from the internet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.7 \u00b6 20.

Mermel opposed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.7 \u00b6 22.

Mermel first argues that this action is procedurally improper because McAllister Olivarius is the plaintiff and only defendants are entitled to removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"[A]ny civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.\"). However, this case does not involve removal. Granted, plaintiff sought to bring this claim in state court, but its request for leave to amend its complaint to include this cybersquatting claim was denied by the Connecticut state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at p.7 \u00b6 22. Plaintiff thereafter initiated the instant action in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Next, Mermel seems to argue that this case does not present a federal question because the \"original complaint\"-that is, the Connecticut complaint-alleged only breach of contract and quantum meruit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Mark Myers Mermel Motion to Dismiss the Complaint (\"Def. Mem.\") at 17, ECF No. 9. This argument, like the\n   previous one, misconstrues the relationship between this action and the Connecticut action. Although there may be a factual nexus between the two lawsuits, they are procedurally distinct. The cause of action that plaintiff has pled before this Court is based solely on a federal statute, the AntiCybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The case therefore presents a federal question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mermel's final argument relating to jurisdiction depends on a choice of law provision in the Engagement Letter stipulating that \"[a]ny dispute or legal issue arising from these terms of business or the engagement letter will be determined by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws of the State of Connecticut.\" Compl. at Ex. A. As an initial matter, plaintiff's anticybersquatting claim does not \"aris[e]\" from the terms of the parties' attorney-client relationship or the Engagement Letter. Therefore, the Engagement Letter's choice of law provision does not cover this dispute. Moreover, even if the clause were applicable here, it would govern only which state's law this Court must apply and therefore would not bar this Court's exercise of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Executive Telecard, Ltd. v.

The website bore the title \"McAllister Olivarius TRUTH\" but, as discussed, the Court cannot decide at this stage that this phrase is patently critical. The only other portion of the website that Mermel points to as containing commentary about plaintiff is the sentence \"Hi Mr. Jef\" that appeared on the homepage. Pl. Mem. at 26.

In addition, while plaintiff nakedly asserts that defendant intended to \"harm Plaintiff's goodwill and cause confusion as to the source, sponsorship affiliation, or endorsement of his website,\" by \"draw[ing] the attention of potential legal clients seeking representation by Plaintiff, [and] intercept[ing] them in their search of Plaintiff's website,\" Pl.

He stated further that although he had developed the aforementioned plan to defend himself against McAllister Olivarius, he \"would prefer a just resolution,\" which, in his view, meant that both parties \"should both just walk away with [McAllister\n   Olivarius] keeping the over $100,000 [Mermel] ha[d] already paid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He finally offered a payment of $44,293.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is tantamount to a request for money in exchange for not developing the website any further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In other words, Mermel's intent, in plaintiff's view, is to blackmail plaintiff into settling its bill collection efforts.

That is, Mermel did not intend to profit by selling the domain name or by diverting consumers to his site so that they would purchase his products.
