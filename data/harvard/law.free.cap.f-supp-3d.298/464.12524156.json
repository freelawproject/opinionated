Compl., Docket Entry No. 25). Currently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's (1) Fourth Amendment as-administered\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   claim for searches and seizures of collateral property, (2) Equal Protection claim for selective enforcement, (3) municipal liability claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) state malicious prosecution claim. (Def. Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 86; Def. Mem. in Supp. of Def. Mot. (\"Def. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 86-9.) Plaintiff cross-moves for declaratory relief holding New York City Charter \u00a7 436 (\"section 436\") and New York City Local Law No. 149 (\"Local Law 149\") facially unconstitutional under both the United States and New York State Constitutions. (Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 87; Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Pl. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 87-2.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants in part and denies in part both motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Gem is a licensed collateral loan broker, also known as a pawnbroker, and second-hand dealer. (Def. Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Local R. 56.1 (\"Def. 56.1\") \u00b6 9, Docket Entry No. 86-1.) As of April of 2014, Gem had twenty separate retail stores throughout New York City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In New York City, pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers have been subject to a variety of state and local regulations that require the recording and reporting of certain transactional information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5-8.) Pursuant to statute, including section 436, Defendant has broad supervisory authority over pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers, including the authority to question employees, examine premises and the records and merchandise thereon, and may issue summonses for failures to comply with the various requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2010, the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") instituted a policy designed to \"encourage\" the use of LeadsOnline, a \"web-based electronic data transfer\" database which serves as a repository for information that pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers are required to record and store pursuant to statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) LeadsOnline allows police officers to download and view every uploaded transaction. (Memo re: Increase Voluntary Use of \"LeadsOnline\" Electronic Pawnshop Database (\"Increase Use Memo\"), annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. R, Docket Entry No. 86-7.) The NYPD believed LeadsOnline would \"allow for the gathering of information on crimes, criminals, and possibly the recovery of property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the time, only sixteen out of approximately 145 pawnshops in New York City used LeadsOnline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gem was an early adopter of LeadsOnline. In 2007, Gem approached the NYPD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   about the potential use of LeadsOnline as \"an effort to extend an olive branch and [desire to] develop a mutually beneficial relationship.\" (Affidavit of Harold Dambrot in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Dambrot Aff.\") \u00b6 2, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 87-4.) Accordingly, Gem used LeadsOnline in 2010. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 26.) However, Gem discontinued its use in February of 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Harold Dambrot, Gem's Senior Vice President for Legal Matters, explained that Gem discontinued the use of LeadsOnline because of the \"constant\" police holds, i.e., requests to hold onto property, and requests for photographs of collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The NYPD encouraged officers to \"actively recruit[ ]\" pawnshops, second-hand dealers, and other businesses to use LeadsOnline. (March 30, 2011 Leads Online Recruitment and Survey (\"March 30, 2011 Memo\"), annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. R, Docket Entry No. 86-7.) Officers were also instructed to \"approach [pawnbrokers] ... to explain the benefits and operation\" of LeadsOnline. (May 12, 2010 Expansion of Voluntary Participation of Pawnbrokers in the \"LeadsOnline\" Database (\"May 12, 2010 Memo\"), annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. R, Docket Entry No. 86-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Gem, after it discontinued use of LeadsOnline, there was a noticeable increase in the police presence at its stores, beginning in the summer of 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dambrot Aff. \u00b6 3.) Joseph Taranto, a manager at one Gem store, testified that the number of police visits at his particular location increased from one to two times per day in 2010, to four to five times per day in the following years, pursuant to the efforts to increase the number of stores using LeadsOnline. (Joseph Taranto Dep. (\"Taranto Dep.\") 18:25-19:1, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. II, Docket Entry No. 87-38.) Dambrot, Taranto, and other Gem employees also testified at their depositions that such interactions were often hostile, accompanied by threats of arrest, and business disruption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Karan Ragoo Dep. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Ragoo Dep.\") 53:14-19, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. JJ, Docket Entry No. 87-39 (\"The nature of the threat was as soon as he came in he says you are not using LeadsOnline and he could shut me down.\").) The NYPD also issued Gem seven criminal summonses for various violations during this time. (Gem Summons, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. S, Docket Entry No. 86-7.) One summons, issued on September 19, 2012, was dismissed on December 21, 2012 after Gem appeared in court before Judge Raciti at the Criminal Court of the City of New York in Kew Gardens, New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 21, 2012 Hr'g Tr. 5:18-22, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. GG, Docket Entry No. 86-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Other pawnshops have testified to similar experiences. Joseph Buoninfante, the senior manager of Quick Cash USA, LLC, a pawnbroker chain with nearly twenty stores in New York City, explained that their stores experienced a sharp increase in the number of police visits beginning in 2012. (Joseph Buoninfante Aff. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Buoninfante Aff.\") \u00b6 2, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. J, Docket Entry No. 87-13.) According to Buoninfante, these visits were accompanied by threats and orders to hold jewelry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Quick Cash USA gave in to the NYPD's demands to use LeadsOnline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Upon doing so, the alleged harassment ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Likewise, David Kaminsky, the president of EZ Pawn Corp., a pawnbroker chain with fourteen different stores in New York City, explained their stores were subject to an increased police presence, threats, harassment, and bullying, upon cancellation of their service with LeadsOnline on two separate occasions, in 2012 and May of 2015. (David Kaminsky Aff. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Kaminsky Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. I, Docket Entry No. 87-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to the asserted hostile nature of the police visits, Gem also complains more generally about officers' seizures and holds of pledged items. Gem has specifically identified eight seizures and holds as examples of problematic police conduct. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 31, 52.) Gem contends that the specifically identified seizures and holds are only examples of a much larger number of such actions. (Dambrot Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 6-10; Sandra Lopez Dep. (\"Lopez Dep.\") 32:13-19, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. KK, Docket Entry No. 87-40; Ragoo Dep. 26:24-27:5; Khariton Popilevsky Dep. (\"Popilevsky Dep.\") 30:19-25, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. GG, Docket Entry No. 87-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant contends that officers had probable cause to believe the seized items were stolen, except for one pledged item for which it could not verify NYPD involvement. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 31-45; Def. Mem. 8 n.5.) The NYPD acknowledges that where an item is not in plain view, and they do not obtain consent to search, the premises must be secured and a warrant obtained before any search and seizure beyond that of an ordinary administrative inspection can be effectuated. (Joseph J. Esposito Dep. (\"Esposito Dep.\") 34:5-13, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. O, Docket Entry No. 87-16.) Similarly, holds of collateral are to be temporary in nature, designed to \"freeze the location\" so that a search warrant may be obtained. (Patrick Timlin Dep. (\"Timlin Dep.\") 65:2-7 (describing an order requiring a store owner to hold collateral \"indefinitely\" as \"inappropriate\"), annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. P, Docket Entry No. 87-19;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Esposito Dep. 34:14-21 (\"[I]f we feel that we want to apply for a search warrant to seize that property, part of the process would be to freeze the location so that the property could not be disposed of while we were applying for a warrant.\").) The NYPD concedes that it has never secured a warrant to seize any item from Gem between 2010 and June 21, 2016, and has never obtained a warrant to search Gem's premises. (June 21, 2016 Letter re: Supplemental Demands (\"Supplemental Demands\") 2, 4, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. W, Docket Entry No. 87-26.) The NYPD also does not maintain records of hold requests for collateral in the possession of pawnbrokers. (Def. Resp. to Pl. First Set of Interrogs. (\"Def. Resp. to Interrogs.\") 5, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. V, Docket Entry No. 87-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant contends that Dambrot, as Gem's authorized employee, consented to every hold and seizure. (Def. Mem. 3.) Dambrot testified that he never voluntarily consented to any seizure or hold request, only relenting after being given \"the typical warning [that he could] be arrested for possession of stolen property, or interference with governmental administration.\" (Dambrot Aff. \u00b6 7.) Dambrot explained that he consistently requested a warrant when the NYPD sought to seize collateral, and generally requested a warrant or further information when the NYPD sought to place holds on property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite\n   his initial protests, Dambrot testified that his resolve was eventually overcome by threats of arrest, harassment of customers, and disruption of business more generally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Harold Dambrot Dep. (\"Dambrot Dep.\") 92:1-3, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. D, Docket Entry No. 86-4.) Gem also explains it was under no legal obligation to keep records of NYPD's hold and seizure requests, and visits by officers.

The statutory framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Collateral loan brokers and second-hand dealers in New York City operate under a regulatory framework that includes several provisions of the New York State General Business Law, the New York City Charter, the New York City Administrative Code, and the Rules of the City of New York (\"RCNY\"). At the state level, Chapter 20, Article 5 of the General Business Law regulates collateral loan brokers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ch. 20, Art. 5. Section 43 of the General Business Law requires collateral loan brokers to keep a book with specific information concerning loans and collateral. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ch. 20, Art. 5 \u00a7 43. Section 45 of the same law discusses inspection of such records and states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The said book and any and all other books and records regularly kept by such collateral loan broker shall at all reasonable times be open to the inspection of the attorney general, the state comptroller, the mayor or local licensing authority, all judges of the criminal courts, the superintendent of police, police inspectors, captains of police and police justices of such cities, or any or either of them, or of any person who shall be duly authorized in writing for that purpose by any or either of them, and who shall exhibit such written authority to such collateral loan broker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ch. 20, Art. 5 \u00a7 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   New York City law also affords the NYPD Police Commissioner (the \"Commissioner\") the authority to conduct administrative searches of certain trades, including pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers. Section 436 of the New York City Charter discusses the Commissioner's search power and states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The commissioner shall possess powers of general supervision and inspection over all licensed or unlicensed pawnbrokers ... dealers in second-hand merchandise ... and in connection with the performance of any police duties he shall have power to examine such persons, their clerks and employees and their books, business premises, and any articles of merchandise in their possession. A refusal or neglect to comply in any respect with the provisions of this section on the part of any pawnbroker ... dealer in second-hand merchandise ... or any clerk or employee of any thereof shall be triable by a judge of the criminal court and punishable by not more than thirty days' imprisonment, or by a fine of not more than fifty dollars, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Charter%20%C2%A7%20436\">\n    N.Y.

Section 20-277 discusses the reporting requirements of pawnbrokers which has changed since the commencement of this litigation. At the commencement of this litigation, Section 20-277 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The police commissioner, at such times as he or she may prescribe in a written notice served upon any pawnbroker by a member of the police department, may require such pawnbroker to report to such commissioner, upon blank forms to be furnished by the police department, a description of all goods, articles or things, or any part thereof, pawned or pledged in the course of business of such pawnbroker during the days specified in such notice, stating the numbers of the pawn tickets issued therefor, the amounts loaned thereon, and such identifying marks as may be on the goods pawned. If such notice from the police commissioner so prescribes, such pawnbroker, until he or she is notified to discontinue so doing, shall keep and furnish on such forms, a general description as to sex, color and apparent age of every person depositing such pledges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020-277\">\n    N.Y.

NYPD guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 1998, George A. Grasso, then-Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters of the NYPD, promulgated a memorandum entitled \"Guidelines for the Inspection of Pawnbroker and Second-hand Dealers Businesses,\" (\"Grasso Memo,\" annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. C, Docket Entry No. 87-6). The Grasso Memo, addressed to \"Chief of Detectives,\" discusses the various laws governing pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers and establishes guidelines \"in order to insure that the administrative searches ... conducted by this Department survive constitutional challenge ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Grasso Memo advises officers,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   to visit stores during regular business hours and request to inspect required books and records.

Dambrot testified that he was threatened with arrest if he did not automatically comply with police officers' seizure or hold requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, Dambrot testified that officers threatened to arrest him for \"possession of stolen property and interference with government administration\" when he requested a warrant or further information. Defendant does not necessarily dispute such threats were made. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. 11 n.8 (noting that there were at most three separate threats described in the record).) Instead, Defendant argues that threats of arrest are not coercive as a matter of law\n   where there is probable cause to arrest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. 5.) In support of this argument, Defendant proffers evidence that most, if not all, of the items were subject to lawful investigations with probable cause to seize the pledges as stolen property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The evidence that there was probable cause to seize the items does not mitigate the threat of arrests and the involuntariness of the consent. Indeed, Defendant provides no evidence that the officers had\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   probable cause to arrest Dambrot and the other employees for\n   <em>\n    knowing\n   </em>\n   possession of stolen property and interference with government administration-the crimes for which they were threatened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20165.40\">\n    N.Y.

(Dambrot Dep. 126:13-20.) While officers are certainly allowed to inform the public of lawful consequences of a refusal to consent, including the obtainment and execution of a search warrant, the manner in which the message is conveyed is relevant to a determination of voluntariness.

Although private homes are afforded greater protections than commercial premises, the Court does not find a meaningful distinction in the effect such threats would have on an owner or employee of a business in comparison to a homeowner. Dambrot was effectively left with two impossible choices-exercise Plaintiff's rights and allow that to be the\n   <em>\n    very basis\n   </em>\n   for his arrest and destruction of his employer's business, or acquiesce to any and all, even unlawful, demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could find a lack of consent for many of the seizures and holds at issue.

Dambrot also explained, by sworn affidavit, that he always protested, even for holds, until he was given \"the typical warning [that he could] be arrested for possession of stolen property, or interference with governmental administration.\" (Dambrot Aff. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Popilevsky Dep. 20:20-25 (\"\n   <em>\n    Every time\n   </em>\n   I call [Dambrot] and put him on the phone, it's a fight ... then [the officer and Dambrot] start arguing and I walk away.\" (emphasis added) ); Taranto Dep. 21:23-24 (\"[W]hen it came to a seizure, ... Dambrot would require a warrant.\").) Indeed, Defendant admits that no warrant was ever served on Plaintiff by the NYPD between 2010 and\n   June 21, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Demands 2, 4.) While the lack of such evidence may evince a remarkable history of cooperation with the NYPD, in light of the testimony of Dambrot and Plaintiff's other employees, a reasonable jury could also find that a threat of arrest or disruption of business likely preceded\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   seizure request by an officer. This finding is especially noteworthy in light of the very purpose of holds-\"to freeze\" the scene temporarily so that officers may obtain a warrant to lawfully seize the collateral. (Timlin Dep. 65:2-7; Esposito Dep. 34:14-21.) The consistency of the testimony across the various stores, located throughout the city, also supports the existence of a widespread policy. Furthermore, Dambrot explained that he did not document every police interaction for a variety of reasons, including a lack of time. (Dambrot Aff. \u00b6 4.) Dambrot and Plaintiff's other employees have testified that there were many more incidents of threats by the NYPD to seize pledge items beyond that expressly identified in this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dambrot Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; Lopez Dep. 32:13-19; Ragoo Dep. 26:24-27:5; Popilevsky Dep. 30:19-25.) Moreover, as Dambrot explained, Plaintiff was not under any obligation to document every hold, seizure, or police encounter. That Dambrot chose to document some of the incidents does not preclude the inference that there were many others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, managers of other pawnshop chains have sworn that they experienced similar treatment by the NYPD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kaminsky Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6 (describing \"demands\" and \"orders\" to place holds on collateral and warrantless seizure of entire premises); Buoninfante Aff. \u00b6 2 (describing \"threats and orders to hold jewelry\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Based on the evidence, the Court denies summary judgment as to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim based on as-administered violations of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.
