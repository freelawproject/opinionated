INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case concerns the unfortunate and rather haphazard business dealings of several individuals seeking to jointly establish and operate a restaurant in the District of Columbia. Plaintiff Neway Alemayehu originally brought this action alleging that Belay Abere, Bekalu Bayabile, and Iyossias\n   Tilahun worked together to defraud him out of a $460,000 investment.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. Mr. Abere denied the allegations, claiming that the contemplated business arrangement never came to fruition and that, in fact, it was Mr. Alemayehu who had acted wrongfully by breaching certain duties he owed to Mr. Abere as his agent and employee. This case now comes before the Court on Mr. Abere's partial motion to dismiss and Mr. Alemayehu's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mot.\") at 1, ECF No. 25, Pl.'s Mot. Dismiss Alt. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mot.\") at 1, ECF No. 26. For the reasons stated below, the Court denies both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the spring of 2015, Mr. Alemayehu and Mr. Abere met to discuss a possible investment in a restaurant called the Amsterdam Caf\u00e9 and Lounge, located in Washington, D.C. Compl. \u00b6 7; Countercl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 4. Through their discussions, the parties ultimately came to an agreement. Although some of the details of the agreement are in dispute, the basic premise was that, in exchange for an initial investment, Mr. Alemayehu would receive an 80% ownership stake in a newly formed corporate entity, which would then be responsible for operating the restaurant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 7; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 16. For their part, Mr. Abere and Mr. Bayabile would each own five percent and fifteen percent of the business, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 7; Countercl. \u00b6 10. The agreement also contemplated that Mr. Abere would assign a commercial lease to the newly formed entity and that an existing liquor license would also be transferred to the business. Compl. \u00b6 7; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. The parties dispute, however, whether these transfers were Mr. Abere's affirmative obligations or whether, instead, they were express conditions on the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevertheless, Mr. Alemayehu claims that these promises and the prospect of owning 80% of the restaurant venture induced him to invest substantial sums of money into the business. Indeed, in addition to making an initial investment of approximately $80,000,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 32, Mr. Alemayehu claims that he also contributed funds to pay: back rents owed to the landlord, along with taxes and insurance, legal fees associated with the attempt to transfer the lease and liquor license, substantial construction and renovation work on the restaurant, the purchase and installation of new kitchen equipment, security and fire alarm systems, restaurant furnishings, a liquor and wine inventory, and a computerized cash register system. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 17. In total, Mr. Alemayehu claims that he invested more than $460,000 in the restaurant. Compl. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unfortunately, the business arrangement did not unfold as the parties had intended. Indeed, despite their efforts to persuade the landlord of the building in which the restaurant was located, she ultimately refused to permit any assignment of the commercial lease from the current leaseholder, Mr. Abere individually, to the newly formed business entity. Compl. \u00b6 10; Countercl. \u00b6 20. Rather, she required that Mr. Abere-and only Mr. Abere-be responsible for the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 10; Countercl. \u00b6 20. Mr. Alemayehu alleges that, at some point, Mr. Abere represented to him that the only way the landlord would permit the assignment was if she were presented with an operating agreement showing that Mr. Abere was the only owner of the corporate entity. Compl. \u00b6 11. Thus, Mr. Alemayehu allegedly agreed to be removed from the corporate documents, albeit temporarily, until the assignment could be accomplished. Compl. \u00b6 11. But apparently the landlord was unwilling to\n   assign the lease even to an entity solely owned by Mr. Abere. Compl. \u00b6 12; Countercl. \u00b6 20. Given the circumstances, Mr. Alemayehu and Mr. Abere believed that the only realistic way forward was to keep the lease, liquor license, and business license in the name of Mr. Abere in his personal capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12; Countercl. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   However, the parties dispute what exactly their future intentions were. Mr. Alemayehu claims that this Abere-centered operation was a temporary arrangement and that they had agreed that the corporate entity would manage the business until they could find a way to convince the landlord to substitute the corporate entity for Mr. Abere on the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12. Moreover, Mr. Alemayehu argues that, as an 80% owner, he was to act as the restaurant's executive manager, have daily access to financial records, participate in major business decisions, and would receive a power of attorney from Mr. Abere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12. Mr. Abere, on the other hand, claims that they modified their earlier agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 22. Specifically, he claims that they agreed that Mr. Abere would form, own, and operate the restaurant, but that he would employ Mr. Alemayehu as the restaurant's manager and compensate him with 80% of the business's profits in consideration for his initial investment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Regardless, in October 2015, the restaurant opened for business and Mr. Alemayehu assumed the role of executive manager while Mr. Abere was traveling outside of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26. But no management agreement or power of attorney was ever executed, either before Mr. Abere left or after he returned. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. And, in fact, it appears that Mr. Alemayehu's time as executive manager was rather short lived. Mr. Alemayehu alleges that when Mr. Abere returned a month or two later, Mr. Abere suggested that he take over the management and operation of the business given his \"superior liability protection and experience,\" but that this change would only last for \"a few months.\" Compl. \u00b6 14. Alemayehu relented, believing this course of action \"to be beneficial ... as long as [the] management was performed in an inclusive, collaborative way.\" Compl. \u00b6 14. But subsequently, according to Mr. Alemayehu, Mr. Abere took several actions meant to undermine his authority as executive manager and never restored Mr. Alemayehu to that position. Compl. \u00b6 18 (Mr. Abere \"has continued, up through the filing of this lawsuit, to strengthen his control of the business, its operation and planning, all designed to totally remove [Mr. Alemayehu] from any involvement or managerial oversight responsibilities for the restaurant enterprise.\"). Furthermore, Mr. Alemayehu claims that, even though he is entitled to 80% of the profits, he has received no profit distributions, Compl. \u00b6 41, and Mr. Abere \"has tried to make it appear that he is the legitimate sole owner of the business.\" Compl. \u00b6 19. All of this seems to have culminated when, on March 4, 2016, Mr. Alemayehu disassociated himself from the venture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Mr. Alemayehu to Mr. Abere, ECF No. 28-6. That same month, he brought this suit seeking what he believes is due to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Abere, however, has a somewhat different take. According to Mr. Abere, upon his return, he discovered that Mr. Alemayehu had abused his position of trust and failed to faithfully and fully perform his duties as manager. Countercl. \u00b6 27. Specifically, he claims that Mr. Alemayehu failed or refused to pay certain taxes, salaries of employees, and invoices submitted by vendors and third parties. Countercl. \u00b6 27. In addition, Mr. Abere learned that, while the business had generated approximately\n   $110,422.81 in gross receipts, that money went unaccounted for. Countercl. \u00b6 28. Mr. Alemayehu allegedly admitted that he took approximately $13,000 from the business to pay a personal debt, but could not account for the remaining balance. Countercl. \u00b6 28. Furthermore, Mr. Abere learned that, before the opening of the restaurant, Mr. Alemayehu had signed a purported Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release (the \"Settlement Agreement\") on Mr. Abere's behalf, but without his knowledge or consent. Countercl. \u00b6 30. The Settlement Agreement purports to release potential claims that Mr. Abere had against Mr. Abere's former sub-tenant, Wilson Concepts, LLC (\"Wilson Concepts\"), and its proprietor, Garnell Wilson, for, among other things, previous unpaid rent. Countercl. \u00b6 30. According to Mr. Abere, it was for all of these reasons that he ultimately decided to remove Mr. Alemayehu as the manager of the restaurant. Countercl. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March 2016, Mr. Alemayehu filed a complaint initiating this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. Mr. Alemayehu asserts six claims against Mr. Abere, including claims for unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, and quantum meruit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-32, 37-41. Mr. Abere, in turn, filed a counterclaim against Mr. Alemayehu.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Countercl. He asserts, among other things, claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, quasi-contract/breach of agency contract, and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-52. Both Mr. Abere and Mr. Alemayehu have since filed answers to the claims against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 8, 2017, Mr. Abere filed a partial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. That same day, Mr. Alemayehu also filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Both motions have been fully briefed and are now ripe for decision. The Court therefore addresses each motion in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. MR. ABERE'S MOTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before turning to the merits of Mr. Abere's motion, the Court must first clear up a technical procedural issue. Mr. Abere styles his motion as a motion dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Under the Federal Rules, such motions are only available to parties\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   they have filed a responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (\"A motion ... must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\"). Because Mr. Abere has already filed an answer in this case, he is not entitled to relief under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   However, under the circumstances, the proper course of action is to construe the motion to dismiss as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) because the standard under both rules is essentially same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bloom v. McHugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986165\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/828/43/#p49\">\n    828 F.Supp.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (D.D.C. 2011) (\"Because, however, the standards for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings are identical, courts routinely construe motions to dismiss that are filed after a responsive pleading as motions for judgment on the pleadings, and this Court will do likewise.\");\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v.

Only the first two claims, however, are worthy of any significant discussion. As the Court noted in a prior opinion, constructive trust is not an independent cause of action, but a remedy. Thus, the Court \"construe[s] the request for a constructive trust as a request for injunctive relief,\" but \"takes no position on whether this remedy would be appropriate in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Alemayehu\n   </em>\n   , 199 F.Supp.3d at 87. As for Mr. Alemayehu's claims for promissory estoppel and quantum meruit, the Court finds that Mr. Alemayehu has alleged facts sufficient to state a plausible entitlement to relief.

Promissory Estoppel (Count III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court first addresses Mr. Abere's argument that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for promissory estoppel. \"To factually allege promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must establish (1) the existence of a promise, (2) that the promise reasonably induced reliance on it, and (3) that the promisee relied on the promise to his detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    Osseiran v.

Based on this Court's prior opinion dismissing the promissory estoppel claim against Mr. Tilahun, Mr. Abere now argues that the same claim against him must fail because Mr. Alemayehu has not \"allege[d] or identif[ied] an adequately definite promise\" that Mr. Abere made.

Later, when the lease transfer negotiations with the landlord deteriorated and Mr. Abere asked that Mr. Alemayehu be removed from membership documents, Mr. Abere assured Mr. Alemayehu that this was only a temporary measure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 11 (\"Abere thus requested that [Mr. Alemayehu] be temporarily removed from the membership documents\" to regain the landlord's trust); Compl. \u00b6 14 (\"[Mr. Abere] told [Mr. Alemayehu] that [taking over the management and operation of the business] would only be 'for a few months.' \") (emphasis added). Thus, at bottom, the Complaint alleges that Mr. Abere promised and then repeatedly reassured Mr. Alemayehu that he would be made an 80% owner of the business, with all the attendant rights and privileges associated with that, in exchange for his investment. Mr. Abere cites no reason why such a promise should be held deficient for purposes of a promissory estoppel claim other than to argue, in conclusory fashion, that the allegations lack the requisite detail. The Court concludes otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Osseiran v. Int'l Fin.

According to the Complaint, Mr. Abere's promises not only induced Mr. Alemayehu to make an initial investment in the enterprise, they also convinced him to continue investing in the business on the belief that\n   he would ultimately be entitled to 80% of the restaurant's net profits once it became profitable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1-2, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. Among other things, Mr. Alemayehu paid for rent, \"legal fees to get the lease and liquor license transferred to the LLC,\" renovations, new HVAC and water heater systems, new kitchen equipment, security and fire alarm systems, and restaurant furniture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9. In total, Mr. Alemayehu allegedly invested approximately $460,000 in the Amsterdam Caf\u00e9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 32. But Mr. Abere never transferred the business over to the corporate entity and Mr. Alemayehu never received any profit distributions. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 41. Mr. Alemayehu asserts that \"he never would have made the initial investment of $85,000 and he certainly wouldn't have continued to fund the restaurant enterprise in an amount exceeding $460,000\" if he had known that Mr. Abere never intended to make him an 80% owner and manager of the business. Compl. \u00b6 32. Accordingly, Mr. Alemayehu's Complaint, taken as a whole, alleges sufficient facts to establish a claim of promissory estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Quantum Meruit (Count V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court next considers Mr. Alemayehu's quantum meruit claim. Under D.C. law, to state a claim for quantum meruit, a plaintiff must allege: (1) \"valuable services rendered by the plaintiff;\" (2) \"for the person from whom recovery is sought;\" (3) \"which services were accepted and enjoyed by that person;\" and (4) \"under circumstances which reasonably notified the person that the plaintiff, in performing such services, expected to be paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Providence Hosp. v.

App. 1984). Defendant argues that none of these elements has been sufficiently plead. Def.'s Mot. at 5. Again, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, Mr. Alemayehu plainly alleges that he rendered valuable services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Mr. Alemayehu's Complaint lists several services that he allegedly rendered in connection with the business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39. What is less clear, however, is to whom he provided these services or who necessarily enjoyed them. At least some of Mr. Alemayehu's services appear to have been enjoyed, not by Mr. Abere, but by the putative corporate entity that was to operate the restaurant, of which he was to hold a significant stake. Indeed, Mr. Alemayehu alleges that he spent time \"working through the legal complications of trying to transfer the liquor license\" and \"trying to persuade the landlord to allow transfer of the [lease]\" to the entity. Compl. \u00b6 39. But if that is true, then the benefit of those services undoubtedly accrued to the benefit of\n   <em>\n    the corporate entity\n   </em>\n   -for which Mr. Abere was to be a part owner-rather than to Mr. Abere. Accordingly, those services cannot rationally support Mr. Alemayehu's quantum meruit claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, Mr. Abere might very well have been the beneficiary of Mr. Alemayehu's\n   other services. All of Mr. Alemayehu's other alleged services appear to be related to establishing the restaurant as a viable business. For example, he alleges that he \"manage[ed] the [restaurant's] renovation projects, market[ed] and promot[ed] the business after it started operating, and manag[ed] the business for the first several months of its operation.\" Compl. \u00b6 39. Thus, the question of who enjoyed the benefits of Mr. Alemayehu's labor necessarily turns on the question of who owned the enterprise. Of course, if Mr. Abere ran the restaurant as a sole proprietor, as he claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Countercl. at 1, then any and all services performed for the restaurant necessarily accrued to his personal benefit. Indeed, D.C. law \"makes no legal distinction between the identity of a sole proprietorship and its owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Kopff v. Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201748918\">\n    2007 WL 1748918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 n.3 (D.D.C.

Names \u00a7 13 (noting sole proprietorship and proprietor \"are but two names for one person\"). Likewise, if Mr. Abere is running the business as a general partnership with people other than Mr. Alemayehu, then again he can be held liable for any benefits conferred on the business because in D.C., partners are \"liable jointly and severally for all debts, obligations, or other liabilities of the partnership.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-603.06\">\n    D.C.

Indeed, as described above, if the corporate entity were deemed to be running the business, then the benefits accrued to it, not Mr. Abere and, thus, Mr. Alemayehu would have no viable quantum meruit claim against him. Similarly, if Mr. Alemayehu were deemed to be a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   partner of the business, then his services accrued, at least in part, to his own benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-604.01\">\n    D.C.

Indeed, the Complaint states that he is \"entitled to 80% of the profit distributions dating back to the first week of the restaurant's operation or,\n   <em>\n    in the alternative\n   </em>\n   , the retirement of his outstanding investment and\n   <em>\n    payment for his services rendered\n   </em>\n   .\" Compl. \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNamara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3927438\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/950/125/#p128\">\n    950 F.Supp.2d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   If Mr. Abere does in fact own the business and Mr. Alemayehu does not, then Mr. Alemayehu may very well have a claim for quantum meruit. Under the circumstances alleged in the pleadings, it would seem reasonable to expect Mr. Abere to have known that Mr. Alemayehu anticipated compensation in one form or another for his work. Indeed, Mr. Abere himself claims that Mr. Alemayehu was \"employ[ed] as the manager of Amsterdam Caf\u00e9.\" Countercl. \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 20 (alleging that Mr. Tilahun informed employees that Mr. Alemayehu \"works for Defendants Abere and Bayabile\"). And there is no reason to believe that Mr. Alemayehu was conferring a benefit on the business gratuitously or officiously. Therefore, if Mr. Alemayehu did not have an interest in the restaurant enterprise, he has at least alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that he has a plausible right to relief on his claim for quantum meruit.

However, unlike Mr. Abere, Mr. Alemayehu has alternatively moved for summary judgment and has attached materials outside of the pleadings. Because both parties rely on these materials, and both parties have had the opportunity to respond and have already taken discovery, the Court will treat Mr. Alemayehu's motion as a motion for summary judgment rather than a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Langley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870747\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/677/261/#p262\">\n    677 F.Supp.2d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the Court finds that the Secretary's motion should in fact be construed as a motion for summary judgment rather than a motion for judgment on the pleadings (or a motion to dismiss)\" because, \"[i]n filing her motion, the Secretary attached various exhibits to her filing that both parties have relied upon in their briefing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In addition, Mr. Abere suggests that Mr. Alemayehu breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing implicit in the agreement when he failed to pay taxes, invoices, and employee salaries and failed to account for approximately $110,422.81 in gross receipts while he was serving as manager of the restaurant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 41-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In his motion, Mr. Alemayehu argues that he did not breach the contract by failing to pay the requisite consideration because the parties had, in fact, agreed to lower the price of the initial investment amount to $80,000, which Mr. Alemayehu paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 12. But, this is not supported by the record currently before the Court. There is no dispute that Mr. Alemayehu paid a total of $80,000-$50,000 directly to Mr. Abere and approximately $30,000 to Mr. Abere's landlord.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abere Dep. at 61:22-62:4, ECF No. 28-10 (\"From our agreement, I was supposed to receive [$]100,000, and from the [$]100,000 I receive[d] [$]50[,000] for me and [$]30[,000]-about [$]30[,000]-something to the landlord.\"). But there is no evidence in the record demonstrating any agreement between the parties to lower the contract price from $100,000 to\n   $80,000. Although Mr. Alemayehu cites a deposition transcript that he urges supports his argument, he fails to provide the Court with that transcript. Pl.'s Mot. at 12. Mr. Alemayehu also points to a share purchase agreement between the parties, which states that \"Mr. Neway [Alemayehu] and Mr. Bekalu [Bayabile] will make a share purchase payment of $100,000 to Mr. Belay [Abere].\" Pl.'s Reply at 6-7, ECF No. 29. Mr. Alemayehu argues that this language demonstrates that the payment of $100,000 was to be borne by Mr. Alemayehu and Mr. Bayabile together-not Mr. Alemayehu alone. Pl.'s Reply at 7. While that may be true, it does not demonstrate how much each person was to pay. Thus, on its face, this document does not demonstrate that Mr. Alemayehu was obligated to pay only $80,000. Mr. Alemayehu also points to a purported operating agreement, which states that Mr. Alemayehu's contribution would be $80,000 and Mr. Bayabile's investment would be $20,000. Pl.'s Reply at 7. But this agreement is not signed by Mr. Abere, and he cannot be deemed to be bound by its terms without some evidence of his assent. Therefore, Mr. Alemayehu has not demonstrated that he was only required to pay $80,000 under the contract with Mr. Abere and thus he fails to meet even his initial burden of showing an absence of a genuine material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Alemayehu next argues that he is entitled to summary judgment because, regardless of whether he breached any contractual duties owed to Mr. Abere, Mr. Abere cannot make a showing of damages. The basis of Mr. Alemayehu's argument is not that the alleged breaches did not injure the\n   <em>\n    business\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, he argues that whatever injuries the business sustained were not injuries shared by Mr. Abere. This is so because, as Mr. Alemayehu contends, \"there is no dispute that Mr. Abere did not pay the rent or contribute any of his personal funds to the business,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 11, and, because the business had not yet become profitable, Mr. Abere cannot claim to have any interest in undistributed profits. This argument is flawed in multiple respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First and foremost, it is important to recognize that, even if Mr. Alemayehu was right-that Mr. Abere did not share the injuries suffered by the business-this would not preclude Mr. Abere's breach of contract claim. \"[T]he settled rule in the District is that '[e]ven where monetary damages cannot be proved, a plaintiff who can establish a breach of contract is entitled to an award of nominal damages.' \"\n   <em>\n    Alston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20Fed.%20Appx.%202\">\n    609 Fed.Appx. at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

For that reason alone, Mr. Alemayehu's argument for dismissal must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But Mr. Alemayehu's argument is also wrong for another reason. Answering the question of whether Mr. Abere made capital contributions to the business does not resolve the issue of whether Mr. Abere was personally injured by Mr. Alemayehu's actions. Indeed, whether Mr. Abere was injured turns instead on the ownership structure of the business. If Mr. Abere is the sole proprietor, as he contends, any injury to the business is also an injury felt by him because the identity of a sole proprietorship is \"the same as that of its owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Pritchett v. Stillwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7937768\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/604/886/#p889\">\n    604 A.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 1992) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    York Grp., Inc. v.

While the contribution or non-contribution of personal funds to the business might have some probative value on the issue of ownership, there is certainly no rule that requires sole proprietors to supply funds to their own ventures. Thus, Mr. Abere's failure to contribute personal funds to the business is not a \"material\" fact for purposes of summary judgment because resolving that question alone does not necessarily affect the substantive outcome of his claim. Furthermore, there is at least a genuine dispute as to the operative question of whether Mr. Abere was the sole owner of the restaurant. Indeed, Mr. Abere testified that he owned the business and had never represented to anyone that the restaurant was jointly owned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abere Dep. at 69:3-9, ECF No. 29-9. Thus, Mr. Abere's failure to contribute his own funds to the venture does not entitle Mr. Alemayehu to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Unjust Enrichment (Count IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court next considers Mr. Abere's unjust enrichment claim. Unjust enrichment is \"an obligation which the law creates, in the absence of any agreement, when and because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money, or its equivalent, under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it ...

Here, Mr. Abere claims that Mr. Alemayehu was unjustly enriched when he diverted or retained over $110,422.81 from the restaurant's gross receipts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 50-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Alemayehu again argues that he is entitled to judgment because Mr. Abere did not contribute funds to the business venture and because the business was not yet profitable such that Mr. Abere might have claim to a undistributed profits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 12-13; Pl.'s Reply at 8-9. In essence, Mr. Alemayehu argues that Mr. Abere cannot claim to have conferred a benefit on Mr. Alemayehu when the alleged monies actually came from the business. But, once again, one of the central disputes in this case is over who owns the business. If Mr. Abere owns the business as a sole proprietorship, as he claims, then any money taken from the coffers of the restaurant is money taken out of Mr. Abere's pockets. Because the ownership issue is disputed, Mr. Alemayehu cannot obtain summary judgment merely by arguing that he took money from the business, not Mr. Abere himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count I) and Breach of Agency Contract (Count III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses Mr. Abere's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of agency contract claims. Mr. Abere claims Mr. Alemayehu owed him fiduciary duties as an employee of the restaurant or duties based on some agency contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Alemayehu allegedly breached those duties when he forged Mr.\n   Abere's signature on the Settlement Agreement with Mr. Abere's sub-tenant, Wilson Concepts and its proprietor, Garnell Wilson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Alemayehu argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on these claims because Mr. Abere cannot make a showing that he suffered any harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Alemayehu argues that his alleged unauthorized signing of the Settlement Agreement\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   could not have harmed Mr. Abere because the Settlement Agreement expressly conditioned its enforcement on events that never came to pass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Thus, according to the argument, the Settlement Agreement did not actually release any claims that Mr. Abere might have had against Wilson Concepts and/or Mr. Wilson and, therefore, Mr. Abere cannot claim to have been harmed by the alleged unauthorized signing of that document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Unfortunately, this argument raises a complication. Specifically, this argument calls into question not only the rights of Mr. Abere, but also Wilson Concepts\n   and Mr. Wilson, who are not currently parties to this lawsuit.

For that reason, the Court declines to address Mr. Alemayehu's argument at this time.

In his Counterclaim, Mr. Abere labels the claim as one for \"Quasi-Contract/Breach of Agency Contract.\" This is rather confusing. As the D.C. Court of Appeals has explained, \" 'Breach of quasi-contract' is really a euphemism for a claim of unjust enrichment; a quasi-contract is not an agreement one can 'break.' \"\n    <em>\n     News World Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Mr. Abere's use of the term \"agency contract\" might also connote breach of fiduciary duties. But, of course, Mr. Abere already asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duties based on this very same conduct. Thus, in construing the Counterclaim broadly and so as not to be duplicative of the breach of fiduciary duty claim, the Court assumes that Mr. Abere means to assert a claim for breach of contract, either express or implied-in-fact. Whether the contract is express or implied-in-fact makes no difference because an implied-in-fact contract is a \"true contract, containing all necessary elements of a binding agreement; it differs from other contracts only in that it has not been committed to writing or stated orally in express terms, but rather is inferred from the conduct of the parties in the milieu in which they dealt.\"\n    <em>\n     Vereen v.

Mr. Alemayehu again rehashes the argument that Mr. Abere did not contribute any funds to the business and, therefore, he cannot have suffered any damages. Again, this argument fails for the same reasons described\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . But the fact that Mr. Abere alleges that Mr. Alemayehu was his employee, rather than a business partner, yet was responsible for paying all of the business's expenses and was only paid as a percentage of profits, raises a host of questions. But, ultimately, a jury will determine what is reasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Although it is true that a claim for breach of fiduciary duties requires a showing of injury,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dorsey v.
