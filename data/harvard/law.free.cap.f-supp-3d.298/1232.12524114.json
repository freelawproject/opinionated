Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff, who was born in 1962, has no past relevant work. (A.R. 35, 84). In October 2014, Plaintiff filed an application for supplemental security income. (A.R. 188-95). Plaintiff's application alleged that on March 31, 2001, she became unable to work due to major depression and anxiety disorder. (A.R. 84). Plaintiff subsequently amended the alleged disability onset date to October 14, 2014. (A.R. 49). Social Security denied the application on March 12, 2015. (A.R. 117-20). In September 2015, upon Plaintiff's request for reconsideration, Social Security affirmed the denial of benefits. (A.R. 125-31). Plaintiff sought further review by an ALJ, who conducted a hearing in July 2016. (A.R. 45-83, 133-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In a September 19, 2016 decision, the ALJ found that Plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. (A.R. 24-37). The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Social Security Commissioner. (A.R. 1-6, 14-20). On January 20, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint (Doc. 1) requesting judicial review and reversal of the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Step Two: Presence of Medically Severe Impairment/Combination of Impairments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ALJ found that Plaintiff has the following severe impairments: (i) osteoarthritis ; (ii) anxiety disorder; (iii) \"affective disorder (a.k.a depression)\"; and (iv) personality disorder. (A.R. 26). This determination is undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Step Three: Presence of Listed Impairment(s)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The ALJ determined that Plaintiff does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R.

(A.R. 526-27). Dr. Papke opined that Plaintiff has \"moderately severe\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   limitations with respect to Plaintiff's ability to relate to other people, complete daily activities, and understand, carry out, and remember instructions. (Bates No. 526). Dr. Papke also opined that Plaintiff has (i) \"severe\" deterioration in personal habits and constriction of interests; (ii) \"moderate\" limitations in responding appropriately to supervision and co-workers and in performing simple tasks; (iii) \"severe\" limitations in responding to customary work pressures; and (iv) \"moderately severe\" limitations resulting from the side effects of Plaintiff's medications. (A.R. 526-27). In addition, Dr. Papke stated that Plaintiff's psychiatric symptoms would severely affect the sustainability of work pace. (A.R. 527). Dr. Papke's opinions may not be discounted without specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The ALJ gave Dr. Papke's Medical Assessment \"partial weight.\" (A.R. 32). The ALJ first explained that Dr. Papke's opinion\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   is internally inconsistent, in that her treating notes do not indicate the level of severity she opined. For example, Dr. Papke identified side effects to medication that included sedation, hypertension, sweating and dry mouth. However, Dr. Papke's medical records do not support his assertion. Specifically, there is little to no evidence of any side effects. (4F; 10F; 14F).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although Dr. Papke's treatment notes indicate that Dr. Papke explained the side effects of Plaintiff's medications, Dr. Papke's notes expressly state that Plaintiff did not report any side effects. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R. 377-78, 519-20, 522-23, 560-61). The Court finds that substantial evidence supports the ALJ's rejection of Dr. Papke's opinion that Plaintiff's medications cause side effects that impose \"moderately severe\" limitations. However, as explained below, the Court finds that the ALJ did not provide valid reasons for discounting Dr. Papke's remaining opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After discussing Dr. Papke's opinion regarding medication side effects, the ALJ stated the following: \"Additionally, in April 2015, claimant reported that she was feeling a lot better with her medication increase, and did not feel her medication needed to be changed. She stated she was sleeping better, her mood was 'pretty good', and her anxiety was not too bad.\" (A.R. 32). The Court finds that these statements mischaracterize the record. The April 2015 treatment note reflects that Dr. Papke conducted a mental status examination and found that Plaintiff's \"[m]ood is depressed, dysphoric, dysthmic[.]\" (A.R. 548). Dr. Papke stated that Plaintiff was \"displaying low energy\" and although Plaintiff's affect was \"brighter,\" it was \"blunted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, Dr. Papke noted improvement in Plaintiff's thought content, but found that it was \"still problematic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court does not find that the April 2015 treatment note contradicts the opinions expressed in Dr. Papke's\n   Medical Assessment. Moreover, when \"a person who suffers from severe panic attacks, anxiety, and depression\" improves, that \"does not mean that the person's impairments no longer seriously affect her ability to function in a workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Holohan v.

The Court does not find that this is a specific and legitimate reason supported by substantial evidence for discounting Dr. Papke's opinions. First, Dr. Papke's treatment records do not indicate that Dr. Papke was acting as Plaintiff's agent or was so sympathetic to Plaintiff as to impair her professional judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haulot v.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R. 377, 519, 522, 560). Dr. Papke indicated on the Medical Assessment that her opinions regarding Plaintiff's limitations result from documented objective, clinical, or diagnostic findings. (A.R. 527). There is no evidence in the record suggesting that Dr. Papke relied on Plaintiff's subjective complaints, rather than on Dr. Papke's own mental status examinations, in completing the Medical Assessment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryan v.

The ultimate disability determination is an issue reserved to the Commissioner.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Dr. Papke, however, did not opine as to whether Plaintiff met the statutory definition of disability. Dr. Papke expressed medical opinions in the Medical Assessment as to the severity of Plaintiff's limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boardman v.

The Court does not find that the ALJ's final reason for discounting Dr. Papke's opinion is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the ALJ properly discounted Dr. Papke's opinion regarding medication side effects, but improperly discounted Dr. Papke's remaining opinions. This error is harmful and alone requires remand. The Court therefore does not address Plaintiff's arguments regarding the other alleged errors in the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The Ninth Circuit, however, has adopted a test to determine when a case should be remanded for payment of benefits in cases where an ALJ has improperly rejected claimant testimony or medical opinion evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055813\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1090/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1100-01 ;\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1017\">\n    759 F.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This test is commonly referred to as the \"credit-as-true\" rule, which consists of the following three factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1.

Dr. Papke opined that Plaintiff would be off task greater than 21% of an 8-hour work day. (A.R. 527). At the administrative hearing, the VE testified that Plaintiff could be off task \"[o]nly about 10 percent\" of a workday in order to maintain employment. (A.R. 80). The Court finds that if Dr. Papke's opinions were credited-as-true, the ALJ would be required to find that Plaintiff is disabled.
