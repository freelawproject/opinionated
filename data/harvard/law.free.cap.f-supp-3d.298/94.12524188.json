Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Denise Banks brought this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Defendant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\" or \"Defendant\"), alleging, among other things, that she was discriminatorily removed from her Senior Executive Service position while employed at USDA based on her sex and race. Plaintiff's discrimination claims survived summary judgment and proceeded to trial. At trial, the jury agreed that Plaintiff's sex was a motivating factor in her demotion and returned a damages award of $100,000. The jury, however, found in favor of USDA on Plaintiff's race discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury's verdict lies at the heart of the parties' motions that are now before the court. In a motion filed under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, USDA argues that the verdict cannot be sustained and asks the court to enter judgment as a matter of law in its favor on Plaintiff's sex discrimination claim. Alternatively, Defendant seeks a new trial pursuant to Rule 59. Plaintiff, on the other hand, maintains that the verdict should be upheld and, by her own motion, seeks an equitable award consisting of reinstatement to the Senior Executive Service, back pay, and a clean employment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the court concludes that: (i) the jury had a reasonable basis to find that USDA discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of sex when it removed her from her Senior Executive Service position; (ii) USDA is not entitled to a new trial; and (iii) Plaintiff is entitled to reinstatement to the Senior Executive Service, a clean record, and back pay, albeit in an amount less than she seeks. Accordingly, the court denies Defendant's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial, and grants in part Plaintiff's Amended Motion for Reinstatement, Back Pay, and Clean Record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Gray, in turn, supervised three deputy directors,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 431, two of whom are central to this case: Plaintiff and Jeremy Wu. In February 1999, Plaintiff began working as Deputy Director for Employment and oversaw a staff of approximately 50 people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 209, 338, 431. Wu, an Asian-American male, was Deputy Director for Systems and Administration and oversaw a staff of approximately six people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, 212-13, 462-63; Def.'s Answer to First Am. Compl., ECF No. 16 [hereinafter Answer], \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff and Wu were members of the SES, the highest career-level position in the federal government. Trial Tr. at 43. Members of the SES are executives at various agencies, and the only more senior positions in the federal government are presidential appointees.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 200;\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 530. In 1999, Banks was in her first year as a member of the SES, which is a probationary period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208, 294, 527. At the same time, Wu was in his second year as a member of the SES and had completed his probationary term.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   All SES members at USDA are subject to performance evaluations by their supervisor.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 460-62, 539. The supervisor's evaluation is in turn reviewed by the Performance Review Board (\"PRB\" or \"Board\"), a collection of SES officials from other parts of USDA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 295, 461-62;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 461 (testimony from Gray explaining that \"PRB rating boards are evaluation peer-review boards that are set up throughout all of the departments of government to evaluate [SES] members\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 1999, Gray gave both Plaintiff and Wu \"unsatisfactory\" performance\n   appraisals and recommended that they be terminated from the SES. Def.'s Ex. 2; Def.'s Mot., Ex. 4, ECF No. 151-4 [hereinafter Def.'s Ex. 4]. The appraisals for both executives contained four performance \"elements,\" or review criteria: (1) development and support of programs and policy; (2) delivery of programs and/or functions; (3) management of resources; and (4) civil rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For each executive, three of the four elements were considered \"critical,\"\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ; Trial Tr. at 41, 459-60, although different elements were designated as critical for each executive, according to his or her respective job duties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 458-60, 465-66. \"Management of resources\" was critical for Wu because he managed the budget, contracting, and other resource issues in the Office of Civil Rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 464-65. \"Development and support of programs and policy\" was critical for Plaintiff, but not Wu, because Plaintiff developed programs and policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 458-59, 465-66. Gray gave Plaintiff a \"does not meet fully successful\" in two elements: (1) development and support of programs and policy and (2) delivery of programs and/or functions. Def.'s Ex. 2. Gray gave Wu a \"does not meet fully successful\" for one element: delivery of programs and/or functions. Def.'s Ex. 4. Under the rating scale, these assessments gave each executive a summary rating of \"unsatisfactory.\" Def.'s Ex. 2; Def.'s Ex. 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 466. Gray recommended that both be removed from the SES. Def.'s Ex. 2; Def.'s Ex. 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 532-33. In late 1999, Sally Thompson, Acting Assistant Secretary for Administration, reviewed and signed off on Plaintiff's and Wu's performance appraisals. Trial Tr. at 33, 180, 515; Def.'s Mot. at 4-5; Def.'s Ex. 2; Def.'s Ex. 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 536-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The appraisals then went to the PRB for review. Def.'s Mot. at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 45, 527-28. In December 1999, Plaintiff submitted an approximately 40-page rebuttal of Gray's appraisal to the PRB. Trial Tr. at 181. The PRB reviewed Plaintiff's rebuttal and had some additional questions for Gray, who, in turn, submitted a supplemental statement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 182.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Upon review of a supervisor's evaluation and recommendation, the PRB issues its own summary rating, either concurring with or changing the supervisor's rating.\n   <em>\n    Cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 42, 532-34. For Wu, the PRB changed the summary rating to \"minimally satisfactory\" and recommended that Wu be reassigned.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s Ex. 4. Wu's appraisal includes written comments from the PRB that \"[t]he designation of element # 2 as critical not clear to the executive. The [PRB] gave the executive the benefit of the doubt and changed the designation to noncritical, thus changing the summary rating for Mr. Wu to Minimally Satisfactory.\" Def.'s Ex. 4. But for Plaintiff, the PRB concurred with Gray's summary rating and recommended Plaintiff's removal from the SES.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 295-96; Def.'s Ex. 2. Plaintiff's appraisal does not contain any written comments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 2. On January 10, 2000, Charles Rawls, Chairman of the PRB, signed both Plaintiff's and Wu's appraisals on behalf of the PRB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 2; Def.'s Ex. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before final action could be taken on Wu, Wu departed for an SES position within the Department of Energy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 528, 530. The chair of the PRB told Gray that when Wu appeared before the PRB, Wu requested that his SES status be retained because he had accepted a position at the Department of Energy and planned to transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 530. He further told Gray that the PRB would not proceed with Wu's evaluation if Gray declined to submit supplemental materials to the PRB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gray did not submit any additional materials to the PRB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wu transferred to the Department of Energy around January 2000.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 528.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's appraisal, however, was forwarded to then-Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, for a final rating and approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 295-96. On January 19, 2000, Glickman issued a final rating of \"unsatisfactory\" for Plaintiff and signed the performance appraisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wu's appraisal does not contain Glickman's signature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Glickman signed Plaintiff's performance appraisal, it was forwarded to Paul Fiddick, who had joined USDA in or around November 1999 and had replaced Thompson as the Assistant Secretary for Administration. Trial Tr. at 301-03. Fiddick sat on the PRB that fall, including the PRB panel that reviewed Plaintiff's performance.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 545-46. Fiddick sent Plaintiff a letter on January 24, 2000, informing her of her demotion. Def.'s Ex. 3. The letter states as the reason for her demotion \"unsatisfactory\" performance during her probationary period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At trial, Fiddick testified that he did not remember the PRB proceedings evaluating Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 546. He also said that, when he sent the demotion letter to Plaintiff, he was just affirming the action of an independent body, the PRB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 541-42. Effective January 29, 2000, Plaintiff was assigned to a GS-15 position as Special Assistant to the Deputy Director for Programs in the Office of Civil Rights. Def.'s Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After her demotion, Plaintiff prepared a rebuttal to Gray's supplemental statement and gave it to Fiddick. Trial Tr. at 185-86, 547;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mots. for J. as a Matter of Law, ECF No. 152 [hereinafter Pl.'s Opp'n], Ex. 4, ECF No. 152-4. Fiddick testified that his calendar shows that he held three meetings in March, April, and June 2000, when he assumes he discussed her request for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 547-48;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 517 (Gray testimony that Fiddick said that he had met with Plaintiff and her attorney following the PRB's decision);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 559-60 (Plaintiff testimony that she met with Fiddick in late 1999 and early 2000). Fiddick ultimately denied Plaintiff's request.\n   <em>\n    Cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 546-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff filed an EEO complaint regarding her demotion in February 2000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer \u00b6 8. In February 2007, USDA issued a final agency decision upholding Plaintiff's demotion.\n   <em>\n    Cf. id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff appealed, and the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations affirmed USDA's decision. Am. Compl., ECF No. 15, \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Answer \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Complaint in this court in October 2007, which she amended in August 2008.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. In her five-count Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that USDA discriminated against her on the basis of race, sex, and age.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-57. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, and in March 2013, then-Chief Judge Roberts granted and denied those motions in part. Judge Roberts granted USDA's motion as to Plaintiff's hostile work environment claims as well as several of her retaliation claims, but allowed Plaintiff's race, age, and sex discrimination claims and other retaliation claims to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks v.

On the eve of trial, the court granted Plaintiff's motion to amend her complaint to include only claims that she was discriminated against on the basis of race and sex when she was removed from the SES in 2000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks v.

At three points during trial-at the close of Plaintiff's case-in-chief, after the close of its own case, and at the close of Plaintiff's rebuttal case-USDA moved for\n   judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 372-82, 551-54, 561-63. At each point, Judge Roberts reserved ruling on the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382, 553, 563.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the close of evidence, Judge Roberts instructed the jury on two theories of intentional discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 575-77, 601-15. He instructed that Plaintiff could show either that her sex was a\n   <em>\n    determinative\n   </em>\n   factor in her removal from the SES, or that her sex was a mere\n   <em>\n    motivating\n   </em>\n   factor in USDA's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Instructions, ECF No. 124 [hereinafter Instructions], at 11-13. The court further explained that under the latter, \"mixed-motive\" theory, the jury could only award Plaintiff damages if USDA failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision to demote Plaintiff even if her sex had played no role in the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The jury returned a verdict that was favorable for Plaintiff in part, finding that USDA removed Plaintiff from her SES position because of intentional discrimination based on her sex, but not on the basis of her race. Trial Tr. at 681;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form, ECF No. 123. Importantly, in finding in favor of Plaintiff on her claim of sex discrimination, the jury did not conclude that Plaintiff would have been demoted\n   <em>\n    but for\n   </em>\n   her sex, but instead found that sex was a\n   <em>\n    motivating factor\n   </em>\n   in Plaintiff's demotion and that USDA had not shown it would have otherwise demoted Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form. The jury awarded Plaintiff $100,000 in damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   USDA then moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) or, in the alternative, for a new trial under Rule 59.

That motion is now before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's Motion advances two bases for undoing the jury's verdict. First, under Rule 50, Defendant contends that no reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence presented that Plaintiff's sex was a motivating factor in her demotion. To support that assertion, Defendant methodically identifies each potential individual discriminator-Rosalind Gray, Sally Thompson, Dan Glickman, and Paul Fiddick-and explains why the evidence does not evince any discriminatory intent on that individual's part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 15-22. Moreover, Defendant also disputes that the jury could have reasonably concluded that the PRB discriminated against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-28. Defendant therefore asks the court to vacate the judgment in favor of Plaintiff on her sex discrimination claim and enter judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the alternative, Defendant contends that a new trial is warranted under Rule 59 for two reasons: (1) Plaintiff gave Defendant no pre-trial notice of her theory that the PRB discriminated against her and raised it for the first time mid-trial, thus constituting prejudicial \"unfair surprise,\" and (2) the jury's verdict is internally inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 29-31. With respect to the latter ground, Defendant also argues that if the court were to enter judgment on the jury's verdict and decline to order a new trial, the court should at least do so \"based on the jury's finding that gender was a mere motivating but not a determinative cause and, thus, award Plaintiff no compensatory damages or equitable relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court starts with Defendant's Rule 50 argument and then considers the grounds asserted for a new trial under Rule 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Rule 50\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Legal standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The standard for considering a motion under Rule 50\"mirrors\" the standard for summary judgment under Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

To be sure, there are some differences between Plaintiff and Wu, but those differences are not significant enough to render them insufficient comparators\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   . For instance, Plaintiff was in her probationary year in the SES at the time of her unsatisfactory rating, and Wu was not. But that difference is mitigated by the fact that Wu was only in his second year of serving in the SES, as well as evidence that Plaintiff and Wu were evaluated in the same manner regardless of their seniority in the SES.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 44-45, 527-28. Plaintiff and Wu also had different job duties because they led different sections. The jury, however,\n   reasonably could have discounted that difference and placed greater weight on the fact that Plaintiff and Wu shared the same rank and both were in the same situation: they were before the PRB, having been recommended by their common superior, Gray, for removal from the SES for poor work performance. Ultimately, these modest differences between Plaintiff and Wu do not warrant disturbing the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   USDA's post-trial contention that Wu and Plaintiff cannot be considered comparators as a matter of law rests largely not on some legal or position-based distinction, but rather on the employees' treatment by the PRB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 25-27. USDA asserts that the Board articulated a legitimate reason for treating Plaintiff and Wu differently-namely, that Plaintiff was aware of all of her critical performance elements and Wu was not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. For that reason, USDA argues, the two are not similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But USDA cannot bootstrap its claimed nondiscriminatory reason for treating Plaintiff and Wu differently into an argument that Plaintiff and Wu are not comparators. The question whether two employees are similarly situated is distinct from whether their different treatment gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087058,12310092\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1109/\">\n    812 F.3d at 1115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (failing to list the actions taken or not taken against the proposed comparator as a factor bearing on whether another employee is an appropriate comparator).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, even if Wu's professed ignorance of one of his critical performance elements could be considered a potential distinguishing factor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 27, the jury reasonably could have rejected it. There was sufficient evidence presented at trial for the jury to disbelieve Wu's claimed obliviousness. Gray testified that Wu received a \"package\" when he took the job as deputy director and that, upon receipt of the package, \"not only did he sign off and accept his position, his job description, but he also accepted his performance standards at that time.\" Trial Tr. at 523. Thus, from Gray's testimony, the jury could find that Wu in fact did have knowledge of his critical performance elements and that his later claim of ignorance before the PRB was not credible. Additionally, Wu was in the SES for a year longer than Plaintiff when they received negative performance appraisals from Gray.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45. From that fact the jury reasonably could have found it implausible that Wu, a long-time employee of the federal government,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 462, would not have known the full scope of his job duties and responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 619 (arguing in closing that Wu's asserted lack of knowledge was not credible in light of his experience). And, although USDA alludes to the difference in Plaintiff's and Wu's \"critical elements\" as a distinguishing factor between them, Def.'s Mot. at 26, the jury readily could have found that difference to be immaterial when the key question presented was why Wu was treated differently from Plaintiff when both were adjudged by Gray to have performed unsatisfactorily with regard to their\n   <em>\n    respective\n   </em>\n   job responsibilities and recommended for removal from the SES. In the end, it is the jury's province to weigh the evidence. Viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff here, the jury reasonably could have found that Wu and Plaintiff were similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, USDA argues that, even if Plaintiff and Wu can be considered comparators, \"Plaintiff offered no basis for a reasonable juror to question the bona fides of the Board's stated reason\" for treating Wu differently than Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. In other words, USDA insists that the Board's nondiscriminatory reason for treating Plaintiff differently is not evidence of pretext. As discussed, the reason\n   the Board offered for not recommending Wu's removal was that Wu did not know that one of his performance elements was deemed critical. The sole evidence presented by USDA of that rationale are typed comments at the conclusion of Wu's performance appraisal, which read: \"The designation of element # 2 as critical not clear to the executive. The [Board] gave the executive the benefit of the doubt and changed the designation to noncritical, thus changing the summary rating for Mr. Wu to minimally satisfactory.\" Def.'s Ex. 4 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 36-37, 41-42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury was not, however, required to take the comments on Wu's performance appraisal as gospel.

Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury also could have credited several other theories of pretext in reaching its conclusion that Plaintiff's sex motivated USDA's decision. The court starts with Gray. There was sufficient evidence presented at trial for a reasonable jury to find that Gray's stated reason for recommending Plaintiff's demotion was false or was patently unreasonable, and that the appraisal-upon which the PRB's recommendation and Fiddick's\n   decision was based-was the product of discrimination. Gray recommended Plaintiff's removal due to her alleged poor performance.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 2. The jury, however, heard evidence that, if believed, would cast doubt on Gray's credibility and the bona fides of her assessment of Plaintiff. For instance, Plaintiff presented testimony from one of her second-level subordinates in the USDA Office of Civil Rights, who stated that he had worked with about 50 people in the agency \"who had come or gone or who were still there who were absolutely incompetent,\" unlike Plaintiff, and that he was therefore \"stunned\" by her demotion. Trial Tr. at 362, 368;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 368 (noting that in his 13 to 14 years in the Office, he had never seen anyone demoted other than Plaintiff). He further testified that Plaintiff was \"the first Second-Line Supervisor [he] had ... in [his] time there, ever, who knew Civil Rights,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 368, and described her as \"analytical,\" \"very professional,\" \"hands-on,\" \"readily accessible,\" and \"supportive,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 363. Moreover, for every contention by USDA at trial that Plaintiff underperformed in her job, Plaintiff provided rebuttal evidence. For example, as to Gray's assertion that there were approximately 120 cases in which decisions were drafted but not forwarded to her office for signature,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 2 at 3, Plaintiff testified that many of those cases were at earlier stages and therefore were not ready for Gray's review, Trial Tr. at 135, 172. Similarly, to rebut Gray's assistant's claims that Plaintiff was difficult to locate during office hours,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 396-98, Plaintiff presented evidence from her special assistant that she worked long hours and was available,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 329-30, 335-36. It was up to the jury to resolve these factual disputes, and they reasonably could have found in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   USDA emphasizes that the question is not whether Plaintiff actually performed poorly, but whether the employer honestly and reasonably believed she performed poorly. Def.'s Mot. at 16-17; Def.'s Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mots. for J. as a Matter of Law or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial, ECF No. 154 [hereinafter Def.'s Reply], at 21-22. Thus, even if Plaintiff created a jury question as to whether the performance review was accurate, USDA argues, she failed to present sufficient evidence casting doubt on the sincerity of Gray's belief in Plaintiff's poor performance.

Rawls was to testify about the Board evaluation process and explain \"the considerations used by the 1999 PRB that reviewed and approved of Ms. Banks's unsatisfactory rating and removal from the SES and that reviewed Gray's decisions regarding Mr. Wu's FY 1999 performance appraisal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/#p47\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rawls never testified, however, because Judge Roberts ruled that USDA had disclosed his name too late-a mere eight days before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks v.

Cir. 2007) (alterations in original) (citations omitted). The jury's verdict is entirely consistent with this mixed-motive standard. After it concluded that Plaintiff's sex was a motivating factor in her demotion, the jury then answered whether USDA would have taken that same action \"in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor.\" It answered that question \"no.\" Thus, USDA manufactures an internal tension that does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Nevertheless, USDA further insists that the jury's \"illogical and conflicting results\" cannot be explained by the shifting burdens of proof, as Plaintiff claims, because \"[t]he jury is not learned in jurisprudence regarding burdens of proof and the verdict\n   form assigns no burdens in presenting the questions for the jury's consideration.\" Def.'s Reply at 25.

The court, however, excluded the Late Rosenberg Report as untimely, holding that the Third Rosenberg Report would be the operative expert report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. (draft), Oct. 5, 2017, at 46. Because this ruling came\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the close of briefing, Plaintiff's back pay calculation is based on the Late Rosenberg Report, including its $701,025 computation of back pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Am.

In calculating Plaintiff's back pay, Defendant relies on an annotated demonstrative exhibit, which \"correct[s]\" any assumptions that the agency contends are flawed. Def.'s Opp'n at 26. Otherwise, it uses the assumptions underlying the calculations of the \"most probable scenario\" in the Third Rosenberg Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334665\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/352/#p362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s Exs., Ex. PP, ECF No. 175-41 [hereinafter Def.'s Ex. PP]. Based on its calculations, USDA argues that the maximum amount of back pay that Plaintiff is entitled to is $280,699.03.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 18; Def.'s Ex. PP. The Third Rosenberg Report, by contrast, calculated a total of $625,384 in back pay based on the \"most probable scenario.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Rosenberg Report at 4-5, 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Based on the present record and the parties' briefs, the court cannot-and should not-attempt to calculate a final back pay award. Instead, the court will resolve USDA's objections to Rosenberg's analysis and leave it to the parties to propose an appropriate award in light of the court's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Mitigating income calculation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   To begin, USDA objects to the source of the numbers used to calculate Plaintiff's\n   mitigating income-that is, the amount of income Plaintiff has received since her demotion in 2000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 21-23. In preparing his Second Report, Rosenberg identified Plaintiff as the source for her actual compensation from 2000 to 2008, which he testified was derived from Bank's pay stubs or W-2 tax forms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Rosenberg Report at 17; Rosenberg Tr. at 90-91. In his Third Report, however, Rosenberg used the rates of pay set forth in SF-50s contained in Plaintiff's employment file. Def.'s Opp'n at 22 (citing Third Rosenberg Report);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Am. Mot. at 14-15. His Late Report, however, reverts back to Plaintiff's W-2 tax forms, as well as an income statement from the Social Security Administration, to tally mitigating income. Def.'s Opp'n at 22 (citing Late Rosenberg Report at 3). USDA argues that even though Rosenberg testified that using Plaintiff's SF-50s to fix Plaintiff's annual income would be \"more accurate,\" his Late Report relies on the less accurate source of data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   USDA insists that the SF-50s' income figures be used to tabulate mitigating income.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This objection is largely moot, however. The court has since excluded the Late Rosenberg Report, and USDA admits that the Third Report \"us[es] the 'more accurate' rates set by [USDA] and reflected on Banks's SF-50s as the source of mitigating income.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, 25. Thus, Plaintiff's mitigating income should be calculated based on the bonuses and salary rates set forth in Banks' SF-50s or other relevant record contained in her official personnel file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. The parties also should assume that Plaintiff did not receive any bonuses prior to 2005 in calculating her mitigating income, given the lack of any SF-50s in her file reflecting such bonuses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. PP at n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Pay not received due to administrative error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   USDA also takes issue with the income figures that Rosenberg used from 2003 to 2007. This objection relates to an administrative error that apparently resulted in a discrepancy between the pay Plaintiff received and the pay set by USDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 23. From 2003 to 2008, Plaintiff's salary, set by the Office of Civil Rights, did not increase even as her GS pay levels increased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Plaintiff's salary remained fixed at $125,246 per year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In September 2008, Plaintiff raised this issue with her supervisor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs., Ex. JJ, ECF No. 175-36. USDA then issued a series of SF-52 forms to harmonize Plaintiff's salary for 2003 to 2008 to the corresponding appropriate GS-15, step 10, salary for those years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 23; Def.'s Exs., Ex. KK, ECF No. 175-37. USDA also amended the SF-50s in Plaintiff's official personnel file to reflect the changes. Def.'s Opp'n at 23. While Plaintiff received the salary-differential payment for the 2008 calendar year, she claims she did not receive those payments for 2003 to 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs., Ex.

She seeks to recoup those sums here by calculating a salary mitigation figure that reflects the lesser income actually received, as opposed to the greater income she should have received per her corrected SF-50s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 23-24;\n   <em>\n    cf\n   </em>\n   . Pl.'s Am. Mot. at 14-15. USDA opposes that request. It argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to back pay from 2003 to 2007 to the extent such pay arises out of the administrative errors. Such errors, USDA contends, are unrelated to Plaintiff's demotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 23-24. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In considering appropriate equitable relief, the court's goal \"is to restore the plaintiff[ ], as nearly as possible, to the\n   circumstances [she] 'would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Caudle v.

There is no connection between Plaintiff's demotion in 2000 and the loss of income she suffered from 2003 to 2007 due to administrative errors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff's back pay award should not account for such unrelated pay errors. Instead, as stated above, Plaintiff's mitigating income should be calculated by the rates set forth in her SF-50s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Projected compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   USDA's remaining objections relate to Rosenberg's calculation of Plaintiff's projected compensation, i.e., the income that she could have expected to earn had she not been wrongfully removed from her SES position. First, USDA attacks the premise of the \"most probable\" scenario relied upon by Rosenberg.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 25. Under this scenario, Plaintiff would have received \"outstanding\" or \"exceeds expectations\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   ratings each year since her demotion in 2000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527257,3475204\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/888/153/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Rosenberg Report at 4-5. As USDA points out, however, Plaintiff \"did not receive such glowing reviews\" in less demanding positions at the GS-15/10 level. Def.'s Opp'n at 25. Thus, the court agrees that it was improper for Rosenberg to assume that Plaintiff would have received such ratings as an SES member, when in fact she had not received them in her positions at the GS-15/10 level. Plaintiff's back pay award instead should be based on her actual performance rating for the year in question. For example, in 2006, 2007, and 2012, Plaintiff received a \"fully successful\" rating.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. MM at 5-6, 10. Accordingly, during those years, Plaintiff's projected compensation should be based on the estimated salary and award distributions for USDA career SES employees with a \"fully successful\" rating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, USDA argues that Rosenberg, \"based on no authority whatsoever[,] projected that [Plaintiff] would have received elevations in [Executive Schedule 'ES'] levels under the prior SES pay system each year from 2000 to 2004.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs., Ex. HH, ECF No. 175-34, at 19-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Third Rosenberg Report at 10 (\"For years 2000-2003, step increases from ES-1 to ES-4 were assumed for all levels.... Salaries in 2004 weren't available and so were averaged between the 2003 and 2005 salaries for each level.\"); Rosenberg Tr. at 55 (explaining that the 2004 average was based, in part, on \"what she would have earned as an ES-4 in 2003\"). According to USDA, under the old ES-based SES pay system, promotions from one ES-level to the next (with a corresponding pay increase) did not occur as Rosenberg assumes. Def.'s Opp'n at 25. Specifically, Patricia Moore, Director of Executive Resources for\n   USDA, testified that from 2000 to 2003, SES employees did not progress like a GS employee would expect to under the grading system, provided their performance was satisfactory. Def.'s Exs., Ex. NN, ECF No. 175-39 [hereinafter Def.'s Ex. NN], at 26-27;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Am. Mot. at 13. Instead, supervisors could make recommendations to the Board based upon the employee's performance, and the Board and ultimately the Secretary would have \"sole discretion ... to give them that progression to the next level.\" Def.'s Ex. NN at 27. Importantly, an SES employee who received a rating of \"outstanding\" would not necessarily progress to the next level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28. Under the old system, progression was based upon a number of factors, including the structure of the office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. As Moore testified: \"If my boss was an ES-4, he probably wasn't going to give me, as a subordinate, an ES-5. So it was based on the position as well as my performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Based on this uncontested testimony, the court agrees that Plaintiff's projected compensation should not rest on the assumption that her ES level would have increased each year from 2000 to 2003. To hold otherwise would require speculation not only that Plaintiff would have received high performance ratings during these years, but also that a myriad of other factors existed to warrant the level increase. Such speculation cannot form the basis of a back pay award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, USDA objects to Rosenberg's projected salary increases from 2010 to 2013, as SES salaries were frozen during this period by Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 25 (noting 2013 freeze); Def.'s Ex. PP at n.2 (\"For years 2010 to 2013, USDA did not project a salary increase because all SES salaries were frozen by OPM during this period of time.\"). To the extent Rosenberg does not account for such pay freezes in his Third Report, his calculations are inaccurate. Plaintiff's back pay should reflect such pay freezes.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs., Ex. OO, ECF No. 175-40 (2013 OPM Memorandum);\n   <em>\n    Freeze on Pay Adjustments for Federal Civilian Employees\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt.

Accordingly, the court directs the parties to meet and confer and attempt to reach a resolution on the amount of back pay in light of the court's rulings.

First, there is no performance appraisal for the period during which Plaintiff served as Chief of the Policy Division.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Ex. MM. At least for purposes of back pay, USDA has conceded that it will treat Plaintiff's performance as \"Outstanding,\" as it has been unable to locate Plaintiff's 2004 appraisal. Def.'s Exs., Ex. PP, ECF No. 175-41, at n.1. The court finds no reason to assume otherwise for purposes of her reinstatement, or at least no reason to adopt USDA's argument that her performance was sub-par during this period, because Defendant does not point to any record evidence to support such a conclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n at 7-15. Second, while Plaintiff is correct that she received \"outstanding\" ratings during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 years when she served as the Director of the Data and Records Management Division,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Ex.
