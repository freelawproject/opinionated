INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the sinking of Defendant LA Marine Service LLC's vessel,\n   the M/V CAPT. LJ. Defendant Leonard Jourdan, Jr. is the owner and operator of LA Marine Service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff StarNet Insurance Company supplied a time-hull insurance policy to defendants to cover the M/V CAPT. LJ for the policy period of September 24, 2015, through September 24, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   LA Marine Service and Leonard Jourdan are each listed as named assureds on the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The M/V CAPT.

LJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and a counterclaim for declaratory judgment and contractual and statutory damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 21, 2017, the Court struck defendants' jury demand because plaintiff designated its claim as an admiralty claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court later granted plaintiff partial summary judgment and dismissed defendants' counterclaims for statutory penalties and lay up damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The only unresolved claims are the parties' cross-claims for declaratory judgment on the issue of insurance coverage.

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It is undisputed that, at the time of its sinking, the M/V CAPT. LJ was insured by plaintiff. But plaintiff argues that no insurance benefits are owed because the vessel sank as a result of defendants' negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Choice of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court must determine whether state law or federal maritime law governs this dispute. \"A marine insurance contract is indisputably a marine contract within federal admiralty jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Martech USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517961\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/1195/#p1198\">\n    993 F.2d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1198 (5th Cir. 1993). But \"the interpretation of a contract of marine insurance is-in the absence of a specific and controlling federal rule-to be determined by reference to appropriate state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Albany Ins. Co. v. Anh Thi Kieu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1797034\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/927/882/#p886\">\n    927 F.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886 (5th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Fifth Circuit has identified three factors a court must consider to determine whether to apply state law or federal maritime law: \"(1) whether the federal maritime rule constitutes 'entrenched federal precedent'; (2) whether the state has a substantial, legitimate interest in application of its law; and (3) whether the\n   state's rule is materially different from the federal rule.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517961\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/1195/#p1198\">\n    993 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1198 (citing\n   <em>\n    Albany Ins.

The parties assume that federal law governs this dispute. \"Entrenched federal precedent exists on the implied warranty of seaworthiness and the interpretation of Inchmaree clauses in maritime insurance contracts, which displaces Louisiana law\" with regard to the issue of seaworthiness.\n   <em>\n    Thanh Long Partnership v. Highlands Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844406\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/189/#p193\">\n    32 F.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193-94 (5th Cir. 1994). The Liner Negligence Clause at issue here is closely related to the Inchmaree Clause and is similarly governed by Fifth Circuit precedent. Both clauses expand maritime insurance to cover additional perils, subject to the assured's due diligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844406\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/189/#p193\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 191 ;\n   <em>\n    Employers Ins. of Wausau v.

The Court therefore applies federal maritime law to this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Implied Warranties of Seaworthiness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has explained that \"federal maritime law implies two warranties of seaworthiness in a time hull insurance policy\": an absolute warranty of seaworthiness at the inception of the policy and \"a modified, negative warranty, under which the insured promises not to knowingly send a vessel to sea in an unseaworthy condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Employers Ins. of Wausau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%201422\">\n    978 F.2d at 1431-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff's complaint and defendants' counterclaim both state that the M/V CAPT. LJ sank because water entered the engine room through the shafts, stuffing boxes, and packing gland assemblies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that the damage to the M/V CAPT. LJ resulted from a premature failure of the stuffing box.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained in more detail below, a stuffing box or packing gland assembly consists of a chamber filled with packing rings that create a seal around the vessel's propulsion shaft, permitting the shaft to rotate while preventing almost all leaks into the engine room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff represents that a sinking caused by defects in, or breakdown of, the shafts and stuffing boxes is not covered by the insurance policy unless defendants satisfy the requirements of the Liner Negligence Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the insured party, defendants bear the initial burden of proving that their loss falls within the policy's coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire Ins.

LJ. But defendants' claims representative, Nicholas Cozad, asserted in a letter to plaintiff on behalf of defendants that the vessel's sinking \"was the result of an unforeseen and sudden failure/accident which is a covered peril under the Liner Negligence Clause of this contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because defendants have not pointed to any other provision in the insurance contract that covers their loss, the Court finds that defendants' claim for insurance benefits is governed by the Liner Negligence Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that the Liner Negligence Clause's exclusion for losses that result from \"want of due diligence by the Assured(s), the Owner(s) or Manager (s) of the Vessel\" should not apply to preclude coverage because the Liner Negligence Clause is intended to \"broaden and not restrict, to expand, not withdraw, coverage\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spot Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413605\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/242/385/#p388\">\n    242 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   391 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Liner Negligence Clause does permit recovery for some losses that would not be available under traditional maritime insurance contracts, such as losses caused by the negligence of the vessel's builder and construction supervisor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Employers Ins. of Wasau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%201422\">\n    978 F.2d at 1440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the clause's expansion of coverage is not unlimited. As is clear from the explicit terms of the policy, \"to come within the\n   protection of the Liner Negligence Clause, the loss in this case must not have resulted from a want of due diligence\" by the assured, owner, or manager of the vessel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%201422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1439 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spot Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413605\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/242/385/#p388\">\n    242 F.2d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the proviso in the Inchmaree Clause excluding coverage for loss or damage caused by want of due diligence \"refers only to acts of which the owner had privity and knowledge\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, under the terms of the insurance policy, plaintiff does not owe insurance benefits if it can establish that the sinking of the M/V CAPT. LJ resulted from the lack of due diligence of Leonard Jourdan as the assured party and vessel owner. Plaintiff argues that the American Rule and the Liner Negligence Clause constitute independent defenses to coverage, and that a violation of either results in a denial of insurance benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Fifth Circuit has found that a Liner Negligence Clause or Inchmaree Clause can waive or displace the American Rule's implied warranties of seaworthiness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Employers Ins. of Wausau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%201422\">\n    978 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1440 ;\n   <em>\n    Tropical Marine Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"397747\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/247/116/#p119\">\n    247 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   122-23 ;\n   <em>\n    Spot Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413605\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/242/385/#p388\">\n    242 F.2d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, defendants appear to argue that Paternostro's report is unreliable because he was hired to confirm plaintiff's preexisting theory of how the vessel sank, and plaintiff allegedly directed him to focus on the vessel's shafts and packing assemblies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   But defendants offer no specific facts to contest Paternostro's detailed findings regarding the deteriorated condition of the M/V CAPT.

In response to plaintiff's interrogatories regarding maintenance of the stuffing boxes, defendants stated that the \"maintenance performed generally included opening the stuffing boxes, inserting additional packing rings/glands and/or tightening the stuffing boxes. No written procedures or policies exist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jourdan himself testified that he added new packing material to the stuffing boxes without removing the old packing, and that he \"ha[d] no idea\" what happened to the old packing material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Paternostro testified that Jourdan's practice of adding new packing rings without removing old packing material constituted poor maintenance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that \"[y]ou can't just keep jamming packing in\" because it \"pushes up against the shaft, the rotating shaft. What happens over time is it loses lubrication, efficiency. You build up heat. The packing gets hard ... that's an abrasive, and it scores the shaft.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paternostro noted that the packing rings on the M/V CAPT. LJ \"were basically welded to the inner diameter of the packing chamber. They hadn't been touched in, it looked like, a long period of time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Andrew Minster, the owner of Rivers &amp; Gulf Marine Surveyors and a marine surveyor with about 40 years of experience, also testified regarding the maintenance of the stuffing boxes on the M/V CAPT. LJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Minster stated that the maintenance \"might not have been proper maintenance, great maintenance. But some maintenance had been done\" because new packing material was added.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Minster agreed that continuously packing material into the stuffing boxes can lead to further wear of the shaft and additional leaking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants assert that Paternostro gave conflicting testimony with regard to whether packing rings should have been removed, and they contend that it would have been reckless and unreasonable to attempt to replace the packing rings while the M/V CAPT. LJ was afloat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   But defendants mischaracterize Paternostro's testimony. Paternostro explained that taking out too many packing rings at once could present a risk of flooding, but he did not suggest that it was never safe to remove and replace packing rings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   He instead stated that \"[y]ou would only take out about three packing rings,\" and \"if you're adding three rings of packing, you should take out three rings of packing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paternostro's testimony indicates that it would have been safe to remove and replace small amounts of packing material while the M/V CAPT. LJ was moored, and defendants offer no explanation why Jourdan failed to do this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, the evidence indicates that Jourdan was aware of leaks from the stuffing boxes that exceeded acceptable levels. Based on the condition of the shafts and packing gland assemblies, Paternostro formed the impression that it was likely \"that both packing gland assemblies were leaking seawater at a rate that should have provoked the necessity of an inspection and/or repairs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paternostro testified that, per most commercial industry standards, a leak should not exceed a pencil lead-sized stream of water, \"[n]ot the pencil itself, just the lead.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jourdan testified that the stuffing boxes had a small drip every five to ten seconds when the vessel was not running, but that the stream of water out of the stuffing boxes would be about as thick as a number 2 pencil when the vessel was running hard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Contrary to defendants' representations, Paternostro did not state that an excessive leak is a subjective term dependent on the opinion of the person inspecting the packing glands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paternostro instead explained that there can be \"variable opinions, but it goes back to our industry standards or, you know, we said earlier a pencil lead stream.... If you can't control it, that should provoke an inspection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Glass testified that, according to industry standards, a vessel working in shallow water like the M/V CAPT. LJ should have had a light to moderate drip of water from the stuffing boxes, which would consist of droplets but not a steady stream.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither Paternostro nor Glass suggested that a pencil-sized stream of water was acceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on this evidence, the Court finds that Jourdan failed to exercise due diligence to maintain the M/V CAPT. LJ's stuffing boxes. At a minimum, a vessel owner would reasonably be expected to\n   ascertain what happens to the packing material already in a stuffing box before adding more packing rings. Jourdan's practice of continuously adding packing rings to the stuffing boxes without removing old material damaged the propulsion shafts and stuffing boxes, undermined the watertight seal, and permitted seawater to flood the vessel. Additionally, the evidence indicates that Jourdan was aware of an excessive leak from the stuffing boxes and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the stuffing boxes were in seaworthy condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although defendants argue that they \"employed maintenance activities that were within acceptable tolerances of generally accepted industry standards,\" they provide no factual support for this assertion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the contrary, in arguing that plaintiff lacks evidence of bad faith under the American Rule, defendants themselves state that \"the proof shows nothing more than negligence on the part of defendants to use simple means to make the vessel seaworthy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that plaintiff has demonstrated that the loss of the M/V CAPT. LJ resulted from the want of due diligence of Leonard Jourdan as the assured and vessel owner. The vessel's sinking is therefore excluded from coverage under the Liner Negligence Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
