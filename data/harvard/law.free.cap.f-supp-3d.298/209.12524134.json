BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   These cases present an array of administrative and constitutional challenges to the Department of Homeland Security's (\"DHS\") rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program. Though the government disputes these challenges on the merits, its primary defenses concern the Court's authority to hear the cases: the government contends that most plaintiffs lack standing, that the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") deprives the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, and that the Department's decision to rescind DACA is not subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") because it was committed to agency discretion by law. The government has moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment only on their APA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These are just two of a series of challenges to the September 2017 rescission of DACA that have already been before several district courts, two circuit courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court on two occasions. At this time, two preliminary injunctions are in place that require DHS to accept applications for the renewal of DACA benefits, but not to accept new DACA applications. Here, through their pending motions, plaintiffs seek\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   injunctive relief, although only on their APA claims. And the relief they seek would reach new as well as renewal DACA applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that it has both jurisdiction and statutory authority to hear plaintiffs' APA and constitutional claims. The Court further concludes that, under the APA, DACA's rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed adequately\n   to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful. Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program. Thus, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment will be granted in part, and the decision to rescind DACA will be vacated and remanded to DHS. Vacatur of DACA's rescission will mean that DHS must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications. The Court will stay its order of vacatur for ninety days, however, to allow the agency an opportunity to better explain its rescission decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE IMPLEMENTATION AND RESCISSION OF DACA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program, which allowed certain undocumented aliens\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who had been brought to the United States as children to be treated as low priorities for removal under the federal immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Secretary's memorandum (the \"DACA Memo\"), these young people generally \"lacked the intent to violate the law\" when they entered the United States as children and, in many cases, \"kn[e]w only this country as home\" and had \"contributed to [the] country in significant ways.\" AR 1-2. DACA was therefore undertaken as \"an exercise of ... prosecutorial discretion\" to \"ensure that our enforcement resources are not expended on these low priority cases.\" AR 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DACA was available to any undocumented alien who: (1) came to the United States when she was under the age of sixteen; (2) had lived in the United States continuously since at least June 15, 2007; (3) was enrolled in school or had graduated from high school or been honorably discharged from the military; (4) had not been convicted of certain criminal offenses and posed no threat to national security or public safety; and (5) was under the age of thirty. AR 1. Aliens who met these criteria were eligible for renewable, two-year grants of \"deferred action\" on their removal from the United States. AR 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14) (defining deferred action as \"an act of administrative convenience to the government which gives some [removal] cases lower priority\"). As the DACA Memo was careful to point out, however, the program \"confer[red] no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship,\" as \"[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.\" AR 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Individuals who received deferred action under DACA were also eligible for a host of other benefits under preexisting statutes and DHS regulations. These benefits included work authorization, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(a)(11), social security numbers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.3(a)(4)(vi), advance parole (i.e., preauthorization to travel to the United States without a visa),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 212.5, and a limited class of public assistance, such as state and federal aid for medical emergencies,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201611\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), 1621(b)(1). Benefits like these allowed DACA recipients to work, travel abroad, access credit, and otherwise lead productive lives during their periods of deferred action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To be considered for deferred action under DACA, an applicant had to provide DHS with certain identifying information, including her name, mailing address, and contact information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Maria De La Cruz Perales Sanchez (\"Perales Decl.\") [ECF No. 28-8] \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Form I-821D, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs.,\n   <em>\n    Consideration for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\n   </em>\n   , https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d. Although many applicants feared that this information would later be used to initiate removal proceedings against them,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Perales Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 24, the Department assured applicants that their information would in most cases be \"protected from disclosure to [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") ] and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs.,\n   <em>\n    Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\n   </em>\n   , https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d. Relying on these representations, hundreds of thousands of undocumented aliens applied for and received deferred action under the DACA program.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Perales Decl. \u00b6 10; Decl. of John Doe # 1 \u00b6 6; Decl. of John Doe # 2 \u00b6 5. By late 2017, nearly 800,000 individuals had been granted deferred action under DACA. AR 242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Deferred Action for Parents of Americans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Two years after DACA's implementation, DHS issued a second memorandum, this time purporting to establish a deferred-action program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (\"DAPA\"). AR 37-41. As its name suggests, DAPA would have offered deferred action to parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who were themselves unlawfully present in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 40-41. The DAPA memorandum also purported to expand the DACA program in certain respects: it would have removed the thirty-year age cap, made the deferred-action grants last for three years instead of two, and required that an alien need only have been present in the United States since January 1, 2010 to be eligible. AR 39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before DAPA took effect, a coalition of states, led by Texas, sued to block its implementation on grounds that it violated both the APA and the Take Care Clause of the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    SeeTexas\n   </em>\n   , 86 F.Supp.3d at 604 &amp; n.1, 607 (citing U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3 ). The district court granted the states' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that they were likely to succeed on their procedural APA claim that DAPA (including its expansion of DACA) should have been promulgated using notice and comment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 671-72 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In part, this was because the Department's implementation of\n   <em>\n    DACA\n   </em>\n   suggested that\n   <em>\n    DAPA\n   </em>\n   would not \"genuinely leave[ ] the agency and its employees free\n   to exercise discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , 86 F.Supp.3d at 604 at 670 (emphasis, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court found that only about 5% of all DACA applications had been denied, and the government could not say how many of those had been denied for discretionary reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 609. This led the court to conclude that the DAPA Memo's suggestion that immigration officers could exercise case-by-case discretion was \"merely pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 669 n. 101 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , 809 F.3d at 173 (agreeing that although \"[t]he DACA and DAPA Memos purport to grant discretion, ... there was evidence from DACA's implementation that DAPA's discretionary language was pretextual\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits not only of their procedural APA claim, but also on their substantive APA claim, because DAPA seemed to conflict with the INA's \"intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children's immigration status.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , 809 F.3d at 179. But the court expressly declined to address the states' constitutional challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 146 n.3 (finding it \"unnecessary\" to address those claims \"at this early stage of the proceedings\"). It also rejected the government's threshold arguments-similar to the ones offered here-that the states lacked standing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 150-63, that the INA deprived the court of subject-matter jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 164-65, and that DAPA's implementation was unreviewable under the APA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165-72.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government petitioned for certiorari, and in June 2016, an eight-Justice Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's judgment by an equally divided vote.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Rescission of DACA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 5, 2017, three months after DAPA's rescission, then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke issued a five-page memorandum rescinding DACA (the \"Rescission Memo\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 252-56. The Rescission Memo began by canvassing the procedural history of the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation, and then noted that \"[a]lthough the original DACA policy was not challenged in [that] lawsuit, both the district and appellate court decisions relied on factual findings about the implementation of the 2012 DACA memorandum.\" AR 253. Specifically, the memorandum noted that \"[t]he Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that DACA decisions were not truly discretionary,\" and that \"[b]oth the district court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that implementation of the program did not comply with the [APA] because the Department did not implement it through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\" AR 253-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The memorandum also stated that in June 2017, after DAPA had been rescinded but before the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation was voluntarily dismissed, Texas and the other state plaintiffs in that case had sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatening to challenge DACA in court unless he rescinded the program by September 5, 2017. AR 254;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 238-240 (Texas's demand letter). Attorney General Sessions then sent a one-page letter to Acting Secretary Duke (the \"Sessions Letter\") instructing her to rescind DACA. AR 251. The Sessions Letter explained that the program had been \"effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and ... after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,\" and that \"[s]uch an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205476770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter also noted that because DACA suffered from \"the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205476770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter instructed Acting Secretary Duke to \"consider\" implementing \"an orderly and efficient wind-down process\" for the program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205476770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation and the Sessions Letter, the Rescission Memo concluded, \"it is clear that the ... DACA program should be terminated.\" AR 255. Given \"the complexities associated with winding down the program,\" however, the Department decided to \"provide a limited window in which it will adjudicate certain requests for DACA and associated applications.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205476770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Department would adjudicate any properly filed DACA applications that were pending as of September 5, 2017, as well as any new applications for the renewal of DACA benefits that were filed on or before October 5, 2017 by persons whose benefits were set to expire on or before March 5, 2018. It would also honor (in most cases) existing grants of deferred action, work authorization, and advance parole. But it would reject all other DACA applications, including any initial applications filed after September 5, 2017, and all pending and future applications for advance parole under the DACA program. Effectively, then, DACA benefits were made unavailable to any alien who had not already applied, and existing DACA grants would be allowed to expire permanently beginning in March 2018. Finally, like the earlier DACA and DAPA memorandums, the Rescission Memo stated that it \"is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\" AR 256.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to the government, DACA was rescinded not only because of its supposed illegality, but also because of the Attorney General's assessment of what the government now calls \"litigation risk\"-that is, the likelihood that DACA would have been invalidated had it been challenged in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 17; AR 254-55. At first blush, this seems to be a \"discretionary\" consideration that makes this case more like\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   , where the agency refused to take enforcement action not only because it thought that it lacked jurisdiction (a legal reason), but also because the alleged violations did not implicate the agency's enforcement priorities (a discretionary reason).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    470 U.S. at 824-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is not difficult to imagine a case where a court's preliminary disapproval of an agency's nonenforcement policy could lead the agency to rescind that policy for bona fide discretionary reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    470 U.S. at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying \"whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts\" as one of several such reasons). For example, the agency could conclude that the costs of defending the policy in court would outweigh its benefits to the public, or that the negative publicity that would surround the litigation would undermine the policy's effectiveness. In such cases, the decision to rescind would be \"discretionary\" in a meaningful sense: the agency would have weighed the policy's costs and benefits and decided that the former outweighed the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But where an agency asserts that a nonenforcement policy is\n   <em>\n    unlawful\n   </em>\n   and then asserts \"litigation risk\" as a separate ground for the policy's rescission, there are reasons to be more suspicious. After all, if an agency could insulate from judicial review\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   legal interpretation simply by framing it as an enforcement policy and then offering as an additional, \"discretionary\" justification the assertion that a court would likely agree with the agency's interpretation, then\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   would be a dead letter. Moreover, because such an assertion would depend (at least in part) on the correctness of the agency's view of the policy's unlawfulness, it would be unlike the independent discretionary ground that triggered the presumption of unreviewability in\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    470 U.S. at 824-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the FDA's statement that even if it had jurisdiction, it would still decline to act pursuant to its\n   \"inherent discretion to decline to pursue certain enforcement matters\").

Although this additional justification was not a bare assertion that a court would likely agree with the agency's view of the law-since it relied on an actual court's view of a concededly similar legal issue-it nonetheless raises many of the same concerns. The\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    OSG\n   </em>\n   rule would be seriously undermined if an agency could insulate from judicial review any legal interpretation stated as a general enforcement policy simply by pointing to one case where one court tentatively agreed with the agency on a similar legal issue. Moreover, the Department's conclusion that the Fifth Circuit's decision to uphold a preliminary injunction of DAPA suggests that a court would likely also impose a preliminary injunction of DACA necessarily relies on the Department's legal analysis of the similarities between the two policies-which, like the Department's view of DACA's legality itself, does not qualify for\n   <em>\n    Chaney's\n   </em>\n   presumption of unreviewability.

For its part, the Rescission Memo pointed to \"the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's rulings\" in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation and then cited the Sessions Letter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 255, which stated that \"DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress's repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.\" AR 251. The Sessions Letter also stated that \"[s]uch an open-ended circumvention of the immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch,\" and later, in its concluding paragraph, it cited the Executive's duty to \"faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also opined that \"the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This scant legal reasoning was insufficient to satisfy the Department's obligation to explain its departure from its prior stated view that DACA was lawful. In concluding that DACA was implemented \"without statutory authority,\" neither the Sessions Letter nor the Rescission Memo cited any statutory provision with which DACA was in conflict.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2127 (rejecting as inadequate an agency's statement that a particular statutory exemption \"does not include [certain] positions and the [agency] recognizes that there are circumstances under which the requirements for the exemption would not be met\"). True, both documents pointed to the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , which held that DAPA likely conflicted with the\n   INA's \"intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children's immigration status.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , 809 F.3d at 179.

The Sessions Letter made a fleeting reference to the Attorney General's \"duty to ... faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress,\" AR 251, which could be read to invoke the President's constitutional duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

Indeed, it expressly declined to address the plaintiffs' constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   809 F.3d at 146 n.3. Like its evaluation of its statutory authority to implement DACA, then, the Department's analysis of DACA's constitutionality was so barebones that the Court cannot \"discern[ ]\" the \"path\" that the agency followed.\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2125 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, it too cannot support DACA's rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Department's failure to give an adequate explanation of its legal judgment was particularly egregious here in light of the reliance interests involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2126. The Rescission Memo made no mention of the fact that DACA had been in place for five years and had engendered the reliance of hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries, many of whom had structured their education, employment, and other life activities on the assumption that they would be able to renew their DACA benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has set aside changes in agency policy for failure to consider reliance interests that pale in comparison to the ones at stake here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2126 (setting aside the Department of Labor's interpretation of a statutory exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime-pay requirements, in part because the agency had failed to address \"decades of industry reliance\" on its prior view that the exemption applied to a particular class of employees).

Here, plaintiffs miss the mark. Although both the Rescission Memo and the Sessions Letter focused primarily on DACA's statutory and constitutional defects, the Sessions Letter did state that DAPA was \"enjoined on a nationwide basis\" and that \"it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\" AR 251. Moreover, the Rescission Memo went on to cite this concern as grounds for its decision to \"wind [DACA] down in an efficient and orderly manner.\" AR 254. Together, these statements were sufficient to express the Department's concern that a nationwide injunction in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation would abruptly shut down the DACA program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chenery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"365064\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/194/#p196\">\n    332 U.S. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20S.%20Ct.%201760\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Nevertheless, this concern does not withstand review under the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true, as the government points out, that in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   the district court preliminarily enjoined DAPA based solely on the program's failure to have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , 86 F.Supp.3d at 677.

Thus, assuming that the district court in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation would have found DACA defective only on procedural grounds (as a fair reading of the Fifth Circuit's opinion would suggest), it seems doubtful that the court would have preliminarily enjoined DACA instead of remanding it to the Department, perhaps without vacatur, to undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On the other hand, if the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   district court were to find that DACA was substantively invalid-or indeed, unconstitutional-injunctive relief rather than remand may have been the more likely remedy.

Rather, the cases are clear that courts have the authority to review an agency's interpretation of the law if it is relied on to justify an enforcement policy, even when that interpretation concerns the lawful scope of the agency's enforcement discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    470 U.S. at 832-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    OSG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889090,3711294\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/808/\">\n    132 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   812 ;\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   , 37 F.3d at 676-77.

She may escape political accountability or judicial review, but not both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Here, the Department's decision to rescind DACA was predicated primarily on its legal judgment that the program was unlawful. That legal judgment was virtually unexplained, however, and so it cannot support the agency's decision. And although the government suggests that DACA's rescission was also predicated on the Department's assessment of litigation risk, this consideration is insufficiently distinct from the agency's legal judgment to alter the reviewability analysis. It was also arbitrary and capricious in its own right, and thus likewise cannot support the agency's action. For these reasons, DACA's rescission was unlawful and must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   For the reasons given above, then, the Court will vacate the Department's September 5, 2017 decision to rescind the DACA program. The Court will stay its order of vacatur for 90 days, however, to afford DHS an opportunity to better explain its view that DACA is unlawful. The Court will also deny the government's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, its motion to dismiss plaintiffs' APA claims on reviewability grounds, and its motion to dismiss plaintiffs' substantive APA claim; grant the government's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' procedural APA claim, the\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' RFA claim, and plaintiffs' information-sharing claim; and defer ruling on the government's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' remaining constitutional claims. Finally, the Court will also grant plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment as to their substantive APA claim, deny that motion as to their procedural APA claim, and deny their motion for preliminary injunctive relief on their information-sharing claim. A separate order has been issued on this date.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Some courts, including the Supreme Court, have referred to aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States as \"illegal\" instead of \"undocumented.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Texas v.
