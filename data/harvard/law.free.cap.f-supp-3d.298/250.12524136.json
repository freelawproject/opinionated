And Battle has not plausibly alleged any link between the EEOC complaint and his termination. Indeed, because he makes no reference to the EEOC complaint in his pleadings, and because the complaint itself (as opposed to its dismissal) is nowhere in the pleadings or attachments, it is not even clear that the complaint was filed before his termination on January 15, 2015. Thus, Battle's EEOC complaint cannot serve as the basis for his retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Battle also alleges that Master Security made retaliatory statements and caused him a \"stressful working environment\" because he expressed concerns internally about the company's \"wrongful procedures.\" His exhibits contain a March 14, 2013 \"Statement of Record\" sent to Kristine Nichols, a Senior Vice President at Master Security, regarding his \"interactions with Mr. Calvin Hersey, regarding [his] work, pay discrepancies[,] renewal of certifications,\" and \"many episodes of harassment, deterrence and unfair labor practices\" he had experienced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Similarly, to the extent that Count 5-titled \"Took Personnel Action Because of Exercise of Complaint and Grievance\"-is a claim independent from Battle's claims for retaliation and for equal pay, it does not state any legal theory under which the Court could grant relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Wrongful Termination Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Battle alleges \"wrongful termination\" based on his January 2015 firing.

The document's first two pages are identical to the amended complaint (ECF No. 10), which Battle did sign. The Court also construes the sixth and seventh of counts of Battle's second amended complaint, respectively, as a demand for a jury trial and for damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Also before the Court is Battle's \"Motions to Amended Pleadings\" (ECF No. 17).
