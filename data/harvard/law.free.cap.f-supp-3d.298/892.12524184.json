Throughout the litigation, Tech Pharmacy was represented by Hogan Lovells and Potter Minton. In September 2017, the parties proceeded to trial on these issues and the jury found that Defendants breached the 2009 Confidentiality Agreement (\"2009 Agreement\") and awarded Tech Pharmacy fifteen million dollars in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because Tech Pharmacy prevailed on its breach of contract claim, the issue of attorneys' fees was submitted to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury found that Tech Pharmacy's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses for their necessary services was two million dollars (Dkt. # 378). Subsequently, on October 31, 2017, Tech Pharmacy submitted this motion for attorneys' fees arguing that the request for attorneys' fees needs to be made through a motion rather than submitted to the jury (Dkt. # 386). Defendants filed a response to the motion on\n   November 14, 2017 (Dkt. # 389). Tech Pharmacy filed its reply on November 21, 2017 (Dkt. # 390), and Defendants filed their sur-reply on November 30, 2017 (Dkt. # 393).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"State law controls both the award of and the reasonableness of fees awarded where state law supplies the rule of decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

Defendants contend that Tech Pharmacy is not entitled to attorneys' fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 38.001 because Tech Pharmacy did not plead it and did not present the claim to Defendants. However, Defendants admit that Tech Pharmacy is entitled to attorneys' fees under the terms of the contract (Dkt. # 389 at p. 18 (\"Finally, although\n   <em>\n    Tech Pharmacy may recover attorneys' fees under the 2009 [Agreement]\n   </em>\n   , Tech Pharmacy has failed to satisfy multiple procedural requirements to recover attorneys' fees under Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\") (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Under Texas law, attorney's fees are recoverable as a cost of collection only if authorized by statute or contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

Here, both a statute and the contract entitle Tech Pharmacy to attorneys' fees; however, Tech Pharmacy does not need to use both. The terms of the 2009 Agreement, on their own, are enough to recover attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mundy v. Knutson Const.

Application of Rule 54\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Tech Pharmacy argues that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54, its claim for attorneys' fees under the terms of the 2009 Agreement must be made by a motion. Defendants claim that the terms of the contract contemplate a jury deciding attorneys' fees. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), \"[a] claim for attorney's fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, it is crucial to determine whether attorneys' fees are an element of damages under the 2009 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court will first look to Tech Pharmacy's claim for damages according to the terms of the contract. As an example of types of claims that are typically proved at trial as an element of damages,\n   the Advisory Committee Notes lists fees that are \"sought under the terms of a contract.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 54(d), Advisory Committee Notes. However, the Advisory Committee Notes do not state that when a party is seeking damages under the terms of a contract, the party must always prove the attorneys' fees at trial as an element of damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10170834,2252394\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/294/371/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, when a party is seeking attorneys' fees under a contract, it is \"[t]he language of the contract and the nature of the claim [that] are the dispositive factors concerning whether the fees are an element of damages or collateral litigation costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826822\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1035/#p1037\">\n    740 F.3d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court looks to the language of the contract to determine whether the attorneys' fees in this case are an element of damages or if they are collateral litigation costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826822\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1035/#p1037\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The contract states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If any action at law or in equity, including an action for declaratory relief, is brought to enforce or interpret the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs of court and reasonable attorneys' fees from the other party, which fees shall be in addition to any other relief that may be awarded, and which fees may be set by the court in the trial of such action or may be enforced in a separate action for that purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Dkt. # 386 at p. 3; Dkt. # 389 at p. 3 (citing PX115 at \u00a7 10) ).

On the other hand, Defendants contend that the language shows the parties considered the possibility that the jury would determine attorneys' fees because of the permissive language in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The contractual language is important to determine whether the claim is an element of damages, not whether the parties contemplated the possibility of a jury determining fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

Attorneys' fees, in this case, are a separate right owed based on the terms of the contract. Because the attorneys' fees are not an element of the claim, based on the language of the 2009 Agreement and the nature of the claim, the request for attorneys' fees must be made by a motion pursuant to Rule 54, and is an issue that is proper for the Court to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

However, Tech Pharmacy \"requests an award of [fifty percent] of this amount, or a total of $7,304,454.15....This discount reflects Tech Pharmacy's reasonable segregation of its state-law claims from its federal patent infringement cause of action.\" (Dkt. # 386 at p. 11). Defendants claim the amount of attorneys' fees should not exceed $2,000.000.00.

Because Tech Pharmacy only prevailed on its breach of contract claim, Tech Pharmacy represents that this total should be reduced by half, leaving \"14,551.85 of these hours...[that] are compensable.\" (Dkt. # 386 at p. 12).

The Court agrees, based on its review of the evidence, on its experience, and on the Court's knowledge of this case, that Tech Pharmacy's assertion that fifty percent of the work would have been necessary even if Tech Pharmacy had not asserted its patent infringement claims is correct.

There was significant overlap between the elements and facts of all the state law claims. The state law claims shared the same issue, \"whether Defendants used Tech Pharmacy's information for any unauthorized purpose-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , any purpose not expressly allowed by the 2009 [Confidentiality Agreement].\" (Dkt. # 386 at p. 13). Further, Tech Pharmacy represented that \"[m]ost of the discovery on the state law claims would have been necessary even if this had been exclusively\n   a breach of contract action.\" (Dkt. # 386 at p. 13). However, in the task estimate, Tech Pharmacy was able to allocate five percent of the hours expended to the trade secret misappropriation claim and two percent to the fraud claim (Dkt. # 387, Exhibit 1 at p. 21). Accordingly, the Court will reduce the total number of hours worked by seven percent, but the Court finds the remaining hours are inextricably intertwined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Tech Pharmacy sued Defendants not only for breach of contract, but also for patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud, and equitable estoppel. The services that Tech Pharmacy's attorneys provided were for all of these claims, not just for the breach of contract claim.

As such, the Court will apply the reductions it deemed appropriate to determine if the reductions bring the lodestar amount below the requested amount. The Court will apply three reductions to the amounts owed to Hogan Lovells: (1) the seven percent attributable solely to the trade secret misappropriation and fraud claims as seen in the task report; (2) six percent reduction for block billing; and (3) six percent reduction for lack of billing judgment. The Court will apply the reductions evenly between the three types of employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The calculation is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-85\">Initial Percent Reduced Reduced Hours Hours X Rate Partners: 3,937.35 6% 3,701.109 $3,182,953.74 Associates: 7,673.8 5% 7,290.11 $4,600,059.41 Staff: 2,135.8 5% 2,029.01 $557,977.75</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court will apply two reductions to Potter Minton for: (1) seven percent attributable solely to the trade secret misappropriation and fraud claims as seen in the task report; and (2) the six percent for lack of evidence of billing judgment. The Court will employ the same method and apply the reductions evenly between the three categories of employees. The calculation is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-87\">Initial Percent Reduced Reduced Hours Hours X Rate Partners: 320.45 3% 310.8365 $186,501.90 Associates: 188.6 3% 182.942 $82,323.90 Staff: 295.85 3% 286.9745 $43,046.18</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   After adding these together, the total amount of attorneys' fees is $8,652,862.88, which is still more than Tech Pharmacy is requesting.
