Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As Palacios's counsel clarified at the hearing, Palacios seeks to amend both her claim under the Affordable Care Act (the \"section 1557 claim\") and her claim under the D.C. Human Rights Act (the \"D.C. law claim\"). Medstar argues that leave to amend should be denied because (1) the claims Palacios seeks to add are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, and (2) Palacios acted with undue delay, bad faith, and dilatory motive in seeking to amend her complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Medstar first argues that the section 1557 claim that Palacios seeks to add is barred by the statute of limitations. In fact, counsel for Medstar suggested at the hearing that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Palacios's section 1557 claims are barred by the statute of limitations. This is so, Medstar contends, because the one-year statute of limitations governing D.C. Human Rights Act claims applies to Palacios's section 1557 claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 5. Palacios contends that the three-year statute of limitations governing D.C. personal injury claims applies instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 2-3. Neither side is correct. The Court finds that Palacios's section 1557 claim is actually governed by the federal four-year catchall statute of limitations set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and the claim is therefore timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination by \"any health program or activity\" on the basis of race, gender, age, or disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018116\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Prior to its enactment, courts and commentators had repeatedly \"cal[led] upon Congress to eliminate these complex cases, that do much to consume the time and energy of judges but that do little to advance the cause of justice, by enacting federal limitations periods for all federal causes of actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870337\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/369/#p382\">\n    541 U.S. at 379-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870337\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/369/#p382\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sentry Corp. v.

Opp'n at 11. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For one, Palacios has not exhibited undue delay in moving to amend her complaint. She filed suit in May 2017 and formally moved to amend her complaint six months later, in November 2017. MedStar's counsel was informed at the mediation session in October of Palacios's intent to file an amended complaint and was provided a copy of that complaint. Given the parties' attempt at mediation-which they agreed to undergo about two months after the complaint was filed-it makes sense that Palacios would wait until mediation proved unsuccessful to file her motion for leave to amend, and she acted promptly thereafter. A delay of six months is hardly an eternity in the lifespan of a civil lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nor is MedStar prejudiced by the delay between the initial filing of the complaint and the motion to amend: discovery here has not yet begun, nor has the Court confronted any dispositive motions. This is not a case where a plaintiff has waited years, until discovery has concluded or the eve of trial arrives or the Court grants a defendant's dispositive motion, to suddenly move to amend the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v.

A six-month delay is not undue given this case's procedural history and status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nor has MedStar met its burden of showing bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sherrod v.

Palacios explained that her current counsel-Kilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton-was not the same counsel that handled her administrative appeals in 2015 and 2016-Whitman Walker Health Legal Services. Pl.'s Mot. at 3. Her current counsel represented that it prepared the original complaint and then learned of the Sridharen claims in August 2017, in a meeting with Palacios to prepare for the parties' mediation session in October 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Counsel sought leave to amend promptly after mediation failed. MedStar presents nothing to counter this explanation for the delay, and any miscommunication or failure to meet with Palacios sooner, standing alone, does not show bad faith. In sum, MedStar has offered no evidence of bad faith here, and the six-month delay-particularly given the parties' attempt at mediation in the interim-is not enough by itself to show bad faith, undue delay, or dilatory motive. The Court will therefore grant Palacios leave to amend her section 1557 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Palacios's D.C. law claim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Palacios's counsel clarified at the hearing that she also seeks to amend her D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   law claim. MedStar, again, contends that leave should be denied on the same grounds as for her section 1557 claim. Because MedStar is correct that Palacios's claim concerning Dr. Sridharen would be barred by the applicable D.C. statute of limitations, amendment would be futile. Palacios's motion will therefore be denied as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Palacios's D.C. law claim has a clear statute of limitations: D.C. law provides that claims arising under the D.C. Human Rights Act must be filed within one year of the alleged discriminatory act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1403.16\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 2-1403.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Because the events at issue occurred before November 20, 2015, Palacios would have needed to file suit before November 20, 2016 to preserve her D.C. law claims. Her lawsuit was filed in May 2017. As such, the claim she seeks to add would be barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Palacios nonetheless contends that the tolling provision in the D.C. statute of limitations applies and saves her claim from being barred. The D.C. statute of limitations provides that \"[t]he timely filing of a complaint with the [D.C.] Office [of Human Rights] ... shall toll the running of the statute of limitations while the complaint is pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1403.16\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 2-1403.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Palacios argues that the charge she filed with the D.C. Office of Human Rights on August 26, 2015 and the charge she filed with HHS's Office for Civil Rights in October 2015 both triggered this tolling provision. But neither of these administrative charges tolls the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, Palacios's D.C. charge: This charge was filed on August 26, 2015, prior to the incident with Dr. Sridharen in November 2015. Unsurprisingly, then, it does not mention the incident with Dr. Sridharen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n Ex. A. Nor has Palacios presented any evidence that she amended her D.C. charge to encompass the Dr. Sridharen incident or filed a separate charge regarding that claim. The absence of any reference to the Dr. Sridharen incident means that Palacios's D.C. complaint does not toll the statute of limitations as to the Sridharen D.C. law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, Palacios's charge with HHS's Office for Civil Rights: This charge was ultimately amended to encompass the Dr. Sridharen incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n Ex. B. But the statute of limitations is tolled by the filing of a charge\n   <em>\n    with the D.C. Office of Human Rights\n   </em>\n   , not just the filing of any administrative charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1403.16\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 2-1403.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"The timely filing of a complaint\n   <em>\n    with the Office\n   </em>\n   ... shall toll the running of the statute of limitations while the complaint is pending.\" (emphasis added) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this charge was filed\n   with the HHS Office for Civil Rights and not the D.C Office of Civil Rights, under the plain language of the D.C. statute it does not toll the statute of limitations. In the absence of any tolling, the addition of the Sridharen allegations to Palacios's D.C. law claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Amendment would therefore be futile, so the Court will deny Palacios leave to amend her D.C. law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that [16] Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Plaintiff will be granted leave to amend her federal claim under the Affordable Care Act but will be denied leave to amend her D.C. law claim under the D.C. Human Rights Act. The Court will issue a separate discovery scheduling order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Palacios's federal charge with HHS's Office for Civil Rights remains pending. In 2016, the District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting HHS from enforcing the anti-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act as to allegations of gender identity discrimination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Burwell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270001\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/660/#p695\">\n     227 F.Supp.3d 660\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 695-96 (N.D. Tex. 2016). The existence of that injunction makes it unlikely that her federal administrative charge will be acted on anytime soon.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Even if the Court were to engage in the complex exercise that section 1658(a) was enacted to avoid, it would still find Palacios's claim timely. In the absence of the catchall statute of limitations, the Court would turn to Title IX to determine a statute of limitations because section 1557 specifically directs that the \"enforcement mechanisms provided for and available under\" Title IX \"shall apply\" to such violations of section 1557,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018116\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Briscoe v. Health Care Service Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205989727\">\n     2017 WL 5989727\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 4, 2017) (applying Title IX standards to claim of gender discrimination under section 1557). And every court of appeals to have considered the question has applied the state personal injury statute of limitations to Title IX claims.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     King-White v. Humble Independent School Dis.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347312\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/754/#p759\">\n     803 F.3d 754\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 759 (5th Cir. 2015) (compiling cases);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Richards v. Duke University\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5746997\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/480/222/#p238\">\n     480 F.Supp.2d 222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 238 (D.D.C. 2007) (applying D.C.'s three-year personal injury statute to Title IX claim). The Court would thus apply D.C.'s three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    For this reason, the Court need not address the parties' arguments regarding the relation back doctrine. Even if Palacios's amended complaint did relate back to her original complaint, that complaint was not filed within the one-year statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Palacios also appears to argue that her complaint relates back to her original administrative charge. The Court is unaware of any precedent allowing an amended complaint to relate back to an administrative charge rather than the original complaint-which is unsurprising since Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) provides for relation back to a party's original pleading and a charge filed with an agency is not a pleading.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Admittedly, the filing of a charge with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") would trigger the tolling provision in the D.C. statute of limitations.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Estenos v. PAHO/WHO Federal Credit Union\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185302\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/952/878/#p886\">\n     952 A.2d 878\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 886 (D.C. 2008). This is so because of the work-sharing agreement between the D.C. Office of Human Rights and the EEOC, whereby any charge filed with the EEOC is automatically cross-filed with the D.C. Office of Human Rights.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185302\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/952/878/#p886\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As far as the Court is aware, no such similar work-sharing agreement exists between HHS's Office for Civil Rights and the D.C. Office of Civil Rights. As a result, nothing indicates that the D.C. Office ever received a copy of the charge filed with HHS's Office and there is no reason to extend the unique treatment of EEOC charges to encompass the federal charge here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
