Specifically, they contest the testimony of FURA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agent Adalberto Del Valle calling it, among other things, implausible and highly impeachable. In sum, Del Valle testified that at approximately 7:00a.m. on December 10, 2016, while on patrol off the coast of Ceiba, Puerto Rico, he and two other officers detected, intercepted and arrested all three co-defendants on board a vessel with twenty-five bales of suspected cocaine. But Stewart and Esquilin challenge Del Valle's assertion that he was able to see them throwing bales of cocaine overboard from a distance of over one hundred (100) feet. Defendants contend that his visibility was impaired by the distance and the fact that, according to other testimony, the defendants were wearing yellow rain jackets with their hoods up covering most of their faces. According to defendants, his incredible testimony cannot be credited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government opposes this argument asserting that despite the distance between both vessels at the time they were first detected visually, upon approaching defendants' vessel more closely, Del Valle was able to confirm that both Stewart and Esquilin were the two individuals standing in the front portion of the boat while Carrasquillo was the one captaining it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 247. Moreover, PRPD Sargeant Magaly Diaz, who was on the FURA vessel along with Del Valle at the time, testified that as the FURA officers got closer to defendants' vessel, she saw black packages being thrown overboard and identified Stewart and Esquilin as the two individuals that were standing on top of the bales and Carrasquillo as the man operating the vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 206 at pages 116-121. In addition, co-defendant Stewart admitted that his uncle, Carrasquillo, was the only one who knew how to operate the vessel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 226 at page 52, and the record shows that Carrasquillo never left the wheel as he sped off\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and tried to avoid capture by engaging in a swerve and ramming into the FURA boat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewing the record as a whole and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the court finds that it can be logically and reasonably inferred from defendants' positions inside the vessel at the time of capture that Stewart and Esquilin were the ones throwing the bales overboard, and thus, in possession of the cocaine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court agrees. In the instant case, the parties stipulated that \"the drugs seized by FURA agents from the boat the defendants were on on December 10, 2016, consisting of 499 bricks of cocaine weighing approximately 500 kilograms, would be worth approximately $10 million to 12 and a half million dollars.\" Docket No. 209 at page 57.

It is uncontested that both Stewart and Esquilin were employees of Carrasquillo, who had a construction company, and they had for years worked together on various projects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 223 at pages 40-41, 59-60, 114. The jury here heard testimony from Stewart and his wife regarding Carrasquillo's visit on December 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016 to supposedly invite Stewart on a fishing trip. The defense's theory is that Stewart and Esquilin went on this legitimate voyage to help Carrasquillo drop twenty (20) lobster\n   cages weighing approximately thirty-five (35) pounds each.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 223 at page 130; Docket No. 226 at page 28. Yet, in order to talk to his uncle about what he claims was an innocent subject matter, Stewart stepped outside of his home where they could not be overheard by the rest of Stewart's family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 223 at page 73. According to both witnesses, the conversation was extremely brief, lasting just one to two minutes. This despite it being the first time Stewart spoke to his uncle about a fishing trip for which he had to wake up at 3:30a.m. and navigate for at least an hour just to reach the drop off location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 223 at pages 121-122; Docket No. 226 at pages 62-63; Docket No. 223 at pages 78, 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Stewart's sworn testimony was that the three of them left the pier of Los Corchos in Naguabo, Puerto Rico on or about 4:30a.m. to go lay these lobster traps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 223 at page 126, 130. However, these statements were in contrast with Police Officer Rolando Melendez's, who interviewed Stewart shortly after the latter's arrest. According to Melendez, Stewart told him that the defendants left the Naguabo dock of El Malecon at approximately 5:30a.m. to go trawling, not drop lobster cages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No 231 at page 41. With regards to the dock of Los Corchos, Melendez also testified that the road to reach it is long and full of holes and that the pier is not in the best conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405233\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/332/#p342\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at pages 45-47.

Stewart also testified that the loading process took Carrasquillo around forty-five (45) minutes and that another hour transpired between the time his uncle finished loading the bales onto the boat and the moment in which he yelled at defendants to throw the bales in the water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 223 at pages 99-100, 104-105. According to one of FURA's arresting officers, the defendants were traveling through a sector where he has performed various drug interdictions. Moreover, the area is rocky, has rough conditions and is difficult to navigate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 202 at pages 45-47. Finally, as previously stated, two FURA agents testified that they saw defendants dumping the bales overboard after being spotted by law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of the circumstantial evidence presented, the jury could have reasonably believed that, given its brevity, the conversation outside of Stewart's home was not the first time he and his uncle spoke of the trip. After, all, they are both relatives as well as co-workers. The jury could have reasonably believed that, given the need for privacy, the topic of their exchange was not fishing. The jury could have reasonably believed that, given the comparable heaviness of the objects in question, defendants went on the trip to help Carrasquillo lift the bales from the ocean as opposed to drop off lobster cages. The jury could have also reasonably\n   <em>\n    dis\n   </em>\n   believed that defendants just sat there for almost two (2) hours doing nothing, not lending Carrasquillo a hand in the completion of the mission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
