The order of March 31, 1959 appealed from directs that decedent\u2019s estate collect and account for all moneys heretofore received or hereafter to be received and to pay over to plaintiff-respondent certain percentages of such collections, and such a direction to the donor\u2019s estate, confirming its right to collect and pay over to the alleged donee, prevents a claim of a gift by assignment in decedent\u2019s lifetime. <em>(Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>207 App. Div. 356, 238 N. Y. 477; <em>Matter of Link, </em>173 Misc. 217; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>80 N. Y. 422.) II. The delivery essential to constitute a valid gift must be such as to vest the donee with the control and dominion over the property, and absolutely to divest the donor of his dominion and control, and the delivery must be made with the intent to vest the title of the property in the donee. <em>(Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix, </em>248 N. Y. 76; <em>Matter of Van Alstyne, </em>207 N. Y. 298; <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>117 N. Y. 421.) III. No \u201cPygmalion Musical stage version \u201d then existed at the time of the alleged gift, nor does plaintiff claim anywhere that it then existed, nor any contract therefor. It was an unfulfilled hope of Pascal for profits, never for him in his lifetime fulfilled. <em>(Beaver </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>117 N. Y. 421; <em>Matter of Lutz, </em>201 Misc. 539; <em>Matter of McCarthy, </em>64 Misc. 719, 254 App. Div. 827.) IV. Not only is there no equitable assignment, but an equitable assignment lacks the legal com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>pletoncss to support a complete <em>in pressenii </em>legal gift. <em>(Hinkle Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>229 N.

Y. 314; <em>Matter of Cohn, </em>187 App. Div. 392.) V. A valid gift must be perfected instantly and not be a promise of future benefits, and the intention to make a gift no matter how clearly expressed is not a valid gift. <em>(Matter of Peno, </em>128 Misc. 718.) VI. Plaintiff-respondent sued in her complaint for an accounting of profits, but the order appealed from and the summary judgment do not direct such an accounting of profits, but order payment of past and future receipts collected by administratrix free of expense. This direction is not sustained by any proof or foundation in the pleadings or elsewhere in the record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-4\"><em>Frederick R. Adler, Martin D. Jacobs </em>and <em>Leonard M. Leiman </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFP\">I. A small share <em>(2% or 5%) </em>of the anticipated and reasonably expected profits, relating to and stemming from the basic 1952 agreement, was the proper subject of a gift by written instrument. The existing license agreement was the \u2018 \u2018 source of profit \u2019 \u2019 and the 1955 agreement was the realization of profit whose expectation in 1954 was \u201c natural and reasonable \u201d. <em>(Matter of Cohn, </em>187 App. Div. 392.) II. The expectation of profit was a proper subject for a gift by written instrument especially under the circumstances here present. <em>(Field </em>v. <em>Mayor of New-York, </em>6 N. Y. 179; <em>Central Trust Co. </em>v. <em>West India Improvement Co., </em>169 N. Y. 314; <em>Hinkle Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>229 N. Y. 179.) III. The effectiveness of a gift of a share of profits would not be inconsistent with some right in the grantor to deal with the license agreement from which the share of profits stem. <em>(Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix, </em>248 N. Y. 76; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>80 N. Y. 422; <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>207 App. Div. 356; <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>117 N. Y. 421; <em>Matter of Van Alstyne, </em>207 N. Y. 298.) IV. The profits now being received by the estate under the May, 1955 agreement are the realization of the valuable rights which were the subject of the February, 1954 gift. The legal mechanics adopted in the 1955 agreement did not destroy the rights of decedent or plaintiff. V. No issues of fact remain. The order and judgment entitling plaintiff to a small percentage of the moneys received from the \u201c Pygmalion Musical stage version \u201d are proper. <em>(Mayer </em>v. <em>Nether sole, </em>71 App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>383; <em>Nay </em>v. <em>Curley, </em>113 N. Y. 575; <em>Matter of Levi, </em>3 Misc 2d 746.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-4\">Chief Judge Desmond.</author>\n<p id=\"Ant\">Gabriel Pascal, defendant\u2019s intestate who died in 1954, had been for many years a theatrical producer. In 1952 an English corporation named Gabriel Pascal Enterprises, Ltd., of whose 100 shares Gabriel Pascal owned 98, made an agreement with the English Public Trustee who represented the estate of George Bernard Shaw. This agreement granted to Gabriel Pascal Enterprises, Ltd., the exclusive world rights to prepare and produce a musical play to be based on Shaw\u2019s play <em>\u20181 </em>Pygmalion \u2019 \u2019 and a motion picture version of the musical play. The agreement recited, as was the fact, that the licensee owned a film scenario written by Pascal and based on \u20181 Pygmalion \u2019 \u2019. In fact Pascal had, some time previously, produced a nonmusical movie version of \u2018 \u2018 Pygmalion \u2019 \u2019 under rights obtained by Pascal from George Bernard Shaw during the latter\u2019s lifetime. The 1952 agreement required the licensee corporation to pay the Shaw estate an initial advance and thereafter to pay the Shaw estate 3% of the gross receipts of the musical play and musical movie with a provision that the license was to terminate if within certain fixed periods the licensee did not arrange with Lerner and Loewe or other similarly well-known composers to write the musical play and arrange to produce it. Before Pascal\u2019s death in July, 1954, he had made a number of unsuccessful efforts to get the musical written and produced and it was not until after his death that arrangements were made, through a New York bank as temporary administrator of his estate, for the writing and production of the highly successful <em>\u201c </em>My Fair Lady\u201d. Meanwhile, on February 22, 1954, at a time when the license from the Shaw estate still had two years to run, Gabriel Pascal, who died four and a half months later, wrote, signed and delivered to plaintiff a document as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Dear Miss Kingman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">This is to confirm to you our understanding that I give you from my shares of profits of the Pygmalion Musical stage version five per cent (5%) in England, and two per cent (2%) of my shares of profits in the United States. From the film version, five per cent (5%) from my profit shares all over the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>As soon as the contracts are signed, I will send a copy of this letter to my lawyer, Edwin Davies, in London, and he will confirm to you this arrangement in a legal form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">This participation in my shares of profits is a present to you, in recognition for your loyal work for me as my Executive Secretary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">Very sincerely yours, Gabriel Pascal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The question in this lawsuit is: Did the delivery of this paper constitute a valid, complete, present gift to plaintiff by way of assignment of a share in future royalties when and if collected from the exhibition of the musical stage version and film version of \u201cPygmalion\u201d? A consideration was, of course, unnecessary (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 33, subd. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In pertinent parts the judgment appealed from declares that plaintiff is entitled to receive the percentages set out in the 1954 agreement, requires defendant to render plaintiff accountings from time to time of all moneys received from the musical play and the film version, and orders defendant to make the payments required by the agreement. The basic grant from the Shaw estate was to Gabriel Pascal Enterprises, Ltd., a corporation, whereas the document on which plaintiff sues is signed by Gabriel Pascal individually and defendant makes much of this, arguing that Gabriel Pascal, as distinguished from his corporation, owned no rights when he delivered the 1954 document to plaintiff. However, no such point was made in the courts below and no mention of it is made in the motion papers, affidavits, etc., on which plaintiff was granted summary judgment. It is apparent that all concerned in these transactions disregarded any distinction between Pascal\u2019s corporation in which he owned practically all the stock, and Pascal individually, as is demonstrated by the agreement between Lerner-Loewe-Levin, writers and producers of \u2018 \u2018 My Fair Lady \u2019 \u2019, and Gabriel Pascal\u2019s estate. Actually, all this makes little difference since what Pascal assigned to plaintiff was a percentage from Pascal\u2019s \u201cshares of profits\u201d and this would cover direct collections or collections through his corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Defendant emphasizes also the use of the word \u201c profits \u201d in the February, 1954 letter from Pascal to plaintiff, and suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>that this means that plaintiff was not to get a percentage of Pascal\u2019s gross royalties but a percentage of some <em>11 </em>profits \u201d remaining after deduction of expenses. Again, the answer is that no such point was made in the proceedings below or in this record and everyone apparently assumed, at least until the case reached this court, that what the defendant Pascal estate will get from the musical play and movie is royalties collectible in full under the agreements pursuant to which \u2018 \u2018 My Fair Lady \u2019 \u2019 has been and will be produced. In this same connection defendant talks of possible creditors of the Pascal corporation and inquires as to what provision would be made for them if plaintiff were to get her percentages of the full royalties. This, too, is an afterthought and no such matter was litigated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The only real question is as to whether the 1954 letter above quoted operated to transfer to plaintiff an enforcible right to the described percentages of the royalties to accrue to Pascal on the production of a stage or film version of a musical play based on \u201c Pygmalion \u201d. We see no reason why this letter does not have that effect. It is true that at the time of the delivery of the letter there was no musical stage or film play in existence but Pascal, who owned and was conducting negotiations to realize on the stage and film rights, could grant to another a share of the moneys to accrue from the use of those rights by others. There are many instances of courts enforcing assignments of rights to sums which were expected thereafter to become due to the assignor. A typical case is <em>Field </em>v. <em>Mayor of New-York </em>(6 N. Y. 179). One Bell, who had done much printing and similar work for the City of New York but had no present contract to do any more such work, gave an assignment in the amount of $1,500 of any moneys that might thereafter become due to Bell for such work. Bell did obtain such contracts or orders from the city and money became due to him therefor. This court held that while there was not at the time of the assignment any presently enforcible or even existing chose in action but merely a possibility that there would be such a chose of action, nevertheless there was a possibility of such which the parties expected to ripen into reality and which did afterwards ripen into reality and that, therefore, the assignment created an equitable title which the courts would enforce. A case similar to the present one in general outline is <em>Central Trust Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>West India Improvement Co. </em>(169 N. Y. 314) where the assignor had a right or concession from the Colony of Jamaica to build a railroad on that island and the courts upheld a mortgage given by the concession owner on any property that would be acquired by the concession owner in consideration of building the railroad if and when the railroad should be built. The Court of Appeals pointed out in <em>Central Trust Go., </em>at page 323, that the property as to which the mortgage was given had not yet come into existence at the time of the giving of the mortgage but that there was an expectation that such property, consisting of securities, would come into existence and accrue to the concession holder when and if the latter performed the underlying contract. This court held that the assignment would be recognized and enforced in equity. The cases cited by appellant <em>(Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>80 N. Y. 422; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix, </em>248 N. Y. 76; <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>207 App. Div. 356, mod. 238 N. Y. 477) are not to the contrary. In each of those instances the attempted gifts failed because there had not been such a completed and irrevocable delivery of the subject matter of the gift as to put the gift beyond cancellation by the donor. In every such case the question must be as to whether there was a completed delivery of a kind appropriate to the subject property. Ordinarily, if the property consists of existing stock certificates or corporate bonds, as in the <em>Young </em>and <em>Vincent </em>cases <em>{supra), </em>there must be a completed physical transfer of the stock certificates or bonds. In <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan $ Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winthrop {supra) </em>the dispute was as to the effect of a power of attorney but the maker of the power had used language which could not be construed as effectuating a present gift of the property which the donor expected to receive in the future from another estate. The <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Go. </em>case does not hold that property to be the subject of a valid gift must be in present physical existence and in the possession of the donor but it does hold that the language used in the particular document was not sufficient to show an irrevocable present intention to turn over to the donee securities which would come to the donor on the settlement of another estate. At page 485 of 238 New York this court held that all that need be established is (\u2018 an intention that the title of the donor shall be presently divested and presently transferred \u201d but that in the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>document under scrutiny in the <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>case there was lacking any language to show an irrevocable intent of a gift to become operative at once. In our present case there was nothing left for Pascal to do in order to make an irrevocable transfer to plaintiff of part of Pascal\u2019s right to receive royalties from the productions.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The rules as to the requisites for completed gifts have recently been restated by us in <em>Matter of Szabo </em>(10 N Y 2d 94, 98).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Beaver </em>(117 N. Y. 421) and <em>Matter of Van Alstyne </em>(207 N. Y. 298) cases relied on by defendant deal with the transfer of tangible physical property and are not helpful here. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young </em>(80 N. Y. 422, <em>supra) </em>and <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Rix </em>(248 N. Y. 76, <em>supra), </em>similarly cited by defendant, there was neither a physical delivery nor delivery of a writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
