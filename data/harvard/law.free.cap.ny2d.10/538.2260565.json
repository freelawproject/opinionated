The board was required to act fairly toward Mars, Its failure to make an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>investigation, or to give Mars some sort of a hearing was tyrannical, arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of Heaney </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>286 N. Y. 38; <em>Housing Auth. of Opelousas, La., </em>v. <em>Pittman Constr. Co., </em>264 F. 2d 695; <em>People ex rel. Coughlin </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>121 N.

S. 1; <em>People ex rel. Doscher </em>v. <em>Sisson, </em>222 <em>N. </em>Y. 387; <em>People ex rel. Jordan </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>152 N.

Lodes </em>v. <em>Department of Health, </em>189 N. Y. 187; <em>Matter of County of Ulster </em>v. <em>State Dept, of Public Works, </em>211 App. Div. 629.) II. Even if taken as true, the facts on which the board relied do not sustain a finding of illegal or immoral conduct on the part of Mars. <em>(Matter of Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Thacher, </em>14 A D 2d 524; <em>Planet Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>7 N Y 2d 381; <em>Rason Asphalt </em>v. <em>Town of Oyster Bay, </em>6 A D 2d 810; <em>A. &amp; J.

S.] 94; <em>Matter of Association for Preservation of Freedom of Choice </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>9 N Y 2d 376.) III. The board\u2019s disqualification of Mars was <em>ultra vires. </em>IV. The Special Term erred in excluding the second Kaplan report. <em>(Matter of Mandle </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 N Y 2d 51.) V. The court below was correct in conducting a hearing in order to compel the board to submit the entire record of its proceedings and to determine disputed issues of fact. Its decision is not appealable. <em>(Matter of Towne </em>v. <em>Sherk, </em>256 App. Div. 938; <em>Matter of Scott </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>12 Misc 2d 671; <em>Matter of Heaney </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>286 N.

Greenberg </em>for Caristo Construction Corp., appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT11\">I. There was no dishonesty, immoral or illegal action by petitioner warranting the conclusion that it might not satisfactorily perform its contracts. The board\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>71 N. Y. 527; <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>34 Neb. 129; <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>Kernan, </em>148 Ore. 666.) II. Moral irresponsibility to warrant disqualification must be such as to indicate lack of responsibility in performing contracts. Co'ncededly, there was no such lack here. <em>(Matter of Association for Preservation of Freedom of Choice </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>9 N Y 2d 376.) III. The board\u2019s determination barring petitioner from bidding is arbitrary in that it is based upon conclusions contained in a report of the department of investigation\u2014which the department later conceded to be erroneous \u2014 without any testimony or evidence before it indicating the basis for such conclusions. IV. Petitioner has a property right which entitled it to a hearing before being disqualified from bidding board contracts. <em>(Matter of La France Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>7 Misc 2d 739; <em>Matter of Hecht </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>307 N. Y. 461; <em>Duplex Print. Press Co. </em>v. <em>Deering, </em>254 U. S. 443; <em>Truax </em>v. <em>Corrigan, </em>257 U. S. 312; <em>Erving </em>v. <em>Mayor of City of N. Y., </em>131 N. Y. 133; <em>People ex rel. Coughlin </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>121 N. Y. 631; <em>Interstate Commerce Comm. </em>v. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co., </em>227 U. S. 88; <em>Matter of Perpente </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>293 N. Y. 325; <em>Matter of Heaney </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>286 N. Y. 38; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>304 U. S. 1; <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Cherry Cotton Mills, </em>98 F. 2d 444.) V. The disqualification of petitioner as a means of punishment and not because petitioner was in fact not a qualified bidder was beyond the authority of the board. VI. The facts adduced at the hearing at Special Term were undisputed. There was no substantial evidence to support the findings of the board.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-4\"><em>Leo A. Larkin, Corporation Counsel (Seymour B. Quel, Leon A. Fischel, Fabian Palomino </em>and <em>John L. Radlein </em>of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqOu\">I. The board\u2019s disqualification of the petitioners was proper because their agreement of October, 1959 was illegal and immoral. Since the facts of the agreement were admitted in the pleadings, the petitions should have been dismissed on the papers before the court. <em>(Kuhn </em>v. <em>Buhl, </em>251 Pa. 348; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>35 Barb. 236; <em>City of New York </em>v. <em>Bronx </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>County Trust Co., </em>261 N.

The court at Special Term illegally directed and improperly conducted the hearing. III. The record and the opinion of the court at Special Term established no basis for setting aside the board\u2019s resolution. <em>(Matter of Kaelber </em>v. <em>Sahm, </em>281 App. Div. 980, 305 N. Y. 858; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>223 App. Div. 353; <em>Matter of Mandle </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 N Y 2d 51.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-4\">Chief Judge Desmond.</author>\n<p id=\"AHy\">While we have doubt as to the board\u2019s power permanently to disqualify appellants from bidding on Board of Education specifications and/or contracts, we do not construe the resolution in question as a permanent disqualification, and the Corporation Counsel indicated on the argument that it was not so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Appellants are free at any time to renew their applications for prequalification based upon their past experience and performance with the Board of Education, and such other factors as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The orders should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b573-7\">Van Voorhis, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AnqL\">The determination permanently disqualifying petitioners from bidding on Board of Education contracts was, in my vieAV, arbitrary and capricious for reasons stated at Special Term, and beyond the poAvers of the board. By affirming, the majority of the court is holding, in effect, that petitioners may be disqualified indefinitely but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>permanently. That seems to me to be a distinction without a material difference. Defective work in connection with school buildings has not been laid at their doors. They have performed hundreds of millions of dollars of construction work for the Board of Education over a period of many years without fault being found respecting materials, workmanship or prices. The Board of Education even let contracts to at least one of the petitioners after the occurrence of the incident now being held to disqualify them from bidding. Neither their competence as builders nor their financial responsibility is criticized. The bids interposed on the job in question were the lowest submitted by any competitive bidder. The circumstance that they resolved the conflict resulting from tie bids in the manner in which they did, which may have been illegal, has no relation to preventing them from hereafter bidding on other jobs, which can only result in lessening the competition and increasing the costs of school construction. The orders of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the orders of Special Term reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Burke and Foster concur with Chief Judge Desmond ; Judge Van Voorhis dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In each case: Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
