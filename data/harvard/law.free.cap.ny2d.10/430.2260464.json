The said perjured testimony included testimony which was not only material but was prerequisite, as a matter of law, to sustain the conviction of defendant-appellant, namely, the testimony of Tobias Hanover which purported to corroborate the accomplice testimony of Cooperman and Rose. Defendant-appellant was denied a fair and impartial hearing of his petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>by virtue of the improper and unconstitutional conduct of the District Attorney in intimidatingly interrogating defendant-appellant\u2019s prospective witnesses Hanover and Rose. Thereby defendant-appellant was denied due process of law in violation of the Constitution of this State and of the United States. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledwon, </em>153 N.

The People\u2019s failure at the 1938 criminal trial to produce Bose\u2019s statements, dated May 25,1937, June 4, 1937, and March 5,1938, amounted to a suppression thereof affecting defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>9 N Y 2d 286; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N.
