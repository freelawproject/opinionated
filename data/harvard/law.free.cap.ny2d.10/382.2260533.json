The qualifications of the police officer were not sufficiently established to warrant the trial court to accept her testimony as an expert in the case at bar. III. The statute conferring exclusive jurisdiction to a Magistrate, in offenses of the grade of misdemeanor, is unconstitutional. IV. The People failed to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-7\">Burke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARu\">The issues presented on this appeal involve the construction of section 975 of the Penal Law and the constitutionality of section 102-a of article VII of the New York City Criminal Courts Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Defendant was arrested for a violation of section <em>975 of </em>the Penal Law\u2014possession of comptroller\u2019s ribbons used in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>operation of the game called \u201c policy \u201d. After a trial in New York City Magistrates\u2019 Court, he was found guilty of possession of materials \u201c used in carrying on, promoting or playing the game commonly called 1 policy \u2019 On appeal, the Appellate Part of the Court of Special Sessions reversed the judgment and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Defendant contends that the complaint was too broad in its scope to fairly apprise him of the charge, that a violation of section 975 of the Penal Law can only be proven by evidence of possession of material used in the actual wagering on the game of \u201c policy\u201d, and that the statute conferring jurisdiction over gambling offenses on the Magistrates\u2019 Court of the City of New York is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Although the heading of the complaint stated \u201c Possession of Policy Slips \u201d, the body of the complaint charged defendant with possession \u201c of a writing, paper, and document <em>representing and being a record </em>of any chance, share [etc.] \u201d, It further specified that defendant had in his possession 5 comptroller\u2019s ribbons. There was no charge that defendant possessed policy slips. Clearly, defendant knew that he was being charged with possession of the comptroller\u2019s ribbons, and that such possession violated section 975 of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We find that the complaint informed the defendant \u201c of the nature of the charge against him and of the act constituting it \u201d, and enabled him to prepare for trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacoby, </em>304 N. Y. 33.) Here the information, although closely following the words of the statute, is sufficient as it is \u201c enough detailed in describing the crime \u201d. <em>(People ex rel. Guido </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>9 N Y 2d 77, 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(232 App. Div. 186) is of no avail to defendant. The information in that case charged the defendant with possession of \u201c a certain writing, paper, document, record and policy slip \u201d. There is no indication that the information there spelled out exactly what it was in the defendant\u2019s possession that violated the statute. In this case the information distinctly specifies comptroller\u2019s ribbons, thereby limiting the crime charged to be a violation of the latter part of section 975 \u2014 possession of materials used in the operation of policy. Section 975 provides for two separate crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>and a person can be found guilty of one without being guilty of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Peck </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Muste </em>(7 N Y 2d 76) we decided the remaining issue of jurisdiction. Although that situation involved a specific misdemeanor under an emergency statute, the scope of our decision transcended the narrow factual situation. In holding that the Legislature could constitutionally vest the Magistrates\u2019 Courts in the City of New York with jurisdiction over a misdemeanor, we necessarily concluded that these courts are \u201cinferior local courts of similar character\u201d within the meaning of section 18 of article VI of the New York Constitution. Since this same section authorizes the Legislature to grant such courts jurisdiction over misdemeanors as it sees fit and that such misdemeanors may be tried without a jury, it is not unconstitutional for the Magistrates\u2019 Courts in the City of New York to have jurisdiction over such misdemeanors as are determined by the Legislature. That a defendant is deprived of the right to move for a certificate of indictment under section 31 of article LEI of the New York City Criminal Courts Act, because the Legislature gave the New York City Magistrates\u2019 Court jurisdiction over gambling offenses, may very well be true \u2014 especially where the intent of the Legislature appears to be to speed up the judicial process in the case of such offenses. But these considerations do not make an act of the Legislature unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The order of the Appellate Part should be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Van Voorhis and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Order reversed and a new trial ordered. ;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
