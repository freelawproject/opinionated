Insofar as pertinent, that provision recites that \u201c The accumulation of benefit rights by a claimant shall be suspended during a period of seven consecutive weeks beginning with the day after he lost his employment because of a strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which he was employed \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The employer, National Airlines, Inc., operates an airline for the transportation of passengers, cargo and mail between New York and a number of other cities, many of them in the South. Maintaining its principal office in Miami, it operates branch offices at each station on its route and, in the New York City area, at La Guardia and Idlewild Airports and several places in Manhattan. National also maintains a facility employing mechanics and cleaners at a hangar at the Idlewild Airport. The claimants in this case are the ticket agents, reservation clerks and baggage clerks employed in Manhattan\u2014all of whom are for convenience referred to as \u201c clerks \u2019 \u2019 \u2014 and the airplane mechanics and cleaners employed at the Idlewild hangar.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The clerks were represented by one union, the Airline Agents Association, International, the hangar personnel by another and separate labor organization, the International Association of Machinists, AFL-CIO. The industrial controversy, involving only the Airline Agents Association and National, originated as follows. On April 1, 1957, the collective bargaining agreement between National and the Association expired. Negotiations for a renewal of the agreement were carried on over a period of several months but without success. On September 18 and 19, 1958, without the authorization of the union, a number of the clerks employed in the Idlewild office discontinued or failed to report for work. Between September 20 and 22, other members of the Association employed at several of National\u2019s southern offices also stopped work.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">During this brief period (from September 18 to September 23), however, National continued to operate its ticket office at Idle-wild with supervisory personnel; its Manhattan ticket offices, as well as the hangar at Idlewild, continued to operate with their regular personnel. \u2022 On September 23, however, National discontinued all of its operations and, with certain exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>not here relevant, furloughed all of its personnel, including the clerks in the Manhattan offices and the hangar employees at Idlewild.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Thereupon, the Idlewild clerks, the instigators of the walkout, the Manhattan clerks and the hangar employees filed their respective claims for unemployment compensation. The Industrial Commissioner denied benefits to all of the claimants for a seven-week period on the ground that an \u2018' industrial controversy \u2019 \u2019 existed within the \u2018 \u2018 establishment \u2019 \u2019 of the employer within the meaning of section 592, subdivision 1. The Unemployment Insurance Referee and, thereafter, the Appeal Board overruled the Commissioner with respect to the Manhattan clerks. The Appellate Division modified the board\u2019s decision by granting benefits not only to the Manhattan clerks but to the Idlewild mechanics and cleaners as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Before the suspension provision may be invoked under section 592, it must appear, first, that the claimant lost his employment \u201c because of a strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy \u201d and, second, that such strike or other industrial controversy occurred \u201c in the establishment in which he was employed \u201d. As to the first element, the claimants employed at the Idlewild hangar and those employed at the Manhattan offices seek to establish that their loss of employment did not take place \u20181 because of a strike * * * or other industrial controversy \u201d involving the Idlewild clerks, but resulted rather from the employee stoppages at National\u2019s southern offices. It may not be disputed that the industrial controversy involved originated with the Idlewild clerks\u2019 refusal to work. Their continued absence from work was clearly a contributing factor in the ultimate layoff of claimants and, for purposes of this decision, it is unnecessary to determine whether the layoff of the claimants resulted solely from that walkout. At least one of the causes underlying the claimants\u2019 loss of employment was the industrial controversy involving the Idlewild clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The first element being established, we turn to a consideration of the second: are the Manhattan offices and the Idlewild hangar facilities within the same \u2018 \u2018 establishment \u2019 \u2019 as the Idlewild office <em>1 </em>Although both appellants seek to reverse the order of the Appellate Division, each urges different grounds to support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>position. The Industrial Commissioner argues that the phrase <em>\u201c </em>containing the word <em>\u2018 establishment </em>\u2019 should be given a definition of sufficient breadth to include employees whose continuance at their jobs has become useless, or economically wasteful, while the strike lasts, and \u2018 <em>because of </em>\u2019 it \u2019 \u2019. The employer argues that, since the airline operations are of necessity integrated for the purpose of reserving and selling airplane space and ultimately furnishing transportation, each <em>\u201c </em>station \u201d \u2014 that is, each metropolitan area in which the airline has facilities \u25a0\u2014constitutes a single establishment. As opposed to these contentions, the claimants maintain that the term \u201c establishment \u201d is to be construed in spatial or geographic terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">To adopt the broad interpretation advanced by the Commissioner would obliterate the carefully delineated distinction which the statute seeks to draw between the phrase \u2018 \u2018 in the establishment in which [the claimant] was employed \u2019 \u2019 and the phrase \u20181 because of a strike \u2019 \u2019. Under his construction, one or the other of the two tests for a suspension of benefits would become superfluous. Manifestly, therefore, the statutory language itself requires rejection of this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The employer\u2019s argument that each station constituted a single establishment must also fail. Essentially, it is the contention which was advanced in <em>Matter of Machcinski (Ford Motor </em>Co.\u2014 <em>Corsi) </em>(277 App. Div. 634, 643), and there rejected on the ground that the word \u201c establishment\u201d as used in the statute means the <em>\u201c </em>place where the employee was last employed \u201d. In this case, too, the Appellate Division, in rejecting the contention and in concluding that the Manhattan offices, the Idlewild office and the Idlewild hangar were separate establishments, reasoned that the Legislature \u2018 \u2018 did not mean by \u2018 establishment \u2019 the whole compass of a large employer\u2019s business institution where it operates in differently localized components. The word \u2018 establishment \u2019 has strong local connotations \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Although the statute furnishes no definitive answer as to whether the term <em>\u201c </em>establishment \u201d is to be given an all-encompassing meaning equated with \u201c enterprise \u201d or a more limited spatial meaning equated with <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 place \u2019 \u2019 and although the dictionary provides definitions which fit either alternative, we deem it indicated that \u20181 establishment \u201d is to be equated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>place or situs. The Unemployment Insurance Law is a remedial statute designed to protect the wage earner from, the hazards of unemployment by providing money benefits to individuals \u201cunemployed through no fault of their own \u201d (Labor Law, \u00a7 501). Conversely, only claimants who are unemployed through fault of their own \u2014 such as employees who voluntarily quit their jobs or who refuse employment without good cause or who are discharged for misconduct \u2014 are denied benefits under the statute (\u00a7\u00a7 593, 594).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Subdivision 1 of section 592, constituting the only exception to this statutory tenet, represents this State\u2019s reconciliation of the purposes of unemployment insurance with the principle of governmental neutrality, a principle which runs through all labor relations laws. In the interest of preserving that neutrality between a contesting employer and employees and irrespective of individual need, that provision withdraws benefits under certain limited circumstances there spelled out. The State must stand aside, at least during the early stages of an industrial controversy, and thereby avoid the imputation that a dispute may be financed through unemployment insurance benefits. (See <em>Matter of Burger </em>[Corsi], 277 App. Div. 234, 236, affd. 303 N. Y. 654.) The exception, the suspension of benefits otherwise provided for, must be narrowly construed to effectuate the broad humanitarian objectives sought to be achieved by the statute. So read, it is evident that the term \u2018 \u2018 establishment \u201d is to be defined in geographic terms rather than in terms of corporate organization or exercise of management powers and functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">This conclusion is confirmed by reference to the manifest design of the Legislature to provide a rule which may be expeditiously applied. Suspension under section 592 demands proof neither of individual participation in or financial aid to the industrial controversy nor interest in its outcome. Suspension may, perhaps, be invoked even though claimants be separately represented for bargaining purposes. The administrator is thereby spared the need for making either complex or abstract administrative determinations which reference to individual involvement, participation or interest would require. Moreover, the geographic concept of \u2018 \u2018 establishment \u2019 \u2019, looking only to concrete facts, better fits the legislative purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>simplicity of administration than does a concept which would require determinations regarding functional 1 \u2018 interdependence,\u201d \u201cintegration\u201d or \u201centity\u201d. Finally, apart from the fact that the term \u2018 \u2018 establishment \u2019 defined in geographic terms, is more expeditiously interpreted and applied by the Industrial Commissioner, it is more easily understood by both employee and employer, the persons whom it directly involves and affects.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">To construe \u201c establishment\u201d as denoting space or place is also more appropriate to the use of the term in other provisions of the statute. For instance, section 593 (subd. 2, par. [b]) provides that a claimant, who refuses employment because of \u20181 a strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy in the establishment \u201d in which it is offered, shall be deemed to have refused employment for good cause and shall not be denied benefit rights. The broad definition of establishment sought by the employer in this ease would, if applied to the last-mentioned provision, enable employees to reject appropriate employment and still continue to draw unemployment benefits \u2014 a result obviously never intended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In addition to the fact, already noted, that the Appellate Division previously decided that the term \u201cestablishment\u201d is to be interpreted in the geographic rather than in the functional or managerial sense (see <em>Matter of Machcinski [Ford Motor Co. </em>\u2014 Corsi], 277 App. Div. 634, 643-644, supra; <em>Matter of Lasher [Bethlehem Steel Co. </em>\u2014 <em>Corsi], </em>279 App. Div. 505, 507), it is of some relevance that the Legislature has resisted a number of attempts, first initiated shortly after the <em>Machcinslci </em>decision, to amend the statute so as to extend the scope and content of the term \u201c establishment \u201d and the consequent suspension of benefits. (See, e.g., 1953, Assem. Int. No. 1807, Pr. No. 1868; 1957, Assem. Int. No. 3854, Pr. No. 3996; 1959, Assem. Int. No. 3162, Pr. No. 3220; 1960, Assem. Int. No. 2753, Pr..No. 2805; 1961, Sen. Int. No. 2043, Pr. No. 2139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Applying the principles set forth above to the facts in the case before us, there can be no doubt that the clerks in the Idle-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>wild office and the mechanics in the Idlewild hangar, two and a half miles from the terminal building\u2019s ticket facilities, were not employed in the same establishment. And that, of course, is also true of the Manhattan clerks 10 miles away. The fact that they belonged to the same union as the Idlewild clerks is without significance in view of the geographical connotation to be given the term \u2018\u00a3 establishment \u2019 \u2019. In other words, the industrial controversy involving the clerks at the airline\u2019s terminal building at Idlewild did not occur in the same establishment as that in which either the Idlewild mechanics and cleaners or the Manhattan clerks were employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Burke and Foster concur with Judge Fuld; Judges Froessel and Van Voorhis dissent and vote to reverse and to reinstate the determination of the Industrial Commissioner upon the ground that a restricted interpretation of the word &lt;\u00a3 establishment \u201d as used in subdivision 1 of section 592 of the Labor Law was not intended by the Legislature and would operate to defeat the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">. <em>Matter of Curatalo (Catherwood), Matter of Wentworth (Catherwood) </em>and <em>Matter of G\u00edlmartin (Catherwood) (infra, </em>p. 10 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AGy2\">. A glance through the Labor Law discloses that \u201c establishment <em>\u201d </em>is used in a number of provisions other than those in article 18 (e.g., \u00a7 2, subd. 9; \u00a7 2, subd. 11; \u00a7 376; \u00a7 391, subd. 1; \u00a7 661) and that in each, instance the term unquestionably connotes \u201cplace\u201d or \u201cgeographic situs\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
