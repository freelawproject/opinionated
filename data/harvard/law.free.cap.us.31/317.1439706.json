Arnold, governor, captain-general and commander-in-chief of the state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Be it known that the name \u201cHenry Bowen,\u201d to the aforesaid written attestation subscribed, is the proper hand writing of Henry Bowen, Esquire, who, at the time of subscribing the same, was secretary of the state aforesaid, duly elected and qualified according to law: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>wherefore, unto his said attestation full faith and credit are to be rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of said state to be affixed, at Providence, this seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and of independence the fifty-sixth.

It is evidence of local law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-9\">Mr Justice Thompson. The paper is evidence of the dates of the laws, but it is otherwise inadmissible. If it is offered as evidence of a custom in Rhode Island, it should have been laid before the jury, by whom the question whether such was the custom should have been decided. The facts stated in the certificate cannot be inquired into by this court in this form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-10\">Mr Justice Story. It is incompetent evidence. The laws must be produced to show what they are, and their dates. They may be certified by the officer.

That an attachment had been issued against the real estate of the deceased in Newport, and against^ his heirs and devisees by one of. the creditors, for money alleged to he due to. him, and a judgment obtained thereon.

They were private - acts; and if they are to be given in evidence, it would be necessary and proper for the plaintiffs to have an opportunity to examine into the. facts of the cases to which the laws refer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-8\">Mr Wirt, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afk\">contended, that the evidence was legal. There is no written constitution'in Rhode Island, and the proceedings now offered'.are adduced to show the law and practice of ihe state by her highest tribunal, in the full and undoubted exercise of the powers entrusted to it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The judges having severally expressed their opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"ANR2\">Mr Chief Justice Marshall</author>\n<p id=\"AqB\">said, the evidence objected to is-' understood to be offered to prove that certain proceedings have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>been had at different, times in the legislature of Rhode Island, on private petitions of a similar nature with that before the court; and that there haye been certain usages and proceedings in the legislature of Rhode Island, in regard to th'e administration and sale of the estates of deceased persons for their debts, which will establish, that it has for a long period by usage, and rightfully, exercised the authority contended for by the defendant. The public laws of a state may without question be read in this court; and the exercise of any authority which they contain, may be deduced historically from them: but private laws, and special proceedings of the character spoken of, are governed by a different rule. They are matters of fact, to be -proved as such in the ordinary manner. This court cannot go into an inquiry as to the existence of such facts upon a writ of error, if they are not found on the record. The evidence, if not objected to, might have been heard; but since it is controverted, the matter of fact must be ascertained in the circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-5\">Mr Justice Baldwin dissented.</judges>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">[Upon this decision, the parties consented to remand the cause to the circuit court for further inquiry into the facts.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
