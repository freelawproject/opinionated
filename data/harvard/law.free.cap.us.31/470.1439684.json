Joseph Nourse, Complainant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AiA\">The agent of the treasury of the United States, under the provisions of the. act of congress passed on the 15th of May 1820, entitled \u201c an act for the better organization of the treasury department,\u201d issued a warrant to the marshal of the . district of Columbia, under which the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of J oseph Nourse, late register of the treasury of the United States, were attached for.the sum of eleven thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine dollars and thirteen cents, alleged to be due to the United States upon a settlement of his accounts at the treasury of the United States. Mr Nourse, under the authority of the fourth section of that act, applied to the district judge Of the district of Columbia, for an injunction to stayiproceedings under the warrant, and alleging that a balance was due. to him by the United States, as commissions for the expenditure of large sums of money for the United States, and as a compensation for other duties than those of register of the treasury, in the disbursement of the said sums of money, to which commissions and compensation he claimed to be entitled, according, as he alleged, to the established practice, and by the application to his claims of the same rules which had been applied to other and similar cases in the adjustment-of accounts at the treasury department. The district judge granted an injunction to stay proceedings under the warrant; and the United States having filed an answer to the bill of Mr Nourse, auditors were 'appointed by the district judge to audit and settle the accounts of Mr Nourse with the United States. .The auditors reported the sum of twenty-three thou- ' sand five hundred and eighty-two dollars and seventy-two cents due to Mr Nourse by the United Stales, for extra services rendered to the United States in receiving and disbursing public money. Allowing credit in the audit of the accounts of the sum of eleven thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine dollars and thirteen cents; claimed by the United States, a balance of eleven thousand, eight hundred and thirteen dollars and fifty-nine cents would be due1 <em>to- </em>Mr Nourse. The district judge made a decree that the injunction should be perpetual. The United States appealed to the circuit court; .and the decree for'a perpetual injunction was affirmed in that court. The United States appealed to the supreme court; and on a motion by the appellee to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, it was held that no appeal is given by the act of congress from a decree of the district judge to the circuit court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b478-6\">The special jurisdiction created by the act of congress must be strictly exercised within its provisions; A particular mode is \u25a0 pointed out by which an appeal from the decision of the district judge may be taken by the person against whom proceedings have issued; consequently, it can be taken in no other way.

That the said account is unjust and illegal; and so far from any balance being due thereon to the United States, a considerable balance should have been struck thereon in favour of this complainant, as appears by an account hereto annexed, which he declares is just and true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgqJ\">That, besides his regular duties, as register, established by law, and stated according to the custom and routine of his office as such register, he was, for a long course of years, that is to say, from the year 1790 till his recent dismission from office, dqly employed by the proper department of the government of the United States, in the separate, independent, and wholly extra business of special agent for the disbursement of the contingent funds of the treasury department, and for the Settlement, as such special agent, of all the numerous accounts connected with the disbursement of those funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">. That this distinct branch of duty, which he took upon himself, at jthe special instance and request of the proper department of the government, and \"having competent authority to engage 'him or any other agent in that capacity, and for the performance of those duties, devolved upon him great labour, responsibility, and risk, altogether independent of, and apart from, his proper duties as register, and occupied a great\" portion of his private hours, that is, of those hours, when, according to. the established order and routine of his department, he was altogether .discharged and free from the proper duties appertaining to his office of register, and had his time entirely at his own disposal; but for his employment as special agent as aforesaid. That the extent of the extra labour and responsibility so devolved upon him cannot be adequately described or conceived, without a\" reference to, and inspection of, his books, bank accounts, and vouchers connected with this branch of his employment in the public service; and he there-, fore prays that these documents may be ordered to be produced from the treasury department, and audited in this court: that, besides the great labour and consumption of time induced by this extra employment, he was exposed to considerable pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>cuniary losses, from the ordinary errors that occasionally occur in the accounts of the best accountants, fro'm the multiplicity and minuteness of the various accounts and vouchers to be settled and preserved: that when he undertook this branch of public employment, the precise nature and amount of compensation therefor were not ascertained by any particular stipulation: that, if the government had employed, any indifferent person to perform these duties, without any other precise compensation stipulated beforehand, a reasonable mercantile commission or per centage on the sums disbursed would have resulted to such person, according as well to general usage as to the custom of the treasury department in the like cases. That the usage of the <em>treasury </em>department, and other departments of the government, has invariably been, since the organization of the general government, to allow such commissions or <em>per centage, </em>not only to unofficial persons so employed, but to official persons and clerks of the departments, when such duties were distinct from the stated duties appertaining to their offices and stations, notwithstanding such official persons were in the receipt of fixed salaries for their stated duties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">That, as early as the year 1800, this complainant made out an abstract of his disbursements under these extra agencies, claiming to be allowed a compensation therefor; which original abstract is on file in the treasury department; from whence he prays that it may be produced and audited in this court. That he has duly made out and presented his account to the proper accounting officers of the treasury, charging his commission at the rate of two and one half per cent on the amount of his disbursements, which, if allowed, would, after a full and fair settlement of all his public accounts, leave the United States indebted to him in a balance of nine thousand eight hundred and eighty-six dollars and twenty-four cents; which he has good reason to believe, and does verily think and believe, to be justly and equitably due and owing to him from the United States; as stated in his said annexed account. That the accounting officers of the treasury have altogether rejected and thrown out his said charge, and denied him any manner of compensation for his extra services as such special agent as aforesaid, not upon the ground or pretenc\u00e9 that his charge of commission is too high or unreasonable, if he were entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>any compensation; but that he is not entitled to any compensation whatever for his extra services as such special agent, and pretending that his stated salary as register shall be received as full compensation, not only for his proper duties as register, but for his extra employment and sgryices in the agencies above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">. That the. commissions or per centage so charged by the complainant are not only reasonable and usual in the like cases, but are an inadequate compensation for th,e peculiar labour and responsibility of the complainant in the discharge of the particular employment and' duties for which they are charged:. And this complainant further shows, that he is well advised' <em>by </em>counsel, and believes, that the act of congress under which the said warrant of distress is pretended to have been .issued, being a law in derogation of common right, and of ihe ordinary and approved remedies under the general law of the land, ought to be construed, with the utmost strictness against any authority assumed under it, and in .favour of the citizen; but, that in no reasonable construction of the same, can- this complainant or his accounts, either as register of the treasury, or as the special agent of the treasury, or as the agent of the joint library committees of congress, above described-, be brought within th\u00a1e description of persons over whom that act gives jurisdiction to the agent of the treasury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkY\">By the second and third sections of the said act, the offic\u00e9rs subjected to the summary jurisdiction' and process of such treasury agent \u00e1re distributed into two classes: 1st, those employed to collect and'receive-the public money before it is paid into the treasury; 2dly, those employed to disburse the public mo.ney after it is paid into the treasury, appropriated for the service of the <em>civil, naval, </em>or <em>military departments.</em>There can be no pretence whatever, and he presumes none ife set up, to bring this complainant within the first class;, and, therefore, the \u25a0 only question is, whether he falls within the second.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">This class he is well advised and believes was intended to comprehend none but the <em>regularly appointed officers </em>of the government, charged, fex officio, with disbursements for any of the three great departments named in the act. That this description cannot embrace mere subordinate agents employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>by any particular department of the government, as by the treasury,, to disburse the contingent funds of the department, such agent 'not being an <em>officer </em>who is, ex <em>officio, </em>to disburse the public money appropriated for the service of either of the three great departments named; but, in the strictest sense, a mere unofficial agent, employed informally, \u2019without any letter patent, or commission or letter of appointment, to perform extra services for the treasury as a commission merchant or banker, to make purchases or accept bills on public account, might be employed, without attaching l\u2019o such commission merchant or banker the character of functions of a public <em>officer. </em>Whereas the third section of the act throughout describes the party subjected to the summary process authorised by it, as \u201cany officer employed,\u201d &amp;c.; \u201csuch delinquent officer,\u201d &amp;c.: and as to his office of register of the treasury, which constituted the only <em>official </em>relation between him and the government of the United States, it was not an office, the duties or employment of which consisted in the disbursement of any public money appropriated for the services of any of the three great departments of service named in the third section of the act of congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">Nor did this complainant, <em>as such register, </em>receive or disburse, nor was he competent, as such register, to receive or disburse, any of the public money charged to him in the skid pretended account so settled by the accounting officers of the treasury, and upon which the said warrant of distress was issued as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">Nevertheless, the said accounting officers of the treasury have unjustly and unlawfully charged him, in the settlement of his official account as register, with all the\u2019moneys received by him for disbursement as such special agent as aforesaid; and the whole of the alleged delinquency is charged, to him officially as register, and under that'official head; and against him, officially as register, such warrant was issued. Whereas, his said account for the receipts and disbursements of public money was wholly <em>unofficial, </em>and connected with his official duties and station as register.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">The complainant therefore submits, that, whatever its merit, in the opinion of the court, of the essential dispute on matters of account between him and the accounting officers, the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ties may be remitted to the ordinary process &amp;f law, so as to have a fair trial and regular adjudication of the merits, before execution be had of his body or estate. Therefore, this complainant prays that injunction may be granted to him to stay proceedings on the said warrant altogether; and that he may have such further and other relief in the premises, as to this court shall seem meet, and agreeable to equity and good, conscience.

The act under which the warrant was issued against Mr Nourse, authorises an anomalous proceeding; and as it assumes a penal character, subjecting the party who resists the operation of it to the penalty of ten per cent on the debt, it is to be construed with a strict observance of its provisions. No right of appeal is given, in terms, to the United States; and in all cases under the judiciary acts, when an appeal is given, it is authorised by express provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">In this act the right of appeal is given to the party aggrieved only, and not to the United States: they not being aggrieved, cannot have an appeal; as the language of the law authorises it in favour of the person against whom the warrant has issued, and his appeal is to a judge of the supreme court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">The appeal now before the court has- been taken as if this was the case of an ordinary suit: but this is denied. The decree is not that of a court; the proceeding is before the district judge, .not in his character as composing the district court. The. bill for an injunction maybe preferred to any district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>judge of any district; and is not confined to the district judge of the district where the party resides. The United States are not brought into court. They may not appear. The whole* proceeding is that of a judge, not judicially. The directions of the statute must be pursued: Cited, Bac. Ab. stat. C. 3 Mass. 307. 1 Paine, 406. 6 Dane\u2019s Ab. 593. A new remedy pr new jurisdiction is not to be extended when it is summary. 6 Dane\u2019s Ab. 596. If the decision of the district judge had been against Mr Nourse, he could not have had an appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-6\">All the authority of the- circuit and district courts of the United States is derived from the statutes;, and in the law organizing those courts, no right of appeal in such a case is allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-7\">There is no force in the argument ab inconvenienti, when urged for the United States. The government had a right to proceed in the ordinary course; and by so doing, all the right to have a final judgment in this court upon their claim could have been exercised. But if another mode is chosen, they are bound by it; and it is not a subject of complaint that they must be regulated by the law, the provisions of which they have voluntarily elected to employ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-8\">The decision of this court in the case of Bullock, a case arising in Georgia seven years ago, determined the principle contended for on the part of the appellee. The opinion .of Mr Justice Johnson in that case, which was that no appeal could be taken by the United States from the decision of the district judge, must have been known to the treasury; and it should be considered as having settled the law. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The act under which the warrant was issued against Mr Nourse, is not a judiciary, but a treasury act. It was passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>for certain purposes; and if it does not accomplish those purposes, let there be other legislative provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">The appellate, power of this court is not to be inferred from doubtful expressions in the law. Those who assert the power, are bound to show its existence affirmatively; they must show this, by the express terms of some act of congress. It must be found in the act itself, or in some other law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">The act of congress under which the warrant was issued, gives no appeal expressly \u2014 none by reference or by implication; nor does it give such a proceeding as in its nature supposes an appeal, but exactly the contrary. To establish the right of appeal .under this law, it is necessary to maintain that in every case in which <em>&amp; </em>judge is called upon to act, the right of appeal exists.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">In the very nature of the proceedings there is an inconsist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ency with a right to appeal in the government; and such a right is in opposition to the policy of the law. Th\u00e9 purpose of the law was to give a summary process in cases of extreme urgency; but an appeal would defeat this object, as, if the United States could appeal, so could the defaulter. The act establishes a system of its own; and the court cannot go out of the law for its aid, or to introduce or engraft upon it that which' it does not direct or authorise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-5\">Nor is the right of appeal given in any other act of congress. It is conceded that it does not exist under the judiciary act of 1789; but it has been asserted that it may prevail under the act of 18,03.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-6\">But this position is not correct. The act of 1803 gives no appeal from the district judge, nor does it give an appeal in equity, for the district judge has no equity jurisdiction. When he exercises that jurisdiction, it is as a judge of the circuit court. The appeal from the district judge is given by that act incases of common law, and in admiralty and maritime cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\">But this point has been decided in the case of the United States v. Goodwin, 7 Cranch\u2019s Rep. 108, by which it has been adjudged that the act of 1803 does not apply. Cited also, 2 Peters\u2019s Cond. Rep. 436, and the notes of cases collected there.

A new remedy given by a statute, does not require an express provision for an appeal; this right results from the general power of this court over the inferior courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">Equity jurisdiction-is given to the district judges, and there is incident to this grant of power, all that is required to the completion of ample justice to both the parties. The right to an appeal is necessary to this, or how else shall it be attained. The law is exceedingly special in providing an appeal by the party aggrieved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-10\">It is considered that the district judge proceeded in this case, as a case in the district court; and from that court there was an appeal to the circuit court, and from that court to this court. The question now before this court, is not whether the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>or circuit court had jurisdiction. That question may come up when the argument takes place on the merits, but cannot arise on a motion to dismiss the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">The only question here is, whether this court will take jurisdiction over a decree of the circuit court, when the subject was within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">The original proceedings were on the part of the United States, but those summary proceedings are not now in review. By the filing of the bill, the case has become one in equity, and is to be governed by all the rules of equity proceedings. It ha's become a proceeding by a debtor against the United States; the United States have, by instituting their proceedings under the act, consented to be sued; and the bill filed by Mr Nourse, is for relief from the judgment against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">The district judge could not act in the case but judicially, whether in or out of court. He could not hear the merits out of court, nor could he, but in court, grant or dissolve the injunction. The law contemplates a hearing in court: an issue joined or assumed to be joined; by exempting the United States from answering. This is necessarily implied by directing the proceedings \u00abto be the same as in other cases. \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-8\">All the proceedings after the application for the injunction are judicial, and in court, on a regular proceeding in equity. The power is given to the district judge, for the purpose of stopping the execution; and it is similar to an application for an injunction in any'other case. The words i{,as in other cases,\u201d refer to, and authorise all the ordinary proceedings in a chancery suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">The act of 1803, giving an appeal, extends to decrees in cases like-this. The decree of the district court was a final decree, and was therefore within the general language of that act. It gives an appeal from all final decrees, of a certain amount; and all the powers subsequently given to the district courts, where final decrees are made, are under the influence of that law, and become subject to the revision of the superior courts.

Bullock, referred to its. the arguments, were as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">District of Georgia. In the district court. United States v. <em>A. S. </em>Bullock. Petition, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">This case is brought before me again by a petition in nature of a petition for leave to file a bill of review. In order to a correct understanding of this proceeding it is necessary to observe, that on the 3d September 1822, a warrant ef distress issued from the treasury department against the defendant, stating that he was in arrears and indebted to the United States in a certain sum of money, and directing the marshal of this district to proceed, by levy and sale of the-defendant\u2019s property, and if a deficiency should happen, to arrest his person. While the marshal was proceeding as directed, the defendant filed a bill of complaint before me, and, after consideration, an injunction was allowed, according to the act of congress of 15th May 1820. Upon the hearing of a motion for a dissolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>tion of the injunction, it was found necessary to submit the accounts to auditors, which was done; and their report returned and tiled. The defendant paid the amount adjudged to be due to the United States, and the case there rested. The United States now petition for a re-hearing of the cause, alleging that new and other evidence has been discovered since the hearing, which it was not in their power to produce at that time. The question now before me is, have I now the power and authority to review my own determinations, under the act of congress before mentioned. I must give to that part of the act relating to the case now before \u00a1ne such a construction as it requires, having in view the intention of the legislature. It will be observed, that there was no equity jurisdiction given to the district courts at their organization; but by an act of congress, district judges were allowed to grant injunctions in all cas\u00e9s, which before was confined to supreme court judges; and this authority was very limited. Now it appears to ,me it never was'the meaning or intention of the act of the 16th May 1820, to grant all and unlimited equity powers to district judges; but rather a limited authority to grant or not, dissolve or continue injunctions, in such cases alone as the act contemplates; to grant to complainants a hearing, and adjust according to equity and justice the real balance due the. United States; and direct the warrant of distress to be proceeded on or restrained accordingly: and here I take the power and authority of district j idges cease. But it is said, that the district court is a court of record, and all courts of record are authorised and have power to correct their own errors.</p>\n<p id=\"AGKP\">This is true of common law courts, but not so of the United States courts; they are courts created by statute, their jurisdiction limited and their errors corrected by higher tribunals. And in all cases like the one now before me, individuals are provided for, and if the United States are not, it is because the act itself in this respect is deficient. Congress thought proper to grant this summary mode of proceeding, and it is with courts to pursue it, and take it as they find it. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the petition ought and must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction or authority to proceed in the case. If is to be remarked1, that had I the power to proceed, it is extremely doubtful whether the petitioners bring themselves within the rules prescribed by courts of equity for granting a, bill of review, for the receipt that now seems to have been found was always in the department \u2014 it was about eight years before it was looked for, and then certified to be lost or burnt: \u2014 whether reasonable diligence has been, made use of to search for it, is yet very questionable. It is ordered that the petition be dismissed. J.

To provide for such emergencies, the treasury department is vested with extraordinary and responsible powers; and to guard the rights of the citizens from any abuse by the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>of these powers, a special authority is given to a district-judge of the United States, or one of the judges of this court, to arrest the proceedings by granting an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">' The judge who allows the injunction, may extend it to the whole or a part of the demand of the government, as the equity of the case may require. He may grant such injunction or dissolve it, either in or out of court. As the proceedings on this injunction, in regard to the merits of the case, are to be the same as in other cases of injunction, and may be .had before the judge, out of court, and as the district court possesses no chancery powers, the jurisdiction given by this act must be limited by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">If the party be aggrieved, either by the refusal of the judge to grant the injunction, or by his dissolving ft, an appeal may be allowed to the circuit court, by a judge of the supreme court. As this special mode is pointed out, by which an appeal from the decision of the district judge to the circuit court may be taken, it negatives the right to an appeal in-any other manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Whilst congress seemed disposed to protect the citizen from oppression by the exercise of the extraordinary powers vested in the government under the act of 1830, they were not willing that the proceedings should be arrested, except upon equitable ground. No provision is made in'the act for an appeal by the government; but it is insisted that this right' is secured by the general provisions of the act of 1803.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">By the second section of this act it is provided, \u201c that from all final judgments or decrees in any of the district courts of the United States, an appeal, where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the- sum or value of fifty dollars, shall be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">This act authorises.an appeal from a decree or judgment of the district court, rendered in the ordinary exercise of its jurisdiction, which is limited to cases at law, and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. It may be admitted, that an enlargement of the powers of the district court, by giving a new remedy, would not require a special provision to secure the right of appeal: but if a new jurisdiction be conferred, and a special mode be provided; by which it shall be exercised, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>clear that the remedy, cannot be extended beyond the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">If provision had not been made in the act, allowing an appeal to the aggrieved party, under the sanction of a judge of the supreme court, he could take no appeal from the decision of the district judge. And as there is no provision in the act, authorising an appeal by the government; is it not equally clear that it can .take no appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In judicial proceedings, no exclusive rights are given to the government in this respect over other suitors, except by statutory provisions. From a decision of the district judge, out of court, how could the government appeal to the circuit court. It is no answer to this question, that the decree under consideration was made by the district judge in court. The right to an appeal cannot depend upon this contingency, and the objection to the appeal in one case is as strong as in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The government consents to have the summary proceedings instituted by its officers arrested on certain conditions, and gives a right to the aggrieved party to carry his complaint to the circuit court; but no appeal is provided for, or seems to be contemplated, in behalf of the government. Having submitted itself to the special jurisdiction created by the act, it is as much bound by the decision of the judge as an individual; and can claim no exemption from the decision, by appeal or otherwise, which does not belong equally to the other party, independent of any special provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Having the power to collect in this summary mode the sum-due from an individual, as established by the books of the treasury, the legislature may have considered that the interest of the government would be safe in the hands of the judge, to whom the special jurisdiction is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">It is objected, that in the consideration of this motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, the court cannot look beyond the decree which was made in the circuit court. And that as that court apparently had jurisdiction, this being a chancery proceeding, its jurisdiction can only be questioned, if at all, on the final hearing-</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">In the discussion of the motion, the jurisdiction of the circuit court has been fully investigated on both sides; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>question must be considered as much before the. court as it could be on the final hearing. This being a case in chancery, a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction may involve all objections to the jurisdiction, which may be urged without a consideration of the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">If it clearly appear, that the circuit court bad no jurisdiction in this case, still this court may take jurisdiction, so far as it regards the proceedings had before the circuit court; but those proceedings, being wholly unauthorised, must be annulled or reversed.. This court, however, in such case, can take no further jurisdiction of the cause. They .cannot remand the cause for further proceedings to the circuit court, because that court has no jurisdiction; and they cannot retain the cause here for further proceedings, because, this court can exercise no appellate jurisdiction which is not given to it by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Upon a deliberate consideration of the case, the court are clearly of the opinion, that the special jurisdiction created by the act of 1820, must be strictly exercised within its provisions. A particular mode is provided, by which an appeal from the decision of the district, judge may be taken; consequently, it can be taken in no other way.- No provision is made for an appeal by the government, of course none was intended to be given to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">There is another point of view in which this case may be considered, and which is equally conclusive against the jurisdiction of this court. The jurisdiction of the district court is limited to cases at law, and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. From all decrees over a certain amount, in the latter, appeals may be taken to the circuit' court; but judgments of law must be removed by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In the case of the United States v. Goodwin, reported in 7 Cranch, 108, this court decided, that no writ of error lies to reverse the decision of a circuit court in a civil action, which had been brought to that court from the district court by writ of error. This decision was made under the provision of the twenty-second section of the judiciary act of 1799; which subjects no cause to revision in the supreme court by writ of error that was brought from .the .district to the circuit court, in any other way than by appeal. And as no cause, except of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, could be so appealed, it fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>lowed, under that act, that such cases only, coming from the \u2022district to the circuit court, could be. taken to the supreme court on a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The act of 1803, which provides that, \u201cfrom all final judgments or decrees in any of the district courts, an appeal, where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum or value of fifty dollars, shall be. allowed to the circuit court;\u201d made no alterations in the law of 1789, as it respects appeals to the circuit court, except in reducing the sum- or -matter in controversy from three hundred to fifty dollars, on which such appeals shall be allowed. The above provision had no.reference to a chancery proceeding, as the district court is not vested with chancery powers; and the words, \u201cfinal judgm\u00e9nts or decrees,\u201d refer to judgments and decrees in cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. It therefore follows, that in such cases only, has the law authorised an appeal from the district to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In the second section of the act of 1803, it is also provided, \u201c that from all final judgments or decrees rendered, or to he rendered, in any circuit court, in any cases of equity, of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and of prize or no prize, an appeal, where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum or value of two thousand dollars, shall be allowed to the supreme court.\u201d' This provision, so far modifies the twenty-second section of the act of 1789, as to allow appeals to be taken'from the judgments or decrees of the circuit court in cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; though such causes may have been brought to the circuit court by an appeal from the district court. An appeal is substituted by this act instead of \u00e1 writ of error, to remove' such causes from the circuit to the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">It might have been contended in the case of the United States v. Goodwin, as it has been argued in this case, that as the supreme court had power to revise the judgments of the circuit court, they could not dismiss the writ of error in that case for want of jurisdiction. But they decided, that their jurisdiction was limited to the provisions of the statute; and that as it contained ho provision for the revision in the supreme court by writ of error, of any judgment or decree of the circuit couri, in a cause which had been brought to that court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>from the district courtj except by appeal, they could not sustain the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">If, then, it app\u00e9ars that no provision is made in the general \u00e1ct to authorise an appeal from'the judgment or dfecree of the district court to the circuit court, except in cases of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction; is it not clear, on the principle of the case of the United States ,v. Goodwin, that the appeal cannot be sustained in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">If it be a case in chancery, as denominated by the counsel for the government, no provision is made in the general law for the appeal of such a case from the district to the circuit court</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Whether we look to the general law which regulates appeals, or to the provisions of the act of 1820, which confers the special jurisdiction that was exercised in this case; the want of jurisdiction in the circuit court is equally clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The decree of the circuit court must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
