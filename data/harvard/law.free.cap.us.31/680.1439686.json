The bill stated that the defendant, Cadwallader Wallace, had caused part of the tract to be located, and had obtained a grant for the same; and upon t.he said grant had prosecuted a writ of ejectment against persons in possession of the land under the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b688-8\">The defendant held under a patent, dated April 13, 1824, issued to him in consideration of military services performed by Thomas Parremore to the United States, a captain, for the war, in the Virginia line on continental establishment, and in pursuance of an act of the congress of the United States of the 10th day of August 1790, entitled <em>\u201c </em>an act to enable the officers and soldiers pf the Virginia line on continental establishment to obtain titles to certain lands lying northwest of the river Ohio, between the Little Miami and SciotaN The survey on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the patent was founded, was dated the 17th day of December 1823. In an answer afterwards filed to an amended bill, he says that the complainant has no equitable claim to the land, because tbe entry made by him is based upon a resolution warrant, which is not protected by the act of congress, and cannot therefore be a foundation on which to base a valid entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b689-5\">The pleadings also exhibit other questions as to the nature and validity of the surveys of the land.

That previous to all this, he raised the first company of minutemen on the south side of James river, and was on actual duty at the Great Bridge with his company until his promotion in the continental line. That, since his resignation, he has, on every invasion, been employed against the enemy, and with active and disagreeable commands, with the rank still of colonel in the militia, which he satisfied himself with, though inferior to the rank he held in the army, as he felt the satisfaction of serving his country; and during all this his services in the militia, he never received'a shilling of money of any sort from this state or the continent; notwithstanding, by the act of assembly allowing a bounty of lands to the officers and soldiers, he is precluded from any share, because he did not serve three years in a continued line; that, nevertheless, he is emboldened to request the assembly will allow him <em>a colonel\u2019s allowance of lands, </em>because they have resolved that generals Stephens and Lawson should receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>theirs; and although each of these are general officers of the militia, yet they were only colonels at the same time .with your petitioner, who remained longer in the continental army than either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-5\">In the House of Delegates, Tuesday, the 18th of November 1783:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-6\">Mr Mann Page reported from the committee of propositions and grievances, that the committee had, according to. order, had under their consideration the petition of Josiah Parker, to them referred, and had agreed upon a report, and come to a resolution thereupon, which he read in his place, and after-wards delivered in pt the clerk\u2019s table, where the same was again twice read and agreed to by the house, as foiloweth: It appeal\u2019s to your committee, that in October 1775, the said Josiah Parker was appointed a major of the fifth regiment on continental establishment, in which rank he acted until August 1776, when he was appointed lieutenant-colonel; and in April 1777, he received a full colonel\u2019s commission in the same regiment, and acted in that rank until August 1778, when he resigned.

The warrant issued to Josiah Parker by mistake, and this is a matter to be inquired into by the court. It is shown by the record that both parties claim under the various acts of congress, relative to the grants of lands to officers and soldiers of the Virginia line. The right of the defendant in the state court of Ohio, under that law, has been denied. . Thus the construction of the act of congress is involved in the cas\u00e9, and the court have full jurisdiction over it. By the facts disclosed' in the pleadings and in the exhibits, it is moSfc apparent that the supreme court of Ohio, in deciding the case, were bound to review the statutes of the United States in reference to the subject, and to give a construction to them. The plaintiff in error contends that the court gave an erroneous construction to the act. Cited Hickie v. Starke, 1 Peters, 98; Harris v. Denny, <em>3 </em>Peters, <em>292; </em>Fisher v. Cockrel, 5 Peters, 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-5\">As the warrant to Josiah Parker emanated from the state of Virginia, and was issued by an officer of the state, and the United States have assumed the execution of the laws of Virginia under which the same was granted, the courts of Ohio must have had those laws before them and must have construed them.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-6\">The law of the United States, of August 10, 1790, gives land on the Sciota river to satisfy those who are entitled to land by the law of Virginia, under military warrants. The plaintiff in error contends that the grant to the devisor of the defendant in error was not authorized by the Virginia law. Swann\u2019s Laws of Ohio, 70, 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-7\">It is denied that the title of the defendant in error is protected under the act of congress. In September 1783, congress passed the act proposing the cession of the lands north and west of the Ohio river to the United States; and in October- 1783, the legislature of Virginia acceded to the terms offered by that act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-8\">In May 1779, the-state of Virginia passed the first law relative to the grants of lands for military services. No quantity Was designated by that act. In October 1779, a law was passed regulating the quantity each officer should have. Swann\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Laws, 11. These were the only laws on the subject in force at the time of the cession; and under these laws no one was entitled to a warrant who had not served on the continental establishment three years, or until the end of the war; or who was the legal representative of one who was killed in battle or had died in the service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-5\">Under the act of congress of 1800, state line officers were not entitled to land. And that act expired in three years. If the defendant could avail himself of the provisions of that act, he was bound to show a compliance with its provisions within the three years. The act of 1807 provides for another class of officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-6\">After the cession made by Virginia to the United States, she might provide as she thought proper for her meritorious officers; but that provision could not be made out of the land ceded, unless the officer had served- three years. And the issuing of a patent under the act of 1807 is prohibited under the act of 1807, unless the person applying for it was entitled to a warrant under the laws of Virginia prior to the cession. The warrant to Josiah Parker was issued under a special resolution of the Virginia legislature, was for services of less than three years on the continental establishment, and was authorized in November 1783, after the cession to the United States.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b693-7\">Mr Corwin, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A46\">argued: l: That this court had no jurisdiction of the case on the pleadings and evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9n\">2. That the warrant to Josiah Parker was good and valid, it having issued prior to the transfer of the soil by Virginia to the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-9\">3. The warrant of Parker being in usual form, expressing upon its face legal consideration, and having been issued upon the order and judgment of the proper tribunal authorized to hear and determine such cases, and no appeal or writ of error being allowed from such decision; it cannot be questioned in a collateral way, but must be taken as conclusive evidence of the right of Parker to the warrant. Cited on this point, Ohio Land Laws, 129, 132, 134, 135; Hughes\u2019s Ken. Rep. 46; 2 Bibb, 134; 1 Marshall, 149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-10\">He denied that the construction of an act of congress was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>drawn into question in this case before the courts of Ohio, in deciding on the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-5\">The warrant of the 21st of November 1783 was before the courts of Ohio; and it was not necessary for those courts to look beyond the Virginia laws to decide upon the rights of the complainant there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-6\">But if the warrant to Josiah Parker was a resolution warrant, it was good under the act of congress. The cession by Virginia was made in March 1784, and'the warrant was issued on the 21st of November 1783. The act of congress of 1807 covers all land <em>engaged </em>by the state of Virginia prior to the \u2022cession, not prior to .the preparatory legislation in reference to the cession. All existing rights to lands under the legislature of Virginia were to be satisfied out of the reserved lands. This is clearly one of the, cases included under the act of 1807. That act relates in terms to resolution warrants, and does not relate to warrants under the Virginia law of 1779.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-7\">A resolution is a law within the meaning of this act. No officer entitled to a warrant under the Virginia law of 1779 took a resolution warrant: and the necessity for a warrant arose from the fact that the officer in this case was not entitled under the act of 1807.

S. 171.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b694-8\">Mr Chief Justice Marshall</author>\n<p id=\"A0j\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">This is a writ of error to a decree nronounced by the supreme court of the state of Ohio, sitting in and for the county of Brown, in a case in which the defendant in error was plaintiff. The case must therefore be brought within the twenty-fifth section of the judicial act, or this court cannot take jurisdiction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">The plaintiff in error alleges that the construction of an act of congress was drawn in question on the trial, and that the decision was against the title set up under the act; and- also, that the construction of a state law was drawn in question, as being contrary to art act of congress, and the decision was in favour of the party claiming under the state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Josiah Parker obtained a land warrant from the land office of Virginia, for his services in the Virginia line, on continental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>establishment. The defendant in error having located the warrant on lands in the military reserve, and received a patent therefor, instituted a suit in chancery against the plaintiff in error, who held the same land under a prior grant, and obtained a decree'for a conveyance. This court cannot examine the general merits of the decree. Our inquiries are in this case limited to the question, wnether the record shows that an act of congress has been misconstrued, to the injury of the plaintiff in error, or the title of the defendant in error hasbeen sustained by a law of a state which is repugnant to a law of the United States. Both questions depend on the construction of the act by which Virginia ceded the territory she claimed northwest of the river Ohio to the United States, of the resolution accepting the deed of cession, and of the acts Of congress prolonging the time for completing titles to lands within the Virginia military reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The deed of cession was executed by the members of congress, then representing the state of Virginia, on the 1st of March 1784; in virtue of a power conferred on them by the act of cession, which act it recites. One of the conditions on which the cession is made, is, 1 Laws U. S. p. 474, \u201cthat in case the quantity of good lands on the southeast side of the Ohio,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>which have been reserved by law, for the Virginia troops or continental establishment, should\u201d <em>\u201c </em>prove insufficient for their legal' bounties, the deficiency should be made up to the said, troops, in good lands to be laid off between the rivers Sciota and Little Miamis, on the northwest side of the river Ohio, in such proportions as have been engaged to them by the laws of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The deed was accepted by congress-according to its terms. The act of cession to which the deed refers was passed on the 20th of December 1783.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In his answer to an amended bill filed by the plaintiff in the state court, the defendant says <em>\u201c </em>that if the complainant\u2019s entry do.es contain that certainty and precision which the law requires, in order to constitute a valid entry, yet the complainant has no equitable claim to the lands in question', because, first,' said entry is based upon a resolution warrant, which is not protected by any act of congress; and cannot, therefore, be a foundation' on which to base a valid entry.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The warrant to which the answer refers is in the usual form, and does not purport to have been issued in virtue of a resolution. But the warrant did in fact issue on a resolution which appears in the proceedings in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">It appears that Colonel Josiah Parker presented a petition to the general assembly of Virginia, in which he stated himself to have served two years and ten months in' the Virginia line or continental establishment, after which he- resigned his commission as a colonel in the army. That since his resignation he had been called into service as colonel, commanding a corps of militia, during every invasion of the'state. He prays that the assembly will grant him a colonePs allowance of lands. This petition was referred to a committee, whose report stated the facts, and concluded with the following resolution. <em>\u201c </em>Resolved, that the petition of the said Josiah Parker, praying that he may be allowed the bounty in lands, by law given to a colonel in the continental line, is reasonable. This resolution was approved by the senate, and was passed the 20th of November 1783.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In March 1807, congress passed an act, extending the time for locating Virginia military land warrants, which enacts <em>\u2018 </em>that the officers, and soldiers of the Virginia line or continental establishment, their* heirs or assigns, .entitled to bounty lands within the tract reserved by Virginia, between the little Miami and Sciota rivers, for satisfying the legal bounties to her officers and soldiers' upon continental establishment, shall be allowed a further time,\u201d &amp;c. This act was continued by subsequent acts, so as to be in forc\u00e9 when the survey was made under which the complainant in the state court obtained his decree. Does'the act cover his case?</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We think it extends to every case which comes within the reservation made by Virginia in her act of cession. The deficiency of good lands on the southeast of the river Ohio, having been admitted by congress, the inquiry is, whether th\u00e9 warrant granted to Josiah Parker is among those for which the reserve on the northwestern side of that river was made?</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The. resolution grants the land to Josiah Parker as a colonel in the continental line. At the time it was passed, Virginia possessed the territory in which it was located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>absolute sovereignty. The deed of cession had not been executed, nor had the'act been passed by which that deed was authorised. Congress, by accepting the cession, admitted the right to make it, and that right has never since been drawn into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The resolution then gave to Josiah Parker all the right it purported to give. What was that? \u201cThe bounty in lands by law given to a colonel in the continental line.\u201d By this resolution Josiah Parker was placed by the state of Virginia on precisely the same footing with a colonel who claimed under the act which had previously been passed. Had the cession never been made, no distinction could have been taken between them. The officer by whom the warrant was issued, perceived no distinction, and the warrant is expressed to be \u201c for his services for three years as a colonel in the Virginia continental'line.\u201d To discover what services the legislature received as an equivalent for two months of this time, services performed at the head of corps of militia, we must look at the petition and the report of the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">. But the legislature at that time possessed the same power to bestow their bounty on an officer who had performed the services stated in Colonel Parker\u2019s petition, and in the- report of the committee, as on one who had completed his three years in the continental line. They possessed the same. power to \u2022 bestow that bounty on an individual in the form of a resolution, as on their officers, generally, in the-form of an act. The one conferred the same rights as the other, and was equally obligatory on the state. ' Had the lands been retained by Virginia, no distinction could have been made between these claims, and it is impossible to perceive any reason why she should have distinguished between them in the reservation contained in her act of cession. f&gt;o the words of the act set up this distinction?</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">They are \u00abthat in case the quantity of good land on the southeast side of the Ohio, which have been <em>allowed by law </em>for the Virginia troops upon continental establishment, should,\u201d \u201cprove insufficient for their <em>legal </em>bounties, the deficiency should be made up,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">It cannot be doubted that Colonel Parker\u2019s warrant might have been located on the land \u201c reserved by law on the south<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>east side of the Ohio, for the Virginia troops upon continent\u00e1l establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">This reservation is made in general terms. It is not connected with the allotment of specific quantities for specific services. Provisions were, afterwards made for this subject, and those provisions varied at different times. At one time, service was required during the war; by another act three years service entitled the officer to his bounty; and an increased bounty was allowed for those who had served six years and upwards. Officers who resigned after .serving three years, were entitled to the bounty by an act which was passed so late as the year 1782. Particular resolutions were passed after-wards, in favour of officers who were deemed by' the legislature to have performed services as meritorious as if they had remained in the regular army for three years. All these warrants were equally entitled to be s\u00e1lisfied out of the land <em>\u201c </em>reserved. by law on the southeast side of the Ohio for the Virginia troops on continental establishment.\u201d They were equally \u201c <em>legal bounties,\u201d- </em>equally bounties \u201c which had been engaged to them by the laws of Virginia,\u201d before her cession of the territory northwest of the Ohio; for a resolution receiving the assent of both houses, is a law as operative as an act of assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">If, then, under the laws of Ohio, we may consider the petition of Colonel Parker and the report of the committee as part of the record in this cause, the court of Ohio does not appear to us to have misconstrued the act of cession or any, act of congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The decree of the supreme court of the state of Ohio sitting in and for the county of Brown is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, from the supreme court of the state of Ohio, setting in and for the county of Brown, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed by this Court, that the judgment and decree of the said supreme court- in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
