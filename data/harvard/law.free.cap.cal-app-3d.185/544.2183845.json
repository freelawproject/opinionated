J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF2\">Plaintiffs Jennie Green and Thomas J. Flavetta (appellants) appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after demurrers to the first amended complaint were sustained without leave to amend, and from a subsequent order staying all proceedings in the above entitled matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">This dispute is but another chapter in the asbestos litigation that arose between Johns-Manville Products Corporation, Pittsburg, California (hereafter Manville) and some 17,000 individual plaintiffs claiming asbestos-related personal injuries which are being litigated in approximately 12,000 pending lawsuits. The relevant facts leading to the present appeal may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The original action in this case was commenced by appellants against Manville in 1981. Appellant Green, the surviving widow of James Green, brought a wrongful death action against the company, charging that her husband died from the effects of asbestos-related disease he contracted while working at Manville\u2019s Pittsburg plant from 1948 to 1981 (Jennie Green et al. v. Manville Corporation, action No. 233426). Appellant Flavetta, an ex-employee of Manville, brought the action on his own behalf alleging that he was suffering from asbestos-related disease which was aggravated by his employment at the plant (Thomas Flavetta v. Johns-Manville Corporation et al., action No. 219323).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">On August 26, 1982, the Manville companies jointly filed a petition for reorganization under section 301 of the Bankruptcy Code. (11U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq.) Pursuant to its statutory power the bankruptcy court stayed all litigation pending against Manville. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 105, 362.) Four days later, on August 30, 1982, appellants filed the present action against 27 insurance companies who provided primary, as well as excess and reinsurance coverages for Manville. The complaint alleged that the defendant insurance carriers (hereafter respondents) breached their duties owed to appellants under Insurance Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 790.03, and asked for a declaration of said duties. After the trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrers to the complaint with leave to amend, appellants amended their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The first amended complaint filed on April 29, 1983, sought declaratory relief as well as damages specifically pleading breaches of section 790.03, subdivision (h),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> both before and after August 26,1982. Thus, it was alleged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>inter alia, that respondents breached their statutory duty towards appellant third party claimants: (1) by failing to acknowledge and act promptly with respect to appellants\u2019 claims arising under the Manville insurance policies (subd. (h)(2), first and second cause of action); (2) by failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for investigation and processing claims (subd. (h)(3), third and fourth causes of action); (3) by a failure to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time (subd. (h)(4), fifth and sixth causes of action); (4) by a failure to effectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement in good faith (subd. (h)(5), seventh and eighth causes of action); (5) by delaying the investigation or payment of claims (subd. (h)(ll), ninth and tenth causes of action); (6) by failing to settle claims promptly where liability has become clear (subd. (h)(12), eleventh and twelfth causes of action); and (7) by a failure to give a reasonable explanation for the denial of the claim or for the offer of compromise settlement (subd. (h)(13), thirteenth and fourteenth causes of action). Lastly, in the fifteenth and sixteenth causes of action appellants prayed compensatory and punitive damages for the above stated violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Respondents demurred to the first amended complaint claiming that the action at bench was premature inasmuch as the insured\u2019s liability toward appellants has not been determined yet <em>(Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 880 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329]); that the declaratory relief in this case was inappropriate due to an absence of actual controversy between the parties; and that the action was barred by the stay order of the bankruptcy court. The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend and dismissed the action against respondents. Subsequently, the trial court issued an order staying all proceedings pending resolution of both the Manville bankruptcy litigation <em>(Johns-Manville Corporation et al. </em>v. <em>Asbestos Litigation Group etal., </em>Adversary Proceeding No. B 82-6377A, Bankruptcy Court, S.D.N.Y.) and the coordinated insurance coverage litigation in the San Francisco Superior Court <em>(In re Asbestos Insurance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Coverage Cases, </em>Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 1072). Appellants filed a notice of appeal from both the judgment of dismissal and the subsequent stay order. In addition, appellants challenged the validity of the stay order also by a petition for writ of mandate and/or prohibition filed in this court (No. A023986). By an order previously issued, we determined that appellants\u2019 writ petition will be considered together with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred both in sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend and in staying the proceedings. More specifically, appellants claim that the causes of action predicated upon section 790.03 were actionable despite a lack of final judgment against Manville because the bankruptcy proceeding has removed Manville from the civil litigation as effectively as if there had been a settlement or civil judgment in the case. In the alternative, appellants urge that respondents should have been estopped from asserting the absence of final judgment because their own wrongful denial of coverage forced Manville into bankruptcy which, in turn, prevented a conclusion of the underlying action; and that, at any rate, appellants should have been allowed to obtain at least declaratory relief based on equitable grounds. The second prong of appellants\u2019 argument (which is repeated in their writ petition) is that the stay order issued by the trial court is not supported by the bankruptcy court order and, hence, invalid. In their counterargument respondents maintain that the ruling of the trial court was correct in both respects because (1) a third party claimant may not bring an action against the insurer until the insured\u2019s liability has been determined and the action between the claimant and the insured has been concluded <em>(Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 880; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 953 [203 Cal.Rptr. 868]; <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 46 [190 Cal.Rptr. 705]; <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 711 [180 Cal.Rptr. 464]); (2) estoppel as a theory cannot be raised for the first time on appeal <em>(California Teachers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 735 [193 Cal.Rptr. 650]; <em>Roam </em>v. <em>Koop </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 1035 [116 Cal.Rptr. 539]) and in addition, it is unsupportable by the facts of this case <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aetna </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 188 [181 Cal.Rptr. 564]; <em>Muraoka </em>v. <em>Budget Rent-A-Car, Inc. </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 107 [206 Cal.Rptr. 476]); (3) declaratory relief is inappropriate in the present instance since it would be based on a hypothetical contingency, i.e., Manville\u2019s potential liability <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111]), and would address only past wrongs <em>(Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379]; <em>Travers </em>v. <em>Louden </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 926 [62 Cal.Rptr. 654]); and (4) the stay order is supported by both the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>circumstances of the instant case. For the reasons that follow we agree with respondents and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">I. <em>Appellants\u2019 Unfair Claims Practices Action is Premature.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrers on the ground that appellants\u2019 first amended complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 880 and <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 46 (i.e., the action was premature). We believe the ruling of the court is well supported by applicable legal principles and therefore withstands judicial scrutiny on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The controlling case is <em>Royal Globe. </em>Therein plaintiff filed a personal injury action against the food market. He joined the food market\u2019s insurance carrier, Royal Globe, as a party defendant alleging that Royal Globe violated certain provisions of section 790.03, subdivision (h). The Supreme Court held that while a third party claimant may sue the insurer for violating subdivision (h) of section 790.03, the third party\u2019s suit may not be brought until the action between the injured party and the insured is \u201cconcluded.\u201d <em>(Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 884.) The rationale of the court\u2019s decision was spelled out as follows: \u201cunless the trial against the insurer is postponed until <em>the liability of the insured is first determined, </em>the defense of the insured may be seriously hampered by discovery initiated by the injured claimant against the insurer. In addition, damages suffered by the injured party as a result of the insurer\u2019s violation of subdivisions (h)(5) and (h)(14) may best be determined <em>after the conclusion of the action by the third party claimant against the insured. </em>Thus, plaintiff\u2019s claim against defendant was brought prematurely and the trial court should have sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings on that ground. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 892, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Royal Globe </em>has been followed in subsequent decisions, all confirming that an injured party may not institute an action against the insurance carrier under section 790.03 until the liability of the insured has been determined by final judgment or settlement with dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Thus, in <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 711 [180 Cal.Rptr. 464], the injured plaintiff sued the insured and recovered judgment against her at trial. While the insured\u2019s appeal was pending, the plaintiff brought a section 790.03, subdivision (h), action against Nationwide, the insurance carrier, for a failure to settle. In holding that the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>against Nationwide was premature and the demurrer to the complaint should have been sustained for a lack of an actionable wrong, the appellate court pointed out that \u201cthe court\u2019s language in <em>Royal Globe </em>\u2018until the liability of the insured is first determined\u2019 and \u2018after the conclusion of the action by the third party claimant against the insured\u2019 could only have had reference to a final determination and conclusion, a final judgment\u201d (at p. 714) and emphasized that the injured party may not institute a section 790.03 action until a judgment establishing the liability of the insured has been secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 46, the issue was whether the settlement and dismissal of the underlying action against the insured constituted a \u201cconclusion\u201d of the suit within the meaning of <em>Royal Globe. </em>While the appellate court held that a settlement combined with a dismissal satisfied <em>Royal Globe, </em>it has reaffirmed that the conclusion of the underlying action by final judgment or settlement is a legal prerequisite to bringing a section 790.03 action against the insurer. (At p. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The principle that in the absence of final judgment or settlement between the insured and the third party claimant, any action against the insurance carrier is premature and subject to demurrer or other summary disposal is underlined by additional cases as well. For example, in <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Mazon </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 862 [204 Cal.Rptr. 885], the appellate court emphasized that <em>Royal Globe </em>and its progeny \u201chave held that the claimant\u2019s suit against the insurer may follow disposition of his claim against the insured through settlement as well as by final judgment following a trial [citation], but may not be initiated while his action against the insured is on appeal and no final judgment or conclusion has been reached [citation]. Thus, <em>a claimant\u2019s cause of action against the insurer does not accrue </em>until the time that suit may be brought\u2014in other words, <em>until the action between the claimant and the insured has reached a final conclusion.\u201d </em>(At p. 865, italics added.) Similarly, in <em>Muraoka </em>v. <em>Budget Rent-A-Car, Inc., supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d 107, the appellate court underscored that \u201cPlaintiff is precluded from bringing an action against Budget for its alleged bad faith practices in its capacity as an insurer until the conclusion of the underlying action against the insured\u201d and that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s failure to allege such a conclusion prevents him from stating this cause of action.\u201d (At p. 120.) Lastly, in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 881 [199 Cal.Rptr. 835] where the personal injury plaintiff died before the underlying suit was concluded, the court held that the causes of action for unfair claims practices could be asserted only after the estate concluded the tort litigation against the insured. Once again, the court made it emphatic that while a cause of action ordinarily accrues when the wrongful act is done and the obligation or liability arises \u201ca <em>statutory bad faith cause of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>action does not accrue </em>until suit may be brought <em>and such a suit \u2018may not be brought until the action between the injured party and the insured is concluded.,,, </em>(At p. 889, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The cases cited above are dispositive of the present matter. The record at bench reveals that all causes of action alleged by appellants were predicated on various provisions of section 790.03, subdivision (h). Moreover, the first amended complaint to which the demurrers were sustained without leave to amend explicitly stated that the lawsuits brought by appellants against Man-ville were pending in the superior court and that such actions remained unresolved due to the bankruptcy proceeding initiated by the insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In brief, since the facts alleged by appellants reveal that the underlying action against Manville, the insured, has not been brought to a conclusion by either final judgment or settlement, the first amended complaint as a matter of law failed to state a cause of action and was a proper subject to demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e); <em>Heninger </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 830 [221 Cal.Rptr. 303]; <em>Sych </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 321 [220 Cal.Rptr. 692]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 557 [218 Cal.Rptr. 403].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Appellants\u2019 proposition that the initiation of a bankruptcy procedure should be deemed equivalent to the conclusion of the case because it \u201cremoves\u201d the insured indefinitely from the civil litigation, is lacking in both legal and policy support.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The law is firmly settled that in order to bring a section 790.03 action against the insurer, the third party claimant must demonstrate that the underlying suit against the insured has been concluded by either final judgment or settlement which determines the liability of the insured. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>policy reason for this rule is obvious: the insurance carrier\u2019s liability toward a third party is derivative in nature, that is, the insurer cannot be found liable toward third persons unless the insured itself is liable. As concisely stated in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 953, 960: \u201cIt is fundamental that an insurance contract is, by nature, an indemnity contract; no enforceable claim accrues against the insurer until the insured\u2019s liability is in fact established. (See, e.g., Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580, subd. (b)(2); <em>Mathews Cadillac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phoenix of Harford Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 393, 397 [].) Therefore, however well isolated facts may <em>seem </em>to indicate a time when liability had become reasonably clear to the insurer, if the insured had no liability in actual fact, the insurer can have breached no duty to settle a third party claim.\u201d (Original italics.) It follows that the determination of the insured\u2019s liability must be deemed an indispensible precondition to any suit against the insurer both as a matter of logic and legal policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Moreover, it is well demonstrated that the rules relative to the unfair claims practices action remain cogent even if the opportunity to determine the insured\u2019s liability is lost. The case especially in point is <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 953. In <em>Williams, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s husband had been injured in an automobile accident. The injured husband entered into settlement negotiations with Transport Indemnity, defendant\u2019s insurance carrier, but died before the negotiations could be concluded. Prior to his death, Mr. Williams did not initiate any legal action to establish the liability of the insured, neither did his estate bring any action after his death. Plaintiff, the deceased husband\u2019s widow, brought the present action against Transport Indemnity for violation of section 790.03 following the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations, i.e., at a time when action against the insured was already barred. The trial court granted Transport Indemnity\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that there had been no final determination of the insured\u2019s liability which would form the basis of an unfair claims practices suit by the plaintiff. The appellate court affirmed by pointing out that despite the fact that the insured\u2019s liability could no longer be litigated due to the statutory bar, the establishment of such liability was still a necessary requisite to bring a section 790.03 suit against the insurance carrier and that the case brought by the plaintiff \u201cpresents no factual circumstances which raise policy considerations favoring an exception to the foregoing requirement. \u201d (At p. 962.) The idea expressed in <em>Williams </em>is unmistakable: if an entire loss of opportunity to establish the insured\u2019s liability is not sufficient to carve out an exception to the <em>Royal Globe </em>rule, a fortiori, mere temporary delay to bring a claim against the insured (as happened in this case) cannot give rise to an exception either. (See to the same effect, <em>Muraoka </em>v. <em>Budget Rent-A-Car, Inc., supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d 107; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Co., supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 881; <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.3d 711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">II. <em>Appellants Cannot Invoke the Theory of Estoppel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Appellants\u2019 alternative argument that respondents should be es-topped from relying on <em>Royal Globe </em>because the conclusion of the underlying action has been thwarted by respondents\u2019 wrongful conduct in forcing Man-ville into bankruptcy, is also without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">First of all, appellants failed to plead the theory of estoppel and failed to argue that doctrine in the court below, despite the fact that they were allowed to amend their complaint and did, in fact, advance lengthy arguments in opposition to respondents\u2019 demurrers.  It is, of course, well settled that a party who has an opportunity to plead estoppel on which his cause of action or defense is premised must do so, and that an eventual failure to so plead constitutes a waiver of estoppel. <em>(California Teachers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 735, 746; <em>Roam </em>v. <em>Koop, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 1035, 1044.)  It is likewise settled (1) \u201cthat a party to an action may not, for the first time on appeal, change the theory of the cause of action\u201d and (2) \u201cthat issues not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>(Estate of Westerman </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 267, 279 [66 Cal.Rptr. 29, 437 P.2d 517].) The latter rule especially applies to the doctrine of estoppel which constitutes factual elements which must be both pled and proved in the trial court. <em>(Glass </em>v. <em>Benkert </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 322, 329 [95 Cal.Rptr. 735]; see also <em>California Teachers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 746.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Second, axiomatic is also the rule that the theory of estoppel is invoked as a defensive matter to prevent the party estopped from alleging or relying upon some fact or theory that would otherwise permit him to recover something from the party asserting estoppel. <em>(In re Mercantile Guaranty Co. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 346, 354 [69 Cal.Rptr. 361].) Or as frequently stated: \u201cThe doctrine acts defensively only. It operates to prevent one from taking an unfair advantage of another but not to give an unfair advantage of one seeking to invoke the doctrine.\u201d <em>(Peskin </em>v. <em>Phinney </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 632, 636 [6 Cal.Rptr. 389]; accord <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>Volz </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 480, 488 [102 Cal.Rptr. 107]; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Glenmoor Homes, Inc. </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 242, 267 [54 Cal.Rptr. 786].) Appellants here purport to use the doctrine offensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Third, even if assumed arguendo that the theory of estoppel can be raised in this case, appellants still cannot prevail. The doctrine of estoppel by conduct is embodied in Evidence Code section 623 which states: \u201cWhenever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>a party has, by his own statement or conduct, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief, he is not, in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct, permitted to contradict it.\u201d  As the case law explains, four elements are essential to the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury. <em>(Cal. Cigarette Concessions </em>v. <em>City of L. A. </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 865, 869 [3 Cal.Rptr. 675]; <em>Muraoka v. Budget Rent-A-Car, Inc., supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d 107, 116; <em>Transport Clearings\u2014Bay Area </em>v. <em>Simmonds </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 405, 427 [38 Cal.Rptr. 116].) There can be no estoppel where one of these elements is missing. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aetna, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 188, 195; see also 7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Equity, \u00a7 132, p. 5352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Herein appellants have not (and could not have) alleged any facts which would have reflected misrepresentation by respondents or concealment of facts known to respondents, but unknown to appellants. Nor could appellants allege any conduct by respondents which was intended to induce reliance on the part of appellants resulting in injury or prejudice to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellants\u2019 argument that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining respondents\u2019 demurrers without leave to amend because they could have alleged the elements of estoppel and thus could have remedied the defect in the pleading, requires just a brief reply.  While, as a general rule, an amendment to a pleading should be allowed where the defect may be possibly cured by supplying the omitted allegations <em>(Leach </em>v. <em>Drummond Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 362, 368 [192 Cal.Rptr. 650]; <em>Grieves </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 168 [203 Cal.Rptr. 556]), it is well settled that where, as here, there is no reasonable probability that under the undisputed facts and the applicable law the defects in the pleading can be eliminated or cured, it is not an abuse of discretion to sustain a general demurrer without leave to amend. <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Mazon, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d 862, 866; see also <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Streatfield </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 565, 575 [145 Cal.Rptr. 39]; <em>Berkeley Police Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 931, 942-943 [143 Cal.Rptr. 255]; <em>Sackett </em>v. <em>Wyatt </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 592, 603 [108 Cal.Rptr. 219].) This is especially true in the present instance where appellants were given the opportunity to amend their complaint once, but failed to cure the defect or supply the omission in the amended pleading. <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [134 Cal.Rptr. 375, 556 P.2d 737]; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, \u00a7 946, p. 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>III. <em>Declaratory Relief Is Inappropriate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Appellants\u2019 last contention that the first amended complaint stated a cause of action for at least declaratory relief, is also groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure sets forth in pertinent part that \u201cAny person interested under a deed, will or other written instrument, or under a contract, or who desires a declaration of his rights or duties with respect to another, or in respect to, in, over or upon property, or with respect to the location of the natural channel of a watercourse, may, <em>in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal right and duties of the respective parties, </em>bring an original action in the superior court or file a cross-complaint in a pending action in the superior, municipal or justice court for a declaration of his rights and duties in the premises, including a determination of any question of construction or validity arising under such instrument or contract . \u2019 \u2019 (Italics added.)  As the cases spell out the \u2018 \u2018 actual controversy \u2019 \u2019 referred to in the statute is one which \u201cadmits of definitive and conclusive relief by judgment within the field of judicial administration, as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical state of facts. The judgment must decree, not suggest, what the parties may or may not do.\u201d <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of Buenaventura, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 110, 117; <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Gnaizda </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 750, 755 [152 Cal.Rptr. 700].)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In the case at bench appellants have not secured a final determination of Manville\u2019s liability which is central to determining the culpability of respondents, Manville insurers. It is obvious that in the absence of such adjudication no present and actual controversy exists between the parties, and that any eventual declaration of rights and duties would constitute mere advisory opinion based on hypothetical rather than actual, presently existing facts. Since declaratory relief is not available based on speculative and hypothetical contingencies, appellants\u2019 request for declaratory relief must be rejected on this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The case illustrating this point is <em>United Services Automobile Assn. </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1981) 120 Cal. App.3d 963 [174 Cal.Rptr. 835]. In <em>Martin, </em>plaintiff automobile insurer sought a declaration against the insured and the third party claimants of the insured that it was relieved of its duty to defend and indemnify because the insured has failed to cooperate in defending the action. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the first amended complaint and dismissed the action for failure to state an actual and present controversy. The Court of Appeal affirmed by pointing out that the issue of prejudice to the defense of the tort action could not be established while that action was pending. Significantly enough the court stated: \u201cLogically, the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>showing of prejudice cannot be made while the main tort action is still pending, its outcome uncertain, and therefore declaratory relief against the injured persons at this stage is inappropriate.\u201d (At p. 966.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In view of our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrers was proper and must be sustained on appeal, the alternative issue addressing the validity of the stay order has become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The judgment dismissing the action is affirmed. The purported appeal from the stay order is dismissed inasmuch as such order is nonappealable. The petition for writ of mandate, prohibition or other alternative relief (action No. A023986) is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Channell, J., and Sabraw, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Insurance Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Section 790.03 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following are hereby defined as unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance. . . .
