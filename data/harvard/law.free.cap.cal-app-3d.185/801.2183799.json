J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adn\">John W. (appellant) was convicted by a jury of committing a lewd and lascivious act upon a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)) and of engaging in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261.5). The victim in both counts was appellant\u2019s stepdaughter, Leann who was 11 years old at the time the incidents took place. Leann testified that on the night of July 7, 1984, she, her mother and appellant were watching a movie on television when at one point she noticed that appellant had no clothes on. When Leann\u2019s mother left the room to go to the bathroom appellant approached Leann, removed her pajama bottoms and underwear and touched her vagina with his hand. Subsequently, appellant engaged in an act of sexual intercourse with Leann.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Appellant argues that his convictions must be reversed because (1) the trial court erroneously excluded testimony of a psychologist that appellant was not a sexual deviant; (2) the jury was improperly instructed with CALJIC No. 2.03 (4th ed. 1979);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) the jury was improperly instructed with CALJIC No. 2.51. We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">\n<em>Testimony of Psychologist Properly Excluded</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">During trial appellant sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Paul Walker, a psychologist licensed in San Francisco who since 1980 had been in a private practice \u201cpretty well limited to deviant or different forms of sexuality.\u201d Dr. Walker would have stated that based on two examinations of appellant he had \u201cfound no . . . scientific objective data of deviant sexual interest and [could not] recommend any particular form of therapy for his\u2014 for his sexuality.\u201d Defense counsel offered Dr. Walker\u2019s evaluation for the purpose of showing that appellant did not exhibit behavior characteristics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>consistent with persons who are likely to commit sexual crimes against children, and that therefore, the alleged events concerning Leann did not occur.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court excluded this testimony, reasoning that, since reliability of the scientific procedures utilized by Dr. Walker in forming his opinion about appellant\u2019s sexuality had not been adequately established <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]), Dr. Walker\u2019s evaluation could not be admitted to show whether or not the alleged acts took place as Leann claimed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bledsoe </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 236 [203 Cal.Rptr. 450, 681 P.2d 291].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">There were three aspects to Dr. Walker\u2019s examination of appellant. The first was a standard psychological interview, aimed at evaluating appellant\u2019s \u201ccurrent state of function, his emotional style of relating to the interviewer. \u201d The second was the giving of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (the MMPI), a paper and pencil test of 566 true/false questions which \u201cmeasures 15 different aspects of a person\u2019s personality or psychological functioning as well as three other subtests which measure a lie, in case the person is trying to lie, trying to look good, or in some cases people try to look bad.\u201d Finally, on two separate occasions, Dr. Walker administered to appellant an electronic physiological test known as a penile plethysmograph (the physical test).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Dr. Walker described the physical test as follows: \u201cThis is an electronic device that fits over the man\u2019s penis. And he wears it while he views slides of naked women of various ages, one through adulthood. Also [while] he listens to audio tapes. A total of 12 tapes altogether, which vividly describes sexual activity either with an adult or with a child. And there\u2019s various tapes. In some tapes the child\u2019s sexuality is obviously forced. And in others the child is ostensively consenting, as the child doesn\u2019t struggle. And the device measures any changes in the blood flow to the penis, or erection. It can measure erections in percentages, one hundredth of an erection all the way up to a hundred percent of an erection. So it is a physiological measurement of arousal, of sexual arousal, specifically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">It is clear from Dr. Walker\u2019s candid responses to questions posed during cross-examination that he had to have based his opinion that appellant was not a sexual deviant primarily on the results of the physical test. While Dr. Walker stated his belief that the MMPI was a reliable test, he conceded that it had never been \u201cstandardized in a sexual deviant population. \u201d Specifically, he stated that the publishers of the MMPI had not produced any profiles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>that one would expect from a person who is suffering from any sexual deviancy, so that the test is not particularly useful as applied to the topic of deviant sexuality. In that regard, he admitted that \u201cthe main usefulness [of the MMPI] is whether they were honest or not on the test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The primary focus of the trial court\u2019s inquiry into Dr. Walker\u2019s testimony had, therefore, to be the validity of the physical test as a gauge of sexual deviancy.  \u201c [Admissibility of expert testimony based upon the application of a new scientific technique traditionally involves a two-step process: (1) the <em>reliability of the method </em>must be established, usually by expert testimony, and [(]2) the witness furnishing such testimony must be properly <em>qualified as an expert to give an opinion </em>on the subject.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 30 (re: voice print), original italics.) The reliability requirement demands a preliminary showing of general acceptance of the new technique in the relevant scientific community. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This requirement \u201cis not fulfilled merely by evidence that one expert personally believes the challenged procedure is reliable; the court must be able to find that the procedure is generally accepted as reliable by the larger scientific community in which it originated.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shirley </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 18, 54, fn. 32 [181 Cal.Rptr. 243, 641 P.2d 775] (re: hypnosis); see also <em>Kelly, supra, </em>at p. 37.) Finally, it is the proponent of the testimony who has the burden of showing the reliability of the new technique. <em>(Shirley, supra, </em>at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Based upon these standards, there was clearly no acceptable showing in this case that the physical test was a reliable means of diagnosing sexual deviancy. Dr. Walker testified that it is widely used in many diagnostic and treatment centers which involve sexual offenders, but such a statement does not satisfy the \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard demanded by <em>Kelly </em>and its progeny. In fact, Dr. Walker\u2019s testimony about his own experience with the test cast grave doubt upon its inherent reliability. He stated that results obtained at Atascadero State Hospital and other treatment centers show that 80 percent of convicted sex offenders tested showed a positive response to the deviant stimuli for which they were convicted. When asked about the remaining 20 percent, he testified \u201cthey did not turn on to anything about children, but they also did not turn on to anything about the adults, therefore, you are talking about someone who simply is not turned on by pictures and slides and movies, external stimuli.\u201d Walker further testified that appellant was one of the men who fell into this \u201cnon-responsive\u201d category: though he was tested twice, he responded to none of the images contained within the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Following cross-examination, the court asked Dr. Walker, \u201cis there any body of scientific knowledge or opinion supporting the position that based on either of the two kinds of analyses you performed on a defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>you could reliably express an opinion as to whether he did or whether he didn\u2019t do anything?\u201d His response was, \u201cNot that directly, no.\u201d The court further inquired, \u201cIs there a basis of scientific opinion within the community indicating that the absence of response to stimuli is an indicator or predictor of a lack of propensity to engage in deviant behavior?\u201d To this Dr. Walker replied, \u201cNot quite, since you compare someone to the normal and you give them a test, and you either say that they are different from the normal or we fail to detect a difference. ... [11] I know I would not certify as anyone being pure and clean and without a propensity to do an illegal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Based on these comments, the fact that Dr. Walker was the only witness called to testify to the general acceptance of the physical test in the scientific community, the doctor\u2019s likely bias, being a proponent of the new technique (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>17 Cal. 3d at p. 38) and the testimony establishing that fully one-fifth of men given the test had no response at all, there was no error in the trial court\u2019s concluding that Dr. Walker\u2019s opinion testimony based on the results of the physical test was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 219 [266 P.2d 38] to argue that whether or not the results of the physical test were determined to be unreliable, Dr. Walker\u2019s testimony should have been admitted as a matter of law. In <em>Jones, </em>a prosecution for lewd and lascivious acts on a child, the Supreme Court ruled that it was error for the trial court to exclude testimony of a psychiatrist that in his opinion the defendant was not a sexual deviate, because the competency of such testimony was established by the statutory procedure which existed at that time for the determination of sexual psychopathy. Moreover, the <em>Jones </em>court ruled that such testimony could not be excluded on the ground that the psychiatrist had examined the defendant on one of two occasions with the aid of sodium pentathol, even though it conceded that the admissibility of the results of examinations made while a person is subject to \u201ctruth drugs\u201d is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We consider the rule of <em>Jones </em>concerning the competence of expert opinion on sexual psychopathy no longer valid in light of the 1981 repeal of this state\u2019s mentally disordered sex offender statutes. (Former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 6300-6331; see Stats. 1981, ch. 928, \u00a7 2, p. 3485.) Also, we find <em>Jones </em>distinguishable insofar as it rules on the admissibility of unreliable evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The key to understanding the <em>Jones </em>ruling with regard to the competency of psychiatric opinion is recognizing the court\u2019s continual reference to then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>sections 5500 through 5516, dealing with sexual psychopaths. The opinion states: \u201cUnder the Welfare and Institutions Code, a sexual psychopath may be dealt with as a person who is a menace to the health or safety of others. When one is convicted of a sex offense involving a child under 14 years of age and the crime is a felony, there shall be a subsequent proceeding to determine whether the person is a sexual psychopath. (\u00a7 5501, subd. (c); and cf., also, Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5501, subd. (b), providing for a similar procedure where a second offender is convicted of a misdemeanor.) <em>The Legislature has concluded that a person who engaged in such conduct upon one occasion has given probable cause for believing that he is a sexual psychopath. </em>. . . [1f] These statutory provisions concerning those who commit sex offenses <em>clearly state a legislative determination that such a person is more likely to violate [Penal </em>Code] <em>section 288 </em>than one who has no such propensity; to some extent there is a cause and effect relationship.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 224, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The <em>Jones </em>court\u2019s specific ruling with regard to psychiatric testimony was, \u201cThe competency of expert opinion in this field of evidence is <em>established by the statutory procedure </em>for the determination of sexual psychopathy. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5504-5506).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 225, italics added.) As recognized by the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Spigno </em>(1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 279, 287 [319 P.2d 458], this was an extremely narrow holding. The <em>Spigno </em>court emphasized that under former section 5504 the court had to appoint <em>psychiatrists </em>to evaluate a defendant\u2019s sexual psychopathy; therefore, it ruled the <em>psychologist </em>therein fell short of having the necessary qualification or competency to testify as an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>concerning the sexual psychopathy of the defendant. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 288.) Illustrative of what was recognized in <em>Spigno </em>as the special, statutorily recognized competence of psychiatrists to testify about a defendant\u2019s sexual psychopathy is the statement, \u201cIf we assume for the moment that the rule of the <em>Jones </em>case, <em>to the effect that only a psychiatrist can testify in such matters, </em>does not apply, it appears that there ought to have been a showing of <em>at least a semblance of scientific acceptance of the psychologist\u2019s ability to formulate a dependable conclusion </em>under all of the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In citing <em>Jones </em>for the proposition that Dr. Walker\u2019s testimony was admissible as a matter of law, appellant ignores the fact that the statutes from which the Supreme Court derived the competency of such expert testimony in 1954 <em>no longer exist </em>in 1986. While the language of former sections 5504 through 5506 was carried forth substantially in sections 6307 through 6309 (see Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, \u00a7 37, p. 4107), sections 6300 through 6331 (the mentally disordered sex offender statutes) were repealed in 1981. (Stats. 1981, ch. 928, \u00a7 2, p. 3485.)  Contrary to the finding in <em>Jones </em>of a legislative determination that sexual psychopaths were more likely to commit lewd acts against children than persons with no such propensity\u2014 that \u201cto some extent there is a cause and effect relationship\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 224)\u2014\u201cIn repealing the mentally disordered sex offender commitment, the Legislature recognize[d] and declare[d] that <em>the commission of sex offenses is not in itself the product of mental diseases. </em>\u201d (Stats. 1981, ch. 928, \u00a7 4, p. 3486, italics added.) The competency of expert opinion in the field of sexual deviance is no longer established by any statutory procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">While <em>Jones </em>held that the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony was not made inadmissible by the fact that he had made use of an unreliable \u201ctruth drug\u201d in examining the defendant, the court therein expressly found that \u201cthe proffered evidence was not the answers of [the defendant] to certain questions, but the interrogator\u2019s expert analysis of those answers for the purpose of determining whether [the defendant] was a sexual deviate. ...\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 226.)  \u201cWhile in California such statements [made as the result of an unreliable technique] may be used to establish a basis for expert opinion, the cases either state specifically or assume that they are not admissible to prove the truth of the matter therein contained.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blair </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 640, 665 [159 Cal.Rptr. 818, 602 P.2.d 738].) In this case it is clear that the results of the physical test are taken as \u201cstatements\u201d of the examinee\u2019s sexual preference and would have been introduced for the proof of the matter asserted\u2014that appellant had no abnormal sexual impulses. Therefore, Dr. Walker\u2019s opinion as to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>sexuality was inadmissible as the direct product of a legally unreliable scientific technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Channell, J., and Sabraw, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-13\"> All CALJIC instructions referred to are from the fourth edition unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> There was also an offer of proof that Dr. Walker would testify that instances of sexual misconduct do not take place in the manner described by Leann. However, appellant expressly states that he does not challenge on appeal the court\u2019s ruling as it relates to that testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\"> Unless otherwise indicated all statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\"> In 1954 sections 5504 through 5506 read as follows: \u201c5504.
