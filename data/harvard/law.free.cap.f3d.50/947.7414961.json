On appeal, Whitfield challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentencing enhancement to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), based upon its finding that Whitfield used the gun in connection with two burglaries (for which he pleaded guilty in state court). We hold that the district court did not clearly err in making this factual determination; accordingly, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-24\">On October 18,1992, Whitfield burglarized an apartment in Atlanta, and stole a gun. On his way out of the apartment, Whitfield threatened the victim\u2019s neighbor, who inadvertently confronted him, with this weapon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Whitfield attempted to burglarize another apartment. When police officers arrived at the scene, they discovered Whitfield in a chair facing the front door of the second residence. Whitfield\u2019s hands were hidden under a coat that was folded and lying on his lap. While one officer \u201ccovered\u201d Whitfield, the other removed the coat from his lap and unfolded it; a semi-automatic pistol fell out. One of the officers stated, in a written report after the incident, that he believed that Whitfield had specifically positioned himself in front of the door in the hope of ambushing a police officer. Whitfield pleaded guilty to two burglary counts in state court, and was sentenced to concurrent four-year prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">In federal court, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a four-point increase in Whitfield\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which provides for such an adjustment if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d The PSI reasoned that Whitfield used the gun in connection with the state-law burglaries. Whitfield objected, contending that he was simply carrying the gun along with all the other stolen \u201cloot,\u201d and intended to pawn it later in the day. The district court disagreed, specifically finding that \u201cthe weapon was not being carried as part of the loot from a burglary but ha[d] been sequestered and separated from that and was being used as a weapon while committing another crime.\u201d Accordingly, the district court imposed the sentencing adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">The Guidelines do not define the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). This court has never addressed the question, and other circuits, at first glance, appear to disagree on the proper nexus between the weapon and the underlying felony. Some courts hold, by analogy to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-13\">the prosecution will have to make a greater showing than a defendant\u2019s mere possession of a firearm to obtain a section 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. Instead, to the extent that the government relies upon physical possession, it must show that the firearm was possessed in a manner that permits an inference that it facilitated or potentially <em>facilitated </em>\u2014 i.e., had some potential emboldening role in \u2014 a defendant\u2019s felonious conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\"><em>United States v. Ronton, </em>25 F.3d 815, 819 (9th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Other courts apply a more lenient nexus by analogy to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> holding that \u201cthe enhancement is required not only for <em>use, </em>but also simply for <em>possession, of </em>a firearm in connection with another felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1197 n. 19 (5th Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 115 S.Ct. 161, 130 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">It is questionable whether these theoretically distinct standards in fact differ in practice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This case, however, does not require us to choose between the two competing interpretations of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), because the enhancement was proper under <em>either </em>legal standard. <em>See McCabe v. Sharrett, </em>12 F.3d 1558, 1569 (11th Cir.1994) (unnecessary to choose test for evaluating freedom of association claim where result would be the same under both standards).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whatever the applicable legal benchmark, the district court\u2019s <em>factual </em>determination that the weapon was used or possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d the burglaries was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whitfield\u2019s use of the gun to threaten a bystander between the burglaries, his concealment of the gun in his coat at the time of the arrest, and the officer\u2019s averment that Whitfield had apparently positioned himself to fire the weapon at persons coming through the front entrance of the apartment, all plainly evidence both possession of the gun in connection with the burglaries and facilitation of the burglaries by use of the gun. <em>Compare Guerrero, </em>5 F.3d at 873 (defendant possessed firearms \u201cin connection with\u201d a burglary for purposes of similar U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) \u201carmed career criminal\u201d enhancement even where they were not used to commit the burglary, but were instead its fruits; \u201c[p]os-session of firearms obviously increases the <em>danger of violence </em>whether or not such weapons are actually used. If armed burglars encounter the occupants of a home or law enforcement officials, it makes little difference how the burglars obtained their firearms.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the district court did not err in increasing Whitfield\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">. Whitfield also contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) violates the equal protection clause and is beyond the statutory power of the Sentencing Commission. Because Whitfield did not raise these arguments below, we do not address them on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.) (\"Where the district court has offered the opportunity to object and a party is silent or fails to state the grounds for objection, objections to the sentence will be waived for the purposes of appeal ... [absent] manifest injustice.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 906, 111 S.Ct. 275, 112 L.Ed.2d 230 (1990), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v.

Thus, for example, on facts similar to <em>Condren, </em>courts applying the purportedly more stringent \u201cfacilitation\u201d test have reached the same result as did the Fifth Circuit under the more relaxed \"possession\u201d benchmark: a weapon\u2019s physical proximity to narcotics may provide the requisite nexus for underlying drug felony enhancements under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>See Routon, </em>25 F.3d at 816-19; <em>Gomez-Arrellano, </em>5 F.3d at 467. The Fifth Circuit, on the other hand, recently has demonstrated that its supposedly lenient standard is not without some bite. <em>See United States v.
