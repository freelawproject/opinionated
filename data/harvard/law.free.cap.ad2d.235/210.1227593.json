Appellant\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees was properly denied since the stipulation in issue did not provide for recovery thereof and the record does not support appellant\u2019s contention that respondents engaged in frivolous or contumacious conduct. The court also properly determined, without a hearing, that appellant is not entitled to share in the payment made to Ridenhour in settlement of his Federal copyright infringement action, the parties\u2019 stipulation in this action being unambiguous in its preclusion of any such claim, and it being clear that the payment made to Ridenhour did not constitute a license fee.
