Lippincott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Company and A.J. Holman Pension Plan under section 4041 (b) of ERISA (29 USC \u00a7 1341 [b]). The $110,064 funding payment in question was part of the $230,076 funding payment determined by plaintiff\u2019s actuary to be necessary to fully fund the Plan for termination. Thus, it was not an older pre-closing obligation not covered by section 6.3 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We also reject plaintiffs contention that an ambiguity exists because section 6.1 (b) conflicts with section 6.3 (a). The contributions referred to in sections 6.1 (b) and 6.3 (a) are, by their plain terms, separate and distinct. Section 6.1 (b) refers to contributions required to have been made in the past, in the regular course of administering ongoing plans, while section 6.3 (a) refers to acts to be taken in the future to terminate a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We have considered plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.
