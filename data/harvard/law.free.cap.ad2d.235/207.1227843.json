In any event, we find that defendant was not deprived of a fair trial. The prosecutor was entitled to comment on defendant\u2019s intelligence, his demeanor, and whether he was manipulated by the police, in light of defendant\u2019s testimony and comments made by defense counsel <em>(see, People v Williams, </em>178 AD2d 145, <em>lv denied </em>79 NY2d 954). We also note the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes of which he was convicted. Concur\u2014Ellerin, J. P., Wallach, Williams, Tom and Andrias, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
