Smith on the 6th day of December, 1859, from the administrator of Charlotte Clayton\u2019s estate, for which John L.

Clayton, as the guardian of the minor children of Charlotte Clayton, for their benefit and as an advancement to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-8\">On the 11th day of January, 1862, the guardian purchased from John L.

Said 422 acres of land were adjudged by a decree of the district court to be the property of the minor children of Charlotte Clayton.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-9\"><em>A. Haidusec, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">I. The probate court, being a creature of statute' with limited jurisdiction, had no authority to adjudicate upon the equitable title of Charlotte Clayton\u2019s heirs to the said 422 acres of land, in a cause to which they were not made parties. Channel <em>v. </em>Bruly, 45 Tex., 8; Denison <em>v. </em>League, 16 Tex., 400; Allison <em>v. </em>Shilling, 27 Tex., 450; Cannon <em>v. </em>McDaniel, 46 Tex., 304.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>II. The decree of the probate court, based upon the petition of H. M. McKinnon, the guardian of Lucinda, Eveline and Charlotte E. Clayton, is an absolute nullity as regards the rights of H. F. Clayton, because the court did not have jurisdiction over the person of said H. F. Clayton, he having been in no way made a party to said decree, nor to the petition upon which the said decree was based. Channel <em>v. </em>Bruly, 45 Tex., 8; Allison <em>v. </em>Shilling, 27 Tex., 450; Denison <em>v. </em>League, 16 Tex., 400; Morrison <em>v. </em>Loftin, 45 Tex., 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-6\">III. A decree of the probate court confirming the proceedings had in said court under which the land to which Henry F. Clayton, the plaintiff, had an equitable title was sold, and to which proceedings he was not made a party, did not divest the title out of said Henry F. Clayton and vest it in the defendants. Morrison v. Loftin, 45 Tex., 17; Channel <em>v. </em>Bruly, 45 Tex., 8; Allison <em>v. </em>Shilling, 27 Tex., 450; Denison <em>v. </em>League, 16 Tex., 400; Barrett <em>v. </em>Barrett, 31 Tex., 344; Lockhart <em>v. </em>Ward, 45 Tex., 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-7\">TV. Hone of the allegations of said petition disclose that a citation was asked for Henry F. Clayton, nor do they disclose the fact that he was served with notice by pubhcation, as is prescribed by statute in such cases. Pasch. Dig., art. 1351; Littlefield <em>v. </em>Tinsley, 26 Tex., 353; Oliver <em>v. </em>Robertson, 41 Tex., 422; Newland <em>v. </em>Holland, 45 Tex., 588; Millican <em>v. </em>Millican, 24 Tex., 439.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-8\"><em>Teichmuller, Dunn &lt;Sc Meerscheidt, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b221-9\">Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ADe\">1. As this case was tried by the court without a jury, and as we are of opinion that there was competent evidence sufficient to authorize the judgment rendered, it is not necessary to examine the numerous assignments of error to the action of the court in admitting evidence objected to; for in such a case the erroneous admission of evidence would not require a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>versal of the judgment. Melton <em>v. </em>Cobb, 21 Tex., 539; Beaty <em>v. </em>Whitaker, 23 Tex., 526;.Smith <em>v. </em>Hughes, 23 Tex., 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">2. We are of opinion that the appellant, by his guardian, John W. Clayton, was a party to the proceedings of the county court of Fayette county, had in 1868, on the petition of Authora McKinnon, partitioning a part of the estate of Charlotte Clayton; and that the partition then made was valid as to the plaintiff. The petition prayed for citation to \u201cJohn W. Clayton, of Liberty, Texas, as guardian of H. F. Clayton;\u201d the decree ordering partition recites that \u201c the minor Henry F. Clayton appeared by his guardian,\u201d and the decree confirming the partition made by the commissioners directs that \u201c John W. Clayton, guardian of Henry F. Clayton, . . . have and recover for the use and benefit of said Henry F. Clayton,\u201d etc. The court making these decrees must be presumed to have had satisfactory evidence that John W. Clayton was such guardian; and from the recitals it must further be presumed that said guardian appeared either in person or by attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">3. Henry B. Clayton having used means of his son and ward, Henry F., in buying in bis own name the 122 acres of land, he, and those holding under him with notice of that fact, held the legal title subject to the equitable right of Henry F., to so much of the land as had been paid for with his means. But there was evidence sufficient to support a finding of the court that John W. Clayton, the subsequent guardian of Henry F., instead of enforcing this equitable right to. a part of the land, prosecuted a monied demand for the means thus used against the estate of Henry B. Clayton; that to satisfy this and other monied claims established against said estate as liens on the land, said 122 acres were regularly sold under order of court by the administrator; that part of the proceeds was paid over by said administrator to said guardian, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that the land has by repeated sales passed into the hands of purchasers, who .have made large improvements. There is no evidence that the guardian in taking this course acted in bad faith, or even acted improvidently, nor that these purchasers had any notice that the equitable claim of the plaintiff would or could be urged, after this action of his guardian. In this state of the facts, we are of opinion that the plaintiff was bound by the election of his guardian, and that he had no such right to the land as entitled him to disturb the defendants, who were in possession holding the legal title.
