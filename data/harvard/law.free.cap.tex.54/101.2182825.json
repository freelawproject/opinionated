Alienage \u2014 Statutes construed.\u2014The act \u201cto define the civil rights of aliens,\u201d of February 13, 1854, did not in express terms repeal section 9 of the act of March 18, 1848, entitled \u201c An act to regulate descent and distribution of estates,\u201d nor is the former act so directly and irreconcilably opposed to section' 9 of the act of 1848, as to repeal that section by implication.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-15\">3. Alienage\u2014Statutes construed.\u2014The act of February 13,1854, was an affirmative and enlarging statute, which intended to give to aliens such rights and privileges, in addition to those granted by section 9 of the act of 1848, as had been or should be given by the government to which the alien belonged, to citizens of the United States.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-16\">3. Alienage\u2014Statutes construed.\u2014When the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland passed the act of 1870, to the extent that it conferred benefits on citizens of the United States, it was, by virtue of the provisions of our statute of 1854, immediately engrafted upon it, and became the law defining the rights of alien citizens of Great Britain and Ireland to real estate in Texas; section 9 of the act of 1848 was, as to such aliens, so far modified as to change their previous defeasible estate thereby given, into an indefeasible estate.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-18\">4. Alienage\u2014Statutes construed.\u2014The effect of the constitution of the republic, of the act of January 38, 1840, and the act of March 18,1848, upon the subject of alienage, was to vest a defeasible title to real estate in Texas, in the alien children and heirs of a citizen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the United States who may have died intestate, leaving such property; such title was valid against individuals as well as against the state, not only for the period of nine years, but for such further time as might elapse until the state should, by proper proceedings, declare a forfeiture.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-6\">5.

Did a title to real estate in Texas descend and vest in the alien heirs of a citizen of the United States, who died in 1865, said hens being unable to claim under any of the provisions of the act of 1854, defining the civil rights of aliens ?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If a title did so descend and vest in such alien heirs, can they, being still aliens, and subjects of Great Britain, maintain a suit for the recovery of their interest after nine years have elapsed since descent was cast in 1865 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u201cUnder the assumption as stated next above, what are the respective rights of alien and citizen heirs of such an alien heir on whom descent was cast, and who died before the nine years had elapsed; also, of such heirs when such alien heir died after the nine years had elapsed; and, in this connection, will those of the plaintiffs not shown on face of petition to have been aliens at the time descent was thus cast, be considered as having been citizens of the United States at such times ?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u201c4. If a title did not so descend and- vest in the alien heirs of the said Edward Hanrick, can those plaintiffs not shown on face of petition to have been aliens at the time descent was cast, trace their descent through their alien father, who was then living, and maintain this action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\u201cBelcher &amp; Ring,</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">\u201cAttorneys for Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">\u201cE. J. Gurley and Goodrich &amp; Clarkson,</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">\u201cAttorneys for Appellee Edward G. Hanrick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">I. The first point of law for our decision is:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cDid a title to real estate in Texas descend and vest in the alien heirs of a citizen of the United States, who\u2019 died in 1865, said heirs being unable to claim under any of the provisions of the act of 1854, defining the civil rights of aliens ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The determination of this question involves the proper construction of the laws of Texas upon the subject of alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The following extracts embrace all these laws relating directly to this subject:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u201cNo alien shall hold land in Texas, except by title emanating directly from the government of this republic; but if any citizen of this republic shall die intestate or otherwise, his children or heirs shall inherit his estate, and aliens shall have a reasonable time to take possession of and dispose of the same in a manner hereafter to be pointed out by law.\u201d Const, of the Republic, sec. 10, General Provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u201cIn pursuance of the above provisions, an act defining what \u2018 a reasonable time \u2019 should be, was passed January 28, 1840 (Hart. Dig., art. 585), reenacted (Hart. Dig., art. 600; Pasch. Dig., art. 44) March 18, 1848, in section 9 of an act entitled \u2018An act to regulate the descent and distribution of intestates\u2019 estates.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">\u201cSeo. 9. In making title to land by descent, it shall be no bar to a party, that any ancestor through wrhom he derives his descent is, or hath been, an alien; and every alien to whom any land may be devised or may descend, shall have nine years to become a citizen of the republic, and take possession of such land; or shall have nine years to sell the same, before it shall be declared to be forfeited, or before it shall escheat to the government. Pasch. Dig., art. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">\u201cThe following act was passed February 13, 1854: cAn act to define the civil rights of aliens.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">\u201cSeo. 1. Any alien, being a free white person, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>have and. enjoy in the state of Texas such rights as are, or shall be, accorded to American citizens by the laws of the nation to which such alien shall belong, or by treaties of such nation with the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201c Sec. 2. Aliens may take and hold any property, real or personal, in this state, by.devise or descent, from any alien or citizen, in the same manner in which citizens of the United States may take and hold real or personal estate by devise or descent within the country of such alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u201c Sec. 3. Any alien, being a free white person, who shall become a resident of this state, and shall, in conformity with the naturalization laws of the United States, have declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, shall have the right to acquire and hold real estate in this state in the same maimer as if he were a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u201cSec. 4. The ninth section of an act, \u2018An act to regulate the descent and distribution of intestates\u2019 estates,\u2019 approved March eighteenth, eighteen hundred and forty-eight, is hereby repealed so far as the same may be inconsistent with this act; and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\u201d Pasch. Dig., art. 45 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">It will be seen from the above that the introduction of the common law into Texas in 1840 (Pasch. Dig., art. 970) did not bring with it all the common law disabilities of alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The controlling question in the case is this: Did the above act of 1854 so far repeal section 9, act of 1848, as that appellants, Nicholas Hanrick <em>et al., </em>could not by virtue of it- claim title to the lands in controversy, under the agreed case as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The statute of 1854 is an affirmative one, and by long established rules of construction must .be considered as additional to the then existing section 9, act of 1848, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the same subject matter,- and that the latter is not repealed by it, unless this is done in express terms or by necessary implication; Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, 189; 1 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Law (4th ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 175, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The statute of 1854 does not in express terms repeal section 9, act 1848, for it is affirmatively provided that it is repealed so far as inconsistent with the act of 1854, thus clearly evincing the legislative intent that the latter act would be the rule only in certain cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Neither, it is believed, was this section 9 repealed by the statute of 1854 by implication, under old and well established rules of construction governing such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Repeals by implication are not favored, and both statutes will stand, if it be possible to reconcile them.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Justice Wheeler, in Cain <em>v. </em>The State, says: \u201cEven in respect to acts passed at different sessions, although it is clearly settled that statutes may be repealed by implication when their provisions are irreconcilable, \u2018 still (says Sedgwick, p. 127) the leaning of the court is against the doctrine, if it be possible to reconcile the two acts of legislature together.\u2019 So, in Pennsylvania, it is declared that one act of assembly is held to repeal another by implication, only in case of very strong repugnancy or irreconcilable inconsistency. . . . This is the well settled doctrine, and the reason of it is said to be, that laws are presumed to be passed with deliberation, and with a full knowledge of all existing ones on the same subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The court on the following page in the same case says: \u201cThere is no doctrine in relation to the construction of statutes more certainly settled than this, that all acts in relation to the same subject matter are to be taken <em>in pari materia </em>and considered as one act.\u201d 20 Tex., 360; Neill <em>v. </em>Keese, 5 Tex., 32; Cannon <em>v. </em>Vaughn, 12 Tex., 402; Scoby <em>v. </em>Sweat, 28 Tex., 727; Street <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Watts &amp; Serg., 209; Bank <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 Barr, 448; Brown <em>v. </em>Com\u2019rs, 21 Penn. St., 42; Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>monwealth <em>v. </em>Herrick, 6 Cush., 468; Williams <em>v. </em>Potter, 2 Barb. (S. C.), 316; Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">That learned commentator, Mr. Bishop, says: \u201cBut repeals by implication . . . are not favored. Therefore statutes in derogation of the common law, or of a previous express enactment, are to be construed strictly, not operating beyond their words or the clear repugnance of their provisions; that is, the new displaces the old, only as directly and irreconcilably opposed in terms. For when the legislative power professes to add a provision, as it does in the enactment of an affirmative statute, we cannot presume for it an intention also to subtract a provision, while there is any well known rule of interpretation, which, applied to the one or to both, will enable both to stand.\u201d Bishop\u2019s Cr. Law (4th ed.), \u00a7 197. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We are of opinion that the act of 1854 is not so \u201c directly and irreconcilably\u201d opposed to section 9, act of 1848, as that the latter is repealed by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201cThe object and only object of judicial investigation in regard to the construction of doubtful provisions of statute law, is to ascertain the intention of the legislature which framed the statute.\u201d Cain <em>v. </em>The State, 20 Tex., 362, quoting from Sedgwick on Stat. and Const. Law, 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In ascertaining this intention, it is a familiar doctrine that we should look to the circumstances under which the statutes were passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The laws of Texas upon the subject of alienage had their origin in the dark days of her revolution. Unable within herself to resist the despotism of Mexico, her only hope was in the procurement of foreign aid and assistance. As one inducement to obtain this, she incorporated into her organic law that the alien children and heirs of those who should become citizens, and thereby aid in her struggle for existence, should have a reasonable time within which to avail themselves of estates which ordinarily would have escheated to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>That wise policy which then induced immigration and consequent material aid and comfort, was, subsequent to the achievement of her independence, continued, and still continues, for the purpose of the settlement and development of her vast domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In pursuance of this policy, and to meet in a proper spirit the modern, liberal international legislation upon the subject of alienage, the act of 1854 was passed, not, it is believed, in a spirit of retaliation, and to withdraw from citizens of those countries which may not have passed such reciprocal laws as contemplated by that act, the benefits of our previous legislation, but simply to make our legislation conform in the particular case with that of those countries which may also have legislated upon the subject. The act of 1854 did not in terms limit the rights of aliens generally, which previously had been granted by section 9, act of 1848, by restricting them to such rights, <em>and those </em>only, as were or might be granted to citizens of the United States by their government.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On the contrary, it was an affirmative and enlarging statute, and intended to give to aliens such rights and privileges, in addition to those granted by section 9, act of 1848, as had been or should be given by their government to citizens of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">When, therefore, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland passed the act of 18T0, referred to in the agreement of counsel, then, so far as it extended benefits to citizens of the United States, it was, by virtue of the provisions of our statute of 1854, immediately engrafted upon it, and became the law defining the rights of alien citizens of Great Britain and Ireland to real estate in Texas; and section 9, act of 1848, was, as to such aliens, so far modified as to change their previous defeasible estate thereby given into an indefeasible estate. As highly persuasive that this is the proper construction of these two statutes, the five distinguished lawyers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>composed the commission which prepared our present Bevised Statutes, on page 14 of their report to the legislature which received and adopted then* work, say that no change had been made in the law relating to aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The act on this subject thus reported by the commission to the legislature, as declaratory of the then existing law, and the adoption of which, in connection with the report, may be considered in the light of a similar legislative construction, or at least as an expression of the policy of Texas upon this subject, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201cIn making title to land by descent, it shall be no bar to a party that any ancestor through whom he derives his descent from the intestate is, or hath been, an alien; and every alien to whom any land maybe devised or may descend, shall have nine years to become a citizen of the state and take'possession of such land, or shall have nine years to sell the same, before it shall be declared forfeited or shall escheat to the government; <em>provided, </em>that the treaties of the United States with the nation to which such alien may belong do not otherwise direct; <em>and provided further, </em>that aliens may take and hold any property, real or personal, in this state, by devise or descent from any alien or citizen, in the Same manner in which citizens of the United States may take and hold real or personal estate by devise or descent within the country of such alien.\u201d Bevised Statutes, art. 1658. Additional articles reported by commissions on this subject and adopted by the legislature. Bevised Statutes, arts. 9, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the statute of 1854, neither by its express terms nor by a proper construction of its provisions and intention, did so repeal section 9, act of 1848, as to prevent, if they are otherwise entitled, the alien heirs of Edward Hanrick from deriving title by descent under it to real estate in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">II. The second point of law submitted for our decision is:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201cIf a title did so descend and vest in such alien heirs, can they, being still aliens, and subjects of Great Britain, maintain a suit for the recovery of their interests after nine years have elapsed since descent was cast in 1865? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Notwithstanding the tendency of the earlier decisions of this court to the contrary, under its more recent decisions, and those of the supreme court of the United States, the effect of the provision of the constitution of the republic and the statutes of 1840 and 1848 upon the subject of alienage, before quoted, was to vest a defeasible title to real estate in Texas, into the alien children and heirs of a citizen of the United States who may have died intestate, leaving such property; which title was valid, both against individuals and also the state, not only for the period of nine years, but for such further time, until the state by some proper proceedings in the nature of <em>office found, </em>had declared a forfeiture. Sabriego <em>v. </em>White, 30 Tex., 576; Settegast <em>v. </em>Schrimpf, 35 Tex., 323; Andrews <em>v. </em>Spear, 48 Tex., 567; Osterman <em>v. </em>Baldwin, 6 Wall., 116; Airhart <em>v. </em>Massieu, 8 Otto, 491; Phillips <em>v. </em>Moore, 10 Otto, 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">No proceeding has been taken in this case to declare the land forfeited. Prom the date' of the death of Edward Hanrick, in 1865, to the passage of the above act of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1870, nine years had not elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Immediately upon the passage of this act, the defeasible title in the alien heirs of Edward Hanrick was, by the provisions of the act of 1854, changed into an indefeasible title; the same vesting into his heirsyiccording to our statute of descent and distribution in force at the time of descent cast.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">That such is the proper construction is evident from the former decisions of this court upon a kindred question.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">In Cryer <em>v. </em>Andrews, 11 Tex., 170, it is decided that this period of nine years, having been given by special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>law, was not restricted by the general statute of limitations; and further, that as the nine years had not elapsed at the date of the annexation of Texas to the United States, which removed the bar of alienage, that the former defeasible title of Mrs. Cryer, she having been a citizen of Arkansas, was thereby made indefeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">To the same effect are the cases of Wardrup <em>v. </em>Jones, 23 Tex., 489; Lee <em>v. </em>King, 21 Tex., 582; Osterman <em>v. </em>Baldwin, 6 Wall., 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Ill and IV. The decision of the first and second points of law involved virtually disposes of the third and fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In regard to the fourth point, it may be added that section 9, act of 1848, by its express terms,, contemplates that in a proper case descent may be derived through a living alien ancestor. It reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">-\u201cSec. 9. In making title to land by descent, it shall be no bar to a party that any ancestor through whom he derives his descent is, or hath been, an alien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The word ancestor, though ordinarily used to designate a deceased person, does not necessarily imply this. It may refer to one living.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">It is evident that the legislature either used it in the latter sense, or that, in view of alienage, the person through whom the title was derived was considered as <em>civiliter mortuus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Under a statute of Virginia almost literally the same, it has been expressly decided that descent may be cast upon a citizen through a living alien ancestor. 1 R. C. of Va., ch. 9, \u00a7 18, p. 357; Jacksons <em>v. </em>Saunders, 2 Leigh, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The judgment below sustaining the demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 petition is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">[Opinion delivered December 14, 1880.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
