Bell, Elijah M. Bell and Hardy Stricldand. The defendant Elbert M. Bell made no answer, and judgment was rendered against him by default, on the 3d day of November, 1879. Of this judgment the defendant Elbert M. Bell complained. A motion for a new trial was made, which was overruled by the court, and Bell appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">The citation issued on the supplemental petition directed to the sheriff, etc., of Harrison county, commanded him to summon Elbert M.
