D. 1868, Was levied upon the property in controversy, then the assets of the estate of Joseph Pauska in the possession of his executrix without bond (said Fanny), and was sold on the 7th day of April, 1868, when appel- \u201e lant purchased the same and paid his bid, amounting to $435, to the sheriff, and asked to be subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor, Leopold Daus, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>event of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery; praying for a judgment against the plaintiffs below for $435 so paid out by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">The record discloses the further facts that the judgment of Leopold Daus against Joseph Pauska was rendered May 16, 1867, was appealed to supreme court, and that Joseph Pauska died pending the appeal, in 1867; that Fanny Pauska appeared in the supreme court, suggested the death of Joseph, and made herself a party as executrix of his last will and testament; that the judgment was affirmed against the executrix and the sureties on the appeal bond, by the supreme court, the 6th day of February, 1868, and the mandate was filed in the court below the 12th day of March, 1868.

This execution was levied on the land in controversy, and after advertisement, the same was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale April 7, 1868, and purchased by appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">The case, was tried before a jury, and after introducing in evidence the judgment and mandate of the supreme court, the will of Joseph Pauska, appointing his wife, Fanny, independent executrix, and the probate of the will, appellant offered in evidence the execution and return and the sheriff\u2019s deed to him for the land, to which appellees objected on the following grounds: 1st. That no execution could legally issue against the assets of Joseph Pauska, deceased, in the hands of his executrix. 2d. That twelve months had not elapsed from the rendition of the judgment until the issuance of execution, and therefore the execution and all done under it was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The court sustained these objections and excluded the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">Verdict and judgment in favor of appellees for the land, upon their paying to the defendant below, G.

R. Masterson, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-8\">I. The court did not err in excluding the execution issued under the judgment of Leopold Daus against Joseph Pauska, and the levy and return of sheriff on same, because an execution against an estate of a deceased person is unauthorized. Pasch. Dig., art. 1371; Hogue <em>v. </em>Sims, 9 Tex., 548.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-9\">II. The execution issued under the judgment of Leopold Daus was not improperly excluded, because the judgment was not obtained in a suit commenced against an independent executrix, allowing her twelve months within which to plead to same, and twelve months had not expired between final judgment and issuance of execution. Pasch. Dig., art. 1371; Hogue <em>v. </em>Sims, 9 Tex., 548.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-10\">ITT. The court did not err in excluding the deed of A. B. Hall, sheriff, to appellant, dated 7th of April, 1868, because the execution under which the sale was made was illegally issued. The execution was issued and run \u2018against a dead man\u2019s estate. Pasch. Dig., art. 1371; 9 Tex., 548.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b518-11\">Watts, Commissioner.</author>\n<p id=\"AiM\">The statute in force at the time of the rendition of the judgment against Joseph Pauska, the affirmance of the same, and the issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the execution and sale thereunder, prescribes that: \u201cAny person capable of making a will may so provide by his or her will, that no other action shall be had in the county court in relation to the settlement of his or her estate, than the probating and registration of his or her will, and the return of an inventory of the estate; and in all such cases, any person having a debt or claim against said estate m'ay enforce the payment of the same by suit against the executor of said will; and when judgment is recovered against such executor, the execution shall run against the estate of such testator in the hands of such executor; <em>provided, </em>that no such executor shall be required to plead to any suit brought against him for money until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the probate of such will.\u201d Pasch. Dig., 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The record clearly shows that Fanny Pauska was the executrix under the will of Joseph Pauska; that the same was an independent will, coming within the provisions of the above articles. That said will had been duly probated, and that she had qualified as such executrix and had returned an inventory of the property of the estate; and as such executrix she voluntarily appeared before the supreme court, and made herself as such a party, and prosecuted the appeal. In the case of Rogers <em>v. </em>Harrison, 44 Tex., 169, the court held that the property in the hands of such executor is hable to execution in the same manner as any other property which may be administered under a power. It is provided in effect by art. 1371, Paschal\u2019s Digest, that when the supreme court affirms the judgment of the district court, the mandate shall be filed in the court below, and the clerk shall, without further order of the district court, issue execution thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. In this case, the mandate of the supreme court was filed in the district court, and the clerk, without further order of the court, issued the execution thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">There is nothing in article 1371, quoted above, that pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>scribes the form of the judgment in such cases; but it says execution shall run against the property of the estate in the hands of such executor. The provision, that such executor shall not be required to plead to a monied demand until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the probate of the will, does not prohibit such executor from pleading to such demand at any time. And, in our opinion, if he does so appear and plead before the expiration of the twelve months, he thereby waives the statutory privilege, and the judgment rendered against him in such case would be as valid and binding as if he had appeared and pleaded after the expiration of the twelve months. The execution and sheriff\u2019s deed were not void or so irregular as to be subject to collateral attack. In our opinion, the court erred in excluding the testimony, for which the judgment ought to be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u2022 [Opinion delivered March 21, 1881.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
