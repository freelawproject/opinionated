LooMng to the terms of the instrument, the nature of the reservation, and of the estate to be created, and bearing in mind that the court below, acting without a jury, passed upon all questions of fact, we are of opmion that the court did not err in its judgment, if it was based on its opimon that the intention of the maker was that the instrument take effect only on Ms death, and-that it was therefore testamentary in its character. There is ample authority supporting such a construction of similar instruments. Hester <em>v. </em>Young, 2 Kelly, 46; Turner <em>v. </em>Scott, 51 Pa. St., 130; Epperson <em>v. </em>Mills, 19 Tex., 67; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 27 Tex., 344.
