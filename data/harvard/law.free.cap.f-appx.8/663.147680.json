We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We review de novo both dismissals for failure to state a claim and dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Clinton v. Babbitt, </em>180 F.3d 1081, 1086 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Because defendants were sued for actions taken as employees of the IRS, and because the Kriegs sought to remove liens imposed to satisfy a tax deficiency, the district court correctly construed their claims as against the United States. <em>See Gilbert v. DaGrossa, </em>756 F.2d 1455, 1458 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Because the government did not waive sovereign immunity, the district court properly dismissed the Kriegs\u2019 claims against defendants in them official capacities. <em>See id. </em>Because the government did not waive sovereign immunity for claims arising from the collection of taxes, the district court properly dismissed claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), and claims for punitive damages, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Because the collection of taxes does not violate any clearly established right, the district court properly concluded that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Wages v. IRS, </em>915 F.2d 1230,1235 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Because remedies provided by Congress foreclose <em>Bivens </em>claims against IRS agents for violations of constitutional rights arising out of the collection of taxes, the district court did not err by dismissing the Kriegs\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claims for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">The injunctive relief the Kriegs seek is barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, <em>see Elias v. Connett, </em>908 F.2d 521, 523 (9th Cir.1990), and the declaratory relief the Kriegs seek is barred by the exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, <em>see Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 732 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">Because amendment would be futile, the district court did not err by dismissing without leave to amend. <em>See Wages, </em>915 F.2d at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
