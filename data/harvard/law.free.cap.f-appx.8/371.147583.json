Workman alleges that the Tennessee Attorney General and various probation and parole board officials from the State of Tennessee denied his substantive and procedural rights in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tion of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in connection with his request for clemency. The district court denied Workman\u2019s motion for a TRO by order dated March 28, 2001, and denied the motion for stay of execution pending appeal by order dated March 29, 2001. Pending before this Court are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">1. Workman\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s March 28, 2001, order denying his motion for a TRO;</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">2. Workman\u2019s motion for stay of execution pending final resolution of the appeal filed March 29, 2001; and</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">3. Workman\u2019s motion to recall the mandate and stay the execution in case numbers 96-6652 and 00-5367 filed March 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">For the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s March 28, 2001, order denying Workman\u2019s motion for a TRO, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. We also DENY the March 29, 2001, motions for stay of execution pending final resolution of the appeal and to recall the mandate and stay the execution in Case Nos. 96-6652, 00-5367.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
