The district court granted Mamaradlo\u2019s request that she be allowed to surrender herself in June 1997 so that Mamaradlo could arrange for the care of her daughter while she served her sentence. Mamaradlo did not file a direct appeal. Mamaradlo failed to surrender in June 1997 and, instead, remained a fugitive for over two years, until her arrest in Arizona in August 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">More than three years after her conviction became final, Mamaradlo filed the instant motion to vacate her conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. She asserted that she had been denied effective assistance of counsel, because her attorney failed to spend adequate time preparing her case and failed to inform her of the consequences of the plea agreement with the Government. The Government responded that Mamaradlo\u2019s petition was time-barred under the one-year limitation period added to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. The district court agreed with the government, and rejected Mamaradlo\u2019s assertion that equitable tolling applied because she had failed to demonstrate \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d sufficient to warrant tolling. The district court granted a Certificate of Appealability, which stated that \u201cthe issue of whether the circumstances that contributed to petitioner\u2019s delay in filing her motion are extraordinary is \u2018debatable,\u2019 because of petitioner\u2019s decision to abscond after sentence was imposed and judgment entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">We have adopted the doctrine of equitable tolling in the context of AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations provisions. <em>See Smith v. McGinnis, </em>208 F.3d 13, 17 (2d Cir.2000). \u201cIn order to equitably toll the one-year period of limitations, [petitioner] must show that extraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his petition on time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., </em>86 F.3d 8, 12 (2d Cir. 1996)). We have also noted that \u201c[a] petitioner\u2019s own behavior ... may ... fatally undermine his claim that \u2018rare and extraordinary\u2019 or \u2018exceptional\u2019 circumstances warrant equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Valverde v. Stinson, </em>224 F.3d 129, 133 n. 3 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>While the circumstances here are somewhat unusual they certainly did not prevent petitioner from filing her petition. She could have, at any time, surrendered and filed. Therefore, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mamaradlo has failed to demonstrate the requisite extraordinary circumstances, especially given that her own behavior contributed to the late filing of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
