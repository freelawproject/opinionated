A writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy and should be granted only in those extraordinary situations when no other remedy is available. <em>See In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). We find extraordinary circumstances lacking, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>conclude that the petition is an attempt to raise issues that are more properly addressed on direct appeal. Accordingly, we deny the petition and Floyd\u2019s motion for default judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
