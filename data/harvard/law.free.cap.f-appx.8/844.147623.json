The district court sentenced him to a 57-month term of imprisonment. Defendant appeals the district court\u2019s sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">Barrett first asserts that the government breached its promise in the plea agreement to \u201cmake no recommendation regarding sentence\u201d by contesting his factual assertions at the sentencing hearing about the drug quantities involved and by stating, in response to the district court\u2019s inquiry, that the evidence established the amounts of drugs reported in the presentence investigation report. We review <em>de novo </em>a contention that the prosecutor\u2019s statements at sentencing constituted a \u201crecommendation regarding sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondvagon, </em>228 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir.2000). We are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing merely addressed factual information regarding the amount of drugs in issue and were not designed to influence the district court in the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>of the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion. The prosecutor complied with the promise to \u201cmake no recommendation regarding sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1051-52 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Read, </em>778 F.2d 1437, 1441-42 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Barrett also challenges the district court\u2019s sentencing guideline determination on the basis that the district court improperly relied on hearsay statements of his co-conspirators to determine the drug quantities for which he was responsible, in violation of his due process rights. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to rely on hearsay testimony in sentencing. <em>United States v. Valensia, </em>222 F.3d 1173, 1183 (9th Cir. 2000). A district court may rely on hearsay statements \u201cso long as they are accompanied by some minimal indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with the hearsay statements initially made by his co-conspirators concerning drug quantities, Barrett\u2019s own pre-arrest admissions to law enforcement officers concerning the duration of the conspiracy, the number of sources from whom he purchased drugs, the number of drug purchases in which he had engaged, and the average quantities of drugs he typically purchased supported the drug quantities relied upon by the district court. The amount of drugs discovered at Barrett\u2019s residence at the end of the investigation provided additional corroboration. We conclude that the hearsay statements of Barrett\u2019s co-conspirators were accompanied by the requisite indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
