Standard also appeals from the district court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Maes. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332. We have jurisdiction over these timely filed appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-16\">Standard contends that it was entitled to rescind Maes\u2019s supplemental disability insurance policy because Maes made fraudulent misrepresentations in her Medical History Statement (MHS) with the intent to deceive. Standard argues that Maes, an experienced insurance industry professional, knowingly omitted information about her chronic back problem with the intent to induce Standard to issue the policy. Confining its review to the administrative record, the district court found that (1) Maes made no misrepresentations on the MHS, and (2) she did not intend to' deceive Standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">While the district judge\u2019s findings were based solely on the administrative record, \u201cwe have in numerous prior cases held that when a district judge tries a case on a written record without live testimony and makes findings of fact, \u2018we apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule ... in reviewing the judge\u2019s findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kearney v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>175 F.3d 1084, 1095 n. 6 (9th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). \u201c[Rjeview under the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard is significantly deferential, requiring a \u2018defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>nite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Prods, v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust, </em>508 U.S. 602, 623, 113 S.Ct. 2264, 124 L.Ed.2d 539 (1993) (internal citation omitted). Application of the clearly erroneous standard often has real significance and, in this ease, is outcome determinative. That we would have found the facts different had we been sitting as the trier of fact is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The relevant clause of the Standard disability policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">After your insurance has been in effect for two years, no misrepresentation by you, except a fraudulent misrepresentation made with actual intent to deceive, will be used to reduce or deny your claim or to deny the validity of your insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">At issue are Maes\u2019s answers to three questions on the MHS:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">1. Have you had any physical, mental or emotional condition, injury, or sickness in the past five years?</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">2. Have you consulted or been attended by a physician or practitioner for any cause during the past five years?</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">4. Have you ever been treated for, taken prescribed medication for, or been diagnosed as having any of the following</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">D. Arthritis, strained or injured back, slipped disc or any bone, joint or muscle disorder?</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">The MHS instructs applicants to \u201cgive details for any \u2018yes\u2019 answers,\u201d including \u201cDescription of Injuries, Disorders and Operations,\u201d and \u201cPhysicians Consulted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">The record indicates that Maes had suffered persistent and severe back pain for several years prior to filling out the MHS, and that she had consulted an osteopath and chiropractor for diagnosis and treatment. Maes complied by providing her history of chronic back problems on a <em>life </em>insurance application requesting the same information, but omitted this history upon applying for <em>disability </em>insurance. She listed only the flu and pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) in response to questions one and two of the MHS. Second, she omitted any reference to the osteopath and chiropractor she had consulted in spite of the requests for \u201cPhysicians Consulted,\u201d listing only her primary physician. Finally, she represented that the statements contained in the MHS were \u201ctrue and complete to the best of [her] knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">The district court determined that Maes\u2019s omissions did not constitute misrepresentations, justifying her failure to provide the information on the basis of: (1) Maes\u2019s belief that her consistent back problem was not a distinct condition, but rather a symptom of her severe PMS; (2) her listing of her primary physician as the doctor with her complete medical records justified her failure to provide the names of \u201cPhysicians Consulted;\u201d (3) the lack of space on the MHS (although the form encouraged adding a page, if needed); and (4) Maes\u2019s view that her fifty-eight chiropractic visits were a homeopathic remedy, rather than treatment by a physician or practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">While the district judge\u2019s determination may be problematic, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that he was wrong on the facts. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cIf the [trial court\u2019s] account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d). Because we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Maes did not make any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>misrepresentations on the MHS, we need not address her alleged intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Standard next contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting Maes\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We review the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to this ERISA plaintiff for abuse of discretion. <em>See Estate of Shockley v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., </em>130 F.3d 403, 407 (9th Cir.1997). We cannot reverse unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors. <em>See Valley Eng\u2019rs, Inc. v. Electric Eng\u2019g Co., </em>158 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Under the civil enforcement provision of ERISA, a court may \u201cin its discretion ... allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). A five-factor test is applied to determine whether to grant attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 453 (9th Cir.1980). The <em>Hummell </em>factors include: (1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability <em>or </em>bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of fees; (3) whether an award of fees against the opposing parties would deter others from acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions. <em>Id. </em>\u201cNone of the <em>Hummell </em>factors is \u2018necessarily decisive\u2019; various permutations and combinations can support an award of attorney fees.\u201d <em>Paddack v. Morris, </em>783 F.2d 844, 846 (9th Cir.1986). Section 1132(g)(1) provides a \u201clevel playing field;\u201d that is, analysis must \u201cfocus only on the <em>Hummell </em>factors, without favoring one side or the other.\u201d <em>Estate of Shockley, </em>130 F.3d at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The record indicates that the district court evaluated Maes\u2019s claim under some <em>Hummell </em>factors and, based on that evaluation, granted the post-judgment motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. However, the district court\u2019s evaluation is inadequately spare and conclusory. The district court provided analysis for only two factors, and its discussion of one \u2014 the fourth <em>Hummell </em>factor \u2014 appears erroneous. The rest of the court\u2019s evaluation is merely cursory. Further, the <em>amount </em>of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the district court requires support. Therefore, we vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and remand for a proper application of the <em>Hummell </em>test and for a reasoned explanation of the amount awarded. Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AZg\">AFFIRMED IN PART, AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
