Gomez and Ramon Gomez-Martinez each pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. At sentencing, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied their requests for safety-valve relief, finding that neither of them had truthfully provided to the government all of the information he knew about the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan. The Court sentenced Mr. Gomez to five years and ten months (seventy months) imprisonment, and five years supervised release; and Mr. Gomez-Martinez to five years (sixty months) imprisonment, and five years supervised release. On appeal, both of appellants\u2019 attorneys have filed briefs and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Gomez-Martinez has filed a pro se supplemental brief, but Mr. Gomez has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in denying either appellant safety-valve relief. See <em>United States v. Toumier, </em>171 F.3d 645, 647 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review). They did not satisfy their burdens to prove entitlement to such relief, see <em>United States v. Santana, </em>150 F.3d 860, 864 (8th Cir.1998) (defendant\u2019s burden), as they did not present argument or evidence in opposition to the prosecutor\u2019s description at sentencing of how they had not been fully truthful, <em>cf. United States v. Rios, </em>171 F.3d 565, 567 (8th Cir.1999) (no plain error for district court to deny safety-valve relief when government contended at sentencing that defendant had not been truthful, and defendant failed to produce evidence showing that he had been).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Mr. Gomez-Martinez\u2019s pro se arguments, relating to ineffective assistance of trial counsel, should be raised in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings. See <em>United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995) (ineffective-assistance claims are ordinarily deferred to \u00a7 2255 proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and having found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal, we affirm the judgments of the District Court, and we grant counsels\u2019 motions to withdraw. We deny Mr. Gomez-Martinez\u2019s request for substitute appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">. The Honorable William G.
