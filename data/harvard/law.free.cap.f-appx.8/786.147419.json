It is time barred. <em>Wilson v. Gar</em>cia, 471 U.S. 261, 280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1949, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985); <em>Matthews v. Macanas, </em>990 F.2d 467, 468-69 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 340(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>(2) The Federal Tort Claims Act limits tort actions against federal employees acting within the scope of their employment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b). The Attorney General certified that Officer Mohiuddin acted within the scope of her employment. That certification removed Officer Mohiuddin as the defendant and substituted the United States in her place. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d); <em>Ward v. Gordon, </em>999 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Velez contests the certification, claiming Officer Mohiuddin did not act within the scope of her employment. He is wrong. The Attorney General\u2019s certification is \u201cprima facie evidence that a federal employee was acting in the scope of her employment at the time of the incident.\u201d <em>Billings v. United States, </em>57 F.3d 797, 800 (9th Cir.1995). If the certification is contested, the party seeking review bears the burden of refuting the certification by a preponderance of the evidence, although we review the district court\u2019s ultimate decision de novo. <em>Id.; see also Clamor v. United States, </em>240 F.3d 1215, 1216-17 (9th Cir.2001). Velez did not demonstrate that Officer Mohiuddin failed to act within the scope of her employment; indeed, his evidence shows the contrary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Her acts were the obtaining and levying of an entry order. Clearly, those actions were incidents of her job as an IRS officer. Even if they were not perfectly performed, a matter on which we do not opine, under California law they were within the scope of the IRS\u2019s enterprise. <em>See Inter Mountain Mortgage, Inc. v. Sulimen, </em>78 Cal. App.4th 1434, 1441-42, 93 Cal.Rptr.2d 790, 795 (2000); <em>Rita M. v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>187 Cal.App.3d 1453, 1461, 232 Cal.Rptr. 685, 690 (1986); <em>Neal v.
