The BIA found that Quinonez did not establish persecution. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a), as amended by \u00a7 309(c)(4)(A) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we deny the petition for review. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not detail them here except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">The BIA conducted a de novo review; therefore we review the decision of the BIA. <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995). We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if there is reasonable, substantial and probative evidence to support the decision based on the record as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The decision can be reversed only if the evidence presented by Quinonez is \u201cso compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">To establish eligibility for asylum, Quinonez bears the burden of proving that she is a \u201crefugee\u201d and has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). The BIA determined that Quinonez failed to carry her burden of proof because she did not present any corroborating evidence of her testimony, such as copies of police reports or death certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">An expectation of corroborative evidence is justified if the BIA has reason to doubt the alien\u2019s testimony, the corroborative evidence is material and available, and the alien does not have a credible explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>tion for her failure to produce the corroborative evidence. <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000). Here, it was reasonable for the BIA to doubt Quinonez\u2019s testimony due to the material inconsistencies between Quinonez\u2019s application for asylum and her testimony. Quinonez wrote on her application that she was a member of a student \u201cpolitical group\u201d whose purpose was to oppose the Guatemalan government. At her hearing, however, she denied ever being a member of such a group; rather Quinonez testified that she was a member of \u201cYouth for Justice\u201d whose purpose was to obtain higher wages for ranch workers from ranch owners. Also, Quinonez wrote on her application that the police had arrested, detained, and mentally and physically abused her on a few occasions. Quinonez testified at her hearing, however, that she had never been arrested, detained, or abused by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The BIA had substantial reason to believe that Quinonez could have obtained corroborative evidence. Quinonez, who still had family in Guatemala, had over six years prior to her hearing to obtain it. Despite this, Quinonez gave no reasonable explanation for her failure to provide the corroborating evidence. The BIA did not err when it held that Quinonez did not carry her burden of proving a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Because Quinonez has not established eligibility for asylum, she has not met the higher burden of proving that she is entitled to withholding of deportation. <em>Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b805-14\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
