At sentencing the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> departed upward based on presentence report (PSR) statements \u2014 to which Red Cloud did not object \u2014 that he had sexually abused this daughter and two of his other daughters on several occasions. The court imposed a sentence of 121 months imprisonment and three years supervised release. Red Cloud now challenges the court\u2019s upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upward in light of Red Cloud\u2019s repeated sexual abuse of three of his daughters. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, comment, (n.4) (1998) (upward departure warranted if court determines defendant committed multiple acts of criminal sexual abuse of same or different victims); <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (standard of review for upward departure); <em>United States v. Beatty, </em>9 F.3d 686, 690 (8th Cir.1993) (district court may accept as true all factual allegations in PSR not objected to by parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\">.
