The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Arthur R. Stewart, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and its denial of his request for a certificate of appealability (COA). Because we agree with the district court that Mr. Stewart has failed to exhaust state remedies, we deny his request for a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">Mr. Stewart\u2019s claim arises from the alleged failure of the District Court of Sedgwick County, Kansas, to respond to his \u201cMotion For Discovery/Discharge or Conversion ... to New Kansas Sentencing Grid.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This motion states that under Kan. StatAnn. \u00a7 21-4724 (2000), Mr. Stewart is eligible for \u201cconversion\u201d of his pre 1993 sentence to new post-1993 guidelines. Such a conversion could potentially shorten his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">Mr. Stewart\u2019s Sedgwick County motion was apparently filed on or about June 12, 2000. On August 2, 2000, Mr. Stewart filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. Arguing that the Sedgwick County court had failed to consider his sentencing motion, Mr. Stewart asked the district court to vacate his sentence and award him $2 million in damages. The district court dismissed Mr. Stewart\u2019s habeas petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies, as his state petition appeared to be still pending. Rec. doc. 3, at 1-2 (Dist. Ct. Order, dated Aug. 7, 2000). On Mr. Stewart\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the district court declined to reconsider its decision or grant a certificate of appealability, finding that there was no evidence Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Stewart had attempted to pursue his claims in the Kansas appellate courts. It did, however, grant him leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. Rec. doc. 7, at 1 (Dist. Ct. Order, dated Sept. 11, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">We construe Mr. Stewart\u2019s complaint liberally because he is proceeding pro se, although we will not act as his advocate. <em>See Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). It seems that Mr. Stewart is asking for two alternative remedies, based on the alleged failure of the Sedgwick County court to respond to his motion. First, he asks that we order the Sedgwick County court to act on his motion, so as to enable him to immediately proceed through the state appellate process. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s Br. at 4. This we cannot and should not do, as federal courts have no authority to issue a writ of mandamus to a state court. <em>See Olson v. Hart, </em>965 F.2d 940, 942 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In the alternative, if we find the lack of a response from the state court excuses his failure to exhaust state remedies, Mr. Stewart asks that we grant him a certificate of appealability and rule on his habeas motion. <em>See Clayton v. Gibson, </em>199 F.3d 1162, 1170 (10th Cir.1999) (noting that \u201c[t]he exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional,\u201d and \u201cmay be waived by the state or avoided by the petitioner if an attempt to exhaust would be futile.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Stewart has not made a sufficient attempt to exhaust any available state remedies. If the Sedgwick County court has truly erred in failing to act on his motion, Mr. Stewart\u2019s immediate remedy lies with the Kansas appellate courts. As there is no indication that Mr. Stewart has attempted to appeal, or to petition the Supreme Court of Kansas for a writ of mandamus, there is also no indication that such an attempt would be futile. <em>See O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 842, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (a state prisoner must \u201cgive the state courts an opportunity to act on his claims before he presents those claims to a federal court in a habeas petition\u201d); <em>Duckworth v. Serrano, </em>454 U.S. 1, 3, 102 S.Ct. 18, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981) (per curiam) (stating that \u201c[a]n exception is made only if there is no opportunity to obtain redress in state court or if the corrective process is so clearly deficient as to render futile any effort to obtain relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In order to obtain a certificate of appeal-ability, an appellant must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Stewart has made no such showing and his request for a certificate of appealability is DENIED. Accordingly, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b925-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
