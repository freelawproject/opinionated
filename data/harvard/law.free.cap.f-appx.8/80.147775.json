New York City Dep\u2019t of Housing Preservation and Development, </em>2000 WL 1209427 (E.D.N.Y. Aug.22, 2000). Muse, who is Haitian, alleges that he was subjected to a hostile work environment, retaliated against, and ultimately terminated from HPD on the basis of his race and national origin. <em>See id. </em>at *l-*2.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-22\">Having reviewed all of Muse\u2019s contentions on this appeal and finding in them no grounds for reversal, we affirm the judgment of the District Court substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Block\u2019s opinion. We note specifically that although the Court did not discuss Muse\u2019s hostile environment claim, the Court properly dealt with this allegation when it concluded that Muse\u2019s claims rest on a \u201csingle discussion\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>with a Deputy Director at HPD eight months prior to his termination. <em>See id. </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
