R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Leonard Joseph Mejia appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal as untimely his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition following his jury conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Mejia contends he was entitled to an additional 90 days under the statutory tolling provisions of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) for time to seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court following the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2254 petition on statute of limitations grounds. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Mejia\u2019s contention, however, is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>241 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that \u201cby its plain terms, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) does not toll the limitations period while a petition for certiorari from a state court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief is pending in the United States Supreme Court.\u201d). The district court therefore properly concluded that Mejia\u2019s section 2254 petition was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Bunney, </em>slip op. at 2786.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-12\">. We decline to review Mejia\u2019s other contentions that he was entitled to statutory tolling pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) or, alternatively, to equitable tolling, because such issues were not certified by the district court in the certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d). <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1 (2000); <em>United States v. Zuno-Arce, </em>209 F.3d 1095, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that \"we decline to address the issues in Defendant\u2019s brief that fall outside the limited COA that the district court granted.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
