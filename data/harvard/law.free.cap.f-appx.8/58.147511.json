In addition, there was overwhelming evidence of DeFreitas\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, any error that might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>occurred on this score was harmless. <em>See United States v. Terry, </em>702 F.2d 299, 314 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of conviction and sentence of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
