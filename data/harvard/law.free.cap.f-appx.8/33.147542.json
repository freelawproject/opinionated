BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On June 11, 1998, John Royster, Sr. (\u201cRoyster\u201d) filed a complaint in federal court asserting myriad claims of constitutional violations against prison officials who had been in charge of his confinement in federal and state prison. Following several rounds of judicial proceedings, Royster\u2019s case was narrowed to the claim that in December 1997, while Royster was held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (\u201cMCC\u201d), Lieutenant Michael Lopez (\u201cLopez\u201d) and six other MCC employees\u2014 named Sterner, DeRoso, Shu, Freschette, Dellamarco, and Stroble \u2014 denied him access to five boxes of legal documents that were critical to a civil suit that Royster had brought against the Department of Corrections in federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Royster claims that this denial violated his federal due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The district court (Rakoff, <em>J.) </em>dismissed with prejudice Royster\u2019s complaint against Lopez pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), on the ground that Royster had not alleged any facts indicating that Lopez was personally involved in denying him access to the legal documents, a necessary element of Royster\u2019s constitutional tort claim. <em>See Sealey v. Giltner, </em>116 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir.1997). In addition, the district court dismissed without prejudice Royster\u2019s complaint against the remaining defendants on the ground that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (the \u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), requires Royster to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in the courts in actions \u201cbrought with respect to prison conditions,\u201d and that Royster had not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Royster now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Since the district court\u2019s March 30, 2000 Memorandum and Order in this case, two opinions of our Court have been issued which require reconsideration of the decision of the court below. First, in <em>Nussle v. Willette, </em>224 F.3d 95, 105-6 (2d Cir.2000), we held that claims of particularized instances of excessive force directed at an inmate are not \u201cbrought with respect to prison conditions\u201d and therefore are not subject to the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA. And second, in <em>Lawrence v. Goord, </em>238 F.3d 182, 186 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam), we extended the logic of <em>Nussle </em>to hold that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement is similarly inapplicable to cases alleging individualized retaliation against prisoners. Importantly, we noted in <em>Lawrence </em>that \u201c[t]he underlying principles requiring exhaustion \u2014 giving notice to administrators and allowing policy makers to change their behavior \u2014 are not served when a practice is aimed at one specific inmate rather than the prison population as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186. <em>See also Nussle, </em>224 F.3d at 106 (noting in a related context that there is no reason to extend the exhaustion requirement to cases \u201cthat do not contemplate ongoing judicial supervision or some other form of \u2018prospective relief affecting large numbers of inmates-let alone individual claims that complain of past, wholly completed conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement has thus been substantially clarified since the district court issued its Memorandum and Order. In particular, the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[i]t ... does not matter [to the applicability of the exhaustion requirement] whether the prisoner\u2019s chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>lenge is to a systemic problem or to one that is individual, or, for that matter, to whether the alleged misconduct is pursuant to a prison policy or <em>ultra vires,\u201d </em>does not, in light of <em>Nussle </em>and <em>Lawrence, </em>reflect the law of our Circuit. These opinions make clear that whether or not the exhaustion requirement applies to Royster\u2019s claim will be substantially affected by whether the denial of access to documents Royster alleges occurred idiosyncratically or pursuant to some prison policy. This question was understandably not addressed below, and is not properly decided on appeal without the benefit of a district court record and decision. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal insofar as it was based on the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement and remand the case to that court for re-consideration in light of <em>Nussle </em>and Lawrence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Finally, because none of the preceding considerations affects the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Royster\u2019s claim against Lopez, we affirm this dismissal for substantially the reasons given by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We have reviewed all Royster\u2019s remaining claims and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of the case against Lopez is AFFIRMED; the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of the case against the remaining defendants is VACATED; and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further consideration consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. Royster alleges that he had been commanded, by MCC personnel, to surrender these boxes of documents on December 4, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">. In light of this remand, we do not now consider the question-which remains unsettled in this Circuit, <em>see Nussle, </em>224 F.3d at 100 n. 5 \u2014 of whether the PLRA requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies even when prisoners seek relief, in this case monetary damages, not available through administrative channels.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
