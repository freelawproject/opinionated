R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Edward A. Addeo appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Union Oil of California (\u201cUnocal\u201d) in his action alleging that Unocal improperly terminated his franchise agreement in violation of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2801-2841 (\u201cPMPA\u201d), and committed conversion by seizing his personal property. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review de novo, <em>Reyes v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>12 F.3d 1464, 1468 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Addeo failed to rebut Unocal\u2019s evidence that grounds existed for terminating the franchise agreement based on Addeo\u2019s failure to make timely payments. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2); <em>Reyes, </em>12 F.3d at 1469. Unocal provided sufficient evidence that requiring 90 days notice of the termination of the franchise agreement would not have been reasonable. <em>See Abujudeh v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>841 F.2d 310, 311 (9th Cir.1988). Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Addeo\u2019s claims under the PMPA. The district court properly granted summary judgment on Addeo\u2019s claims for breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing because these claims were incorporated by reference in his PMPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">On appeal, Addeo failed to address Unocal\u2019s other reason for terminating the agreement, that he failed to stock and sell Unocal fuel, and has waived the argument. <em>See Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>797 F.2d 727, 738 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Addeo\u2019s conversion claim because Addeo\u2019s evidence failed to create a genuine issue that there was a substantial interference with his property or his rights to it. <em>See Jordan v. Talbot, </em>55 Cal.2d 597, 12 Cal.Rptr. 488, 361 P.2d 20, 27-28 (Cal.1961) (In Bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
