Ba-cote was convicted in 1991, after a guilty plea, of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">On June 5, 2000, Bacote moved, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for a reduction in his sentence on the ground that two amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, both of which became effective after his sentencing, entitled him to a shorter sentence. Specifically, Bacote argued that amendments 487 and 503 should be retroactively applied to his case. Amendment 487, which came into effect on November 1, 1993, stated that the term \u201ccocaine base,\u201d as used in the Guidelines, referred to \u201ccrack.\u201d <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>App. C, Vol. 1 (1998). Amendment 503, which came into effect a year later, specified that the term \u201crelevant conduct\u201d when used in connection with a conspiracy conviction does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy undertaken prior to the defendant\u2019s joining the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>Bacote also argued, in a subsequent memorandum, that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) rendered his sentence unconstitutional insofar as the quantity of drugs relevant to his offense was determined by a preponderance of the evidence and not beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">The district court concluded that \u201camendments 487 and 503 do not entitle Bacote to any reduction in sentence since they are not listed in [section] 1B1.10(c),\u201d the Guidelines provision listing which amendments may and may not be retroactively applied. The district court also con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>eluded that \u201ceven if these amendment^] did apply, there was never any question that the sort of cocaine dealt in Bacote\u2019s case was crack. Similarly, [the] eo-conspirator[\u2019s] conduct does not fall within 503.\u201d Finally, the district court held that Bacote\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim was not properly before it, and that as an initial matter, it had to be brought in a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 3582. .</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">On appeal, Bacote reiterates the arguments presented to the district court. We agree with the district court, and for substantially the reasons it gave, that even if amendments 487 and 503 are retroactively applicable, they do not provide grounds for a reduction in Bacote\u2019s sentence. At a plea hearing, Bacote admitted to selling and conspiring to sell \u201ccrack.\u201d And, the district court\u2019s Order sentencing Bacote to 188 months in prison makes clear that he was not held responsible for any conduct of co-conspirators that predated his participation in the conspiracy. Accordingly, even if amendments 487 and 503 were to be viewed as clarificatory, and hence to be given retroactive application apart from \u00a7 1B1.10, <em>see United States v. Kim, </em>193 F.3d 567, 578 (2d Cir.1999), they do not help Bacote. We also agree with the district court that a \u00a7 3582 motion is not the proper vehicle for Bacote\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits district courts to modify sent\u00e9nces \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Appellant\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not relate to a lowering of sentence ranges by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We have considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. The Order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
