Harmon and Darrick L. Kearney appeal their criminal judgments convicting Harmon of use of a firearm during a crime of violence and Harmon and Kearney of armed bank robbery. Counsel for the Defendants have filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issues of whether the court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Harmon\u2019s guilty plea, the validity of Harmon\u2019s 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000) conviction in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and whether the court erred in increasing Kearney\u2019s base offense level for the presence of a firearm used by Harmon during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the crime, but stating that in their opinions there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Harmon filed a supplemental pro se brief claiming that his cooperation was not considered, that he was charged with two similar offenses, and that he was not advised how to qualify for parole or reduce his sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Following a de novo review of the record, we find that the district court complied with all the mandates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Harmon\u2019s guilty plea. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard). Harmon\u2019s conviction for brandishing a firearm was not imposed in violation of the law. The \u201cbrandished clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) sets forth a sentencing factor that need not be charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>243 F.3d 806, 2001 WL 273146, *19 (4th Cir. Mar.20, 2001) (No. 00-4154).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We find that the district court did not clearly err in applying a five-level enhancement for the presence of a firearm. Kearney and Hannon jointly committed and planned the offense. Kearney knew that Harmon was carrying a gun in furtherance of them jointly undertaken criminal activity. Therefore the court properly applied the enhancement. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(l)(B) &amp; 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Harmon\u2019s pro se supplemental claims are also without merit. Harmon, in fact, received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility; therefore, his cooperation was considered and rewarded. Harmon was also properly charged with armed bank robbery and a firearms offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt of a predicate offense, in this case armed robbery, is an essential element of a conviction under \u00a7 924(c). <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 204 (4th Cir.1999). Finally, the court and counsel were not required to advise Harmon regarding ways to qualify for parole and reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We have reviewed the entire record in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no error below. We therefore affirm the appeals. This court requires that counsel inform them clients, in wiiting, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
