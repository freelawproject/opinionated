Jenkins, M.D., alleging that he conspired with others to knowingly file false claims, and that he did file false claims, with the Healthcare Finance Administration (\u201cHCA\u201d). Dr. Jenkins in turn filed a declaratory judgment action against St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (\u201cSt. Paul\u201d) alleging that it had a duty to defend him in the <em>qui tam </em>action. Dr. Jenkins\u2019s policy with St. Paul provides coverage only for damages resulting from his \u201cproviding or withholding of professional services.\u201d The District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dismissed Dr. Jenkins\u2019s declaratory judgment action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Dr. Jenkins appeals. Our review is <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">As the District Court determined, St. Paul did not have a duty to defend unless there was a possibility that the damages claimed by the relators in the <em>qui tam </em>action would have fallen within the policy coverage. The <em>qui tam </em>action was brought under the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d). The FCA imposes liability on persons or corporations who knowingly submit false claims to the government for reimbursement. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(b) (defining \u201cknowingly\u201d). Thus, for the relators in the <em>qui tam </em>action to have recovered against Dr. Jenkins, they were required to prove that he knowingly submitted false claims to the HCA for reimbursement. Accordingly, any award in that action would not have resulted from the \u201cproviding or withholding of professional services.\u201d We therefore conclude that the District Court correctly determined that St. Paul had no duty to defend Dr. Jenkins in the <em>qui tam </em>action, inasmuch as there was no possibility that the <em>qui tam </em>action would have resulted in an award that fell within the coverage provided by the St. Paul policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">Finding no error in the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Dr. Jenkins\u2019s action for a declaratory judgment, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-18\">. The Honorable Harry F.
