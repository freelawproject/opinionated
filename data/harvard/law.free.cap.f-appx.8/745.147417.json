The City moved for, and was granted, summary judgment on all of Lesperance\u2019s claims, with the exception of his state claims of retaliation and constructive discharge. Both claims were subsequently presented to a jury, resulting in a favorable verdict for Lesperance on the retaliation claim. Despite its finding that Lesperance prevailed on his state retaliation claim, the jury awarded him zero dollars in compensatory damages. The district court awarded Lesperance nominal damages of $100.00, adjusted for inflation to $605.57. Lesperance then moved the court for attorney\u2019s fees totaling approximately $94,000.00, of which the court awarded approximately $84,000.00. The City appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment on the issue of retaliation and the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment, but REVERSE the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-17\">The City contends that the district court erroneously denied its motion for summary judgment on Lesperance\u2019s retaliation claim. Because a plenary trial on the merits has been conducted in this case, we need not reach the merits of this claim. <em>See, e.g., Price v. Kramer, </em>200 F.3d 1237, 1243 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable on an appeal from a final judgment entered after a full trial on the merits.\u201d); <em>Herring v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. and Health Servs., </em>81 Wash.App. 1, 914 P.2d 67, 76 (Wash.Ct.App.1996) (\u201c[A] ruling denying summary judgment based upon the presence of ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>terial disputed facts is not reviewable after trial on the merits.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The City next argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Lesperance because his claim did not achieve a sufficient level of success. We review an award of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>See McGinnis v. Kentucky Fried Chicken, </em>51 F.3d 805, 810 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Section 49.60.030(2) of the Washington Revised Code (\u201cSection 49.60.030(2)\u201d) enables civil rights plaintiffs to recover \u201ccost of suit including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 49.60.030(2) (2000). \u201cThe Washington Supreme Court has held that \u2018we look to federal authority for guidance\u2019 in resolving issues of reduction in fees for circumstances not mentioned in the statute.\u201d <em>McGinnis, </em>51 F.3d at 808 (quoting <em>Blair v. Washington State Univ., </em>108 Wash.2d 558, 740 P.2d 1379,1385 (Wash.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In <em>McGinnis, </em>we addressed the relationship between a plaintiffs level of success in litigation and the amount of attorney\u2019s fees he may reap under Section 49.60.030(2). In defining the contours of this relationship, we focused predominately on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). <em>Farrar </em>established a bifurcated test for determining whether a party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. First, the moving party must establish that he is the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 109-110. The Supreme Court found this first prong to be satisfied where, as here, a plaintiff is awarded nominal damages. <em>Id. </em>at 112. Second, the \u201cprevailing party\u201d must establish that the attorney\u2019s fees sought are commensurate with the degree of success obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15. Thus, we have held that before awarding attorney\u2019s fees under Section 49.60.030(2), \u201cthe district court must answer the question, \u2018[D]id the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.\u2019\u201d <em>McGinnis, </em>51 F.3d at 809-10 (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">In addressing the level of success achieved by Lesperance, the district court looked beyond his receipt of only nominal damages, and focused instead on what the court termed the \u201cnon-monetary aspects of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d The success of Lesperance\u2019s retaliation claim, the district court reasoned, was reflected in the fact that \u201c[sjociety as a whole gains when violations of civil rights are redressed.\u201d Further attempting to illustrate Lesperance\u2019s success in this litigation, the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">Employees in Washington have the right to work in an environment free from discrimination; coupled with that right is the right to complain about perceived acts of discrimination without fear of retaliation. The state legislature has made clear that, whether or not an individual is damaged by the retaliatory actions of his employer, such conduct will not be tolerated. However, to a large extent, the state has delegated to the injured parties the power to enforce its discrimination laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">When an individual has been retaliated against by his employer, his ability to redress this wrong within the civil justice system should not be precluded because of the economic circumstances of his individual case. The possibility of an award of attorney\u2019s fees allows plaintiffs such as Ken and Kristine Lesperance to retain skilled and competent counsel; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>plaintiffs are thereby given an opportunity to right a wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Thus, we are asked to determine whether the district court properly exercised its discretion by relying on the above-mentioned factors in awarding Lesperance attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Our holding in <em>McGinnis </em>makes clear that where, as here, a plaintiff seeks and obtains only monetary relief, his \u201clevel of success\u201d for purposes of attorney\u2019s fees must be measured by looking to the amount of money recovered. <em>See McGinnis, </em>51 F.3d at 810. The sole relief sought by Lesperance was money damages in the amount of $3.5 million. Lesperance did not seek, nor was he awarded, injunctive, declarative, or any other form of relief. The jury awarded Lesperance nothing, and the district court awarded Lesperance only nominal damages. To borrow from the rationale of <em>McGinnis, </em>\u201cno reasonable person would pay lawyers [$83,902.50] to win [$605.57].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Further supporting our conclusion is the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Farrar. </em>The Court stated in <em>Famr </em>that \u201c[i]n some circumstances, even a plaintiff who formally \u2018prevails\u2019 under \u00a7 1988 should receive no attorney\u2019s fees at all. <em>A plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages is often such a prevailing </em>party.... When a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief, <em>the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.\u201d Id. </em>at 115 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Turning to the facts before it, the <em>Farrar </em>Court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because he had received only nominal damages instead of the $17 million in compensatory damages he had sought. Furthermore, the Court rejected the notion that the case had benefitted the public, stating, \u201c[t]his litigation accomplished little beyond giving petitioners \u2018the moral satisfaction of knowing that a federal court concluded that [their] rights had been violated\u2019 in some unspecified way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114 (quoting <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 762,107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Contrary to Lesperance\u2019s assertions, the facts before us are easily distinguished from <em>Wilcox v. City of Reno, </em>42 F.3d 550 (9th Cir.1994). We held in <em>Wilcox </em>that if a district court elects to award fees in the wake of a judgment for nominal damages, \u201cit must point to some way in which the litigation succeeded, <em>in addition </em>to obtaining a judgment for nominal damages.\u201d <em>Wilcox, </em>42 F.3d at 555 (emphasis in the original). Specifically, we held that a district court must note \u201cother <em>tangible </em>results \u2014 such as sparking a change in policy or establishing a finding of fact with potential collateral estoppel effects.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We affirmed the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in <em>Wilcox </em>after finding that the district court had properly cited several \u201ctangible results\u201d from Wilcox\u2019s case that demonstrated the requisite level of success for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Such results included the exposure and alteration of an unconstitutional government policy, as well as the fact that the findings in Wilcox\u2019s lawsuit could \u201cbe used as a matter of collateral estoppel, if there were other cases like it which arose during that period of time....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">The general policy considerations cited by the district court in this case do not reflect the kind of success required to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Lesperance sought only monetary damages and recovered nothing more than nominal damages. This is not a case in which an unconstitutional policy has been unearthed, nor will the City of Spokane be collaterally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>estopped from making similar defenses against future claims of retaliation by similarly injured plaintiffs. Rather, \u201cthis litigation accomplished little beyond giving [Lesperance] \u2018the moral satisfaction of knowing that a federal court concluded that [his] rights had been violated....\u2019\u201d <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the retaliation claim, and REVERSE the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
