Floyd appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing with prejudice his Fair Labor Standards Act suit and denying his motion for reconsideration of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"AIa\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Floyd\u2019s suit was entered on the court\u2019s docket on July 20, 2000. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on October 24, 2000. Floyd did not file his motion to reconsider within ten days of the district court\u2019s order dismissing his suit, consequently the time period for filing his appeal of that order was not tolled. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4); <em>Panhorst v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 367, 370 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, Floyd\u2019s appeal is timely only as to the district court\u2019s denial of his subsequent motion for reconsideration, construed here under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See, e.g., Small v. Hunt, </em>98 F.3d 789, 797 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">This Court reviews a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See NOW v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995) (per curiam). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of Floyd\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss Floyd\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order dismissing with prejudice his Fair Labor Standards Act suit for lack of jurisdiction because Floyd\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely as to that order. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Floyd\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Floyd\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
