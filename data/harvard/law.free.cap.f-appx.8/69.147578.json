Plaintiff, who was employed as an economist at the Department of Labor, sued to set aside the determination of the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor that he had ceased to be disabled from doing his job as an economist and that his benefits under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act should thus terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">Plaintiff contends that because there was a disagreement between his physician and the physician to whom plaintiff was sent by the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, the Secretary was required by Section 8123(a) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8123(a), to appoint a third physician to resolve the conflict between the physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">The Government contends first that the action of the Secretary is final and conclusive and not subject to judicial review. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b). Second, the Government argues that in any event the facts did not warrant appointment of a third physician because there was no disagreement between plaintiffs physician and the physician chosen by the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">We agree with the Government on the latter point. The physician chosen by the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs stated in relevant part that plaintiff was \u201cable to return to work.\u201d The letter written by plaintiffs physician acknowledged that plaintiff was \u201cclearly not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>abled\u201d as that term is defined under the Social Security Act, and stated further that plaintiff \u201c[was] clearly disabled\u201d from \u201cdoing manual labor.\u201d The letter by plaintiffs physician took no position on plaintiffs ability to do his job as an economist. The two physicians\u2019 opinions were thus not in disagreement, and we accordingly need not reach the question whether the action of the Secretary is subject to judicial review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
