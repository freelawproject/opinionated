For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">James Mooney (\u201cMooney\u201d) worked as a general laborer in the coal mines for twenty-seven years. J.A. 61, 62. His job required him to pull mining cables, shovel dust, dig ditches, wash equipment, and set timbers. J.A. 61. In May of 1987, Mooney quit his job as a general laborer at Peabody Coal Company (\u201cPeabody\u201d) because he no longer had enough breath to perform his job. J.A. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">As a result of his condition, Mooney has filed three claims for federal black lung benefits. Mooney\u2019s first two claims were denied because he failed to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that he suffered from pneumoconiosis. J.A. 7. With respect to Mooney\u2019s third claim \u2014 which is the subject of this appeal \u2014 an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) awarded benefits, finding that Mooney had proven the requisite elements by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ also addressed whether Mooney had shown \u201ca material change in conditions,\u201d a requirement for any claimant filing a duplicate claim. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d) (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ concluded that Mooney had shown a material change by proving \u2014 in contrast to his prior claims \u2014 that he met all the requirements for benefits eligibility. J.A. 52. The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed, holding that Mooney had established a material change in conditions by submitting evidence which demonstrated \u201ca reasonable probability that it would change the prior administrative result.\u201d J.A. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Peabody subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration with the BRB, requesting that it reconsider its holding in light of <em>Lisa Lee Mines v. Director, OWCP, </em>86 F.3d 1358 (4th Cir.1996), in which we approved of the \u201cone element\u201d standard, requiring a \u201cclaimant to <em>prove, </em>under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition <em>after </em>the prior denial, at least one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the elements previously adjudicated against him\u201d to show a material change in conditions. 86 F.3d at 1362 (emphasis in original). The Board granted the motion for reconsideration, but again concluded that the ALJ\u2019s findings were \u201ctantamount to a finding of a material change in conditions under [Lisa <em>Lee]\u201d </em>because the ALJ found \u201cat the previously unestablished element of pneumoconiosis was established by the newly submitted evidence.\u201d J.A. 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Peabody then filed an appeal in this court, and we remanded the case to an ALJ by unpublished order for reconsideration in light of <em>Lisa Lee. </em>J.A. 28. The ALJ again awarded benefits to Mooney upon remand, concluding that he had demonstrated a material change in conditions by establishing \u201cthe existence of pneumoconiosis with newly-submitted evidence.\u201d J.A. 19. The BRB affirmed, J.A. 12, and Peabody filed a timely petition for review in this court. J.A. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Peabody argues on appeal that the ALJ erred in determining that Mooney had established a material change in conditions since he failed to prove one of the elements previously adjudicated against him as required by <em>Lisa Lee. </em>Specifically, Peabody contends that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mooney has pneumoconiosis \u2014 which was the element previously adjudicated against him in his earlier claims \u2014 was not supported by substantial evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">We review the BRB\u2019s decision by undertaking an independent review of the record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co., </em>211 F.3d at 208. \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla\u2019; it is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207-08 (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">In finding that Mooney has pneumoconiosis and thus that he had proven a material change in conditions, the ALJ summarized his findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">I interpret Dr. Tuteur\u2019s diagnosis of no \u201csignificant\u201d coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis as a positive finding of \u201cinsignificant coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d I also find Dr. Acosta\u2019s diagnosis of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis to be adequately documented and reasoned.... Relying on the opinions of Drs. Tuteur and Acosta, I find that the newly-submitted evidence establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">J.A. 19 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the validity of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Mooney suffers from pneumoconiosis depends entirely upon the opinions tendered by Drs. Tuteur and Acosta.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Dr. Acosta filled out a standard form provided by the United States Department of Labor, in which he wrote \u201cOcc. Coal Pneumoconiosis\u201d as his diagnosis and checked a \u201cyes\u201d box that indicated that it was his opinion that the diagnosed condition related to dust exposure \u201cin the patient\u2019s coal mine employment.\u201d J.A. 78. The form asked for a medical rationale for the diagnosis, but that portion of the form was left blank. J.A. 78. The remaining parts of the form contain general information such as Mooney\u2019s medical history, his work history, and findings from his physical examination, J.A. 75-77, but any reasoning supporting Acosta\u2019s diagnosis is conspicuously absent. Furthermore, as the ALJ noted, \u201cthe record [did not] reflect Dr. Acosta\u2019s credentials.\u201d J .A. 44. As a result, we hold that the ALJ erred when he credited Acosta\u2019s report because it did not provide any explanation or basis for the conclusion that Mooney has pneu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>moconiosis nor did it even so much as list Acosta\u2019s credentials; accordingly, his report cannot be considered \u201ca reasoned medical opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) (requiring that a medical opinion underlying a finding that a claimant suffers from pneumoconiosis be supported by \u201ca reasoned medical opinion\u201d); see <em>also Lango v. Director, OWCP, </em>104 F.3d 573, 577 (3d Cir.1997) (\u201cThe mere statement of a conclusion by a physician, without any explanation of the basis for that statement, does not take the place of the required reasoning.\u201d); <em>cf. Milbum Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 530 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that an expert who checked a box verifying that a blood gas test was technically acceptable lent little additional persuasive authority to the study).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Although Dr. Tuteur provided a \u201creasoned medical opinion,\u201d his report also fails to provide substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Mooney suffers from pneumoconiosis. Tuteur ultimately concluded that \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty, Mr. James K Mooney, Sr. does not have clinically significant, physiologically significant, or radiographically significant coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d J.A. 102. The ALJ interpreted that single sentence as a specific \u201cfinding of insignificant coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d J.A. 11. Although we admit that Tuteur\u2019s one-sentence conclusion is susceptible of more than one construction if read in isolation- \u2014 including the one adopted by the ALJ \u2014 -we can discern only one plausible interpretation when the statement is properly read in context. <em>See Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 763 (4th Cir.1999) (reading a physician\u2019s opinion in its \u201cfull context\u201d). That is, although inartfully drafted, Tuteur was expressing an opinion that Mooney does not suffer from pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The absence of any other statements or findings in Tuteur\u2019s report that identify the presence of pneumoconiosis, insignificant or otherwise, supports a finding of no pneumoconiosis. First, Tuteur found no indication of pneumoconiosis in Mooney\u2019s blood gas tests, x-rays, or any of the other tests that he reviewed. J.A. 100, 102. Second, Tuteur explicitly attributed Mooney\u2019s breathlessness not to pneumoconiosis, but entirely to \u201ca primary pulmonary disorder, other than coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and arteriosclerotic heart disease of substantial severity.\u201d J.A. 101; <em>see also </em>J.A. 102 (opining that Mooney\u2019s \u201cprimary pulmonary process, namely cigarette-smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ... accounts for his respiratory symptoms\u201d). Tuteur further found that Mooney\u2019s other symptoms are \u201cnot regular features of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d J.A. 101. Indeed, there is not even a single sentence \u2014 other than the one misconstrued by the ALJ \u2014 that even arguably supports the ALJ\u2019s interpretation that Tuteur diagnosed \u201cinsignificant pneumoconiosis.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the ALJ drew an unreasonable inference from Tuteur\u2019s report; rather than supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision, the only logical reading is that it constitutes substantial evidence that Mooney <em>does not </em>have pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In sum, Mooney was required to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>a material change in conditions in order to receive federal black lung benefits. The reports submitted by Drs. Acosta and Tuteur, however, do not constitute substantial evidence of pneumoconiosis and are thus insufficient to establish a material change in conditions. We therefore reverse the order of the BRB and remand for entry of an appropriate order denying benefits to Mooney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">. \"In order to obtain federal black lung benefits, a claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: '(1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v.
