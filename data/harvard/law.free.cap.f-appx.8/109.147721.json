Martin, Jr., <em>Judge </em>) denying his petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. In May 1991, Ogando was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and operating a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a). Ogando was sentenced to concurrent 363 month terms of imprisonment on both the \u00a7 846 and the \u00a7 848(a) convictions. Ogando filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in March 1997. This motion was based on the argument that in light of <em>Rutledge v. United, States, </em>517 U.S. 292, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996), Ogando\u2019s convictions for both the narcotics conspiracy and the CCE cannot stand, because the narcotics conspiracy is a lesser included offense of the CCE count. Ogando argued that his conspiracy count should be vacated and that he should be resentenced on the CCE count.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">While <em>Rutledge </em>does hold that separate punishments may not be imposed on both a \u00a7 846 and a \u00a7 848 count, Ogando\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Underwood v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 84 (2d Cir.1999), in which we held that relief under <em>Rutledge </em>cannot be obtained on collateral review where the issue was not raised on direct appeal and the error did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87 (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Underwood, </em>we found such \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d lacking because the double penalty imposed on the defendant consisted solely of separate $50 special assessments on the conspiracy and CCE counts, and thus did not affect the term of his imprisonment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Ogando argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>Underwood </em>because he can show \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d based on the fact that he would receive a sentence reduction if his conspiracy conviction is vacated. Under the 1988 version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines applicable to Ogando\u2019s sentencing, Ogando\u2019s CCE conviction carried an offense level (36) that was two levels lower than the offense level applicable to his conspiracy conviction (38). An essential premise of Ogando\u2019s argument is that his conspiracy conviction \u2014 the lesser included offense\u2014 must be vacated, as opposed to his CCE conviction. This premise, however, is flawed. <em>Rutledge, </em>the reasoning of which is grounded in double jeopardy jurisprudence, requires only that <em>either </em>the CCE conviction <em>or </em>the conspiracy conviction be vacated. <em>See </em>517 U.S. at 307, 116 S.Ct. 1241 (concluding that <em>\u201c[o]ne </em>of [petitioner\u2019s] convictions, as well as its concurrent sentence\u201d must be vacated (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have indicated that a district court has discretion regarding which count to dismiss. <em>See United States v. Rosario, </em>111 F.3d 293, 301 (2d Cir.) <em>(\u201cRutledge </em>requires that only one of [the defendant\u2019s] convictions be vacated .... \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 923, 118 S.Ct. 319, 139 L.Ed.2d 246 (1997); <em>id. (\u201cRegardless </em>of which conviction is vacated .... \u201c (emphasis added)). <em>See also Lanier v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 833, 841 (7th Cir.) (\u201c[W]hen the presumption against double punishment requires invalidation of the conviction for either the greater or lesser offense, the choice of which conviction to vacate rests with the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 930, 121 S.Ct. 312, 148 L.Ed.2d 250 (2000); <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>944 F.2d 1253, 1269 (6th Cir. 1991) (district court has discretion to vacate either conspiracy or CCE count on remand), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1112, 112 S.Ct. 1217, 117 L.Ed.2d 455 (1992). Thus, the District Court could have vacated Ogando\u2019s CCE conviction rather than his conspiracy conviction, thereby providing Ogando with no sentence reduction. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d necessarily resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
