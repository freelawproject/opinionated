We also reject plaintiffs contention that he is entitled to declaratory relief based on <em>Pulliam v. Allen, </em>466 U.S. 522, 536-37, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984), given that the <em>Pulliam </em>holding with respect to such relief has been effectively overruled by Congress. <em>See </em>Federal Courts Improvement Act, Pub.L. No. 104-317, 110 Stat. 3847 (1996) (amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to provide that \u201cinjunctive relief shall not be granted\u201d in an action brought against \u201ca judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity,\u201d \u201cunless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
