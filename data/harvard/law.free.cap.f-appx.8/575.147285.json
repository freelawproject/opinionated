At sentencing, he objected to receiving only a two-level, rather than three-level, reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and to the application of a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for using or possessing firearms in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">The government linked Sumlin\u2019s possession of firearms with his possession and sale of drugs on the basis of police reports, introduced through the testimony of the probation officer who had reviewed them in preparing the presentence report. The reports related that firearms were present when Sumlin sold drugs to a confidential informant. The reports also showed that at the time of his arrest there, Sumlin had a loaded firearm in his pocket and that there was drug residue in the apartment. The District Court overruled Sumlin\u2019s objections, finding an adequate evidentiary basis for the enhancement, and sentenced him to eighty-two months imprisonment and three years supervised release. Sumlin renews on appeal the arguments he presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">Sumlin\u2019s challenge to the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction he received is foreclosed by his stipulation to a two-level reduction in his written plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Barrett, </em>173 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>We conclude, however, that the District Court lacked an adequate factual basis for applying the challenged enhancement. By virtue of Sumlin\u2019s objection, the government had the burden to prove a connection between the firearms and another felony offense, but it did not show that its hearsay evidence bore sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (1998) (stating that a sentencing court may consider relevant evidence which might be inadmissible at trial, provided the information has sufficient indicia of reliability); <em>United States v. Wise, </em>976 F.2d 393, 402-04 (8th Cir.1992) (en banc) (discussing when hearsay is sufficiently reliable under \u00a7 6A1.3(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 989, 113 S.Ct. 1592, 123 L.Ed.2d 157 (1993). We believe that a more probative evidentiary hearing on this issue is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Sumlin\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. Apart from the enhancement, Sumlin\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
