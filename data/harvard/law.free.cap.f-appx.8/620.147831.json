We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we recount them here only where necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">1. Recusal</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">We review the district judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>109 F.3d 1450, 1453 (9th Cir.1997). The district judge appropriately exercised his discretion in refusing Klock\u2019s motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">As required by \u00a7 455, the judge made a personal, independent assessment of whether a reasonable person could question his impartiality. The district judge concluded that a disinterested person would not question his impartiality based solely on the fact that the Montana Freemen had previously filed a lien on his property. This conclusion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 940 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cA judge is not disqualified by a litigant\u2019s suit or threatened suit against him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">As required by \u00a7 144, the district judge assessed Klock\u2019s affidavit, determined that it was insufficient on its face to support recusal, and therefore declined to refer the motion to another judge. This was not an abuse of discretion. Klock\u2019s affidavit was legally insufficient because it failed to \u201cspecifically allege[] facts that fairly support the contention that the judge exhibits bias or prejudice directed toward a party that stems from an extrajudicial source.\u201d <em>United States v. Sibla, </em>624 F.2d 864, 868 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">2. Agent Healy\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">We review the district judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Manning, </em>56 F.3d 1188, 1196 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-19\">The district judge appropriately exercised his discretion in determining that Agent Healy\u2019s testimony was not hearsay. It is true that Agent Healy related out-of-court statements made by Freemen instructors. However, those statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. See FedR.Evid. 801. Instead, they were offered to show their effect on the seminar attendees\u2019 good faith belief in the validity of the lien process and the certified money orders. For example, the government offered Agent Healy\u2019s testimony that the Freemen instructors warned seminar attendees of the potential of being arrested for negotiating the certified money orders not to prove that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>attendees would, in fact, be arrested, but rather to show that someone who heard such a statement would not have formed a good faith belief in the instrument\u2019s validity-</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Further, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that Agent Healy\u2019s testimony was not substantially more prejudicial than probative. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. Agent Healy\u2019s testimony about the instruction he received at a 1996 Freemen seminar was probative insofar as it undercut Dr. Todd\u2019s expert opinion that some seminar attendees formed a good faith belief in the financial instruments. On the other side of the scale, Agent Healy\u2019s testimony was not highly prejudicial. Although he did mention firearms and a general militaristic atmosphere, that information was' offered only as background to explain why Agent Healy had to go undercover to investigate the Freemen seminars.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
