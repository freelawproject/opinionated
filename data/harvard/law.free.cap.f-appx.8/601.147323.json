The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to fifteen years and eight months (188 months) imprisonment, and five years supervised release. On appeal, Hardy\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending that the Court incorrectly calculated the appropriate Guidelines range and thus imposed an \u201cexcessive sentence.\u201d In a pro se supplemental brief, Hardy contends that he was sentenced in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment omitted drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">At sentencing, the District Court properly resolved Hardy\u2019s objections to the applicable Guidelines range. Further, Hardy was not sentenced within that range because he received a downward departure, the extent of which is unreviewable. See <em>United States v. Dutcher, </em>8 F.3d 11, 12 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">As to the pro se issue, because Hardy\u2019s sentence does not exceed the twenty-year statutory maximum prison term for a non-quantity-based drug offense, it does not violate <em>Apprendi. </em>See <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 934 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-21\">.
