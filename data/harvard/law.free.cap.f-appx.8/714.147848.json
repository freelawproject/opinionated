The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a motion to withdraw on the ground that he could find no meritorious issues on appeal. Castorena-Curiel did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-26\">In the plea agreement, Castorena-Curiel agreed to waive his constitutional and statutory rights to appeal his sentence as long as the sentence was within the statutory maximum, the court did not depart upward more than two levels and the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>offense level was 22 or below. The sentence imposed is within these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Because our independent review of the record indicates that the plea agreement, including the waiver of the right to appeal, was entered knowingly and voluntarily, <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998) (waiver of right to appeal is valid if knowing and voluntary), we enforce the waiver, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-27\">.
