Weiner v. San Diego County, </em>210 F.8d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir.2000). Because Karlozian submitted direct evidence <em>of </em>discrimination, he was only required to produce \u201cvery little\u201d evidence to show that the District\u2019s legitimate reason was pretextual. <em>See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Karlozian did not, however, present any pretext evidence to the district court. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) required Karlozian to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d He failed to do so, despite being warned by the district court that the District\u2019s motion had the \u201cpower to end your lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">He argues that he is entitled to lenient treatment because he was proceeding <em>pro se. </em>We have held, however, that <em>\u201cpro se </em>litigants in the ordinary civil case should not be treated more favorably than parties with attorneys of record.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. </em>Filler; 790 F.2d 1362, 1364 (9th Cir.1986) (upholding summary judgment against <em>pro se </em>plaintiff in civil rights case where plaintiff failed to file responsive material in opposition of summary judgment motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">While pretext evidence may have been buried in Karlozian\u2019s 242 page deposition, \u201ca district court is \u2018not required to comb the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., </em>237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Forsberg v. Pac. N.W. Bell Tel. Co., </em>840 F.2d 1409, 1418 (9th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">This is not a case where a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff presents his evidence in an improper format. Karlozian failed to submit his pretext evidence in any form. He not only violated a local rule, he violated Rule 56(e). Karlozian\u2019s violation of Rule 56(e), after having been warned of the effect of such a violation, is sufficient to warrant summary judgment. <em>See Jacobsen, </em>790 F.2d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Afb\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
