Patrick further contests the court\u2019s decision denying his motion to amend his complaint. Oxycal Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cOxycal\u201d) cross appeals certain evidentiary decisions as well as the court\u2019s computation of <em>Prentice </em>damages. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">I. Patrick\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">We review the district court\u2019s refusal to allow Patrick to amend his complaint under a standard of abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 604, 607 (9th Cir.1992). We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment of liability for intentional interference with contract <em>de novo. Rano v. Sipa Press, Inc., </em>987 F.2d 580, 584 (9th Cir. 1993). In doing so, we must determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">Patrick\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint was filed beyond the cut-off date set out in the court\u2019s scheduling order of August 8, 1997. With this scheduling order in place, the district court correctly analyzed Patrick\u2019s motion according to the standards set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b), and determined that it would not permit Patrick\u2019s amendment \u201cexcept upon a showing of good cause.\u201d Having heard Patrick\u2019s explanation for the belated amendment, the court found that Patrick had failed to make any such showing. Patrick has not convincingly challenged this finding on appeal. He is also incorrect in arguing that the court\u2019s modification of the pretrial order demonstrated that it abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>its discretion in refusing to allow a modification of the scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment for Oxycal on its intentional interference with contract claim. Patrick contends that as sole owner and director of Alacer he was a party to the contract between Alacer and Oxycal and, therefore, could not have tortiously interfered with this contract. In support of his argument, Patrick points to <em>Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia, </em>7 Cal.4th 503, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d 454 (1994). California law, however, has \u201cconsistently found owners, managers, and advisers ... liable in tort as third parties where they were not acting to protect the interests of the contracting party.\u201d <em>Shapoff v. Scull, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 1457, 272 Cal.Rptr. 480, 484 (Cal.Ct.App. 1990) (disapproved in part by <em>Applied Equip., </em>28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d at 464, n. 10); <em>see also Collins v. Vickter Manor, Inc., </em>47 Cal.2d 875, 882, 306 P.2d 783 (Cal.1957). <em>Applied Equipment </em>did not act to change this principle of California tort law. <em>Applied Equipment </em>merely disavowed caselaw holding parties to contracts liable for intentional interference under a conspiracy theory. <em>Applied Equip., </em>28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d at 464, n. 10 (specifying \u201c[w]e disapprove of all prior cases to the extent they hold that a party to a contract can be held liable in tort based on a conspiracy to interfere with its own contract, including each of the following: <em>Shapoffv. Scull </em>...\u201d). Oxycal has not alleged a conspiracy theory in this case. Moreover, Patrick was not a party to the contract at issue here; the contract was between Alacer and Oxycal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Patrick\u2019s argument on appeal is essentially an assertion of the manager\u2019s privilege. As the district court correctly noted, the manager\u2019s privilege is an affirmative defense to liability for intentional interference with contract. <em>Shapoff, </em>272 Cal.Rptr. at 488; <em>Olivet v. Frischling, </em>104 Cal.App.3d 831, 164 Cal.Rptr. 87, 91-92 (1980) (disapproved in part by <em>Applied Equip., </em>28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d at 464, n. 10); <em>Collins, </em>47 Cal.2d at 883, 306 P.2d 783. As a legal justification, under California law, it must be affirmatively pled. <em>Herron v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </em>56 Cal.2d 202, 207, 14 Cal.Rptr. 294, 363 P.2d 310 (Cal.1961) (in bank). Patrick failed to plead this defense in a timely manner in the district court and, therefore, cannot assert this defense now.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">III. Oxycal\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Oxycal challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence related to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) as inadmissible hearsay and as irrelevant evidence. Oxycal also contends that the court improperly failed to award <em>Prentice </em>damages associated with its failed enforcement action. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under a standard of abuse of discretion. <em>Kisor v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>783 F.2d 1337, 1340 (9th Cir.1986). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to the <em>Prentice </em>damages for clear error, while the legal standards used in the calculation of damages are reviewed <em>de novo. R.B. Matthews, Inc. v. Transamerica Transp. Servs., Inc., </em>945 F.2d 269, 272 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">With respect to the court\u2019s ruling that an alleged statement by Mr. Milgrom of the FTC was hearsay, we first reject Oxycal\u2019s argument under Fed. R.Evid. 803(1) (\u201cpresent sense impression\u201d) because this argument was not raised below. <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Sea-Land Serv. Inc., </em>50 F.3d 723, 729 (9th Cir.1995). Oxycal\u2019s argument under Fed.R.Evid. 807 is also unpersuasive, because there are no \u201cequivalent circumstantial guarantees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>trustworthiness,\u201d as required by Fed. R.Evid. 807, associated with this alleged statement. We also reject Oxycal\u2019s argument under Fed.R.Evid. 803(3) (\u201cthen existing state of mind or motive\u201d). Oxycal attempted to rely on this statement to establish the FTC\u2019s motive in initiating its investigation. The alleged statement, however, occurred after the initiation of the investigation and, therefore, was not a statement of \u201cthen existing\u201d motive within the meaning of this exception. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>290 U.S. 96, 105-06, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933) (\u201cDeclarations of intention, casting light upon the future, have been sharply distinguished from declarations of memory, pointing backwards to the past.\u201d). Finally, all of Oxyeal\u2019s arguments suffer from the problem that the statement is possibly double hearsay, because Oxycal could not demonstrate that Milgrom had personal knowledge of the facts of the alleged statement. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in excluding this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">With respect to the other evidence concerning the FTC investigation, we conclude that the court permissibly excluded this evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 402 (\u201cEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d). Oxycal\u2019s attempt to support its claim for damages by reference to the FTC investigation was overly speculative. The letter at issue mentioned the FDA not the FTC. Oxycal could only trace the letter to the subcommittee with oversight of the FTC, not to the FTC itself. Finally, Oxycal could not prove that the FTC\u2019s investigation was more likely caused by this particular letter than by Patrick\u2019s previous public condemnations of Oxycal\u2019s products. In light of these serious problems with this evidence, we cannot conclude that its exclusion was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Finally, we consider the district court\u2019s computation of <em>Prentice </em>damages. Oxycal argues that the district court improperly refused to award <em>Prentice </em>damages to compensate Oxycal for its expenses incurred in the original enforcement action. We disagree. Under California law, a \u201cperson who through the tort of another has been required to act in the protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against a third person is entitled to recover compensation for the reasonably necessary loss of time, attorney\u2019s fees, and other expenditures thereby suffered or incurred.\u201d <em>Prentice v. N. Am. Title Guar. Corp., </em>59 Cal.2d 618, 30 Cal. Rptr. 821, 381 P.2d 645, 647 (1963) (in bank). The district court concluded that the expenses incurred in Oxycal\u2019s initial enforcement action \u201cwere not reasonably incurred in attempting to enforce the Settlement Agreement between plaintiffs and defendant Alacer Corporation.\u201d In the initial action, the court only had jurisdiction to enforce the permanent injunction entered based on the settlement agreement; enforcement of the settlement agreement itself required a second cause of action. Thus, Oxycal\u2019s unsuccessful attempts at enforcement in the initial action are distinct. These damages were not recoverable as <em>Prentice </em>damages under its tort claim in the current action.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">For the reasons stated above, the summary judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b793-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
