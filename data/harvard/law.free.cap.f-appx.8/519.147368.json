This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">Apparently seeking monetary and injunctive relief, Parchman sought the appointment of an attorney and various experts because he was not pleased with the testimony given by various witnesses during his criminal trial held in the mid-1980\u2019s. Because of the incomprehensible nature of the complaint and the hundreds of pages of attachments, the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-22\">In his rambling brief on appeal, Parch-man continues to request the appointment of counsel \u201cfor the purpose of preserving documents, records, and testimony at trial,\u201d and argues that the district court erred in failing to note that he sought monetary damages, that he was unfairly denied his day in court, that he was being discriminated against because he is poor, and that he is factually innocent as the state withheld evidence at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-23\">The district court\u2019s order is reviewed de novo. <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">The district court properly dismissed the complaint as frivolous. A complaint is deemed frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or in fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Although Parchman\u2019s complaint is incoherent, his brief on appeal does provide some clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-25\">Parchman\u2019s complaint was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Because Parch-man complains on appeal that the evidence from his criminal trial needs to be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>served and that he is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, it appears that Parchman is attacking the validity of his criminal conviction. As such, Parchman\u2019s complaint is frivolous as a matter of law under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner cannot make a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983 for an alleged unconstitutional conviction or for \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d unless a prisoner shows that the conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87. As Parchman is attacking the validity of his conviction, the complaint was dismissable pursuant to <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Accordingly, we deny Parchman\u2019s request for counsel and affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
