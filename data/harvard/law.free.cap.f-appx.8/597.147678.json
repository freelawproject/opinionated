The Honorable Andrew W. Bogue, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b628-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Manuel Villegas\u2019s appeal from his convictions on two counts involving controlled substances, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), \u00a7 846, raises a single issue, namely, whether the trial court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> erred in putting Mr. Villegas to trial assisted by appointed counsel despite Mr. Villegas\u2019s insistence that retained counsel be allowed to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">After Mr. Villegas\u2019s case was set for trial, he informed the trial court that he wished to plead guilty, and the court set a hearing to accept his plea on the day on which the trial had been set to begin. When Mr. Villegas appeared on that day, however, he indicated that he wished to proceed to trial, and asked that retained counsel (who was not present) be allowed to defend him. The court then set Mr. Villegas\u2019s case for a trial two days later and indicated that Mr. Villegas\u2019s retained counsel would be allowed to represent him at trial if retained counsel entered an appearance. On the day set for trial, Mr. Villegas\u2019s retained counsel did not appear, and Mr. Villegas went to trial with the court-appointed counsel who had been representing him. According to Mr. Villegas, retained counsel refused to appear because he had not had adequate time to prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Mr. Villegas correctly points out that a person accused of crime has a right under the sixth amendment to retain counsel of his or her choice, and that the right is violated regardless of whether a defendant invoking it can show that not having counsel of his or her choice worked to his or her actual disadvantage. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>759 F.2d 1316, 1326-27 (8th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 994, 106 S.Ct. 406, 88 L.Ed.2d 357 (1985). But we have held that the right must nevertheless yield to concerns of efficiency and order, <em>see id. </em>at 1326, and in this instance Mr. Villegas\u2019s request that retained counsel be allowed to represent him came on the very day on which his case had been set for trial. While Mr. Villegas argues that it would not have caused any substantial inconvenience to the court to postpone the trial to a later date, we are mindful of a district court\u2019s duty to assure that the public\u2019s business is, so far as reasonably possible, tended to in an expeditious way. For this reason, we see no abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Swinney, </em>970 F.2d 494, 499-500 (8th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1011, 113 S.Ct. 632, 121 L.Ed.2d 563 (1992), 507 U.S. 1007, 113 S.Ct. 1650, 123 L.Ed.2d 271 (1993), in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of Mr. Villegas\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-15\">.
