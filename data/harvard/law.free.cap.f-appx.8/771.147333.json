The Honorable John M. Duh\u00e9, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The County of Los Angeles appeals the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Plaintiff-Appellee Valariea Harps in her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that she was wrongfully arrested. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we REVERSE. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we do not recount it here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">The County argues that the district court erred in awarding Harps attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement because the parties never entered into a binding settlement agreement. This Court relies on basic principles of state contract law in interpreting a settlement agreement. <em>Jeff D. v. Andrus, </em>899 F.2d 753, 759 (9th Cir.1989). California law requires mutual assent of the parties to form a valid contract. <em>Meyer v. Benko, </em>55 Cal.App.3d 937, 127 Cal. Rptr. 846, 848 (Cal.Ct.App.1976). Whether mutual assent existed is determined by objective criteria, the test being what the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">The parties here had discussed attorneys\u2019 fees in previous settlement offers and, based on the offers made and rejected, these fees were a material part of the negotiations. Thus, without the parties\u2019 mutual assent as to whether the settlement waived such fees, there is no enforceable contract. <em>Id. </em>At the time of the settlement conference at issue, neither Harps nor her attorney had seen the terms of the release that Harps was required to sign as a condition of the settlement. Counsel for the County agreed to submit the release to Harps and stated that if there were any problems with it they could discuss and hopefully resolve them. Considering (1) the previous offers rejected over the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, (2) that Harps and her attorney had not seen the general release, and (3) that the parties did not discuss attorneys\u2019 fees in the challenged settlement conference, compels an objective conclusion that there was no mutual assent and no enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Harps also argues that the County\u2019s position on appeal that there is no agreement is inconsistent with the County\u2019s previous attempt to enforce the agreement. We disagree. The agreement the County sought to enforce required Harps to sign its general release form that waived attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court expressly struggled over whether there was an enforceable agreement. This is entirely consistent with the County\u2019s argument on appeal that if what it understood to be the terms of the agreement were not the actual terms, then there was no meeting of the minds of the parties and, thus, no enforceable agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-16\">.
