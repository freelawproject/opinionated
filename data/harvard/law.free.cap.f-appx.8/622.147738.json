In this appeal, we must decide whether the district court exceeded the scope of our previous remand, and if the district court plainly erred by enhancing Ramon Sandoval-Barajas\u2019s sentence on the basis of a prior aggravated felony that had not been alleged in the indictment or proved at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Sandoval-Barajas initially appealed his sentence, claiming that his previous Washington state conviction for being an alien in possession of a firearm was not an aggravated felony for federal sentencing purposes. We agreed, and remanded his case to the district court, stating: \u201cBecause Sandoval-Barajas\u2019s Washington state conviction was not an aggravated felony for federal sentencing purposes, this case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sandoval-Barajas, </em>206 F.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">This was a general, not a limited, remand. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Washington, </em>172 F.3d 1116, 1117-18 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>153 F.3d 1037, 1043 (9th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Pimentel, </em>34 F.3d 799, 800 (9th Cir.1994). Following a general remand, the district court \u201cmay consider any matter relevant to the sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Ponce, </em>51 F.3d 820, 826 (9th Cir.1995). Therefore, the district court properly considered whether Sandoval-Barajas\u2019s sentence could be enhanced on the basis of a different prior aggravated felony, such as his 1996 Washington state felony drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Moreover, the district court did not plainly err in enhancing Sandoval-Barajas\u2019s sentence on the basis of his 1996 state felony drug conviction, even though that conviction had not been alleged in the indictment or proved at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.200).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
