Duncan, </em>No. 00 Civ. 1856 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Figueroa\u2019s petition was originally before Judge Griesa who issued an order to show cause as to why the petition was not barred by AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. Figueroa explained that he had encouraged his attorney, David J. Goldstein, to file a federal habeas petition on his behalf within the statute of limitations, and submitted copies of two letters from Figueroa to Mr. Goldstein. It is clear from this submission that Figueroa appreciated that he had one year from the denial of state post-conviction relief within which to file a federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Figueroa\u2019s conviction became final prior to April 24, 1996 (the effective date of AEDPA) and he therefore had until April 24, 1997 to timely file his petition. <em>See Ross v. Artuz, </em>150 F.3d 97, 102 (2d Cir. 1998). This period was tolled while Figueroa\u2019s application for state post-conviction relief was pending, <em>i.e. </em>until the denial of Figueroa\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment in state court pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10, on April 24, 1997. Therefore, at most, Figueroa had until April 24, 1998 to file his federal habeas petition. Figueroa concedes that his petition \u2014 filed on October 18,1999 \u2014 was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">Figueroa asks that the statute of limitations be equitably tolled \u2014 and his petition heard on the merits \u2014 because he relied on his attorney to file his federal habeas petition and, when his attorney failed to do so, was forced to file it pro se. \u201cEquitable tolling applies only in the \u2018rare and exceptional circumstance[ ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. McGinnis, </em>208 F.3d 13, 17 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Turner v. Johnson, </em>177 F.3d 390, 391-92 (5th Cir.1999)). In addition, the petitioner must demonstrate that he acted with reasonable diligence during the period he seeks to have equitably tolled. <em>See Warren v. Garvin, </em>219 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>F.3d 111, 113-14 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Smith, </em>208 F.3d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We agree with the district court that Figueroa failed to demonstrate that \u201cextraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his petition on time.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>208 F.3d at 17. There is no evidence in the record that Mr. Goldstein ever agreed to file a federal habeas petition on Figueroa\u2019s behalf or that Mr. Gold-stein obstructed Figueroa from filing the petition pro se at an earlier time. Figueroa was not entitled to an attorney on collateral review, <em>see Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987); <em>Bloomer v. United States, </em>162 F.3d 187, 192 (2d Cir.1998), and therefore cannot rely on suggestions of ineffective assistance to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
