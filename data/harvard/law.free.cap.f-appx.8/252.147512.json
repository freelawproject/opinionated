He filed motions for leave to file a supplemental claim and to dismiss the indictment on July 21, 2000. Without any action by the district court as of October 23, 2000, Wheeler filed the petition for writ of mandamus in this court. Pursuant to Fed.RApp.P. 21(b), on February 22, 2001, we ordered the district court to respond to the mandamus petition within thirty days. On April 10, 2001, the district court entered judgment granting the \u00a7 2255 motion in part and denying it in part. Therefore, the requested relief is now moot and we deny the petition on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">We grant Wheeler\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented.in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED AS MOOT.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
