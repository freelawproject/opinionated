Zamora-Rivera contends that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it is illegal to impose a sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) based upon a prior felony to which he did not admit, and which was not submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Zamora-Rivera also contends that <em>Apprendi </em>limits <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor and not a separate offense), because Zamora-Rivera did not admit to an aggravated felony, and it was not proven to a jury. These arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir. 2000), <em>amended </em>(Feb. 8, 2001) (order). <em>United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020,1024 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">Zamora-Rivera\u2019s request for this court to defer submission pending resolution of the petition for writ of certiorari in <em>Pacheco-Zepeda </em>is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AEh\">.
