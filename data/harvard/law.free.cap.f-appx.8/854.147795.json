Hernandez, Leslie R. Scales, and Hunter Robinson Hernandez appeal the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss their claims under federal and state law brought after the tragic death of five-year-old Forrest Hernandez. Because the appellants do not state a claim under federal law for which relief could be granted, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-22\">The appellants\u2019 claims brought pursuant to the citizen suit provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972, failed to comply with the statute\u2019s pre-filing notice requirements. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6972(b)(1)(A). Prefiling notice is \u201ca mandatory condition precedent for suit,\u201d and failure to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>compels dismissal. <em>Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, </em>493 U.S. 20, 26, 110 S.Ct. 304,107 L.Ed.2d 237 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 fail to allege sufficient facts to show an unconstitutional policy or custom by Mendocino County. <em>See Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The complaint also fails to allege unconstitutional official conduct. In order for the appellants to have a proper claim of unconstitutional denial of access to the courts, they must show that an official coverup \u201cactually rendered all state court remedies ineffective.\u201d <em>Delew v. Wagner, </em>143 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir.1998) (requiring that a party bring an action in state court and fail because of official misconduct before having a claim under \u00a7 1983). If the appellants had filed a wrongful death action in state court and lost because of the destruction of evidence by various officials, they may have had a colorable claim that their due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Because the district court properly dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction, it properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims brought under state law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
