This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-21\">Seeking monetary and injunctive relief, Ely sued the Tennessee Department of Corrections and multiple prison officials contending that he was denied medical treatment, that he was having \u201cmany of his civil rights\u201d broken, that the prison\u2019s grievance system should be managed by neutral outsiders, that prisoners should not be charged twenty cents per page for photocopies, and that prisoners should not be charged thirty-five cents for a first class stamp. The district court dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">On appeal, Ely argues that he should have been allowed to amend his complaint before it was dismissed, that he fears that he may be subjected to retaliation as a result of bringing his suit, and that since filing his lawsuit, his psychiatric drug has been reduced so he will \u201cfall weak to suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The district court\u2019s order is reviewed de novo. <em>See McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The district court properly dismissed Ely\u2019s suit as frivolous. Ely contends that he should have been allowed to amend his complaint before it was dismissed. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, a district court is required to screen all civil cases brought by prisoners to determine if the complaint is frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 608. If the case is frivolous, the case must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>As Ely\u2019s complaint is frivolous, the district court properly dismissed the complaint without allowing Ely to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Ely speculates that he might be subjected to retaliation for filing his suit. To establish standing, a prospective plaintiff must demonstrate an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that it is both \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and is \u201cactual or imminent.\u201d <em>Barden Detroit Casino, L.L.C. v. City of Detroit, </em>230 F.3d 848, 854 (6th Cir.2000). As Ely merely speculates that he could suffer a future injury by unidentified individuals, his argument does not establish an injury in fact necessary to maintain a cause of action. The argument is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Ely states that his medication has been reduced since he filed his suit and he feels this action will cause him to \u201cfall weak to suicide.\u201d This argument concerns an event which occurred after Ely\u2019s suit was filed, and it was not presented to the district court. Therefore, the issue is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See Foster v. Barilow, </em>6 F.3d 405, 407 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">As for the remaining issues raised in Ely\u2019s complaint in the district court, but not raised on appeal, these issues are considered abandoned and not reviewable on appeal. <em>Boyd v. Ford Motor Co., </em>948 F.2d 283, 284 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
