Zatkoff, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Reginald L. Warren appeals a district court judgment dismissing his habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In August 1993, Warren pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, to using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The district court sentenced Warren to 120 months of imprisonment. Warren did not appeal his judgment of conviction and sentence. In September 1994, Warren filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied, and Warren\u2019s subsequent appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In August 1995, Warren filed a \u201cmotion for order to release,\u201d which the district court denied. On appeal, this court construed his motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate and affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment denying relief. In September 1998, this court denied Warren permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate in which he sought to raise a claim in light of the decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In his current habeas corpus petition filed in August 1999, Warren claimed that he is actually innocent of the \u00a7 924(c) conviction because he did not use a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision narrowly defining \u201cuse\u201d in <em>Bailey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">The district court denied Warren relief under \u00a7 2241 concluding that Warren\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cuse\u201d as defined in <em>Bailey. </em>Accordingly, the district court dismissed Warren\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief. Warren appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">This court renders de novo review of a district court judgment dismissing a habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). Such review reflects that the district court properly dismissed Warren\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Under highly exceptional circumstances, a federal prisoner may challenge his conviction and imposition of sentence under \u00a7 2241, instead of \u00a7 2255, if he is able to establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (last clause in fifth paragraph); <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. It is the prisoner\u2019s burden to prove that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">Reviewing recent decisions that have invoked this savings clause, the Sixth Circuit in <em>Charles </em>concluded that the courts have done so essentially to permit prisoners to submit claims of actual innocence that would otherwise have been barred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. <em>See Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756-57. Because the petitioner had failed to submit a facially valid claim of actual innocence in <em>Charles, </em>the court withheld judgment as to whether a claim of actual innocence would permit a petitioner to have a \u201csecond bite of the apple.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757; <em>see also Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir.2000) (court declines to articulate circumstances when burden would be met because prisoner had a prior opportunity to present claims and he had not presented a claim of actual innocence); <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d 34, 52-53 (1st Cir.1999) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1176, 120 S.Ct. 1208, 145 L.Ed.2d 1110 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Warren has not satisfied his burden of showing that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, as he does not cite to an intervening change in the law or to any extraordinary circumstances which reflect that he may be actually innocent of his crime. In <em>Bailey, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u00a7 924(c) requires evidence sufficient to show that the defendant actively employed a firearm, using it as an operative factor in relation to the predicate offense. <em>Bailey, </em>516 U.S. at 148. \u201cUse\u201d of the firearm includes brandishing the firearm. Id. Warren contends that he did not \u201cuse\u201d a firearm because he mistakenly believed that thieves were breaking into his home to steal his drugs or drug proceeds when he brandished the shotgun. Warren admits that he obtained the shotgun in order to protect his drugs, that he picked up the sawed-off shotgun to protect his drugs and drug proceeds from a perceived threat, and that he brandished the shotgun as police officers entered his home to execute a search warrant. Warren clearly used the shotgun during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>89 F.3d 1306, 1313 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Warren\u2019s remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not rendered deficient for any other reason under the circumstances of this case. As the court explained in <em>Charles, </em>the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective simply because a petitioner has been denied relief under \u00a7 2255, because the petitioner has been denied permission to file a second or successive motion to vacate, or because the petitioner has allowed the one-year statute of limitations to expire. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756-58; <em>accord United States v. Lurie, </em>207 F.3d 1075, 1077-78 (8th Cir.2000). The remedy afforded under \u00a7 2241 is not an additional, alternative or supplemental remedy to that prescribed under \u00a7 2255. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
