The Honorable Richard H.

On June 29, 2000, following several sentencing hearings and a court ordered medical evaluation, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced Littlejohn to 262 months in prison. Littlejohn raises several issues on appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-21\">First, Littlejohn contends that because the district court failed to ask him at sentencing whether he affirmed or denied his previous conviction in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b), it was error for the court to enhance his sentence due to this previous conviction. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-22\">Our review of the record shows that the government served Littlejohn with an information and notice of prior conviction on October 13, 1999. See Joint Appendix at 26. After receiving this notice, Littlejohn failed to file a written denial of the prior conviction as is required by \u00a7 851(c)(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>and later declined to object to the inclusion of his previous conviction in the presentence report. Even now, Littlejohn does not argue that this convictions was invalid. In view of the government\u2019s notice, as well as Littlejohn\u2019s failure to file a written objection, we are satisfied that any error resulting from the district court\u2019s omission under \u00a7 851(b) was at most harmless error. <em>See United States v. Rounsavall, </em>115 F.3d 561, 566 (8th Cir.1997) (\u201cAll courts of appeals which have considered the question presently hold that failure to engage in the colloquy required by section 851(b) is subject to \u2018harmless error\u2019 analysis\u201d) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Romero-Carrion, </em>54 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Littlejohn next argues that his sentence was unconstitutionally and illegally imposed pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that \u201cincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\u201d must be included in the indictment and proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. This principle governs penalties for drug offenses listed in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). <em>See United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 930, 934 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600,148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000). Thus, if an indictment or jury verdict fails to specify the quantity of drugs involved, sentencing is limited by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which provides a statutory maximum penalty of twenty years or, if the defendant has a prior felony drug conviction (as in this case), thirty years. <em>See id. </em>at 930. Because Littlejohn\u2019s sentence of 262 months (21.8 years) does not exceed the 30 year statutory maximum provided in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(c), his sentence need not be redetermined under <em>Apprendi. See id. </em>at 934; <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>236 F.3d 968, 975 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Finally, Littlejohn\u2019s contention that <em>Apprendi </em>requires the indictment to have contained notice of his previous felony conviction is similarly without merit. The Court in <em>Apprendi </em>specifically excluded enhancements resulting from previous convictions from its holding. 530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63; <em>see also United States v. Rush, </em>240 F.3d 729, 731 (8th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-23\">. The Honorable Charles R.
