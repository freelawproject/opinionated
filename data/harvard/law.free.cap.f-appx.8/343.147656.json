Both parties have expressly waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">A jury found Slusher guilty of the single count described above. Her motion for a new trial, on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent with the evidence, was denied. The district court sentenced Slusher on January 14, 2000, to 70 months in prison and three years of supervised release. The total offense level included a two-level reduction for a minor role in the offense. An amended judgment was entered on January 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">On appeal, Slusher argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a new trial based upon insufficient evidence; (2) the district court abused its discretion by failing to reduce Slusher\u2019s offense level by four under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(a); and (3) the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.13 based upon diminished capacity. Upon review, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">Although Slusher\u2019s first issue specifically attacks the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial, which is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Hartsel, </em>199 F.3d 812, 815 (6th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1070, 120 S.Ct. 1679, 146 L.Ed.2d 487 (2000), it is clear that she is actually challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. When reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence this court determines \u201c \u2018whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Prince, </em>214 F.3d 740, 746 (6th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Haun, </em>90 F.3d 1096, 1100 (6th Cir.1996)), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 974, 121 S.Ct. 417, 148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>L.Ed.2d 322 (2000). Every reasonable inference is drawn in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>161 F.3d 977, 985 (6th Cir.1998). In addition, \u201c[s]ufficiency-of-the-evidence appeals are \u2018no place ... for arguments regarding a government witness\u2019s lack of credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>227 F.3d 686, 694 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>164 F.3d 989, 996 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1137, 119 S.Ct. 1793, 143 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1999)); <em>see also Miller, </em>161 F.3d at 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In order to obtain a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, \u201cthe government must prove the existence of an agreement to violate the drug laws and that each conspirator knew of, intended to join, and participated in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, </em>148 F.3d 577, 586 (6th Cir.1998). Proof of a formal agreement is not necessary; a tacit or mutual understanding will suffice. <em>United States v. Ledezma, </em>26 F.3d 636, 640 (6th Cir.1994). A conspiracy may be inferred from circumstantial evidence that can reasonably be interpreted as participation in the common plan. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the defendant need not have knowledge of every phase of the conspiracy; it is enough that she knew her criminal conduct was in some way connected to the success of the collective venture. <em>Gaitan-Acevedo, </em>148 F.3d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">When the proof presented at trial is examined in this light, it is clear that sufficient evidence does indeed exist to sustain Slusher\u2019s conviction. The testimony, particularly that of coconspirator Catherine Brock, is clearly sufficient to establish all of the elements for a drug conspiracy conviction. Recognizing this, Slusher argues that Brock\u2019s prior inconsistent statements rendered her trial testimony unreliable. However, as already noted, the issue of witness credibility is within the province of the jury which, in this case \u2014 and after cross-examination regarding the prior statements \u2014 chose to believe Brock. This court has found the testimony of one cooperating eoconspirator sufficient to sustain a conspiracy conviction. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>190 F.3d 483, 488 (6th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1118, 120 S.Ct. 940, 145 L.Ed.2d 817 <em>and </em>529 U.S. 1028, 120 S.Ct. 1440,146 L.Ed.2d 328 (2000). Slusher\u2019s first issue on appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Slusher next argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for a four-level reduction in offense level as a minimal participant under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(a). The defendant bears the burden of proving a mitigating role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>223 F.3d 377, 379 (6th Cir.2000). While this court has often stated that a district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating role reduction is reviewed for clear error, it has also explained that the two-part standard of review used in the context of aggravating role enhancements is equally appropriate in the context of mitigating role adjustments. <em>Id. </em>at 379-80. Under that approach, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error while its legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 380. Slusher cannot prevail under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">At sentencing, Slusher requested a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 as \u201ceither a minimal participant ... or a minor participant\u201d on the ground that all she did was to make an introduction. In its ruling, the district court noted that the government had no objection to a two-level minor-role reduction. The court stated, however, that it did not think either that Slusher qualified for a minimal role reduction or that her conduct fell between the two. The district court\u2019s finding that Slusher\u2019s role in the offense was minor rather than minimal is not clearly erroneous. To qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for a minor role reduction, \u201ca defendant must be less culpable than most other participants and substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Owusu, </em>199 F.3d 329, 337 (6th Cir.2000) (internal quotations omitted). The reduction for a minimal role is intended to cover those defendants plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the offense and should be used infrequently. <em>Ledezma, </em>26 F.3d at 646. In this case, Slusher was asked to find a buyer for approximately 1000 Tylox capsules and she did so. This transaction simply would not have taken place but for Slusher\u2019s involvement. Thus, the district court did not err in finding that, although Slusher\u2019s role was less culpable than that of the buyer and seller, it was not \u201cminimal,\u201d and warranted only a two-level reduction as a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Finally, Slusher argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.13 for significantly reduced mental capacity. This court has consistently held that \u201ca district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward is generally not appealable, unless the district court mistakenly believed it did not have legal authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>156 F.3d 638, 650 (6th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Henderson, </em>209 F.3d 614, 617 (6th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>144 F.3d 412, 418 (6th Cir.1998). \u201cWhere the district court\u2019s sentencing decision evinces a purposeful decision not to depart downward, however, it is not appealable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>144 F.3d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The district court\u2019s sentencing decision in this case clearly evinces a purposeful decision not to depart downward. The district court considered the evidence offered by Slusher in an attempt to show that she did not appreciate the wrongfulness of her actions. Nonetheless, the court concluded that, even taken all together, the evidence did not amount to a ground for departure under \u00a7 5K2.13. Because the district court did understand that it had the authority to depart but simply concluded that the facts did not warrant a downward departure, Slusher\u2019s final issue is not renewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
