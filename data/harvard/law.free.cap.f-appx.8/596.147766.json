Thomas completed his direct appeals and pursued state post-conviction remedies before petitioning for federal habeas relief. In dismissing his habeas petition as untimely, the district court held that' the time between the conclusion of Thomas\u2019s direct appeals and his application for post-conviction relief in state court counted against the section 2244 one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Under section 2244, a petitioner has one year after his direct appeals are concluded to file his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). In contrast, Iowa law allows a defendant three years in which to apply for post-conviction relief. Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 822.3 (West 1994). On appeal, Thomas contends that the federal statute of limitations did not begin to run until the completion of his state post-conviction proceedings. We recently rejected this argument in <em>Painter v. Iowa, </em>247 F.3d 1255 (8th Cir.2001), holding that \u201cthe time between the date that direct review of a conviction is completed and the date that an application for state post-conviction relief is filed counts against the one-year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1. The statute of limitations is tolled by the proper filing of an application for post-conviction relief, <em>id., </em>but the district court correctly included the period after the conclusion of direct review and before Thomas\u2019s application was filed in its calculation of the section 2244 time bar, <em>see id. </em>Thus, Thomas\u2019s habeas petition was properly dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-15\">.
