Pursuant to the government\u2019s recommendation, White was sentenced to time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">In this appeal, White challenges the voluntariness of his plea. He claims that the district court did not adequately inquire into the reason for his pleading guilty in light of his protestation of innocence two weeks earlier, when the district court refused to accept his plea. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 38, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">We conclude that here, the district court conducted an adequate inquiry into the reason for the guilty plea. The defendant was very familiar with the nature of the government\u2019s case against him, for there had already been two trials ending in mistrials. At this change of plea proceeding, the court asked the defendant directly to \u201ctell me what you did that satisfies you that you are guilty.\u201d The defendant responded that his plea was \u201cbased on the facts that the government presented at trial,\u201d and he believed that the government \u201ccan prove that I am guilty.\u201d The court then summarized exactly what the government would have to prove with reference to the facts of his case and the elements of the crime, and asked whether the defendant understood that he was \u201caccepting that the government can prove that beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The defendant responded that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">The reason for the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the plea is apparent. The plea allowed White to be sentenced to time served, while the presentence report recommended a far higher sentence of 70 months. The defendant was afforded all of the protections to which a defendant protesting innocence is entitled, even if we accept defendant\u2019s suggestion that the circumstances of his plea did not indicate that he was acknowledging guilt. See <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
