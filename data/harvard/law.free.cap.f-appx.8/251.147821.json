We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Beasley, </em>Nos. CR-94-122-F; CA-98-810-5-F (E.D.N.C. Sept. 28, 1999).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\"> We previously granted Beasley's petition for rehearing and placed his appeal in abeyance for <em>United States v. Jones, </em>No. 00-7249, 2001 WL 692281. We recently held, however, in <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 2001 WL 369719 (4thCir., 2001) (No. 00-6281), that the new rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Accordingly, the <em>Apprendi </em>claim Beasley asserted for the first time in his petition for rehearing in this appeal is not cognizable. We therefore remove this appeal from abeyance because we conclude <em>Sanders </em>is dispositive of Beasley\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
