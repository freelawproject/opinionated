He appeals the imposition of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, claiming that the enhancement of his sentence on account of his prior felony drug conviction was improper because the government failed to comply with the procedural requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851; that his prior conviction was not a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1); and that his prior conviction had not become \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). Finding no merit to any of Soto\u2019s claims, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">In early 1997 a joint task force of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies began investigating cocaine trafficking in the Chattanooga area. One target of the investigation, Alex Freeman, used a cocaine supplier based in Los Angeles named Henry Mitchell. When Freeman decided to cooperate with the investigation, he consented to the taping of a three-way conference call between himself, Mitchell, and Soto, who also lived in the Los Angeles area and supplied cocaine to Freeman through Mitchell. During this conversation Soto informed Freeman that he wished to continue supplying him so long as Freeman, who owed both Mitchell and Soto money, repaid his debts and could travel to Texas to pick up the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">After this conversation Mitchell traveled to Chattanooga to arrange a transaction, and law enforcement officers videotaped his activities and persuaded him to cooperate with the investigation. Mitchell made a recorded telephone call to Soto and informed him that he was in Chattanooga and everything was proceeding as planned. Mitchell returned to California, accompanied by several law enforcement officers, and began negotiating his next purchase from Soto. When negotiations broke down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>because of Mitchell\u2019s debt to him, Mitchell repaid Soto, a transaction captured on videotape. Eventually, in February 1999 Mitchell made a controlled purchase of approximately three kilograms of cocaine from Soto. When Soto retrieved the narcotics for delivery to Mitchell, investigators arrested him as he transported the cocaine. Though prior to his arrest Soto had never set foot in Tennessee, his recorded conversations with Mitchell show that he knew he supplied drugs that reached Freeman in Chattanooga.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">For sentencing purposes, investigators also developed evidence that during 1998 Soto stored 40 kilograms of cocaine at Mitchell\u2019s house in California. Further, agents learned of another 1998 transaction between Mitchell and Soto involving 10 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Proceedings in the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">After execution of the plea agreement, prosecutors filed a document with the court on July 26, 1999, styled: \u201cNotice of Intent to Use Prior Conviction to Enhance Punishment.\u201d This notice identified Soto\u2019s prior conviction as \u201cFelony Possession of a Controlled Substance for Sale and Possession of Marijuana for Resale which occurred on or about February 25, 1997, in Santa Ana, California, Orange County Superior Court, Case # 96CF2565.\u201d According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), this conviction followed Soto\u2019s arrest for selling methamphetamine and marijuana to a confidential informant, and Soto served 365 days in jail for this offense and was then placed on probation for three years. Additionally, the notice referenced 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 as the statutory authority pursuant to which the prosecution sought enhancement of Soto\u2019s sentence. On July 27, 1999, the district court arraigned Soto and accepted his guilty plea. At this hearing the district court informed Soto that he faced a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment and ten years of supervised release. After acknowledging the possible sentencing range Soto pleaded guilty, and the court accepted the plea as knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Upon receipt of the PSR, Soto filed two objections. First, he asserted that the government had failed to comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 for providing notice of intent to use a prior conviction to enhance a sentence. Second, he maintained that his prior conviction had not become final for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) and so could not enhance his sentence. Soto pressed these arguments before the district court at sentencing to no avail. He raised an additional objection during the sentencing hearing-also to no avail-that the prior conviction was not for an offense for which 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 requires enhancement. With respect to the section 851 argument, the court concluded that, although the parties disagreed about the adequacy of the PSR\u2019s description of the offense for which Soto was previously convicted, Soto had received sufficient warning of the government\u2019s intent to use his 1997 California conviction to enhance his sentence and adequate opportunity to contest the existence and validity of the conviction. Further, the court ruled that the conviction was a prior felony offense that had become final for purposes of federal law. Because the PSR calculated a guideline sentencing range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment, the court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence allowed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">I. Section 851 Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 subjects persons convicted of conspiracies to violate federal drug laws to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>formed the object of the conspiracy. When an individual has a prior drug-related felony conviction, violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), which prohibits distribution or possession of controlled substances, carries an enhanced penalty. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Specifically, \u201c[i]f any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>To avail itself of this enhancement, however, the government must comply with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">(1) No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">(2) An information may not be filed under this section if the increased punishment which may be imposed is imprisonment for a term in excess of three years unless the person either waived or was afforded prosecution by indictment for the offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">These requirements are mandatory, and a district court cannot enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on a prior felony drug conviction unless the government complies with them. <em>United States v. King, </em>127 F.3d 483, 487 (6th Cir.1997). The sufficiency of an information under section 851 presents a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 575 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Section 851 does not specify the particular form that notice of enhancement must take. <em>King, </em>127 F.3d at 490 (Martin, C.J., dissenting) (quoting <em>United States v. Belanger, </em>970 F.2d 416, 419 (7th Cir. 1992)). Likewise, \u201cthe statute is also silent on the specificity with which the government must identify prior convictions.\u201d <em>Layne, </em>192 F.3d at 576. We have explained the central purpose of section 851 as fulfilling due process requirements. <em>King, </em>127 F.3d at 488-89. \u201cTherefore, the proper inquiry is whether the government\u2019s information provided the defendant reasonable notice of its intent to rely on a particular conviction and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted). We have also emphasized the importance of interpreting the notice requirement of section 851 so as to avoid elevating form over substance. <em>Layne, </em>192 F.3d at 576. <em>See also United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cPractical rather than technical considerations govern resolution of indictment challenges and we will not reverse for minor deficiencies which do not prejudice the accused.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Although he cites no authority for the proposition, Soto maintains that in order to use his prior conviction to enhance his sentence for the instant offense, section 851(a)(2) requires the government to present the prior conviction to a grand jury and obtain an indictment. However, we have interpreted the additional safeguards of section 851(a)(2) as a requirement that the government prosecute the instant federal offense by indictment, rather than the prior offense, to avail itself of the enhanced mandatory minimum penalty. <em>United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, </em>148 F.3d 577, 594 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Against this background, Soto\u2019s argument that the government has not complied with the mandatory terms of section 851 because it did not charge the enhancement by indictment must fail. As this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>court has explained in both <em>Layne </em>and <em>King, </em>a section 851 information suffices if it provides reasonable notice of and an opportunity to be heard regarding enhancement. <em>Layne, </em>192 F.3d at 576; <em>King, </em>127 F.3d at 488-89. Here, Soto does not dispute that he has had adequate opportunity to challenge the enhancement despite receiving notice of the government\u2019s intent to invoke the mandatory minimum penalty of section 841(b)(1) shortly after executing the plea agreement. Sentencing did not occur for another three months, and the district court sought assurances at the sentencing hearing that Soto knew of the enhanced penalty and still desired to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Instead, Soto appears to focus on the adequacy of the notice in that the government did not proceed by indictment or accurately describe his prior conviction. Soto\u2019s attack on the adequacy of notice risks elevating form over substance. \u201cThat the information was titled \u2018Notice\u2019 instead of \u2018Information\u2019 ... is of no significance since the defendant was aware of the convictions that would be used in connection with an [sic] \u00a7 851 sentence enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>79 F.3d 413, 426 (5th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Section 851(a)(2) requires only that the government prosecute by indictment the instant offense, for which it seeks enhancement, not that a grand jury charge a prior felony drug conviction by indictment. Soto\u2019s argument that section 851 demands notice in the form of an indictment reads a requirement into the statute that its language does not support<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ignores the practical difficulty that until preparation of a PSR the government may not know of a defendant\u2019s prior felony drug convictions. As for the accuracy with which the government described Soto\u2019s prior conviction, the defendant neither asserts that the government relied on some prior conviction other than the one listed in the PSR nor contests the existence of the prior conviction on which the government relied to enhance his penalty. Accordingly, to the extent Soto takes issue with the government\u2019s description of his prior conviction, his challenge goes not to notice under section 851, but to whether his prior conviction constitutes a prior felony drug conviction for purposes of section 841(b)(1), the question to which we next turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">II. \u201cFelony Drug Offenses\u201d Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In addition to the notice requirements of section 851, availability of the mandatory minimum sentence of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) depends on a defendant\u2019s \u201cpri- or conviction for a felony drug offense [that] has become final[.]\u201d Soto contends that his prior conviction does not constitute a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d for purposes of section 841. Title 21 defines \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant .substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Soto\u2019s 1997 California conviction satisfies this definition. According to the PSR, whose factual findings the district court adopted and whose accuracy Soto affirmed at his sentencing hearing, Soto was convicted on two counts of \u201cSale of Controlled Substance\u201d resulting from sales of methamphetamine and marijuana to a confidential informant. This activity falls squarely within the definition of \u201cfelony drug of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>fense\u201d in section 802(44), and Soto does not contest that this conviction carried a possible punishment of more than one year in prison under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Rather, Soto relies on <em>United States v. Casarez-Bravo, </em>181 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir. 1999), to argue that his conviction does not constitute a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d There, the Ninth Circuit determined that the California statute that formed the basis for Soto\u2019s prior conviction will not support sentencing a defendant under the career offender provision of the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, using the categorical approach of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 588-89, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), because the state law punishes a broader range of conduct than the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1077-78. Not only does <em>Casarez-Bravo </em>interpret a statutory definition not at issue in this case, this court does not employ a categorical approach to determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d for purposes of section 841(b)(1). Even if we did, section 802(44) defines \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d broadly to encompass any offense that \u201cprohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs[.]\u201d This breadth contrasts with the language of the career offender guideline, which limits its application to certain specifically identified acts, such as manufacture, import, export, or distribution of narcotics. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. Accordingly, although in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view the career offender guideline does not reach a prior conviction under the California statute pursuant to which Soto was previously convicted because \u201ca defendant could be convicted under [the California law] without committing one of the qualifying controlled substance offenses delineated in \u00a7 4B1.1,\u201d <em>Casarez-Bravo, </em>181 F.3d at 1078, this analysis does not apply to the broader statutory language of section 802(44). Therefore, <em>Casarez-Bravo </em>offers no support for Soto\u2019s argument that his prior conviction does not constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of section 841(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">III. Finality of Prior Convictions for Purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Section 841(b)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence applies only when a defendant\u2019s prior felony drug offense \u201chas become final.\u201d This phrase\u2019s meaning presents a question of federal, rather than state, law. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>160 F.3d 1078, 1093 (6th Cir.1998). Although the statute does not define the term \u201cfinal,\u201d this court has held that \u201ca prior conviction is \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of section 841(b) when the time for taking a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction has expired.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Soto contends that his prior conviction was not final within the meaning of section 841(b)(1) because \u201cit is a mailer [sic] of ancient and well settled principles that a grant of probation in California is not a \u2018final judgment.\u2019 \u201d Although this proposition remarkably finds support in the California courts, <em>e.g., People v. D\u2019Elia, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 764, 167 P.2d 253, 254 (1946) (\u201cAn order granting probation is not a judgment.\u201d), we need not plumb the mysterious vagaries of California law to determine the finality of Soto\u2019s prior state court conviction because federal law assigns finality to any prior conviction when the time for taking an appeal from that conviction has expired. <em>Walker, </em>160 F.3d at 1093. Whatever else California law might say about the effect of probation on the finality of a judgment, one thing is certain: a \u201cprobation order is considered to be a final judgment only for the limited purpose of taking an appeal therefrom.\u201d <em>People v. Howard, </em>16 Cal.4th 1081, 68 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>870, 946 P.2d 828, 832 (1997) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Soto does not maintain that the time for appealing his California conviction had not expired prior to his participation in the conspiracy giving rise to his present conviction under federal law. Therefore, Soto\u2019s prior state court conviction \u201chas become final\u201d within the meaning of section 841(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Soto\u2019s prior conviction had \u201cbecome final\u201d and constitutes a \u201cprior felony drug conviction\u201d within the meaning of section 841(b)(1). We also think that the government complied with the notice requirements of section 851. Therefore, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\">. Indeed, because section 851(a)(2) precludes filing an information unless prosecution proceeds by indictment or indictment was waived, the statutory language contemplates an information rather than indictment as the procedural vehicle for providing notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
