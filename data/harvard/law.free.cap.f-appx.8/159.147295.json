Stephenson appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action in which he sought clarification of the Defendants\u2019 interpretation of provisions of his pension plan. The district court dismissed the complaint after determining that Stephenson lacked standing to bring such action. Because Stephenson does not challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s order, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if Stephenson could establish the first two <em>Olano </em>prongs \u2014 that the district court\u2019s determination was erroneous and that such error was plain, he cannot demonstrate the third element of the plain error analysis because his substantive claim fails on the merits. <em>See Gallo v. Amoco Corp., </em>102 F.3d 918, 922 (7th Cir.1996) (plan administrators are not required to provide the \u201creasoning behind the reasons\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of this action. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
