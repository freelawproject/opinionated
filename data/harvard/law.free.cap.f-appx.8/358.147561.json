Scoville\u2019s report and recommendation and the district court\u2019s order adopting that report fully state the reasons why Widger\u2019s petition should be denied, the issuance of a detailed written opinion by this Court would be unduly duplicative. Accordingly, for the reasons articulated below, we AFFIRM the order of Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Robert Holmes Bell of the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan denying the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
