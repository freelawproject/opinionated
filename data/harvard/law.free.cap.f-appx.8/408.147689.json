Defendants argue that (1) police used observations obtained unlawfully from within Defendants\u2019 curtilage in obtaining the search warrant, (2) the warrantless use of a thermal imaging device violated the Fourth Amendment, and (3) the court erred in ruling that Defendants had not met their burden of proof under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), with respect to three challenged statements in the affidavit used to obtain the warrant. The United States argues that even if Defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights were violated, the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant is sheltered from exclusion by <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">During 1997, Detective Mark Cool of the Kentucky State Police (\u201cKSP\u201d) was investigating indoor cannabis operations in Boyle County, Kentucky. On June 11, 1997, Jason Stephens, who was suspected of operating an indoor cannabis facility, informed Detective Cool that he had obtained marijuana from \u201cJohn and Cathy,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who also operated an indoor facility on their Tank Pond Road property.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Detective Cool contacted Sheriff Karl Luttrell of the Boyle County Sheriffs Office and learned that marijuana-related complaints had been made about John and Cathy Black, who lived in the Tank Pond Road area. Detective Cool also contacted Trooper George Canter of the KSP who confirmed that he had received similar complaints concerning Defendants. Finally, Detective Cool spoke with Detective Rick Ledford of the KSP, who, using information provided by the DEA, confirmed that Cathy Black had purchased equipment commonly used in indoor marijuana production.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">That night, Detective Cool sent officers to Defendants\u2019 rural residence for further investigation. Defendants\u2019 house, which sits about one-fourth of a mile from their property line, is reached by Chestnut Grove, a private road. Past the house, a two or three car-length driveway intersects Chestnut Grove and leads to a carport. Beyond the driveway, Chestnut Grove runs to the shed which was the subject of the officers\u2019 investigation. The shed is approximately five feet from the carport, at least fifty feet from the house, and three to five feet from Chestnut Grove. Chestnut Grove continues past the shed to the next tract of land, but consists only of two trenches worn by the tires of vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">When the officers dispatched by Cool arrived at Defendants\u2019 property on June 11, 1997, they parked their vehicles on Chestnut Grove near the carport. Thus, the officers were within approximately five feet of the shed, but over fifty feet away from the house. The officers then made several observations from their vehicles. First, a bright light emanated from within the shed, and Trooper Tony Perkins, Trooper George Canter and Detective Ledford testified that they could see marijuana plants through a crack in the wall of the building. Detective Ledford and Trooper Perkins, who were both familiar with marijuana odor, also testified that they could smell marijuana from the vehicle. Finally, a thermal imaging survey revealed significant amounts of heat escaping from the shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">The officers secured the scene and obtained a search warrant. The affidavit in support of the warrant contained the information obtained from Stephens, as well as the confirmation by Boyle County authorities and Trooper Canter that marijuana-related complaints had been lodged against Defendants. It stated that DEA records confirmed that Defendant Cathy Black had purchased equipment used for growing marijuana indoors. An attachment to the affidavit also recited the officers\u2019 observations upon arriving at Defendants\u2019 residence, and the results of the thermal imaging survey. The ensuing search produced a total of 620 marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>plants inside two out-buildings on Defendants\u2019 property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">On August 7, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Defendants. Count One charged them with manufacturing over one hundred marijuana plants. Count Two charged them with aiding and abetting in the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Count Three sought the forfeiture of Defendants\u2019 real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On August 15, 1997, Defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. On September 2, 1997, Defendants filed a joint motion to suppress. The court denied the motion, and shortly thereafter Defendants sought to change their plea. On the day of their re-arraignment, Defendants filed a supplemental motion to suppress and a motion to reconsider, which the court subsequently denied. Defendants then entered conditional guilty pleas to Counts One and Two, and agreed to forfeit the property set forth in Count Three. On January 16, 1998, Defendants were each sentenced to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment under the safety valve provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">On May 11, 1999, this Court vacated the district court\u2019s order denying Defendants\u2019 motion to suppress and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Black, </em>No. 98-5155, 1999 WL 357759 (6th Cir. May 11, 1999) (unpublished per curiam). We reasoned that Defendants were entitled to a hearing on essentially five issues: (1) whether Jason Stephens\u2019 tip had been misrepresented by the police in the application for a search warrant, (2) whether the officers present at the Black residence actually smelled marijuana from their vehicles, (3) whether the officers actually saw marijuana plants through a crack in the wall of the shed, (4) whether the officers made their observations from within the curtilage of the home, and (5) whether the thermal scan of the shed violated Defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at *3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing on July 30 and August 3, 1999. Subsequently, the court denied Defendants\u2019 motion to suppress in a written Opinion and Order. The court concluded that (1) Defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights had not been violated because the portion of Chestnut Grove from which the officers made their observations was not part of the curtilage of Defendants\u2019 residence, and (2) Defendants had not met their burden under <em>Franks </em>of establishing that the information in the affidavit was knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. Notably, the court also concluded that the even without the thermal imaging evidence, the facts contained in the affidavit were sufficient to justify the warrant. Therefore, the court did not consider whether the use of the thermal imager itself violated Defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">We first address Defendants\u2019 contention that the court erred in denying their motion to suppress because the police used unlawful observations made from within Defendants\u2019 curtilage in procuring the search warrant. Defendants argue that the officers\u2019 observations from Chestnut Grove, including the thermal image scan, were made from within the curtilage of their home, which by definition is the area \u201cso intimately tied to the home itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>that it should be placed under the home\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019 of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 301, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987). If the observations were made from within the curtilage, Defendants assert that these observations were illegal, and therefore tainted the affidavit. Defendants assert, under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, that this taint requires suppression of the evidence gathered in the search conducted pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We reject Defendants\u2019 argument, and we note that in so doing, we need not even reach the question of whether the officers\u2019 observations came from within the curtilage of Defendants\u2019 home. Rather, under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, the question we must address is whether, despite any impermissibly tainted factual averments in the affidavit, the warrant nevertheless issued upon probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Herrold, </em>962 F.2d 1131, 1138 (3d Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Vasey, </em>834 F.2d 782, 788 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that \u201c[t]he mere inclusion of tainted evidence in an affidavit does not, by itself, taint the warrant or the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant.... A reviewing court should excise the tainted evidence and determine whether the remaining, untainted evidence would provide a neutral magistrate with probable cause to issue a warrant\u201d). If probable cause did exist even without consideration of the challenged observations, then Defendants\u2019 argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings on a motion to suppress for clear error, and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. United States v. Leake, </em>998 F.2d 1359, 1362 (6th Cir.1993). Although we owe no particular deference to the conclusions of the district court, which sat as a reviewing court, we must pay \u201c \u2018great deference\u2019 \u201d to the state judge\u2019s findings, which \u201c \u2018should not be set aside unless arbitrarily exercised.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1362-63 (quoting <em>United States v. Pelham, </em>801 F.2d 875, 877 (6th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct, 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983))). \u201c\u2018[L]ine-by-line scrutiny [of an underlying affidavit is] ... inappropriate in reviewing [a state judge\u2019s] decisions.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Allen, </em>211 F.3d 970, 972 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230 n. 14). Notwithstanding, the state judge must have been neutral, detached and more than a mere rubber stamp for the police. <em>United States v. King, </em>227 F.3d at 739 (citing <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 111, 84 S.Ct. 1509,12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Here, apart from the challenged observations, the affidavit included the tip provided by Jason Stephens, who was under investigation for growing marijuana indoors. As described in the affidavit, Stephens stated that he had \u201cobtained\u201d mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>juana from \u201cJohn and Cathy,\u201d who grew marijuana indoors at their Tank Pond Road area residence. In <em>Allen, </em>211 F.3d 970 (6th Cir.2000), this Circuit recently addressed the role that an informant\u2019s tip may play in the probable cause determination. In such cases, we must examine factors which, although not \u201c \u2018separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case,\u2019 \u201d should be weighed in assessing the value that should be afforded to the tip. <em>Allen, </em>211 F.3d at 973 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230). \u201cThese factors, which consist of the \u2018veracity\u2019 or \u2018reliability\u2019 as well as \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of the tip, are relative where the strength of one factor may compensate for the deficiency of another.\u201d <em>King, </em>227 F.3d at 740 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230-32). In other words, \u201c[the] determination does not lend itself to the application of \u2018[r]igid legal rules,\u2019 and no one decision may serve to provide a definitive basis upon which to rely inasmuch as \u2018informant\u2019s tips, like all other clues and evidence ... may vary greatly in their value and reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>King, </em>227 F.3d at 739 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 232). At bottom, based on the information presented, the judge must be able to independently determine probable cause; his determination cannot merely ratify the \u201cbare conclusions\u201d of others. <em>Id.; Allen, </em>211 F.3d at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Although Stephens was not named in the affidavit, he was described as a \u201csuspect\u201d of the ongoing investigation. Thus, it was clear to the reviewing judge that Stephens was known to the affiant, and that his tip bore more indicia of reliability than if it had been made anonymously. Additionally, it is significant for purposes of veracity and reliability that in the process of implicating Defendants, Stephens made statements against his own penal interest. <em>United States v. Southern, </em>No. 99-1736, 2000 WL 1769633, at *4 (6th Cir. Nov. 16, 2000) (unpublished). We think that such statements are inherently more truthful and reliable than statements which do not implicate the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In addition to the indicia of reliability inherent in Stephens\u2019 tip, we also note that it was corroborated by independent police investigation. Detective Cool contacted Sheriff Luttrell and Trooper Canter, both of whom confirmed that they had received \u201ccomplaints\u201d that John and Cathy Black, who lived in the Tank Pond Road area, had been cultivating marijuana indoors. Although no specific complaints were identified, the mere confirmation that a \u201cJohn and Cathy\u201d lived in the Tank Pond Road area lends some credibility to Stephens\u2019 information. Moreover, Detective Cool contacted Detective Ledford, a specialist in indoor marijuana operations, who corroborated Stephens\u2019 tip against information provided by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, which indicated that Cathy Black had previously purchased equipment used for the indoor production of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Given the totality of the circumstances, we find on these facts a substantial basis for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing even without consideration of the officers\u2019 observations at Defendants\u2019 residence prior to obtaining the warrant. Although Defendants claim that Stephens\u2019 information was not \u201cfirst hand,\u201d this alone is not dispositive for purposes of a probable cause determination, which may be based entirely on hearsay, so long as a substantial basis exists for crediting the hearsay. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 269-70, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960); Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(c)(1) (stating that a warrant may issue based on hearsay in whole or in part). Taking into consideration Stephens\u2019 tip, which went against his own penal interest and was corroborated by the local sheriff and another Kentucky State Police officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>as well as information supplied by the DEA, the state judge had a substantial basis for crediting Stephens\u2019 tip, and could independently determine probable cause. Therefore, the district court properly determined that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not require exclusion of the evidence obtained from Defendants\u2019 property pursuant to the warrant. As a result, we decline to address the United States\u2019 argument that the officers are entitled to good faith immunity under <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Next, we consider whether the court erred in concluding that Defendants failed to demonstrate, under <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), that the information in the affidavit supporting the warrant was knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. A defendant must prove this assertion by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 156. If the burden is satisfied, then the false information is extracted from the affidavit and the remaining information is reexamined to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a finding of probable cause is still supported. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Defendants make three separate arguments concerning the <em>Franks </em>hearing: (1) that Detective Cool lied in the affidavit about the \u201ctip\u201d he had received from Jason Stephens; (2) that the officers lied about smelling marijuana from their vehicle; and (3) that the officers lied about seeing marijuana through a crack in the wall of the shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Because we have concluded that the affidavit supported a finding of probable cause even without consideration of the information gathered at Defendants\u2019 residence, we need only address Defendants\u2019 argument that Detective Cool lied in the affidavit about the \u201ctip\u201d he had received from Jason Stephens. Specifically, as noted above, the affidavit stated that Stephens had \u201cobtained\u201d marijuana from individuals known to him only as \u201cJohn and Cathy,\u201d who were growing marijuana indoors on their property located in the Tank Pond Road area. Later, however, Stephens testified that the affidavit misrepresented the information he had given to the police. Stephens maintained that he never told Cool that he had actually \u201cpurchased\u201d marijuana from Defendants, but only that he had obtained marijuana from someone who had obtained it from \u201cJohn and Cathy\u201d in the Tank Pond Road area. Thus, Defendants assert that Cool lied about the nature of the evidence, inasmuch as the affidavit characterizes it as \u201cfirst-person\u201d knowledge rather than \u201csecond-hand\u201d knowledge. Defendants also point to the police report, which states that Stephens admitted to having \u201cpurchased\u201d marijuana from \u201cJohn and Cathy\u201d within the past week.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">The district court concluded that, for <em>Franks </em>purposes, there was no discernible difference between \u201cobtaining\u201d marijuana directly from \u201cJohn and Cathy\u201d via sale or gift, and smoking marijuana with someone else who had obtained it from them. The court noted that \u201ceither way, Jason Stephens possessed marijuana once owned by \u2018John and Kathy.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the court concluded that Defendants had not established that the statement was knowingly false or made with reckless disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">We affirm the district court on this issue. Nothing in Stephens\u2019 testimony is inconsistent with Detective Cool\u2019s statement in the affidavit because Stephens had, in fact, obtained marijuana from Defendants. Simply that Detective Cool used the term \u201cpurchased\u201d in the police report does not suggest that he lied or recklessly disregarded the truth in the affidavit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Nor do we believe that the mere fact that Stephens may have obtained marijuana from Defendants indirectly, rather than directly, demonstrates that Detective Cool lied or was reckless in drafting the affidavit. Therefore, we affirm the determination that Defendants failed to meet their burden under <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Defendants also contend that the mere use of the thermal imaging device, regardless of whether it was used from within the curtilage of their residence, by itself constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we have concluded that the affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause even without the information gathered at Defendants\u2019 residence, we decline to address Defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\">. At various points in the record, Defendant Cathy Black is referred to as \"Kathy\u201d or \"Kathy Black.\u201d For purposes of consistency, she is referred to in this opinion solely as \"Cathy\u201d or \"Cathy Black.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. Plants were located in the shed observed by the officers, as well as on the second floor of a \"block building\u201d used to store farm equipment, which was situated within five feet of the shed, approximately at the point where Chestnut Grove disintegrated into \"two ruts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\">. The contours of probable cause have been established by Supreme Court precedent, and have been dutifully explored by other panels within this Circuit. Our task is to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the state court judge had a substantial basis for concluding that \"a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>227 F.3d 732, 739 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). In reviewing the affidavit, we do not look for \"magic words,\u201d and we judge it based \"on the adequacy of what it does contain, not what it lacks, or on what a critic might say should have been added.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>211 F.3d 970, 974 (6th Cir.2000). Stated differently, the judge must \" 'make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \"veracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying the hearsay information,\u2019 probable cause exists.\u201d <em>King, </em>227 F.3d at 740 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\">.

Because we have decided the case at bar on other grounds, we need not issue a stay pending the outcome of <em>Kyllo.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b444-8\">HARRY W. WELLFORD,</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">HARRY W. WELLFORD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">This is a difficult case which has occupied a district judge and concerned this court over a considerable period of time. It involves a close question regarding the extent of curtilage in a rural area, probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant, and other issues concerning the legality of a search of rural outbuildings by Kentucky police.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">I. <em>CURTILAGE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">Defendants challenge the observations and thermal imaging conducted by police officers in the course of their investigation of defendants because allegedly they took place within the curtilage of the defendants\u2019 home prior to issuance of the contested search warrant. I would affirm the district court\u2019s analysis of this issue, first to the effect that the relevant portion of Chestnut Grove Road used by the officers to make observations was not within the curtilage. Thus, evidence of the observations made, the smelling of marijuana, and thermal imaging from the road did not take place within the curtilage, and were therefore properly taken into account by the judge issuing the warrant. Although the issues are close, I find no error in this curtilage determination by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">II. <em>PROBABLE CAUSE (APART FROM THERMAL IMAGING)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">I concur also in this court\u2019s decision that the informer\u2019s tip, especially as a \u201csuspect\u201d in area drug operations, \u201ccorroborated by independent police investigation\u201d (apart from thermal imaging), including the officers\u2019 observations at the scene, furnished sufficient probable cause under the totality of the circumstances for the state judge\u2019s issuance of the search warrant. Apart from the thermal imaging survey by detective Ledford, I conclude that the actions of the officers, as set out by the district court, were: (1) based upon adequate and reasonable police investigation; (2) based upon a totality of circumstances indicating probable cause to believe that defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>were engaged in an illegal marijuana operation; and (3) were not reckless, arbitrary, flagrant, dishonest, nor even negligent. That much of the information obtained about defendants was based upon hearsay does not render the information unreliable under the circumstances. The affidavit of detective Cool adequately set forth the background circumstances in his affidavit for a search warrant. It describes the location of the property to be searched in detail, together with outbuildings purportedly possessed by defendants. The affidavit was adequate for the judge\u2019s determination of probable cause for the search, again apart from any thermal imaging utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">III. FRANKS <em>CHALLENGE TO AFFIDAVIT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">After conducting a <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), hearing, mandated upon remand, the district court found no demonstrated violation by detective Cool of the Kentucky State Police of the <em>Franks </em>requirements. I agree with our conclusion of the correctness of the district court\u2019s finding that defendants failed to show either \u201cdeliberate falsehood or ... reckless regard for the truth\u201d in the submission of the challenged affidavit. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">IV. <em>THERMAL IMAGING</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The court, in <em>United States v. Ishmael, </em>48 F.3d 850 (5th Cir.1995), considered the government\u2019s use of thermal imaging in investigating marijuana production in outbuildings in a remote, rural area. <em>Ishmael </em>found the practice to be constitutional, not an unreasonable invasion of privacy in somewhat comparable circumstances to those involved in this case. In that case, the defendant attempted to conceal the marijuana activity, and he, like the Blacks, exhibited subjective expectations of privacy. The Fifth Circuit found no constitutional violation in the use of the thermal imaging device under those circumstances and reversed the district court\u2019s suppression of evidence obtained by the use of the device. <em>Ishmael, </em>48 F.3d at 856; <em>see also United States v. Myers, </em>46 F.3d 668 (7th Cir.1995), and <em>United States v. Ford, </em>34 F.3d 992 (11th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See also the earlier case of <em>United States v. Pinson, </em>24 F.3d 1056 (8th Cir.1994), reaching the same conclusion. The Ninth Circuit joined the chorus of agreement on the issues in <em>United States v. Kyllo, </em>190 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. granted, </em>530 U.S. 1305, 121 S.Ct. 29, 147 L.Ed.2d 1052 (2000). <em>Compare United States v. Cusumano, </em>67 F.3d 1497, 1504 n. 11 (10th Cir.1995), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>83 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir. 1996) (en banc), as noted in <em>United States v. Elkins, </em>95 F.Supp.2d 796 (W.D.Tenn. 2000) (expressing a distinctly minority view).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">I am persuaded by the virtuously unanimous authority on the thermal imaging issue that the use of this equipment did not violate defendants\u2019 constitutional rights with respect to the outbuildings on the subject property. I would add this evidence, therefore, to the other evidence addressed in considering whether there was probable cause for the search under the totality of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">V: <em>APPLICABILITY OF </em>LEON</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\"><em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1983), decided that \u201cevidence obtained by offers acting in reasonable reliance on a search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>issued by a detached and neutral magistrate\u201d may be admissible in a criminal trial even if \u201cultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 900, 104 S.Ct. 3405. The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Leon </em>considered the tension in such cases between \u201cunreasonable invasions of privacy\u201d and admission of \u201cevidence which exposes the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 900-01 (quoting <em>Alderman v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 165,175, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969)). Like the instant case, <em>Leon </em>included drug involvement of a defendant who challenged the basis for the search warrant involved, because it was \u201cdevoid of information establishing the informants\u2019 reliability\u201d and because the information contained in the affidavit was stale and \u201cthese deficiencies had not been cured by police investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><em>Leon </em>considered or assessed, in making its analysis as to admissibility of evidence of illicit drug conduct, despite the aforesaid deficiencies in the search warrant process, \u201cthe flagrancy of the policy misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911. It also considered whether in that process the search had been made in \u201cgood-faith rebanee\u201d on the warrant, comparable to a good-faith arrest by a police officer based upon his rebanee upon an apparently valid statute. <em>Id. </em>at 911. <em>See Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO-\">Reasonable minds frequently may differ on the question whether a particular affidavit establishes probable cause, and we have thus concluded that the preference for warrants is most appropriately effectuated by according \u201cgreat deference\u201d to a magistrate\u2019s determination. <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S.[410,] 419[\u201e 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969)]. See <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236; <em>United States v. Ventresca, supra, [3</em>80 U.S. 102,] at 108-109[\u201e 85 S.Ct. 741,13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 914, 104 S.Ct. 3405. The issuing magistrate must, however, have \u201ca substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause; <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 915, 104 S.Ct. 3405, looking to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Leon </em>emphasized both that \u201cthe exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct\u201d and \u201cthe extreme sanction of exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 916. Finally, the Court in <em>Leon </em>observed that it was only in the \u201cunusual case\u201d that exclusion of evidence would \u201cfurther the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918. Such rule of exclusion \u201ccannot be expected: ... to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 919. \u201cWhere the official action was pursued in complete good faith, however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its value.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>422 U.S. 531, 539, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 45 L.Ed.2d 374 (1975), <em>quoted in Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 919.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Not only must the officer\u2019s conduct be in objective good faith in this situation, his \u201creliance on the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of the warrant ... must be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922. More than that, the courts must look to whether the officers in this case acted in a \u201cdishonest\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d fashion in preparing the affidavit in question, or that they could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>reasonably have believed there was probable cause to effect the search at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Applying the aforesaid principles from the landmark <em>Leon </em>decision, I believe that the evidence obtained of illegal marijuana production in the Black outbuilding should not have been excluded. The following findings of the district court with respect to the actions of the Kentucky police and the issuance of a warrant by Kentucky Judge Shewmaker demonstrate that these actions were taken in good faith and were objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">VI. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The district court was not in error in overruling defendants\u2019 motion to suppress for all of the reasons stated. In addition, I would hold the thermal imaging under the circumstances not to have violated defendants\u2019 constitutional rights. Finally, I would hold that the actions of the police met the <em>Leon </em>reasonable good-faith standards. Accordingly, I concur in affirming the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">. The Eleventh Circuit reiterated this result in <em>United States v. Robinson, 62 </em>F.3d 1325 (11th Cir.1995), noting no contrary authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-5\">. The government\u2019s petition for certiorari presented the question whether, under the Fourth Amendment, \"evidence seized in reasonable good faith reliance on a search warrant that is subsequently held to be defective\" should be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 905, 104 S.Ct. 3405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\">. The Court applied an objective test of the good faith of police officers particularly \u201cwhen an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 920, 104 S.Ct. 3405.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b447-8\">MOORE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHi\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">I would hold that the officers\u2019 observations came from within the curtilage of defendants\u2019 home. Nonetheless, I agree with the per curiam opinion that we need not resolve that issue, or the question of thermal imaging, in this case. After excising the portions of the affidavit relating to thermal imaging and the officers\u2019 observations from the curtilage, I must conclude that the non-tainted averments in the affidavit were adequate under current Sixth Circuit precedents to provide probable cause for issuing the warrant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
