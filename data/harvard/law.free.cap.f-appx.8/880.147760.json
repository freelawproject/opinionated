The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Petitioner Terry L. Hedger appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his counseled habeas petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) before his appeal can proceed before this court. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). Because the district court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for a COA, petitioner must demonstrate \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d before a COA can issue. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">In his habeas application before the district court, petitioner asserted four claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his criminal trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contended that counsel was ineffective for failing to 1) request a self-defense instruction, 2) object to testimony by Detective Allen concerning an overheard conversation between petitioner and his attorney, 3) investigate the availability of additional witnesses to events before the shooting, and 4) object to certain statements and declarations made by his wife. The district court rejected these issues on the merits. On appeal, he has abandoned the ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on counsel\u2019s alleged failure to adequately investigate the availability of additional witnesses, but adds another claim of error, contending that the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim concerning Detective Allen\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Our review of petitioner\u2019s appellate arguments, along with the record on appeal, including decisions of the state appellate court and the district court, in light of the applicable law convinces us that, for the substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its decision denying habeas relief, petitioner has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-18\">.
