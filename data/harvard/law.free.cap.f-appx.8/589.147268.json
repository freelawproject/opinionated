The agency\u2019s decision was not arbitrary or capricious. See 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.2(a) (2001) (definition of farmed wetland pasture); <em>Downer v. United States, </em>97 F.3d 999, 1002 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (court looks to whether agency considered all factors Congress intended it to consider, whether agency considered factors Congress did not intend it to consider, and whether there is lack of rational connection between facts found and decision made). We have considered Prokop\u2019s due process arguments and conclude that they fail, also for the reasons laid out in the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\">. The Honorable Richard G.
