He filed a notice of appeal, but his counsel now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming that any appeal would be frivolous. Pursuant to Circuit Rule 51(b), Cruz was notified that he could respond to his attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>has not done so. After reviewing the record only as it relates to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, <em>see United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583 (7th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551 (7th Cir.1996), we agree that an appeal would be frivolous. We therefore grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The first potential basis for appeal identified by counsel is whether Cruz could challenge the validity of his guilty plea on the ground that the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. Because Cruz did not move to withdraw his plea in the district court, we would review this issue only for plain error. <em>United States v. Driver, </em>242 F.3d 767, 769 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Having reviewed the transcript of the change of plea hearing, we agree with counsel\u2019s conclusion that the district court substantially complied with the procedures set forth in Rule 11. The court informed Cruz of the nature of the charge against him, the maximum and minimum penalties, and the rights he would give up by pleading guilty. The court further explained that imprisonment would be followed by supervised release and questioned Cruz to ensure that his plea was not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from the plea agreement. In short, there is nothing in the Rule 11 colloquy to suggest that Cruz\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary, and we therefore conclude that any appeal based on the validity of the plea would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We also agree with counsel\u2019s conclusion that Cruz has no nonfrivolous challenge to his sentence. First, Cruz cannot challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his total offense level because the court simply adopted the calculation that Cruz stipulated to in his plea agreement. <em>United States v. Fiore, </em>178 F.3d 917, 925 (7th Cir.1999). And Cruz has no nonfrivolous challenge to his criminal history category\u2014the district court determined that Cruz had no prior convictions and therefore placed him in criminal history category I. Cruz\u2019s sentence was also within the applicable guideline range, and so he has no basis for appeal on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">For the above reasons, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED. Cruz\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
