Adu-Beniako alleges that Maimonides violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>by making him work longer hours than other residents, harassing him, and not offering him a second-year resident position, on account of his national origin, race, and color, and in retaliation for his statements that \u201cMaimonides was killing its patients.\u201d Maimonides responds that it did not offer him a second-year resident position due to Adu-Beniako\u2019s behavioral problems, and denies all other allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">When Maimonides filed a motion for summary judgment, Adu-Beniako failed to oppose the motion. His counsel, however, appeared on the date the court had set for oral argument, and asked the court to allow him to file his opposition out of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">In its July 31, 2000, memorandum and order, the court denied that request, concluding that counsel\u2019s proffered excuse for failing to file an opposition in the time allotted \u2014 that he had been on a religious retreat and had been ill \u2014 was \u201cmeritless.\u201d <em>Adu-Beniako v. Maimonides Med. Ctr., </em>No. 97-CV-0693 (JG), at 6 (E.D.N.Y. July 31, 2000). The court then deemed the facts set forth in Maimonides\u2019s Rule 56.1 statement as admitted, and granted summary judgment in favor of Maimonides. <em>Id. </em>at 6-12. The court concluded that: (1) because Adu-Beniako had not asserted any facts in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, he had neither established a prima facie case of unlawful termination or disparate treatment nor proved that Maimonides\u2019s proffered reason for the termination and alleged disparate treatment was pretextual; (2) Adu-Beniako had not submitted any evidence in support of his hostile work environment claim; (3) Adu-Beniako\u2019s retaliation claim was not cognizable under Title VII because \u201c \u2018telling people the hospital was killing people\u2019 is not \u2018protected\u2019 within the meaning of Title VII as it does not concern any issue of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Adu-Beniako argues that the district court should not have denied his counsel\u2019s request for an extension of time, and that triable issues of fact exist which preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(2) provides that district courts may grant extensions of time in procedural matters such as this upon a showing of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d This Court reviews decisions to grant, or not to grant, such an extension for abuse of discretion. <em>Davidson v. Keenan, </em>740 F.2d 129, 132 (2d Cir.1984). After a thorough review of the record, we have concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Adu-Beniako\u2019s request for an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mazzola, </em>175 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.1999). We affirm the court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum and order, <em>Adu-Beniako </em>at 4-12, with the following exception: with respect to Adu-Beniako\u2019s retaliation claim, to the extent that Adu-Beniako contends that he was retaliated against due to his protected opposition to discrimination, we conclude that the claim is without merit because such opposition occurred after the non-renewal of his contract and Adu-Beniako has not shown that he was subjected to any adverse employment actions prior to that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
