Miller argues on appeal that the sentencing court erred in enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction because the government failed to comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. Specifically, he alleges that the information that the government filed identified a prior conviction for possession of heroin, although Miller had actually been convicted for possession of Lysergic Acid. We affirm the dismissal of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Valdez-Pacheco, </em>237 F.3d 1077 (9th Cir. 2001), controls. In <em>Valdez-Pacheco, </em>we held, on similar facts, that \u201ca federal prisoner may not challenge a conviction or sentence by way of a petition for a writ of audita querela when that challenge is cognizable under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1080. The writ of audita querela is only available to \u201cfill the interstices of the federal postconyiction remedial framework.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1079 (quoting <em>Doe v. INS, </em>120 F.3d 200, 203 (9th Cir.1997)). In that case, because Valdez-Pacheco\u2019s challenge to the government\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 851 was cognizable under a \u00a7 2255 habeas petition, we held that the writ of audita querela was unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-18\">In this appeal, Miller asserts claims which not only are cognizable under \u00a7 2255, but were addressed on the merits in a prior \u00a7 2255 petition. Therefore, the writ of audita querela is not available and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the district court correctly dismissed Miller\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
