Hobbs, </em>98 F.Supp.2d 287, 289-91 (E.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-21\">Pollack raises four issues on appeal: (1) the district court erred in declining to recuse itself in the instant habeas action; (2) the district court erred in employing a procedural default analysis to Pollack\u2019s claim that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the arson charge; (3) the one year limitations period for bringing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions renders that provision inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention; and (4) the district court erred in finding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the arson count of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-24\">We conclude that the district court did not err in declining to recuse herself in this case. First, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 47, which precludes federal appellate judges from hearing appeals of cases over which they presided as district court judges, is inapplicable to this situation. Second, Pollack has set forth no facts that would warrant disqualification Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, although Pollack brings this peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tion under \u00a7 2241, the usual practice by which a federal prisoner challenges his sentence, a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, specifically envisions that the \u201ccourt which imposed the sentence\u201d will review the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Next, we conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pollack\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition was proper. As the district court concluded, Pollack failed to demonstrate, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate or ineffective vehicle to test the legality of his conviction. <em>See Pollack, </em>98 F.Supp.2d at 292; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Here, Pollack simply failed to apply for relief under \u00a7 2255 within the limitations period. This Court has clearly stated that \u00a7 2241 is not available in all cases where \u00a7 2255 is either unavailable or unsuccessful; instead, only those situations where the unavailability of \u00a7 2255 would raise serious constitutional questions is \u00a7 2255 rendered inadequate to test the legality of a prisoner\u2019s detention. <em>See Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir.1997). Denying Pollack collateral review where \u00a7 2255 is unavailable because of his failure to abide by the statute of limitations provision does not raise any serious constitutional questions; therefore, \u00a7 2241 is not available to Pollack.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Because we conclude that Pollack is thus barred from pursuing relief under \u00a7 2241, we need not reach his remaining arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">(b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-25\">(1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding....</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
