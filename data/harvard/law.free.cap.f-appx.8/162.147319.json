Nwandu, a citizen of Nigeria, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-22\">Danish authorities found 692 grams of heroin in Valentine C. Nwandu\u2019s (\u201cNwandu\u201d) possession when he attempted to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ter Denmark using a fake Nigerian passport issued in the name of Valentine Azuka Hayes in February 1983. On May 17, 1983, Nwandu was convicted of the offense of heroin smuggling and sentenced to a period of four years incarceration. Denmark deported Nwandu to Nigeria in June 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In July 1985, Nwandu fraudulently obtained a student visa to enter the United States by failing to reveal his prior drug trafficking conviction in Denmark. Subsequently, he married an American citizen and, after his student visa had expired, filed a visa petition and an application for adjustment of status. On May 11, 1994, while this adjustment application was pending, Nwandu applied for and was granted advance parole to leave the United States in order to attend his father\u2019s funeral in Nigeria. Advance parole permitted Nwandu to leave the United States without abandoning his application for adjustment of status. When Nwandu returned from Nigeria on May 31, 1994, he was \u201cparoled\u201d into the United States in accordance with the terms of his advance parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Shortly thereafter, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) conducted an investigation on Nwandu\u2019s adjustment of status application, which included an adjustment interview on September 6, 1994. During this interview, Nwandu revealed his 1983 drug conviction for the first time. Nwandu was inadmissible to the United States due to, <em>inter alia, </em>his prior drug conviction in Denmark, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), and the fact that his initial entry into the United States as a student was obtained by fraud. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C). Consequently, in July 1995, the INS denied Nwandu\u2019s visa application. Later, in June 1996, the INS terminated Nwandu\u2019s parole status and placed him in exclusion proceedings pursuant to former section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226 (1995). Of special relevance to this appeal, Nwandu was charged with being inadmissible to the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) on account of his earlier drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">At an exclusion hearing, the Immigration Judge sustained that charge and found Nwandu to be excludable. Subsequently, Nwandu pursued an application for adjustment of status in conjunction with a request for waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Nwandu argued at this second hearing that his 1983 conviction in Denmark for smuggling heroin had been expunged, a claim belied by the government\u2019s ability to obtain \u2014 and provide to the Immigration Judge \u2014 a properly certified copy of a 1983 record of conviction for smuggling heroin under the name \u201cValentine <em>Chukvmdu </em>Nwandu.\u201d S.A. 8-13 (emphasis added). Nwandu offered into evidence only a 1999 Danish document purporting to state that \u201cNo entry appears in the Central Crime Register\u201d under the name \u201cValentine <em>Chukwuka </em>Nwandu.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> S.A. 22 (emphasis added). Based on the totality of the evidence, which included the conviction record, the criminal court\u2019s notation that Nwandu acted as a courier, and Nwandu\u2019s 1-485 application, in which he stated that he omitted mention of his conviction when obtaining his visa to come to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>States, the Immigration Judge found that, \u201cnotwithstanding the respondent\u2019s certificate of criminal record, which states that there is no criminal record pertaining to him, that the allegations contained in the amended Notice to Appear are sustained and that the respondent is excludable as charged.\u201d S.A. 4-5. Nwandu\u2019s application for adjustment of status was then pretermitted because no waiver is available under section 212(h) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), for a drug conviction involving heroin. S.A. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Nwandu timely appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA held that Nwandu had been properly placed in exclusion proceedings, that the Immigration Judge had properly found him excludable on account of his heroin smuggling in Denmark, and that his adjustment application was properly pretermitted. The BIA denied Nwandu\u2019s motion to reconsider, and he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Nwandu first argues that he was not subject to exclusion proceedings upon denial of his adjustment application and revocation of advance parole, and that, even if he was, he was given insufficient notice that he would be subject to exclusion proceedings if his petition for adjustment of status were denied. The relevant regulation, however, clearly states that an exclusion proceeding, not a deportation hearing, was the appropriate means for deciding Nwandu\u2019s status once his application for adjustment of status was denied. The regulation is unequivocal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">The departure of an [adjustment] applicant who is not under deportation proceedings shall be deemed an abandonment of his or her application constituting grounds for termination, unless the applicant was previously granted advance parole by the Service for such absence, and was inspected upon returning to the United States. <em>If the application of an individual granted advance parole is subsequently denied, the applicant will be subject to the exclusion provisions </em>of section 236 of the Act. <em>No alien granted advance parole and inspected upon return shall be entitled to a deportation hea\u00f1ng.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(4)(ii) (1994) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, once Nwandu\u2019s adjustment application was denied by the INS, Nwandu was subject to exclusion proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Nwandu also claims that he was given insufficient notice that he could be subject to exclusion proceedings. Nwandu\u2019s advance parole document provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-15\">[t]his authorization will permit you to resume your application for adjustment of status on your return to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-16\">\n<em>WARNING: Pursuant to 8 CFR 215.3(a)(2), if your application for adjustment of status is denied, you will be subject to exclusion proceedings under Section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">J.A. 110 (emphasis in bold in original).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While Nwandu\u2019s notice did cite to an incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>rect regulation, rather than to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(4)(ii), we find this to be of no legal significance given that the substance of the applicable regulation was clearly-conveyed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Nwandu provides no better support for his claim that additional protections were owed to him prior to the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to pretermit his application for adjustment of status and request for a section 212(h) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In the first place, as a statutory matter, we have no doubt that the Immigration Judge properly pretermitted Nwandu\u2019s adjustment application and request for waiver. In order to be statutorily eligible for adjustment of status, an applicant must be admissible to the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Nwandu was found inadmissible to the United States as a result of his Danish conviction for smuggling heroin. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No waiver exists for this ground of inadmissibility when the conviction at issue involves heroin. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (waiver allowed for conviction of simple possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Second, with respect to Nwandu\u2019s constitutional claim regarding expungement, we note that \u2014 even if the facts alleged presented a cognizable due process <em>claim </em>\u2014 we could find no due process <em>violation. </em>For the Immigration Judge did hear evidence with respect to the claimed ex-pungement of the Danish conviction and, weighing the evidence, resolved the issue in favor of the government. We could not say that the ample procedural protections afforded by the hearings before the Immigration Judge, Nwandu\u2019s opportunity to present evidence, and the review by the BIA, are constitutionally deficient, particularly where Nwandu himself cannot explain how he was prejudiced in fact, or what more he would do if given the opportunity. Indeed, even at the time of oral argument, Nwandu\u2019s counsel was unable to describe a single avenue he would pursue, action he would take, or information he expected to obtain, to strengthen his claim of expungement, beyond the evidence already presented to, and considered by, the Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">We need not resolve that issue, however, because, more fundamentally, an adverse ruling on Nwandu\u2019s claim of expungement \u2014 based on Nwandu\u2019s failure to present evidence sufficient to prove expungement to either the Immigration Judge or the BIA, both of whom found that Nwandu was convicted of smuggling heroin \u2014 presents no cognizable due process claim. Indeed, such an adverse ruling does not constitute any constitutional violation at all. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>We decline to review under the aegis of a habeas corpus petition pursuant to section 2241 what amounts to a factual finding by the Immigration Judge that a conviction for heroin smuggling was extant, not expunged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Bowrin v. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>194 F.3d 483, 490 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cOnly questions of pure law will be considered on \u00a7 2241 habeas review. Review of factual or discretionary issues is prohibited.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Nwandu also argues that because his guilty plea to possession for heroin in Denmark was tendered prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), our decision in <em>Tasios v. Reno, </em>204 F.3d 544 (4th Cir.2000), renders him eligible for discretionary waiver under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) (repealed 1996), even if he is not eligible for waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). In <em>Tasios, </em>we held that section 440(d) of AEDPA did not bar relief under former section 1182(c) for lawful permanent residents who pled guilty to aggravated felonies, or who conceded deportability prior to AEDPA\u2019s effective date, because it was impermissibly retroactive; under section 1182 as amended, discretionary relief is not available for aliens convicted of drug trafficking offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">However, AEDPA does not impose a similar retroactive effect in this case because Nwandu, unlike Tasios, and unlike the individual at issue in <em>St. Cyr v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>229 F.3d 406 (2d Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>531 U.S. 1107, 121 S.Ct. 848, 148 L.Ed.2d 733 (2001), has <em>never been </em>a lawful permanent resident, and section 1182(c)\u2019s discretionary relief was <em>never </em>available to him. Former section 1182(c) provides only that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alh\">Aliens <em>lawfully admitted for permanent residence status </em>who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)). Nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Attorney General to exercise the discretion vested in him under section 1181(b) of this title. The first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996) (emphasis added). Because Nwandu was never a lawful permanent resident, and never entitled to the benefit of former section 1182(c), <em>Tasios </em>simply does not dictate the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Nwandu implicitly acknowledges this, but argues that \u201c[although this section expressly applied to aliens who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>lawful permanent residents, [ ] its general principles and approach to deportation waivers <em>should </em>also apply\u201d in his case\u2014 even though he is not a lawful permanent resident. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 26-27. However, AEDPA\u2019s repeal of section 1182(c) cannot be seen, with respect to Nwandu, to \u201cimpair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed,\u201d because discretionary relief was not available to Nwandu prior to AEDPA either. <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 269, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). As a result, <em>Tasios </em>is unavailing for Nwandu.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-13\">. Nwandu was placed in exclusion proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, and his final order of exclusion was issued after October 30, 1996. Judicial review of his case is therefore governed by the transitional provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L.No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996). <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309 (stating that the transitional changes for judicial review are applicable to final orders of exclusion or deportation entered more than 30 days after the date of enactment of IIRIRA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. Nwandu is permanently barred from entering Denmark based on his conviction, J.A. 108 n. 1, and the Danish record of conviction also notes that Nwandu is a person in flight from prosecution in England for possession of five kilograms of hashish in 1982. S.A. 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\">. Nwandu\u2019s search may have been unsuccessful because the record of conviction used a different middle name than his records search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\">. In contrast, the regulation at issue in <em>Joshi v. INS, </em>720 F.2d 799, 804 (4th Cir. 1983) (discussing former 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3)), was held to provide that if an applicant was deportable before his authorized absence, he remained deportable after his return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-20\">. We also agree with the district court that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(4)(ii) (1994) was a legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00ed\u00f1ate exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s authority, and a valid regulation for purposes of placing Nwandu in exclusion proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">. While Nwandu seeks to rely on an earlier decision of this court where the notice of exclusion was deemed insufficient, the form provided in <em>Joshi, </em>720 F.2d 799, is clearly distinguishable from the one provided in this case. The form provided to Joshi was \"unintelligible,\u201d providing: \"However, you will then be considered an applicant for entry <em>and if your adjustment in expulsion proceedings </em>[sic].\u201d 720 F.2d at 802. Despite the incorrect citation in Nwandu's advance parole documents, Nwandu was clearly apprised that he would be subject to exclusion proceedings and <em>Joshi </em>\u2014 with its quite different notice and different applicable regulation \u2014 is inapposite. Moreover, unlike Joshi, Nwandu was represented by counsel at the time he received the advance parole warning. J.A. 181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-13\">. It has long been the case that a conviction for smuggling heroin renders an alien inadmissible to the United States, albeit under varying subsections within, and versions of, section 1182, and we have no doubt that Nwandu was inadmissible in 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. Even if the facts were otherwise, we are unconvinced that the expungement of a foreign drug-related conviction is effective to prevent a finding of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Under the statutory definition of \"conviction\u201d set forth in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), no apparent effect is given to court actions which purport to expunge, dismiss, cancel, vacate, discharge, or otherwise remove a guilty plea or other record of guilt or conviction. Nor do we believe that Nwandu's conviction for trafficking in heroin \u2014 an aggravated felony pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1101 </em>(a)(43)(B) \u2014 would be eligible for expungement pursuant to the Federal First Offender Act (\"FFOA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607, either. For section 3607 applies on its face only to violations of section 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 (possession) and only to offenses committed by persons less than 21 years-old at the time of the offense; Nwandu was convicted for smuggling heroin, and was 27 years old at the time of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">. Nwandu also argues that he is being improperly detained by the INS. However, since Nwandu was placed in exclusion proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, the detention provision of former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(e) (1995) is applicable. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a). That provision provides that because Nwandu is subject to a final order of exclusion and has been convicted of an aggravated felony, his detention pending removal is mandatory. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(e). We have reviewed Nwandu\u2019s other claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">. The INS claims that IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(A) divested the district court of habeas corpus jurisdiction. We are constrained to disagree based on settled law in this circuit, set forth in <em>Bowrin v. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>194 F.3d 483, 489 (4th Cir.1999) (habeas jurisdiction under section 2241 remains intact absent express congressional intent in the language of either AEDPA or the IIRIRA to eliminate it). The government's reliance, through negative implication, on section 1105a(b), which was made inapplicable to Nwandu by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(A), is misplaced because it does not constitute express congressional intent to eliminate section 2241 jurisdiction, and thus fails to meet the standard set forth in <em>Bowrin. </em>Consequently, federal habeas corpus review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 remains available to Nwandu, albeit only on questions of pure law (i.e., statutory and constitutional claims). <em>Bowrin, </em>194 F.3d at 490. For, while 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) and (c) do not expressly provide for habeas review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, neither do they expressly prohibit it, likely because they are concerned with procedures for the judicial review of orders on direct appeal, and not with habeas relief as provided by section 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
