The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> calculated an unobjected-to Guidelines imprisonment range of 210-262 months, and resentenced him to two concurrent 240-month prison terms on two of the counts, a consecutive 22-month prison term on the third count, and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Valentine\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Valentine has filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>argues that the court erred by imposing the 22-month consecutive sentence to achieve the total 262-month sentence because the statutory maximum prison term for each count was 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We reject Valentine\u2019s challenge to his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d); <em>United States v. Sturgis, </em>238 F.3d 956, 960-61 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Kroeger, </em>229 F.3d 700, 703 (8th Cir.2000). We have reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We deny as moot Valentine\u2019s request to proceed pro se on appeal, in light of the pro se supplemental brief that he has filed and we have considered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-34\">.
