This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">Seeking monetary and injunctive relief, Siddiq sued Assistant Deputy Wardens Darlene K. Edlund and Robert Woods; Resident Unit Managers (RUM) Karl Johnson, K. Kemp, and J. LaChance; and Case Manager James LeClaire, Siddiq alleged that: (1) Edlund and Woods violated his due process rights when they reclassified him to administrative segregation for three major misconduct violations; (2) all of the defendants prevented him from being reclassified to the general population; and (3) an RUM named Panjovich retaliated against him by filing a misconduct charge against him in June 1998. The magistrate judge granted Siddiq in forma pauperis status, screened the complaint, and recommended that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(b); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c). The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report over Siddiq\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-21\">In his timely appeal, Siddiq argues that: (1) mandatory language in the prison\u2019s administrative rules and policy directives created a liberty interest in the periodic review of his administrative segregation status; and (2) twenty months in administrative segregation constituted an atypical and significant hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Whether a district court properly dismissed a complaint in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) involves a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997). Siddiq alleges that: (1) the defendants placed him in administrative segregation; (2) performed only perfunctory reviews of his classification status; and (3) refused to return him to the general population despite his good behavior. With respect to each of these allegations, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Siddiq\u2019s complaint. First, his placement in administrative segregation did not constitute an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>see also Jones v. Baker, </em>155 F.3d 810, 812-13 (6th Cir.1998). Absent such a hardship, Siddiq cannot sustain his claim. <em>See Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293; <em>Jones, </em>155 F.3d at 812-13. Second, Siddiq\u2019s argument that mandatory language in the prison\u2019s administrative rules and policy directives required meaningful review of his classification status and created a due process right is without merit. The mandatory language of a prison policy no longer suffices to create a protected liberty interest. <em>See Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Because Siddiq\u2019s confinement to administrative segregation did not give rise to a liberty interest, the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to review his status did not either. Finally, Siddiq had no constitutional right to be returned to the general population. <em>See Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976); <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 224, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976). Without the deprivation of a federal right, Siddiq has no \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 155-57, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978); <em>Brock v. McWherter, </em>94 F.3d 242, 244 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Finally, we note that Siddiq also alleged that the RUM Panjovich retaliated against him because of Siddiq\u2019s involvement in an assault on a guard. As the district court held, Siddiq did not name Panjovich as a defendant and so had no claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Siddiq\u2019s complaint lacked an arguable basis in law, <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Because he \u201ccan prove no set of facts in support this claim which would entitle him to relief,\u201d <em>Mayer v. Mylod, </em>988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.1993), Saddiq has failed to state a claim. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
