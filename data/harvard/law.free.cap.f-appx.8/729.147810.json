The district court allowed the parties to file supplemental memoranda on standing. Plaintiffs complied with the district court\u2019s order and simultaneously filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b) to enlarge time for filing four additional declarations, which they attached to the motion. The district court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 reason for their delay was not \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d and denied the motion to enlarge time. Concluding that the one remaining declaration did not establish Plaintiffs\u2019 standing, the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiffs appeal the denial of their Rule 6(b) motion and the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We review a determination that a plaintiff lacks standing <em>de novo. Abboud v. INS, </em>140 F.3d 843, 846 (9th Cir.1998). We review the denial of a motion to enlarge time under Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>Kyle v. Cam/pbell Soup Co., </em>28 F.3d 928, 930 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">We have jurisdiction, and we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to enlarge time. As a result, we do not reach Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Under Rule 6(b), a court may afford a party relief from the effects of a missed deadline upon a proper showing of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 391, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993), clarified that the drafters did not indicate that they intended \u201canything other than the commonly accepted meaning of the phrase [\u2018excusable neglect\u2019].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Rule 6(b), the term \u201cis a somewhat \u2018elastic concept\u2019 and is not limited strictly to omissions caused by circumstances beyond the control of the movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392 (citations omitted). The Court urged a flexible reading so as not to \u201cignore the most natural meaning of the word \u2018neglect\u2019 \u201d and to avoid an interpretation that contradicted \u201cthe accepted meaning of that word in analogous contexts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394-95. The Court concluded that \u201cthe determination is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party\u2019s omission,\u201d refusing to read <em>Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, </em>497 U.S. 871, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), as restricting the inquiry to \u201cthe movant\u2019s culpability and the reason for the delay[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395 and n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>A district court must consider all the circumstances in deciding whether to excuse a party\u2019s neglect, notably \u201cthe danger of prejudice to the [nonmovant], the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Failure to consider the <em>\u201cPioneer </em>factors\u201d in circumstances like those here, where counsel\u2019s \u201cerrors resulted from negligence and carelessness, not from deviousness or willfulness!,]\u201d constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>See Bateman v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>231 F.3d 1220, 1225 (9th Cir.2000). The government has not argued (nor do we see) prejudice or bad faith on Plaintiffs\u2019 part. Moreover, the district court noted the case\u2019s rapid progress. Furthermore, the government conceded that at least one of Plaintiffs\u2019 new declarations demonstrated Plaintiffs\u2019 standing. We note that, at the time the district court decided Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to enlarge time, it did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Bate-man. Bateman </em>sets forth the correct procedure and standard, and, as in that case, we find that the equities here weigh in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. We therefore remand to the district court with instructions to grant the Rule 6(b) motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
