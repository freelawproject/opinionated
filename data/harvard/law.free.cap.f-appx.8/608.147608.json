He contends on appeal that the district court erred by not granting his petition for writ of habeas corpus based on his claim of juror misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">Bridgette contends that the district court erred by failing to conduct its own evidentiary hearing before rejecting the magistrate judge\u2019s credibility findings. We disagree. The district court did not disturb any of the magistrate judge\u2019s credibility findings, but rather concluded that much of the evidence considered by the magistrate was inadmissible under the rules of evidence. Moreover, the district court owed no deference to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the alleged jury misconduct was prejudicial because the issue represents a mixed question of law and fact which the district court reviews de novo. <em>Rodriguez v. Marshall, </em>125 F.3d 739, 744 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">Bridgette also challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that the jurors did not commit prejudicial misconduct. We agree with the district court that Bridgette has failed to carry his burden of showing that the jurors\u2019 conduct here rose to the level of impermissible extrinsic evidence. <em>See id. </em>(stating that the petitioner \u201cbears the burden of establishing that a constitutional error had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Brecht v.

Moreover, we agree with the state court that any \u201cpresumption of prejudice\u201d to Bridgette was rebutted by \u201cthe virtually uncontradicted evidence concerning the lighting in the apartment at the time of the shooting\u201d and by other \u201cfacts linking defendant to the commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atm\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <em>o\u00ed </em>this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
