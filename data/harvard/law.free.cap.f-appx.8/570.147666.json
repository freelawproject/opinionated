After de novo review, <em>see Lynn v. Deaconess Med. Ctr.W. Campus, </em>160 F.3d 484, 486 (8th Cir. 1998), we conclude the district court (1) properly granted summary judgment for the reasons stated in its order, <em>see Dennis v. Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 523, 525 (8th Cir.2000) (denial of leave to amend under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)); <em>Ghane v. West, </em>148 F.3d 979, 981-83 (8th Cir. 1998) (discrimination analysis); (2) did not err in striking portions of Pride\u2019s affidavit and exhibits, <em>see El Deeb v. Univ. of Minn., </em>60 F.3d 423, 428-29 (8th Cir.1995) (affidavits opposing summary judgment motion shall be made on personal knowledge, set forth such facts as would be admissible, and show affirmatively affiant is competent to testify); and (3) did not abuse its discretion in denying Pride\u2019s motion for reconsideration, see <em>Sanders v. Clemco Indus., </em>862 F.2d 161, 169 (8th Cir. 1988) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-19\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We grant MetLife\u2019s motion to strike portions of Pride\u2019s submission on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-15\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
