Mordue, <em>Judge).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The district court denied Hickman\u2019s petition after concluding that he was barred from arguing for the first time in a habeas petition that he was not afforded a speedy trial pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 <em>et seq. </em>The district court reached this conclusion because Hickman failed to raise the speedy trial issue on direct appeal and did not demonstrate cause for and actual prejudice from the omission. <em>See United States v. Canady, </em>126 F.3d 352, 359 (2d Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1134, 118 S.Ct. 1092, 140 L.Ed.2d 148 (1998). Alternatively, the district court denied Hickman\u2019s petition because the sufficiency of an indictment is not subject to collateral attack after conviction if it is not raised on direct appeal, unless the indictment is so defective as to deprive the court of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. LoFranco, </em>818 F.2d 276, 277 (2d Cir.1987) (holding that violations of a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial are non-jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo. <em>See Lurie v. Wittner, </em>228 F.3d 113, 121 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Maldonado v. Scully, </em>86 F.3d 32, 35 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Because Hickman did not raise the speedy trial issue on direct appeal or in a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, he can only succeed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 if the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We have concluded that a court must consider a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition when \u201cthe petitioner cannot, for whatever reason, utilize \u00a7 2255, and ... the failure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir.1997). Serious constitutional questions arise if a person who could prove his actual innocence on the existing record- and who could not have effectively raised his claim of innocence at an' earlier time-was denied access to a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Id. </em>at 377-80. Because Hickman does not assert that he is actually innocent and could have raised the speedy trial issue on direct appeal or in a timely \u00a7 2255 petition, he has failed to show that his case raises serious constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In addition, a federal prisoner who fails to raise an issue on direct appeal is procedurally barred from asserting it for the first time on habeas review unless he can show \u201ccause and actual prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 167-68, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). <em>See also Canady, </em>126 F.3d at 359-60. \u201cUnder this standard, to obtain collateral relief based on trial errors to which no contemporaneous objection was made, a convicted defendant must show both (1) \u2018cause\u2019 excusing his double procedural default, and (2) \u2018actual prejudice\u2019 resulting from the errors of which he complains.\u201d <em>Frady, </em>456 U.S. at 167-68. Because Hickman makes only conclusory allegations that he failed to pursue a direct appeal on the advice of his counsel, he fails to make the necessary showing of \u201ccause and actual prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
