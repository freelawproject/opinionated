They allege that \u2022Appellees violated their procedural and substantive due process rights by unlawfully assessing an obligation on Appellants\u2019 property. To wit, Appellants allege that the City of Sparks (the \u201cCity\u201d), in conjunction with the other Appellees, imposed a fee, or constructive lien, on Appellants\u2019 property for the widening of a storm drain and for the construction of a road adjacent to Appellants\u2019 property, all in excess of the City\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">The issue tendered to the district court was whether the statute of limitations had run on Appellants\u2019 claims. The complaint, filed in 1998, acknowledged that Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>lants were aware of the City\u2019s attempt to impose an obligation on Appellants\u2019 property through a license agreement with Centex Real Estate Corporation (\u201cCentex\u201d) as early as 1995. Thus, because this \u00a7 1983 action had to be brought within two years, the district court dismissed it as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">There is, however, a jurisdictional issue that must first be addressed. Appellants have not demonstrated that the agreement between the City and the other Appellees had any immediate economic impact on Appellants. That is so because the contemplated fees would be imposed on Appellants\u2019 property only if and when Appellants\u2019 property is annexed to the City. Thus, although both parties insist on arguing about lapsed limitations periods, the real concern is whether the case is ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We recognize that the ripeness issue was not fully developed by the parties either below or on appeal. Appellants cursorily hint at the ripeness issue in them brief by arguing that the statute of limitations on their claims could not have run because the \u201clien\u201d was not statutorily authorized, and thus was never properly perfected. Appellees counter that we may not entertain such argument because it contradicts Appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">However, because issues of ripeness involve, at least in part, the existence of a live \u201cCase or Controversy,\u201d we cannot rely upon concessions of the parties and must determine whether the issues are ripe for decision in the \u201cCase or Controversy\u201d sense. Further, to the extent that questions of ripeness involve the exercise of judicial restraint from unnecessary decision of constitutional issues, the Court must determine whether to exercise that restraint and cannot be bound by the wishes of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-10\"><em>Reg\u2019l Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 138, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Here, we conclude that the issues before the district court were not ripe. According to the record, no hen has yet been filed on Appellants\u2019 property. Appellants concede this point; \u201cCity, through the city council purportedly, through a License Agreement with Centex, on May 10, 1993, claims to have created a liability against Istrice and Istrice\u2019s property in the amount of $87,000 <em>when Istrice\u2019s property is annexed into the City of Sparks.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, Appellants recognize that imposition of the obligation is wholly dependent upon annexation. The record supports this position; every relevant document in the record indicates that Appellants\u2019 obligation would only take effect upon annexation of their property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City\u2019s counsel agreed with this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">At the time of the district court\u2019s decision, Appellants\u2019 property had not yet been annexed; thus, the obligation on them property had not yet been perfected. Consequently, all that existed was an agreement between the City and Centex, which may or may not ever have affected Appellants. After all, the City was under no legal obligation to annex Appellants\u2019 property. And, according to the representations of counsel for the City, had Appellants not desired to develop their property, that property would never have been annexed \u2014 thereby rendering any harm purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Accordingly, there was no actual or imminent economic impact on Appellants\u2019 property and no actual or imminent injury to Appellants. Hence, there was no Article III \u201cCase or Controversy before the district court when it entered judgment. <em>Cf. Stoianoff v. Montana, </em>695 F.2d 1214, 1223 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe mere existence of a statute, which may or may not ever be applied to plaintiffs, is not sufficient to create a case or controversy within the meaning of Article III.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Because we conclude that Appellants\u2019 claims had not yet accrued, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision. Because ripeness problems are generally jurisdictional in nature, dismissal is the usual appropriate disposition. Here, however, because we recognize that subsequent developments may have rendered the case ripe for adjudication,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because \u201cripeness is peculiarly a question of timing,\u201d <em>Reg\u2019l Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. at 140, 95 S.Ct. 335, we remand the case to the district court so that it may make that determination and proceed accordingly. Each party shall bear his or its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b872-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">. Although all of the documents confirm that the obligation would not arise until annexation, Appellants\u2019 counsel indicated at oral argument that the property was annexed <em>sans </em>obligation. Rather, according to counsel, the obligation would be due as a condition for the approval and filing of Appellants\u2019 subdivision map.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">. Appellants, through a request for judicial notice, intimated that the City has already annexed their property. The only document presented which could conclusively show annexation, however, is a <em>proposed </em>ordinance. We have no other document indicating whether or not Appellants' property has been annexed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
