Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-18\">Mega Contractors is a construction company that, among other things, manufactures asphalt. A1 Tucker, an African American, was hired in August 1996 by Mega as the plant operator for the Skippers, Virginia asphalt plant. Tucker was terminated in October 1997 and filed a Title VII complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in July 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">In August 1998, Mega responded to the EEOC\u2019s request for information. In that response, Mega explained that Tucker had been released due to lack of work resulting from the winter shutdown of the Skippers plant. In subsequent correspondence with the EEOC, Mega twice reiterated that Tucker was released due to lack of work. In April 2000, however, Mega came forward with a new explanation. Mega now claimed that Tucker was fired because of poor performance. Specifically, Mega claimed that Tucker had failed to adequately respond to an incident in October 1997 and that this had resulted in the loss of use of one of the two silos at the plant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The EEOC believed this new justification, coming deep into the litigation and nineteen months after the initial explanation, raised the possibility that both explanations were pretextual. Moreover, during its investigation, the EEOC uncovered other evidence that it believed supported Tucker\u2019s charge of racial discrimination. The EEOC thus filed suit, alleging that Mega violated Title VII by terminating and failing to rehire Tucker because of race. The district court denied Mega\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It also denied Mega\u2019s motion, filed at the close of the EEOC\u2019s evidence, for judgment as a matter of law. According to the district court, the shifting explanations provided by Mega suggested this was \u201ca classical pretextual case.\u201d The district court later denied Mega\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and sent the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for Mega.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">After the verdict was returned, Mega filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court denied this motion. According to the court, Mega was not entitled to an award of fees because the EEOC\u2019s case was not \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (setting forth the standard for awarding fees). In support, the district court found that although the jury ultimately ruled for the defendant, \u201cthere was sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to have rejected the defendant\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It is axiomatic that a district court\u2019s decision regarding an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hitachi Credit America Corp. v. Signet Bank, </em>166 F.3d 614, 631 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Arnold v. Burger King Corp., </em>719 F.2d 68, 66 (4th Cir.1983) (\u201c[Ajssessment of frivolousness and attorneys\u2019 fees are best left to the sound discretion of the trial court after a thorough evaluation of the record and appropriate factfinding.\u201d). This deference arises out of the realization that the \u201cdistrict court is in the best position to review the factual circumstances and render an informed judgment as it is intimately involved\u201d with the proceedings in the case. <em>Blue v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>914 F.2d 525, 538 (4th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Here, the district court denied a motion for summary judgment and two motions for judgment as a matter of law. More importantly, after presiding over the trial and hearing all of the evidence, the court believed that a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. We are not prepared to second-guess the district court\u2019s firsthand evaluation of the evidence. Under such circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in declining Mega\u2019s request for fees. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
