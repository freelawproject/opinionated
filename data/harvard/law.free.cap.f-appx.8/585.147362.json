Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs de novo, <em>see Miller v. Menghini, </em>213 F.3d 1244, 1246 (10th Cir.2000) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Gill failed to attach to his complaint any proof of administrative exhaustion. In fact, Gill did not even attach proof of his initial grievances that were embodied in administrative records. <em>Cf. McAlphin v. Morgan, </em>216 F.3d 680, 682 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (to satisfy \u00a7 1997e(a)\u2019s requirements, inmate must allege exhaustion of available administrative remedies and should attach administrative decision, if it is available, showing disposition of his complaint). In response to the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, Gill filed only the first step of a grievance wherein he made allegations different from those in his complaint, against a sergeant not named as a defendant. <em>See Chelette v. Harris, </em>229 F.3d 684, 688 (8th Cir.2000) (holding that a district court, acting on a motion to dismiss, was obligated to make findings of fact on question of exhaustion by considering affidavit submitted by defendants as well as inmate\u2019s response to dismissal motion), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1106, 148 L.Ed.2d 977 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">Accordingly, we affirm, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and we clarify that the dismissal was without prejudice, <em>see McAlphin, </em>216 F.3d at 682. We deny Gill\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-10\">. The Honorable J.
