Films, Inc. (\u201cP.E.A.\u201d) appeals from the August 28, 2000 memorandum and order of the district court in which the court granted the motion for summary judgment made by Defendanb-Appellee Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation (\u201cTwentieth Century-Fox\u201d), and entered judgment in favor of Twentieth Century-Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">This is a contract case wherein P.E.A. contends that film licensing agreements between it and Twentieth Century-Fox provide that the agreements expire after a twenty-year term. Twentieth Century-Fox, however, contends that language in the agreements extends their terms until Twentieth Century-Fox has recouped its advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On appeal, P.E.A. argues that the district court erred by misinterpreting the agreements and their attached schedules, and that extrinsic evidence exists which precludes summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the language in the agreements is clearly in favor of Twentieth Century-Fox\u2019s interpretation, and not reasonably susceptible to P.E.A.\u2019s proffered interpretation. <em>See Gerdlund v. Electronic Dispensers Int\u2019l, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 263, 235 Cal.Rptr. 279, 282 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">We affirm for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum and order. <em>See P.E.A. Films, Inc. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>No. 98 Civ. 2107 NRB, 2000 WL 1218392, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
