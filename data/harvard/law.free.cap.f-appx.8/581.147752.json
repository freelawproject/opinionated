The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied his request for a downward departure on the bases of his cultural assimilation into the United States and the hardships he would suffer if deported. Sears was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years (ninety months) imprisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal, he argues that the Court erroneously concluded that it lacked authority to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing. The District Court\u2019s comments show that it did not believe it lacked authority to grant either a cultural-assimilation or a deportation-related-hardship downward departure; rather, it denied Sears such departures because of the particular facts and circumstances of his case. Thus, the matter is unreviewable on appeal. See <em>United States v. Bohena, </em>223 F.3d 797, 807 (8th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1163, 148 L.Ed.2d 1023 (2001); <em>United States v.
