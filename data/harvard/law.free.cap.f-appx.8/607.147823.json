We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal, on statute of limitations grounds, of a petition for writ of habeas corpus, <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>241 F.3d 1151, 1154 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Because Spikes\u2019 conviction became final after the enactment of Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Spikes\u2019 petition is subject to a one-year statute of limitations running from the date of which his conviction became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). This statute of limitations is tolled for all of the period during which a state prisoner is attempting, through proper use of state court procedures, to exhaust state court remedies. <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">Because Spike did not have any court petitions pending for over a year after his conviction became final, the statute of limitations was not tolled, he cannot benefit from tolling, and his habeas petition must be deemed untimely. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\">.
