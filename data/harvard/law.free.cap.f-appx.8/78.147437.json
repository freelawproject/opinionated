Gerard, attorney for appellee Charles Raab, informed the Court that he would not request oral argument, and that he would rely on the briefs submitted by other appellees rather than submit a brief on behalf of Mr. Raab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b108-25\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b108-26\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgments of said District Court be and hereby are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-27\">Plaintiffs-appellants Nashaat N. Antonious and Soheir F. Antonious timely appeal from judgments entered by the District Court on January 23, 1995 and April 28, 2000 that between them dismissed plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 claims against all defendants-appellees. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Plaintiffs-appellants initiated this action (\u201cthe federal action\u201d) on April 29, 1991, and initiated another action (\u201cthe state action\u201d) one week later in Supreme Court, New York County. The state action was removed to Supreme Court, Rockland County (\u201cthe state court\u201d), and was subsequently dismissed by the state court \u2014 as to defendant-appellee Gribetz by order dated March 31, 1993, and as to the remaining defendants-appellees by order dated May 28, 1993. On the basis of the state court\u2019s dismissal of the state action, defendants-appellees moved in the District Court for dismissal of the federal action as barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The District Court granted their motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs-appellants press one substantial argument \u2014 namely, that because the dismissal of the state court action recited that it was dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d and did not say \u201con the merits,\u201d the New York law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>does not bar the federal action. We disagree for substantially the reasons stated by Judge Sprizzo in his thorough, well-reasoned opinions of January 5, 1995, <em>see Antonious v. Muhammad, </em>873 F.Supp. 817 (S.D.N.Y.1995), and April 28, 2000, <em>see Antonious v. Muhammad, </em>95 F.Supp.2d 156 (S.D.N.Y.2000). Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We have considered plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">For the reasons stated above, the judgments of the District Court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">. The parties briefs rely on New York preclusion law, and such \u201cimplied consent ... is sufficient to establish choice of law.\u201d <em>Tehran-Berkeley Civil &amp; Envtl. Eng\u2019rs v.
