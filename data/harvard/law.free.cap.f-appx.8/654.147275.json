We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. We review credibility findings of an IJ and the BIA under a substantial evidence standard. <em>See Ramos-Vasquez v. INS, </em>57 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir.1995). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum under a substantial evidence standard. <em>See Rivera-Moreno v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 481, 485 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Because Iqbal presented false documents, Tasneem Rukhsana made false statements to immigration officials, and Iqbal\u2019s witnesses provided little corroboration and inconsistent testimony, all of which involve \u201cthe heart of the asylum claim,\u201d substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Iqbal did not establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See De Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir.1997). Because Iqbal failed to qualify for asylum, he \u201cnecessarily failed to satisfy the more rigorous standard for withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Iqbal included his wife, Tasneem Rukhsana, and daughter, Namiha Rukhsana, in his asylum application. Because the denial of a principal\u2019s asylum application shall also result in the denial of asylum status to all dependents included on the principal\u2019s application, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.14(e) (1997), and because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding of Iqbal, the BIA properly denied the Rukhsanas\u2019 asylum application. <em>See De Leon-Barrios, </em>116 F.3d at 393-94. Because the Rukhsanas failed to qualify for asylum, they \u201cnecessarily failed to satisfy the more rigorous standard for withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">We reject the Rukhsanas\u2019 contention that the BIA should have remanded the case to the IJ for a separate credibility hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">The relief requested in letters dated June 26, 2000, and September 5, 2000, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) repealed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a and replaced it with a new judicial provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 306(c)(1), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), as amended by Act of Oct. 11, 1996, Pub.L. No. 104 \u2014 302, 110 Stat. 3656. Because the new provision does not apply to petitioners whose deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, however, this court continues to have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. See IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
