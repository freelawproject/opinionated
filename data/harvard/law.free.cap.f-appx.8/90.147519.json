Maureen Polsby, M.D., appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Michael B. Mukasey, <em>Chief Judge, </em>dismissing her complaint alleging copyright infringement, and awarding defendants attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the grounds that there was no evidence that they had access to Polsby\u2019s work and that there was no substantial similarity between the protectible elements of her work and defendants\u2019 work. On appeal, Polsby contends principally that she should have been allowed discovery, that the question of substantial similarity should have been left to a jury, and that she should not have been ordered to pay attorneys\u2019 fees. For the reasons stated below, we find no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">As the district court noted in its Opinion and Order dated April 15, 1999 (\u201cOpinion\u201d), granting summary judgment, \u201ca court may \u2018determine non-infringement as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment, either because the similarity between two works concerns only wow-copyrightable elements of the plaintiffs work, or because no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the two works are substantially similar.\u2019 <em>Warner Bros., Inc. v. American Broad. Cos., </em>720 F.2d 231, 240 (2d Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\u201d Opinion at 5 (emphasis in <em>Warner Bros.). </em>The court concluded that even if Polsby could establish that defendants had access to her work, summary judgment was warranted because she \u201ccannot establish substantial similarity between the protectible elements of plaintiffs and defendants\u2019 works.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 8.) We see no error in this conclusion, and we affirm the granting of summary judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The fact that plaintiff was not afforded discovery provides no basis for reversal here. Although some limited discovery would have been appropriate had the sole ground for the dismissal been defendants\u2019 asserted lack of access to plaintiffs work, discovery was not necessary for a comparison of the works in order to assess whether, as to the protectible elements, they were substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Nor do we see a basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants. A defendant who prevails in a copyright action may be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 as a matter of the district court\u2019s equitable discretion, consistent with the purposes of the copyright laws. <em>See Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534 &amp; n. 19, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994). The factors that may guide the exercise of that discretion \u201cinclude frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and in the legal components of the case) and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 19, 114 S.Ct. 1023 (internal quotation marks omitted). The decision to award such fees may not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. West Publishing Co., </em>240 F.3d 116, 121 (2d Cir. 2001). Because we are unpersuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the district court in this case made any error of law or considered any improper factors, we see no abuse of discretion, and we affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We have considered all of Polsby\u2019s contentions on this appeal, to the extent that they were presented to the district court and are properly before us, and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
