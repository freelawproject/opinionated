Martin, Jr., <em>Judge) </em>dismissing his petition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely. For the reasons that follow, we deny Matias\u2019s motions and dismiss his petition for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Mat\u00edas was convicted in 1994 of two counts of murder in the second degree and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and was sentenced to two consecutive imprisonment terms of 25 years to life, one for each murder conviction, to run concurrently with an imprisonment term of 5 to 15 years for the weapon possession conviction. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed Matias\u2019s conviction on January 21, 1997, <em>People v. Matias, </em>235 A.D.2d 298, 653 N.Y.S.2d 308 (1st Dep\u2019t 1997), and leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied on April 7, 1997, <em>People v. Matias, </em>89 N.Y.2d 1038, 659 N.Y.S.2d 869, 681 N.E.2d 1316 (1997) (Bellacosa, J.). As a matter of federal law under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Matias\u2019s conviction therefore became \u201cfinal\u201d on July 6, 1997, \u201cwhen his time to seek direct review in the United States Supreme Court by writ of certiorari expire[d].\u201d <em>Williams v. Artuz, </em>237 F.3d 147, 150 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Ross v. Artuz, </em>150 F.3d 97, 98 (2d Cir.1998)); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On or about May 6, 1998, Mat\u00edas attempted to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the District Court, advancing the same claims he asserted in his direct appeal. According to Mat\u00edas, this petition was returned to him by the District Court in July 1998 with instructions to submit his claims on an official \u00a7 2254 form, a blank copy of which was enclosed with the returned petition. Informal communication with the Pro Se Office of the Southern District of New York confirms that Mat\u00edas originally filed a petition dated May 6, 1998, and that the District Court returned that petition on May 15, 1998. However, the Pro Se Office maintains that Matias\u2019s May 1998 petition was not returned for being filed on the wrong form, but rather because Mat\u00edas neither had paid the filing fee nor had moved for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status when he submitted his petition. The manner in which Matias\u2019s May 1998 petition was handled apparently reflects the standard practice in the Southern District of New York; the Pro Se Office notes that had Mat\u00edas moved to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>or paid the filing fee when he submitted his May 1998 petition, it would have accepted that <em>pro se </em>habeas petition irrespective of the form on which it had been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Mat\u00edas filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition, which asserts the same claims as his May 1998 petition, on or around April 18, 1999. In July 1999, the District Court ordered Mat\u00edas to show cause why his habeas petition should not be dismissed as time-barred by the one-year limitations period enacted into law by Section 105 of AED-PA, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217 (1996), and codified at 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00a7 2244(d)(1). In response, Mat\u00edas invoked his previous attempt to file the May 1998 petition, which, had it been accepted and filed by the District Court at that time, he claims would have been timely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The respondent moved to dismiss Matias\u2019s petition in October 1999 as time-barred by \u00a7 2244(d)(1), and the District Court granted that motion in March 2000, finding that his petition\u2014 meaning his April 1999 petition \u2014 was filed approximately two years after his conviction became final and was therefore time-barred by AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Judgment was entered on March 15, 2000. Continuing to appear <em>pro se, </em>Mat\u00edas filed a timely notice of appeal on March 28, 2000, which we construed as a motion for a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 22(b)(2); <em>Lozada v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 1011, 1017 (2d Cir.1997), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Perez, </em>129 F.3d 255 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We construe both Matias\u2019s habeas petition and his motion for a certificate of appealability liberally, since both documents were filed <em>pro se. See, e.g., Williams v. Kullman, </em>722 F.2d 1048, 1050-51 (2d Cir.1983); <em>United States ex rel. Buford v. Henderson, </em>524 F.2d 147, 152 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 923, 96 S.Ct. 1133, 47 L.Ed.2d 332 (1976); <em>cf. Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). In support of his <em>pro se </em>motion for a certificate of appealability, Matias suggests that the District Court\u2019s application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) to dismiss his habeas petition as untimely may have violated the Suspension Clause, which provides that \u201c[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. In this respect, he asserts, the \u201cvery reason\u201d for the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition provides the \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d required for a certificate of appealability to issue under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). <em>See Muniz v. United States, </em>236 F.3d 122, 128-29 (2d Cir.2001) (noting constitutional question arising under Suspension Clause from dismissal of a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons); <em>cf. Lonchar v. Thomas, </em>517 U.S. 314, 324, 116 S.Ct. 1293, 134 L.Ed.2d 440 (1996) (\u201cDismissal of a <em>first </em>federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ entirely, risking injury to an important interest in human liberty.\u201d). Matias\u2019s original petition appears to have been submitted at some point between May 6, 1998, the date on the face of that petition, and May 15, 1998, the date on which the Pro Se Office represents that it returned that petition to him for failure to pay the filing fee or to file for <em>in </em>/turn <em>pauperis </em>status. Matias\u2019s original petition therefore appears to have been filed approximately two months before the AEDPA limitations period expired on July 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Whether we may grant a certificate of appealability to review the District Court\u2019s procedural dismissal of Matias\u2019s petition is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). In <em>Slack, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the standard under \u00a7 2253(c) for a certificate of appealability to issue when the district court has dismissed a habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition on procedural grounds. The Court rejected the government\u2019s position that \u201cno appeal can be taken if the District Court relies on procedural grounds to dismiss the petition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 483, and instead held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">[w]hen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a [certificate of appeal-ability] should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 484. The Court concluded that since \u201cCongress expressed no intention to allow trial court procedural error to bar vindication of substantial constitutional rights on appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 483, some avenue had to remain open to review procedural dismissals if there also was a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d that the substance of the underlying habeas petition had constitutional merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Applying the standard set forth in <em>Slack, </em>we conclude that jurists of reason would not find it debatable whether Matias\u2019s underlying petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that petition, Matias claims that the trial court violated his rights under the Due Process Clause by failing to instruct the jury on the defenses of justification and intoxication and that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Neither one of these claims would be debatable to jurists of reason. First, in order to successfully challenge his conviction, on federal habeas review, based on errors of state law in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, Mat\u00edas is obligated to show \u201cnot only that the instruction misstated state law but also that the error violated a right guaranteed to him by federal law.\u201d <em>Sams v. Walker, </em>18 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Since, as the Appellate Division concluded, the trial court cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>rectly applied state law when it issued its instructions, <em>see People v. Matias, </em>235 A.D.2d 298, 653 N.Y.S.2d 308 (1st Dep\u2019t 1997), the failure to instruct the jury on the defenses of justification and intoxication cannot serve as a basis to grant Matias relief on habeas. Second, Matias\u2019s sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. While \u201cno penalty is <em>per se </em>constitutional,\u201d <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 290, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983); <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring), Matias\u2019s sentence is not unconstitutionally disproportionate to the crimes for which he was convicted. <em>See Bethea v. Scully, </em>834 F.2d 257, 261 (2d Cir.1987); <em>see also Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 290-92; <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 998-1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Given that Matias\u2019s petition fails to state constitutional claims that \u201cjurists of reason would find ... debatable,\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, we need not resolve, in the context of this petition, any questions arising from the District Court\u2019s failure to regard Matias\u2019s habeas petition \u2014 that is, his <em>original </em>May 1998 petition \u2014 as timely under the AEDPA limitations period. However, the facts surrounding the District Court\u2019s dismissal of that petition, if true, do give us pause. For while we have held that the one-year AEDPA limitations period does not <em>per se </em>violate the Suspension Clause, <em>see Weaver v. United States, </em>195 F.3d 123, 124 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam) (limitations period for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for petitions under that section), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1094, 120 S.Ct. 1733, 146 L.Ed.2d 653 (2000); <em>Rodriguez v. Artuz, </em>161 F.3d 763, 764 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (limitations period in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) for \u00a7 2254 petitions), <em>affg on opinion below </em>990 F.Supp. 275 (S.D.N.Y.1998), we have not so held with respect to shorter periods, like the approximately ten-month period that Matias claims effectively to have faced in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Muniz, </em>236 F.3d at 128-29. And under the rule prevailing in several other circuits, Matias\u2019s petition would have been timely under AEDPA, since those circuits have held that a <em>pro se </em>habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition need not be accompanied by either the filing fee or an <em>informa pauperis </em>application in order to have been filed for AEDPA limitations period purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Nichols v. Bowersox, </em>172 F.3d 1068, 1073-77 (8th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>Jones v. Bertrand, </em>171 F.3d 499, 502-04 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Spotville v. Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 377-78 (5th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Since it appears to be the practice of the Pro Se Office in the Southern District of New York not to record habeas and \u00a7 2255 petitions that are unaccompanied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>filing fee or an application for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status as having been filed for AEDPA limitations period purposes, any number of such petitions that actually have been submitted within the AEDPA limitations period may nevertheless be at risk of being dismissed as untimely before the procedural question that Mat\u00edas asserts has been definitively resolved in this circuit. A change in the policy or practice of the Pro Se Office may avert this risk entirely. However, given Matias\u2019s failure to demonstrate that the claims in his underlying habeas petition would be debatable to jurists of reason, <em>see Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, we decline to resolve that issue in the context of this petition. Accordingly, Matias\u2019s motions for a certificate of appealability, <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, and assignment of counsel are DENIED, and Matias\u2019s habeas petition is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. Consistent with the terminology used in <em>Galtieri v. United States, </em>128 F.3d 33, 36 (2d Cir.1997), we use \"petition\" to refer to the document seeking collateral relief, whether filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">. We do note that applying the <em>Slack </em>standard under the circumstances presented here, in which the District Court\u2019s procedural dismissal <em>itself </em>furnishes the predicate upon which the petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is founded, does appear to be in some tension with the plain meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). The statute does not state that a certificate of appealability only may issue if the petitioner has made a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d in the habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition <em>itself. </em>Rather, the text of \u00a7 2253(c) seems to require the petitioner to make that \u201csubstantial showing\u201d without regard to whether the petitioner asserts that the constitutional right in question was denied before or after the commencement of federal habeas or \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Under the plain meaning of the statute, therefore, a \"substantial showing\u201d that a district court denied a petitioner's constitutional rights in its procedural disposition of the petitioner\u2019s habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition would appear to be sufficient to grant a certificate of appealability on that issue, and several of our <em>pre-Slack </em>decisions have relied upon that very interpretation. <em>See, e.g., Lucidore v. New York State Div. of Parole, </em>209 F.3d 107, 112-13 (2d Cir.) (holding that certificate of appealability properly was granted on issue of \"whether AEDPA's statute of limitations violates the Suspension Clause and whether, in order to survive a constitutional challenge, AEDPA must be read to include an 'actual innocence\u2019 exception\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 873, 121 S.Ct. 175, 148 L.Ed.2d 120 (2000); <em>Clark v. Stinson, </em>214 F.3d 315, 319 (2d Cir.2000) (granting certificate of appealability to consider whether AEDPA limitations period violates Suspension Clause), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1116, 121 S.Ct. 865, 148 L.Ed.2d 778 (2001); <em>Weaver v. United States, </em>195 F.3d 123, 124 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (exercising jurisdiction over appeal in which district court granted certificate of appealability to consider whether AEDPA limitations period violates the Suspension Clause), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1094, 120 S.Ct. 1733, 146 L.Ed.2d 653 (2000). However, notwithstanding the apparent meaning of the statutory text, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Slack </em>is not qualified to exclude cases such as the one presented here. We therefore interpret <em>Slack </em>to apply in all cases in which the district court dismissed the habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition \"on procedural grounds,\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, without regard to whether those procedural grounds themselves implicate any constitutional questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">. Therefore, if the Pro Se Office\u2019s decision to return Matias\u2019s petition in May 1998 rested on a correct interpretation of AEDPA, then it would seem necessary to confront the Suspension Clause issue raised by Matias directly. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>990 F.Supp. at 281. Of course, the need directly to address that question might still be avoided if a petitioner demonstrated some legitimate reason, such as application of equitable tolling, to be excused from the AEDPA limitations period. <em>See Muniz, </em>236 F.3d at 128-29; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>219 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 968, 121 S.Ct. 404, 148 L.Ed.2d 312 (2000); <em>Lucidore, </em>209 F.3d at 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\">. In this regard, we also note, as we have in the past, that when a prisoner is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>his or her habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition generally is deemed to have been filed \"as of the date on which it was given to prison officials for forwarding to the court clerk.\u201d <em>See Adeline v. Stinson, </em>206 F.3d 249, 251 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam); <em>cf. Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) <em>(pro se </em>prisoner's notice of appeal is deemed to have been filed upon delivery to prison authorities for forwarding to court clerk).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
