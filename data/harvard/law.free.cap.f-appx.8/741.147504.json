We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural background of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">1. An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) is entitled to reject a petitioner\u2019s testimony if he or she provides \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996). Here, the ALJ rejected Rhodes\u2019 testimony concerning her symptoms. The only rationale given was that the testimony \u201cwas not supported by the evidence as a whole\u201d\u2014 specifically, it was not supported by Dr. Moore\u2019s assessment and by Rhodes\u2019 disability report of March 26, 1994. However, the daily activities listed in Rhodes\u2019 disability report do not conflict with her testimony of neck pain because the ability and desire to perform some daily activities does not negate a finding of disability, particularly when the activities are not substantial ones that can be transferable to a work environment. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1284 n. 7; <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989). In addition, the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of Rhodes\u2019 arm restrictions because of his dismissal of the right shoulder impingement syndrome is questionable given the posW989 records that document this limitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In short, the ALJ did not offer clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Rhodes\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">Further, we cannot discern the basis for the ALJ crediting some medical opinions over others, or why the ALJ partially relied on and partially rejected medical opinions from the same health care provider. We also note that an ALJ should give greater weight to the opinion of the treating physician, and may reject it only after giving \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Ramirez v. Shalala, 8 </em>F.3d 1449, 1453 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>1993). The ALJ\u2019s decision does not provide \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons\u201d for rejecting the treating physician\u2019s opinion in the instances the ALJ chose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">For these reasons, remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">3. On remand, the ALJ should also reconsider the testimony of the vocational expert. If the ALJ alters his conclusions about the medical evidence, then different hypothetical assumptions will be required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">4. By vacating and remanding, we are not expressing any opinion on the merits of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE COMMISSIONER FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS DISPOSITION</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-13\">. For example, Dr. O'Brien's 1989 report noted the possibility of an \"irritated nerve syndrome down the right arm.\u201d Dr. Matthes noted \"arm pain.\u201d Roy Kjorlien noted \"restricted extension\u201d and \"upper arm pain.\u201d Indeed, medical reports from Dr. O\u2019Brien, Dr. Matthes, Roy Kjorilien, and Dr. Mulick all refer to her cervical strain, sprain, pain or discomfort, and they attribute it to her TMJ syndrome (which the ALJ found was \"severe\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b773-18\">. In addition, it appears that the vocational expert deviated from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles without explanation by testifying Rhodes could only perform sedentary work, but opining as to jobs that required light work. Further, the ultimate conclusion that Rhodes could serve as a parking lot attendant or fruit sorter, is contradictory to the medical report issued April 15, 1997 by Dr. Wade.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
