Apfel, </em>No. 98-CV-0402, Mem. &amp; Order (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">This case has previously been before this Court and familiarity with the facts concerning the administrative record as detailed in our prior opinion is assumed, <em>see Raitport v. Callahan, </em>183 F.3d 101 (2d Cir.1999); only those facts relevant to this disposition are set out below. The SSA initially denied Mr. Raitport\u2019s application for SSRI benefits in February 1993, on the ground that from 1958 through 1968 \u2014 the period covered by his social security record \u2014 he had only 36 of the requisite 38 quarters of coverage. <em>See Raitport, </em>183 F.3d at 102. In September 1993, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) reached the same conclusion after conducting a hearing to consider Mr. Raitport\u2019s alleged earnings in the form of \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d securities issued to him from 1980 to 1992 by the Scientronic Corporation (of which Mr. Raitport allegedly was President and Chief Engineer). The ALJ maintained that the stock, having no economic value, could not be credited as wages under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1041(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Following a remand in 1994 by the Appeals Council to consider \u201cnew evidence of additional income,\u201d Mr. Raitport failed to provide any tax returns or wage reports to show that earnings which had been reported to his Summary Statement of Earnings for 1990 through 1992 were from employment covered by the Social Security Act, and, thus, able to be credited to his record. The ALJ again denied Mr. Raitport\u2019s request for SSRI benefits for the reasons previously stated and ordered an investigation to determine whether Mr. Raitport\u2019s newly posted earnings from 1990 through 1992 were \u201cfraudulently placed.\u201d Subsequently, the Appeals Council denied all other relief sought by Mr. Raitport.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Mr. Raitport then commenced this suit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), seeking judicial review of the SSA\u2019s denial of his application to receive SSRI benefits. The Commissioner moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the findings of both the ALJ and the Appeals Council concerning Mr. Raitport\u2019s insufficient quarters of coverage were supported by substantial evidence. Mr. Raitport opposed the motion, arguing that he was entitled to SSRI benefits because he had served as, among other positions, the President of Scientronic and he received nonnegotiable shares of Scientronic stock as compensation for his services. The District Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court recognized that Raitport failed to provide any documentation \u201cdemonstrating his title or position with the company [Scientronic], the services he provided, or that he was being compensated by the corporation in the form of stock shares.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that there was ample evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Raitport lacked the requisite thirty-eight quarters of earnings to qualify for SSRI and that his employment at Scientronic \u201cdid not represent ... a <em>bona fide </em>employment relationship.\u201d <em>See Raitport, </em>No. 98-CV-0402, Mem. <em>&amp; </em>Order, at 4-6 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Mr. Raitport asserts one argument on appeal \u2014 he seeks to have his Scientronic \u201cincome\u201d credited towards the balance of his already earned 36 quarters of coverage so that he qualifies for SSRI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>benefits. When we review a decision denying benefits under the Social Security Act, we must regard the SSA\u2019s factual determinations as conclusive so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Alston v. Sullivan, </em>904 F.2d 122, 126 (2d Cir.1990). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Alston, </em>904 F.2d at 126 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, 402 </em>U.S. 389, <em>401, </em>91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). Here, Mr. Raitport\u2019s claim must be rejected because the SSA\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Payment of retirement insurance benefits under the Act is conditioned upon an individual meeting all the requirements for such benefits; that is, the individual must be fully insured, have attained the age of sixty-two, and filed an application for such benefits. <em>See 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(a), 414(a). To be fully insured for purposes of SSRI benefits, an individual must establish that he earned at least one quarter of coverage in each calendar year after 1950, or, if later, after the year in which he became age twenty-one, and before the year in which he reached retirement age. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 414(a); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.110(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Title 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.115 establishes a table for how many quarters of coverage are necessary to be fully insured for retirement insurance purposes. In this case, because Mr. Raitport attained the age of sixty-two in 1989, and, thus, was born in 1927, he needed 38 quarters of coverage in order to be fully insured. Mr. Raitport had the burden of establishing that he had more than 36 quarters of coverage \u2014 the amount established in the SSA\u2019s records\u2014 and he failed to offer any credible evidence to rebut the SSA\u2019s records. <em>See Butts v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>706 F.2d 107, 108 (2d Cir.1983). In sum, Mr. Raitport failed to supply the SSA with any tax returns, or other IRS forms, to show that Scientronic had made the requisite filings with the IRS, withheld any taxes on his alleged wages from Scientronic, or paid any social security taxes on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The evidence of earnings that Mr. Raitport did offer to the SSA in the hopes of amending the SSA\u2019s records \u2014 non-negotiable company stock \u2014 was both unsubstantiated by any tax form or corporate documentation and an inappropriate form of \u201cwages\u201d for the purposes of crediting his earnings records because it had no known value. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1041(d) (stating that non-monetary wages are determined by the \u201cfair value of the items when paid\u201d). Moreover, Mr. Raitport\u2019s failure to produce any documentation in support of his claim, despite his role as \u201cpresident, director, and general counsel\u201d of Scientronic, supports the SSA\u2019s conclusion that Raitport\u2019s alleged employment was not a \u201cbona fide employment relationship.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1006, 404.1007 (discussing the indicia of employee-employer relationships and defining common-law employee). Finally, Mr. Raitport\u2019s allegation that he earned income between 1988 and 1994 is further invalidated by the fact that he received SSI disability benefits during that time period \u2014 benefits that are only available to disabled persons whose earnings are below a minimum income level. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.110.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We therefore hold that, because the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, and because Mr. Raitport failed to provide any credible evidence to support his contention that he had more than thirty-six quarters of coverage, the District Court\u2019s order granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Mr. Raitport also seeks a writ of mandamus, compelling the Commissioner to pay for his electricity bills until the Commissioner corrects his allegedly false earnings records. To the extent that Mr. Raitport seeks to have the Commissioner pay his electric bills, that request is frivolous and is rejected accordingly. To the extent that Mr. Raitport attempts to use the writ to compel the Commissioner to correct his earnings records, that request is also rejected because Mr. Raitport has ample administrative and judicial avenues to seek an appropriate remedy. <em>See In re Steinhardt Partners, L.P., </em>9 F.3d 230, 233 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
