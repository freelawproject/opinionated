On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Graven has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">Counsel challenges, on due process and separation-of-powers grounds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)\u2019s requirement of a government motion before the district court may impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. This challenge is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>956 F.2d 748, 752 (8th Cir.1992) (en banc) (upholding, against separation-of-powers and due process challenges, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 requirement of government motion before district court may depart from Guidelines); <em>see also United States v. Marks, </em>244 F.3d 971, 973 n. 1 (8th Cir. 2001) (equating \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e)); <em>Kelley, </em>956 F.2d at 751 n. 3 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-30\">. The Honorable Robert W.
