Ousley (the Claimant), widow of former miner Hermal Ousley (the Miner), petitions for review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision and order denying her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45. The parties have waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The Claimant filed her application for benefits with the Department of Labor (DOL) on December 27,1996, following the December 11, 1996, death of her husband. The DOL denied her claim on December 18, 1997, and, following a formal hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a decision and order denying benefits. In accordance with an earlier award of benefits to the Miner while he was alive, the ALJ found that the Miner suffered from pneumoconiosis arising out of his exposure to coal mine dust during his six years as a coal miner. However, the ALJ further found that the Miner\u2019s death was not due to pneumoconiosis and, therefore, denied benefits. The Benefits Review Board (Board) affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and order, despite the Director\u2019s motion to remand to the ALJ for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In her petition for review, the Claimant argues that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the Miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis contributed to or hastened his death from lung cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision if the Board has not committed any legal error or exceeded its statutory scope of review of the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations. <em>Glen Coal Co. v. Seals, </em>147 F.3d 502, 510 (6th Cir.1998). The court reviews the ALJ\u2019s decision only to decide whether it is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the applicable law. <em>Id.; Peabody Coal Co. v. Greer, </em>62 F.3d 801, 804 (6th Cir.1995). Thus, as long as the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are supported by the evidence, they will not be reversed, \u201ceven if the facts permit an alternative conclusion.\u201d <em>Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Webb, </em>49 F.3d 244, 246 (6th Cir.1995). Given this limited scope of review, this court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the ALJ where the ALJ has carefully considered each part of the evidence. <em>Knuckles v. Director, OWCP, </em>869 F.2d 996, 998 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Because the Claimant applied for benefits after January 1, 1982, she must establish that the Miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.1(a). The criteria for determining whether a miner\u2019s death occurred as a result of pneumoconiosis are: (1) whether competent medical evidence establishes that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis; (2) whether pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death, or death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis; or (3) whether the presumption set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 is applicable to the survivor\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(l)-(3). The presumption found in \u00a7 718.304 does not apply to this claim because there is no evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis. Survivors are not eligible for benefits where the principal cause of death is a medical condition not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>related to pneumoconiosis, unless pneumoconiosis was a \u201csubstantially contributing cause\u201d of the death. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(4). This court has interpreted this regulatory language to encompass situations where pneumoconiosis, even if not a proximate cause of death, actually hastened a miner\u2019s death. <em>See Brown v. Rock Creek Mining Co., </em>996 F.2d 812, 816 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The Miner\u2019s death certificate gave the immediate cause of death as small cell lung cancer. No underlying or other significant conditions were listed. The medical records from his last illness focused principally on the cancer, although his black lung disease was noted in several reports. Dr. Gutterman, the Miner\u2019s oncologist, reviewed his records and submitted a letter dated April 8, 1997. In that letter, he stated that the Miner died as a result of his metastatic lung cancer and that he \u201c[did] not believe that Mr. Ousley\u2019s previous pulmonary disability as related to Pneumoconiosis contributed to his death.\u201d Dr. Gutterman also stated that he did not recommend chemotherapy for the Miner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aln\">because his cancer was advanced into stage IV including involvement of the liver. The response rates in patients with this stage of lung cancer are poor with chemotherapy. There are significant side effects from chemotherapy and I thought the side effects outweighed any brief benefit he might gain from chemotherapy. His previous lung condition did not cause me to withhold chemotherapy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">Therefore, I do not think that his Pneumoconiosis contributed to his death nor to his cancer. I believe he died from his metastatic lung cancer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Dr. Lance had been the Miner\u2019s physician since 1990, treating him for black lung and lower back problems, and last seeing the Miner about two weeks before his cancer was diagnosed. Dr. Lance reviewed his records and submitted a letter dated July 18, 1997. He noted the Miner\u2019s diagnosed black lung disease in addition to his small cell lung cancer with metastasis to the liver and referred to attached treatment notes which stated that, while hospitalized for cancer, \u201chis COPD would be treated with nebulizers around the clock along with adequate doses of theophylline.\u201d Dr. Lance continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">I can state with medical certainty that Mr. Ousley\u2019s death does qualify as death due to pneumoconiosis. This is where pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death or where the death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis. This is based on the fact that he had a markedly decreased respiratory reserve which was further decreased by his cancer and even further impaired due to the radiation therapy he received, which further decreased his respiratory reserve. It is with certainty that I state that his black lung condition hastened his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Finally, the record contains two brief consultative reports prepared by Dr. Sarah Long at the DOL\u2019s request. Her initial report stated that she found no medical basis to establish the diagnosis of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis and that, in her opinion, pneumoconiosis did not cause, contribute to, or hasten the Miner\u2019s death. The DOL requested another opinion from Dr. Long after pointing out that it had previously been established that the Miner did have pneumoconiosis. In her second opinion, dated October 21, 1997, Dr. Long stated that, \u201c[e]ven if we assume that pneumoconiosis had decreased his respiratory reserve, I do not believe that in any way contributed to, caused or hastened his death. The extensive involvement of the carcinoma was the cause of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Based upon this evidence, the ALJ found that the Claimant had not established entitlement under \u00a7 718.205(c)(1) because the death certificate made no reference to pneumoconiosis. In addition, the ALJ found that the single report by Dr. Lance, claiming that the Miner\u2019s death was in some way attributable to pneumoconiosis was inadequately documented and so its conclusion was unsupported. The ALJ concluded that this lack of support rendered Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion unreasoned, noting that Dr. Lance \u201cmade no mention of how pneumoconiosis had decreased the Miner\u2019s respiratory reserve.... Because Dr. Lance does not explain how underlying documentation supports his diagnosis, I find his opinion entitled to little weight on this issue.\u201d Instead, the ALJ gave controlling weight to the opinion of Dr. Gutterman, as supported by Dr. Long\u2019s second report, that the Miner\u2019s extensive carcinoma was the sole cause of the Miner\u2019s death. Therefore, the ALJ found that the Claimant had failed to establish entitlement to benefits under \u00a7 718.205(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Both the Claimant and the Director argued to the Board that the ALJ\u2019s decision and order should be vacated and the case remanded because the ALJ erred in finding that Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion was undocumented. The Board, instead, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and order on the ground that the ALJ did not reject Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion solely because it lacked underlying documentation. \u201cRather, the administrative law judge reasonably exercised his discretion as trier-of-fact in finding that the opinion of Dr. Lance was not well reasoned inasmuch as the physician did not explain how his underlying documentation supported his conclusion that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of the miner\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In her petition for review, the Claimant again argues that the ALJ improperly evaluated Dr. Lance\u2019s report and asserts that the Board erred in concluding that the ALJ rejected Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion because he found it to be unreasoned rather than undocumented. In his brief, the Director agrees that the ALJ erred in his finding that Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion was undocumented and that the Board erred in affirming rather than vacating and remanding the ALJ\u2019s decision and order. However, the Director maintains that, rather than reverse the ALJ\u2019s order and award benefits, this court should vacate the decision and order and remand for further consideration by the ALJ in light of the underlying documentation supporting Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion found in the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion was undocumented is not supported by substantial evidence. The record as a whole documents the Miner\u2019s compromised respiratory reserve; in fact, the Miner was awarded benefits on the basis that he was totally disabled from a respiratory or pulmonary impairment arising out of his coal mine employment. This conclusion is supported by the Miner\u2019s continued treatment, while hospitalized for his lung cancer, of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/black lung which was stated to be secondary to his coal mine employment. Moreover, Dr. Gutterman\u2019s statement that the Miner\u2019s \u201cprevious lung condition did not cause me to withhold chemotherapy\u201d is called into question by his contemporaneous report of July 15, 1996, in which he stated: \u201cI am concerned 6ecan.se <em>of his other medical problems </em>that he will not do that well with chemotherapy and his quality of life would not benefit as much\u201d (emphasis added). Those \u201cother medical problems,\u201d as listed in the final diagnoses of July 12, 1996, consisted of \u201chemoptysis, resolving\u201d and \u201cblack lung.\u201d No other medical conditions were noted in this hospital report pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>pared a mere three days before Dr. Gutterman\u2019s July 15th statement. Finally, a reading of the ALJ\u2019s decision and order does not support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ offered an adequate alternative reason for rejecting Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion in that it was \u201cunreasoned.\u201d Instead, the ALJ noted that where a medical opinion is not supported by the underlying documentation, it is unreasoned. Thus, any conclusion that Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion was unreasoned is tied directly to the ALJ\u2019s erroneous finding that it was undocumented.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review. We vacate the decisions below denying benefits and remand the case for further consideration by the ALJ in light of all of the evidence of record, including that submitted with the Miner\u2019s claim, which might support Dr. Lance\u2019s opinion that the Miner\u2019s death was hastened by his pneumoconiosis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
