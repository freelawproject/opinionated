Bruce Watts appeals the August 7, 2000 decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the examiner\u2019s refusal to register the term \u201cBIRTHDAY BALLOONS\u201d for mail order gift balloon services. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Board for reconsideration, Watts filed a timely notice of appeal to this court on November 8, 2000. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(B). Because substantial evidence supports the examiner\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201cBIRTHDAY BALLOONS\u201d is generic and thus ineligible for registration, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Generic terms do not qualify for trademark status. <em>In re Merrill Lynch, </em>828 F.2d 1567, 1569, 4 USPQ2d 1141, 1142 (Fed.Cir.1987). Whether a term is generic is a question of fact. <em>In re Nett Designs Inc., </em>236 F.3d 1339, 1341, 57 USPQ2d 1564, 1565 (Fed.Cir.2001). We review factual findings of the Board for substantial evidence. <em>On-Line Careline v. America Online, </em>229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed.Cir.2000). Evidence is substantial if \u201ca reasonable person might find that the evidentiary record supports the agency\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">The examiner conducted a search of the NEXIS database and found 664 stories referring to the term \u201cbirthday balloons.\u201d The examiner summarized several stories from recent months. .Based on this evidence, the examiner concluded that the relevant public would understand the term \u201cbirthday balloons\u201d to refer to balloons given as gifts on birthdays, and thus that the term is generic. The examiner also submitted evidence consisting of third-party registrations that identified goods as \u201cbirthday balloons\u201d or \u201cbirthday party balloons.\u201d These uses are further evidence showing that consumers would understand the phrase \u201cBIRTHDAY BALLOONS\u201d to refer to Watts\u2019 services.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">Watts argues that, when purchasing such balloons, one would ask for \u201cballoons for a birthday,\u201d rather than for \u201cbirthday balloons .\u201d Watts also maintains that the asserted mark is \u201cunique, creative, descriptive, [and] distinctive.\u201d Watts also states in his informal brief that \u201c[t]he lady Judge at the TTAB laughed when I said that Lexis-Nexis gave me a report which shows that our mark was used only 5 times in the entire year of 1999 in major United States newspapers, and she asked the defendant\u2019s attorney if he agreed, and he said yes, that he agreed that 5 or 6 times was it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">We conclude that, even if the phrase \u201cbirthday balloons\u201d appeared only five or six times in major newspapers during 1999, such evidence is sufficient to uphold the Board\u2019s decision that the term \u201cBIRTHDAY BALLOONS\u201d is generic. Moreover, -the examiner identified hun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>dreds of stories discussing \u201cbirthday balloons\u201d in previous years. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
