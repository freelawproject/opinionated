Trammell sought disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income, complaining of tachycardia, gastritis, shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, chest pain, and anxiety. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined Trammell was not disabled because she did not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments within the meaning of the regulations. The Appeals Council later denied Trammell\u2019s request for review, after considering records of Trammell\u2019s treating physician, some of which predated, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>were not submitted before, the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">After Trammell commenced this federal court action and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in favor of the Commissioner. Trammell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Having reviewed the record, including relevant evidence submitted to the Appeals Council, we are convinced Trammell met her burden of showing she had impairments which would have had more than a minimal effect on her ability to work, and for which, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s belief, she received ongoing treatment. <em>See Nguyen v. Chater, </em>75 F.3d 429, 430-31 (8th Cir. 1996) (claimant bears burden of establishing she has severe impairment; sequential evaluation process may be terminated for lack of severe impairment only when claimant\u2019s impairments would have no more than minimal effect on her ability to work). Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner. On remand, the ALJ should proceed with the sequential evaluation process and determine whether Trammell could return to her former work, and if not, whether there were any jobs in the national economy she could perform. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920 (2000) (discussing five:step sequential evaluation process). Other arguments advanced by Trammell\u2019s counsel have little to do with the facts of this case, and do not merit further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
