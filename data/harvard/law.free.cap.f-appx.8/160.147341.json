Danzig of the Department of the Navy his motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Frazier\u2019s motion for a stay of the proceedings. We further find that Frazier failed to establish that the legitimate non-discriminatory reason given for his removal was a pretext for discrimination. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
