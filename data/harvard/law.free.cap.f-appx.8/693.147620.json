We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">\n<em>A. Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">A reasonable official in Clark\u2019s position could have believed that Clark\u2019s conduct was lawful. Defendants demonstrated that Aune felt threatened prior to Murphy\u2019s removal and that Clark\u2019s motive was to protect Aune\u2019s safety. Clark\u2019s 9:26 a.m. memorandum demonstrates that he himself was concerned for Aune\u2019s safety based on his receipt of Murphy\u2019s letter and his conversation with Murphy. The order to remove Murphy was not made until 12:15 p.m., after Aune had communicated her fear to Clark. Clark could have believed his actions were lawful based upon clearly established law, and he is entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">\n<em>B. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">Defendants demonstrated that Clark did not intend to inflict emotional distress upon Murphy but, rather, that he acted reasonably and was motivated by the desire to protect Aune\u2019s safety. Further, Murphy has provided no evidence that his removal \u201cconstituted an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Murphy was simply removed from the building because GSA officials reasonably feared for Aune\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-12\">. <em>See Act Up!/Portland v.
