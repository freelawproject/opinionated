Moore, was indicted and charged with one count of possessing methamphetamine with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Moore filed a motion to suppress evidence, which was referred to a magistrate judge. After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge filed a report recommending that the motion to suppress be denied. After reviewing the defendant\u2019s objections, the district judge denied the motion to suppress, but for reasons that differed somewhat from that of the magistrate judge. The defendant then entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving his right to appeal the suppression issue. This appeal followed defendant\u2019s being sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of 120 months. Our review of the record convinces us that the motion to suppress was properly denied, and we affirm on the basis of the district court opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-21\">Shortly before 11:00 p.m. on January 27, 1999, Laurel County Deputy Sheriffs Ryan Young and Richard Dalrymple received a report from their dispatcher concerning the possible theft of a blue 1986 GMC truck. Almost immediately thereafter, the officers received an unrelated message from dispatch concerning a suspicious vehicle at the East Bernstadt Medical Center. The medical center closes at 5:00 p.m. Upon arriving at the medical center, the officers observed the suspicious vehicle circling a blue GMC or Chevrolet pickup truck. These were the only two vehicles in the parking lot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officers activated their blue roof-light, which also automatically activated a dash-mounted video camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Deputy Young approached the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, while Deputy Dalrymple went to the passenger side. The vehicle was driven by defendant Moore, and there were two female passengers in the front seat. While asking the defendant for his driver\u2019s license, Young observed a \u201clarge amount of some small plastic baggies\u201d on the seat between the driver and the middle passenger. Young also noticed that Moore appeared to be very nervous and kept moving his left hand in and out of his left front pocket. At this point, Moore was asked to exit the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The transcript of the evidentiary hearing indicates what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">Q. Once you get the defendant outside the car, what happens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">A. I asked Mr. Moore if he had anything in his pockets or anything, and he stated that he had some keys and some money. Did a pat down of the outside of his clothing on Mr. Moore\u2019s pockets, and that\u2019s where I noticed the large\u2014 the large bulky substance that was in his left pocket. When I went into his left\u2014 when I was patting his loft pocket, I came back over, and Mr. Moore, quote, rammed his hand into his left pocket and he would not remove it upon my request. And I used threat of force for him to move his hand and he still not would [sic] take his hand out of his pocket. And I had to physically pull it out of the pocket and go into the pocket to see what it was. I didn\u2019t know if at that time it was a gun or what it was that he was \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t take his hand out until I pulled it out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">On cross-examination what occurred was elaborated upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">Q..... What did you feel in that pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">A. As I said, ... when I was patting his pocket, he rammed his left hand into his pocket, so I placed my hand over his. And when I ordered him to take his hand out of his pocket, he wouldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s when I \u2014 when he \u2014 when he finally moved it I could feel the hard, bulky substance. When I placed my hand over his, it was larger than it should have been for a hand.... There was more in the pocket than just a fist. And he, when I finally got his hand out of his pocket, I could feel the hard bulky substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">After being asked to review the video tape of the incident, Young was cross-examined further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">Q. Okay. Now, when you touched his left pocket, what did you feel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">A. As I said before, I can\u2019t recall if I had touched it for \u2014 before he had rammed his hand in his pocket or if it was at the same time. I know that I remember feeling something in his pocket that was hard and I did not know what it was. His left hand, I remember feeling his left hand in his pocket with that substance also when he would not remove his hand from his pocket. And like I said, I had to physically remove his arm from his pocket and go inside the pocket to get the item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">Q. Did you feel what felt like a gun in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">A. I didn\u2019t \u2014 as I said before, I\u2019m thinking about my safety from the get go, and that\u2019s what I didn\u2019t know, if it was a gun or what it was. It was hard. It could have been a weapon. I didn\u2019t know what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-18\">Q. How big was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-19\">A. About the size of my fist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">[I]t is patent that the officers had more than reasonable suspicions to suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>that criminal activity was afoot. Additionally, upon observing the defendant\u2019s attempt to hide the \u201cbulge\u201d in his left front pocket, the suspicious movements of his hand and the later refusal to remove his hand from the pocket, the officer had every right to believe that a gun or other weapon could be inside his pocket. For his own safety, as well as that of his fellow officer, Deputy Young was authorized to conduct a \u201cpat down\u201d search of the person of the defendant. <em>Cf. United States v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 227, 232 (6th Cir.1996). The plain view doctrine extends to \u201cplain feel\u201d. An officer properly patting down a suspicious stop under <em>Terry, </em>in search for weapons may seize an object whose contour and mass make it apparent that it is a sizable object. <em>See Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. [366], 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). Finally, the baggies which the officers observed in the passenger compartment of the automobile obviously were in plain view and the seizure of same should not be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The district court after conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the record concurred in the result reached by the magistrate, but relied upon different legal grounds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">When reviewing the constitutional validity of a <em>Terry </em>search, the court must consider whether a reasonably prudent officer in the circumstances of the challenged search is warranted in his belief that his safety or that of others is in danger. <em>United States v. Swann, </em>149 F.3d 271, 275 (4th Cir.1998). Here, the officer detected a lump in the defendant\u2019s left pocket that, after the initial frisk, the officer could not pinpoint as a weapon or non-weapon. If an officer is unable to exclude the possibility of a weapon, he may reach into a suspect\u2019s pocket and remove the item and remain within the conf\u00ednes set forth in <em>Terry. Id.; United States v. Strahan, </em>984 F.2d 155 (6th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>129 F.3d 76 (2nd Cir.1997). Based on the contour of the bulge, the defendant\u2019s nervous behavior, and the defendant\u2019s act of placing his hand in the pocket and refusing to remove his hand, the officer was justified in his belief that the object may have been a weapon and thus could reach in and remove the object from the defendant\u2019s pocket under <em>Terry.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Police officers may seize contraband detected during the lawful execution of a <em>Terry </em>search. <em>See Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). Here, the illegal drugs were detected during a lawful <em>Terry </em>search and the officer had probable cause to believe that the powder and rocks that were removed from the defendant\u2019s pocket were contraband. Upon their removal it was immediately apparent to the officer that the contents of the defendant\u2019s pocket were illegal drugs. That, combined with the defendant\u2019s nervous behavior and the presence of a large number of baggies\u2014 commonly used in the drug trade \u2014 was sufficient to give the officer probable cause for the drugs\u2019 seizure under <em>Dickerson </em>and its predecessors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">On appeal, defendant admits that the officers had reasonable suspicion to support a <em>Terry </em>stop and pat down. Defendant argues, however, that the pat down did not justify the officer physically putting his hand in defendant\u2019s pocket and removing the contraband. We disagree. For the reasons set forth by Judge Coffman in her written opinion and order, we conclude that the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\">. The officers subsequently determined the blue truck was not the one reported stolen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
