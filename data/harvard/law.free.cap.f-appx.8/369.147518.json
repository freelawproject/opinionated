Although the respondent appeared at the trial before the Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d), it did not file exceptions with the Board from the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Board applied to this court for summary enforcement of its decision and order on December 14, 2000. The respondent requested an extension of time in which to file a response, asserting it was engaged in settlement discussions with the Board. An extension for filing a response was granted until February 5, 2000, but respondent\u2019s counsel later informed the court that no response would be filed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we conclude the Board is entitled to the relief sought. <em>See NLRB v. Tri-State Warehouse &amp; Distributing, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 31 (6th Cir.1982) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>(order) (in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a Board decision and order is entitled to summary enforcement if no objections are filed with the Board); <em>NLRB v. Innkeepers of Ohio, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 177 (6th Cir.1979) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">It therefore is ORDERED that the Board\u2019s decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-42161 is hereby enforced. The respondent, Refrigeration Service, Inc., d/b/a R.S.I. Appliance Service, its officers, agents, successors and assigns, shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">1.

Reasonable steps shall be taken by the respondent to ensure that the notices are not altered, defaced, or covered by any other material. In the event that, during the pendency of these proceedings, the respondent has gone out of business or closed the facility involved in these proceedings, the respondent shall duplicate and mail, at its own expense, a copy of the notice to all current employees and former employees employed by the respondent at any time since April 25,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">(d) Within 21 days after service by the Region, file with the Regional Director a sworn certification of a responsible official on a form provided by the Region attesting to the steps that the respondent has taken to comply with this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES POSTED PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS ENFORCING AN ORDER OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">An Agency of the United States Government</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">The National Labor Relations Board has found that we violated the National Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Relations Act and has ordered us to post and abide by this notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">WE WILL NOT unilaterally discontinue pension plan contributions on behalf of unit employees, or refuse to meet and bargain collectively with Local Union 636, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada, AFL-CIO, in an appropriate bargaining unit.
