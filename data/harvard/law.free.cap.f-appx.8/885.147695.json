The ease is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\"><em>Pro se </em>petitioner, Harold Dean Cooksey, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) so he can appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a final order disposing of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Cooksey also filed a motion seeking to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal; that motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Cooksey filed his \u00a7 2254 petition with the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on September 11, 2000. In his petition, Cooksey raised only one issue: Cooksey claimed the sentence he received for a 1993 Oklahoma state conviction for bail forfeiture was improperly enhanced by a prior Texas conviction. The district court dismissed Cooksey\u2019s petition as untimely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">A review of the appellate record reveals that this is Cooksey\u2019s second petition for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. On May 10, 1995, Cooksey filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. That petition was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma where it was assigned Case No. 95-CV-1411-E. Cooksey filed an additional habeas petition with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma in which he raised four additional issues. That petition was assigned Case No. 97-CIV-632-E. Although the respondent in that case argued that the petition filed in Case No. 97-CIV-632 E was a second or successive petition, the district court consolidated the two cases and analyzed all five issues raised in the two petitions. Similarly, all five issues were addressed by this court when it dismissed Cooksey\u2019s appeal. <em>See Cooksey v. Champion, </em>No. 99-5008, 1999 WL 363104 (10th Cir. June 7,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">An applicant may not file a second or successive motion for relief pursuant to \u00a7 2254 in the district court until he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>\u201cmove[s] in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Cooksey, however, filed the instant petition in the district court without first requesting permission from this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the district court lacked jurisdiction over Cooksey\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and we, therefore, vacate its order dismissing the petition. Because we conclude that the instant \u00a7 2254 petition is successive, we construe Cooksey\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief as a request for authorization to file a second or successive habeas petition. <em>See Pease v. Klinger, </em>115 F.3d 763, 764 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(1), \u201c[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.\u201d It is clear that the only claim raised in this petition, <em>i.e., </em>that Cooksey\u2019s sentence was improperly enhanced by a prior Texas conviction, was raised in Cooksey\u2019s first \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Cooksey, </em>1999 WL 363104, at *1. Accordingly, Cooksey is not entitled to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition for the purpose of relitigating this claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cooksey\u2019s request for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-6\">. In the habeas petition Cooksey filed in the Western District of Oklahoma, he clearly indicated that he had filed a prior habeas petition. The Western District may have inadvertently failed to check this with the Northern District. To preserve scarce judicial resources, we encourage district courts to take particular care in determining their jurisdiction over a habeas petition before proceeding to the merits of the petition. When Cooksey\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was filed without the required appellate court authorization, the district court should have transferred it to this court. See <em>Coleman v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 339, 341 (10th Cir. 1997) (\"[W]hen a second or successive petition for habeas corpus relief under \u00a7 2254 ... is filed in the district court without the required authorization by this court, the district court should transfer the petition or motion to this court in the interest of justice pursuant to [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1631\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-17\">. The AEDPA applies because the instant petition was filed after the Act's April 24, 1996 effective date. <em>See Hatch v. Oklahoma, </em>92 F.3d 1012, 1014 (10th Cir.1996). Even if we were to apply pre-AEDPA standards, Cooksey\u2019s application to file a second or successive petition would be denied because his claim was rejected on the merits in his first petition and the \"ends of justice\u201d would not be served by a redetermination. <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 15, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); <em>Hawkins v. Evans, </em>64 F.3d 543, 547 (10th Cir.1995) (\"[A] federal court's rejection of a state habeas petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim on grounds of state procedural default is a determination on the merits for purposes of the Rule 9(b) successive petition doctrine.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
