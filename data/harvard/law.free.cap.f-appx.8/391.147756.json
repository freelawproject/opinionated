Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of contempt and contends the six-month term of imprisonment imposed is disproportionately harsh, constituting an abuse of discretion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-25\">Shortly before the events at issue, defendant Richard D. Goldberg had been a medical malpractice attorney. During the 1990\u2019s, he began to experience personal financial problems. In order to solve these problems, he began misappropriating his clients\u2019 funds. On June 8, 1999, an indictment was returned charging defendant Goldberg with seven counts of mail fraud and three counts of bank fraud. Defendant pleaded guilty to seven counts of mail fraud and one count of bank fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and ultimately admitted responsibility for having defrauded twenty-three clients of $4,475,451. On November 17,1999, he was sentenced to a prison term of forty-one months with an extended self-reporting date of January 7, 2000. In the meantime, he was subject to electronic-monitored home confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">On December 23, 1999 defendant filed a motion for permission to leave his house on December 31, 1999 from 5:30 p.m. until 2:30 a.m. The given reason for the request was the wedding of Krista Cannone, said to be defendant\u2019s godchild. The motion was granted by District Judge Dan A. Polster by margin entry order on December 29, 1999, indicating simply, \u201cMotion granted, so ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">It is undisputed that defendant did attend the wedding for a number of hours, but also attended a New Year\u2019s Eve party at a Youngstown restaurant. He did, however, return to his home within the established time limit. Subsequently, Judge Polster learned that defendant may have violated the conditions of his release from home confinement on New Year\u2019s Eve and ordered defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">At the February 7, 2000 show cause hearing, it was revealed that Krista Can-none was not defendant\u2019s godchild at all. However, the district court accepted defendant\u2019s explanation that the inclusion of this erroneous information was the result of an honest mistake by defendant\u2019s secretary. Further, defendant admitted that he had left the wedding on New Year\u2019s Eve and gone to a friend\u2019s party at approximately 11:00 p.m. He explained that he had not originally intended to go to the party, but that his wife had suggested they go there to spend time with their children, who were invited to the party, because commencement of his prison sentence was imminent. Defendant testified that he did not intend to violate the court\u2019s order, and meant no disrespect to the court. To the extent he had violated the court\u2019s order through his temporary diversion, defendant characterized it as an \u201chonest mistake\u201d and apologized to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The district court, on the other hand, characterized defendant\u2019s conduct as \u201ca willful and deliberate flaunting of the court\u2019s order.\u201d Considering that defendant had been granted the privilege of home confinement pending self-surrender, had been granted the further privilege of the New Year\u2019s Eve release for a limited purpose, and had then taken advantage of this latter privilege to pursue other personal purposes in a public way, the district court concluded that defendant\u2019s final transgression was no mere technical violation of the court\u2019s order. The district court determined that defendant, in addition to having \u201cbrought disrespect on the legal community\u201d through his convicted offenses, had now \u201cbrought substantial discredit on the federal court,\u201d \u201cdiminishing [the federal court] in the eyes of the public.\u201d Defendant was found guilty of contempt and sentenced to an additional six months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Defendant first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to satisfy the elements of the charged contempt. The district court\u2019s judgment of conviction must be supported by substantial and competent evidence on the whole record. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>995 F.2d 1357, 1362 (6th Cir.1993). When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, the court must ask \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 567 (6th Cir.1999). All reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In order to establish contempt, the government must prove that defendant willfully violated a specific, clear and unequivocal court order. <em>Downey v. Clauder, </em>30 F.3d 681, 686 (6th Cir.1994). That is, the government must prove (1) the existence of a lawful order of reasonable specificity; (2) that defendant had knowledge or notice of the order; and (3) that defendant willfully disobeyed the order. <em>Id.; United States v. Allen, </em>73 F.3d 64, 67 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Defendant does not directly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the first of these elements and does not argue that the order was in any way unclear or ambiguous. Neither has defendant made an issue of the second element, his knowledge or notice of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Addressing the third element, defendant maintains in his briefing that there is no evidence that he <em>willfully </em>violated the court\u2019s order. The only evidence offered on the issue, he argues, was his own testimony, which indicates his violation was motivated by the desire to spend a little time with his children and was innocent, not disrespectful or \u201cwillful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u201cWillfulness\u201d \u201cimplies a deliberate or intended violation, as distinguished from an accidental, inadvertent or negligent violation.\u201d <em>Downey, </em>30 F.3d at 686. Although defendant testified that he had no intent to violate the order, he also admitted that he understood the order did not authorize his attendance at the New Year\u2019s Eve party. The district judge, who had ample opportunity to assess defendant\u2019s credibility, was entitled to find, under the circumstances, that the violation was not accidental or inadvertent or negligent, but deliberate. Indeed, defendant conceded the point during oral argument of his appeal, acknowledging the willfulness of his violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Accordingly, we hold that a rational trier of fact could find all the elements of contempt proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenge is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Imprisonment is a permissible punishment for contempt. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401. However, neither the contempt statute nor the Sentencing Guidelines prescribe an appropriate sentencing range. The length of a sentence of imprisonment for contempt is therefore committed to the sound discretion of the sentencing court. <em>United States v. Seavers, </em>472 F.2d 607, 611 (6th Cir.1973). Defendant contends the district court abused its discretion when it sentenced him to an additional six months in prison for such an innocent violation of the conditions of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">\u201cSentences for criminal contempt are punitive in nature and are imposed for the purpose of vindicating the authority of the court.\u201d <em>United States v. United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 U.S. 258, 302, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). Factors which may guide the court in sentencing for criminal contempt are \u201cthe extent of the willful and deliberate defiance of the court\u2019s order, the seriousness of the consequences of the contumacious behavior, the necessity of effectively terminating the defendant\u2019s defiance as required by the public interest, and the importance of deterring such acts in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303. \u201cBecause of the nature of these standards, great reliance must be placed on the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Here, the district court justifiably felt compelled to vindicate the authority and integrity of the court and the legal profession as whole. Further, considering that defendant\u2019s violation evidenced his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>continuing reliance on deceit and manipulation to get his way, despite having just been sentenced to 41 months for fraud offenses, the district court may well have determined that a substantial penalty was needed to deter future misconduct by defendant. These are legitimate purposes, appropriately served by a six-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147, a person convicted of a misdemeanor offense while released pending sentence or appeal shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, to be served consecutively. Defendant\u2019s contempt violation may be compared to a misdemeanor offense. His six-month sentence is well within the penalty range established by Congress under \u00a7 3147.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">According the district court due deference in this matter, we hold that it did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
