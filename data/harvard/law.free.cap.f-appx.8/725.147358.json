NELSON, and BERZON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b756-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">A. <em>Disparagement and Defamation Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">Hollenbeck\u2019s false statement to Kim regarding the inability of Krystal Enterprises (\u201cKrystal\u201d) to service its buses could not have caused Krystal\u2019s damages arising out of Kim\u2019s refusal to accept delivery of three buses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The injunction prohibited Krystal from delivering the infringing buses to Kim, so it would not have mattered that Krystal could not service buses that it was not allowed to sell in the first place.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not err in granting Metrotrans Corporation\u2019s (\u201cMetrotrans\u201d) motion for summary judgment on Krystal's disparagement and defamation claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>B. <em>Lanham Act Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Krystal failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Metro-trans\u2019 \u201cTag Axle\u201d and \u201cHave You Heard the Rumor\u201d advertisements contained false claims of product superiority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have distinguished (1) an advertisement that explicitly or implicitly asserts that a claim of product superiority is based on studies, which may be proven false by showing that the studies are unreliable, from (2) an advertisement that made no such assertion, which must be proven false by affirmative evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that neither advertisement in this case mentions a study or comparative analysis or implies that Metrotrans\u2019 claims of product superiority are study-validated. Therefore, Krystal was required to offer evidence tending to show the falsity of Metrotrans\u2019 claims of product superiority. It failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The claim of \u201chighest residual value\u201d in the \u201cTag Axle\u201d advertisement was based on a comparison of \u201cresidual value,\u201d the average percentage of the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price that is retained upon resale. Thus, the fact that Krystal\u2019s buses had a higher resale value according to the \u201cBus Book\u201d is irrelevant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Krystal has offered no other evidence tending to show that the claim of \u201chighest residual value\u201d was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">In its \u201cHave You Heard the Rumor\u201d advertisement, Metrotrans claimed the \u201chighest resale value ... of any small U.S.A. bus.\u201d However, because this advertisement was published in August 1997, Krystal\u2019s comparison of \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d resale values in the 1998 edition of the \u201cBus Book,\u201d which was not fully compiled until November 1997 (at the earliest), does not tend to show that such a claim was false when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">Nor did Krystal offer any evidence tending to show that Metrotrans\u2019 advertisements, although \u201cliterally true,\u201d were \u201clikely to mislead.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Krystal\u2019s surveys of how mid-size bus consumers prioritize \u201cresidual value\u201d have nothing to do with whether the advertisements conveyed an implied message and deceived the viewing public. Instead, they merely suggest that such consumers would be very interested in Metrotrans\u2019 advertisements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For all these reasons, the district court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>in granting Metrotrans\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Krystal\u2019s Lanham Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\">. The only damages Krystal seeks as a result of Hollenbeck's false statement are those arising out of Kim\u2019s refusal to accept delivery of three buses. The damages that Krystal seeks for harm to its reputation were allegedly caused by Metrotrans\u2019 advertisements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-18\">. Hollenbeck sent his letter to Kim before the settlement allowing Krystal to sell some of its infringing buses was reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-19\">. Krystal did not appeal the district court's ruling on Metrotrans\u2019 first summary judgment motion that Hollenbeck\u2019s statement regarding how long it would take Krystal to deliver new buses was \"opinion and not fact\" and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>not a basis for a defamation or disparagement action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). Krystal\u2019s amended complaint also alleged that these advertisements: (1) defamed and disparaged Krystal, and (2) constituted trade libel under California law. These claims have been dismissed and are not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">. <em>Southland Sod Farms v.

In other words, even if the resale price of Krystal\u2019s model was higher than that of Metrotrans\u2019 comparable model, Krystal's model could still have (and did have, according to the study) a lower \"residual value\u201d than that of the Metrotrans model, if Krystal\u2019s bus originally sold for more money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\">. <em>William H. Morris Co. v. Group W, Inc., </em>66 F.3d 255, 258 (9th Cir.1995) (\"Where a statement is not literally false, and is only misleading in context, ... proof that the advertising actually conveyed the implied message and thereby deceived a significant portion of the recipients becomes critical [to a Lanham Act claim].\u201d); <em>see also Southland Sod Farms, </em>108 F.3d at 1140 (stating that relief is available under Lanham Act if it is shown, typically through the use of consumer surveys, that an advertisement misled, confused, or deceived the consuming public).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b757-17\">. Krystal contends that it has raised a genuine issue of material fact to support its Unfair Business and Trade Practices Act claim, <em>see </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17500, because Metrotrans\u2019 \u201d[r]el[iance] upon outdated data has a tendency to mislead.\u201d For the same reason given above, this claim is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
