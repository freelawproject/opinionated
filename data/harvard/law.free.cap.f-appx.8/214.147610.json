Rice pled guilty and was sentenced to a prison term of sixty-three months. He appeals his sentence on the ground that the district court erred in applying United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2A3.1 rather than \u00a7 2A3.2. We are constrained to agree. We vacate Rice\u2019s sentence and remand the matter to district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">In February 1999, using the screen name \u201cEP Mentor,\u201d Rice came into contact with a law enforcement investigator posing as \u201cMatt\u201d in an Internet \u201cchat room.\u201d \u201cMatt\u201d told Rice that he was thirteen years old.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rice was fifty-eight years old at the time. \u201cMatt\u201d talked to Rice about questions \u201cMatt\u201d was having regarding his sexual orientation, and Rice offered to answer questions about homosexuality, described a variety of homosexual acts, and offered to meet \u201cMatt\u201d to perform certain acts of intercourse with \u201cMatt.\u201d The Internet conversations between Rice and \u201cMatt\u201d progressed to the point that Rice revealed his real name and sent \u201cMatt\u201d pictures of himself, his car, and his home. He also gave \u201cMatt\u201d phone numbers where he could be reached during this time period. Eventually, after a number of e-mails and telephone calls, Rice, who lived in West Virginia, arranged to meet \u201cMatt\u201d at a motel in Bedford, Virginia, where the boy supposedly lived. On February 20, 1999, Rice drove from West Virginia to Bedford and registered at the motel under the name \u201cE.P. Mentor.\u201d After making preparations for the sexual activity, Rice drove to a school where he had arranged to meet \u201cMatt\u201d and was there arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">Rice pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2423(b), which makes interstate travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile a criminal offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">Travel with intent to engage in sexual act with a <em>juvenile. </em>\u2014 A person who travels in interstate commerce ... for the purpose of engaging in any sexual act (as defined in section 2246) with a person under 18 years of age that would be in violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2423(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Rice was sentenced in January 2000. Under the 1998 version of the sentencing guidelines, which was then appropriate to use, the district court was faced with three potentially applicable sentencing guidelines for Rice\u2019s violation of section 2423(b): U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.3. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. A. When more than, one guideline is applicable for a particular statute, the sentencing court must \u201cuse the guideline most appropriate for the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. A, intro. comment.; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, comment. (n.l) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Rice contended, as did the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report, that the most appropriate sentencing guideline for his offense was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, entitled \u201cCriminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts,\u201d which imposed a base offense level of 15. By contrast, the Government asserted that the most appropriate guideline was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1\u2014 \u201cCriminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse\u201d \u2014 which fixed a more substantial base offense level of 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The district court agreed with the government that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3 .1 was the proper guideline. The district court observed that \u00a7 2A3.2 was \u201canalogous to simple statutory rape.\u201d J.A. 53. However, the district court concluded that Rice\u2019s conduct, if successful, \u201cwould not have been simple statutory rape\u201d but \u201cwould have been more analogous to sexual abuse.\u201d J.A. 53. The court based this conclusion on the age disparity between Rice and \u201cMatt\u201d as well as the supposed immaturity and naivety of the ostensible victim. Accordingly, the district court applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 in determining Rice\u2019s sentence and imposed a term of 63 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">We review the sentencing court\u2019s selection of the appropriate guideline <em>de novo. See United States v. Davis, </em>202 F.3d 212, 218 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1236, 120 S.Ct. 2675, 147 L.Ed.2d 286 (2000). Our task is simply to select the most appropriate guideline for the nature of the offense by \u201ccompar[ing] the guideline texts with the charged misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>994 F.2d 1088, 1092 (4th Cir.1993). When a defendant is to be sentenced for a crime such as Rice\u2019s where the gravamen of the offense is crossing a state line with intent to commit one of several defined crimes, we hold that in choosing between allowable guidelines sections the court should use the guideline for the offense that the court reasonably finds, based upon all the facts and circumstances, would have been committed if the defendant\u2019s efforts had continued to fruition. With this principle in mind, we review the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The district court selected the criminal sexual abuse guideline set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1. This guideline was drafted to cover conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2242 (West 2000). Broadly speaking, sections 2241 (\u201cAggravated sexual abuse\u201d) and 2242 (\u201cSexual abuse\u201d) criminalize conduct in which the victim, regardless of his or her age, has been coerced into sexual activity by force or threats, or conduct in which a person has engaged in sexual activity with an incapacitated victim. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2242.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Section 2241 covers sexual abuse under aggravated circumstances that unquestionably are not present in this case, including the actual application of force or the use of death threats against the victim. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Section 2242 is likewise inapplicable to Rice\u2019s anticipated misconduct. Section 2242 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">Whoever, in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in a Federal prison, knowingly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">(1) causes another person to engage in a sexual act by threatening or placing that other person in fear (other than by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected <em>to </em>death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">(2) engages in a sexual act with another person if that other person is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">(A) incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">(B) physically incapable of deehning participation in, or communicating unwillingness to engage in, that sexual act; or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2242. We find nothing in the indictment or the record of Rice\u2019s guilty plea that convinces us that Rice threatened \u201cMatt\u201d or attempted to place him in fear or otherwise overcome his will such that the intended sexual encounter would have been nonconsensual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rice\u2019s offense conduct, therefore, fits better within the attempted statutory rape guideline \u2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2. This guideline specifically refers to the federal statute criminalizing sexual abuse of a minor, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2243(a) (West 2000), which makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly engage[ ] [or attempt to engage] in a sexual act with another person who \u2014 (1) has attained the age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years; and (2) is at least four years younger than the person so engaging.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2243(a). The conduct proscribed by this provision would be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>sensual but for the age of the victim. Rice\u2019s plan falls within this guideline more comfortably than the criminal sexual abuse guideline. Despite the offensive nature of Rice\u2019s proposal, he never threatened or attempted to coerce \u201cMatt\u201d and there is nothing before us indicating that he intended to do so. Rice was also forthcoming about his age, his own identity, and the conduct he proposed. There was no secret scheme, so far as the record goes, that Rice concealed from \u201cMatt.\u201d Thus, we are unable to say that the proposed encounter would not have been consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Moreover, the Government\u2019s position leads to an unlikely result. On <em>this </em>record, had Rice actually carried out his plan to completion, his conduct could not have constituted sexual abuse under section 2242, which would have required Rice to have threatened \u201cMatt\u201d or placed him in fear, unless \u201cMatt\u201d was \u201cincapable of appraising the nature of the conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2242(2)(A). The factual basis for Rice\u2019s plea simply does not allow us to conclude without excessive speculation that \u201cMatt\u201d was incapable of understanding what Rice was proposing. Rice\u2019s proposed conduct did not rise to the level of attempted sexual abuse but would have instead, if completed, constituted the crime of statutory rape. Therefore, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 is the applicable guideline in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We hasten to add, however, that the factors identified by the district court-\u2014 such as the ostensible victim\u2019s tender years and the age disparity between the two, as well as the use of the Internet\u2014 may indeed make Rice\u2019s offense different from the run-of-the-mill statutory rape and remove this case from the heartland of cases sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2. Although the district court suggested it would depart upward if we determined U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 was the proper guideline, it did not in fact depart or follow the procedure outlined in <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Accordingly, that issue is not currently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We also reject the Government\u2019s argument that statements in the Background Commentaries dictate a different result. The Government first refers to language appended to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 which states: \u201cSexual offenses addressed in this section are crimes of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 comment, (backg\u2019d) (1998). From this the Government argues that Rice\u2019s proposed conduct would have been a crime of violence and hence covered by \u00a7 2A3.1 only. The Government points to the fact that Rice was much older than the purported victim and argues that his conduct presented a substantial risk of physical harm and a substantial risk that, during the rendezvous, Rice would end up employing physical force to ensure \u201cMatt\u2019s\u201d compliance. Given the complete disclosures made in this case, we are not comfortable with this degree of speculation. Simply as a matter of logic, it seems to us the same risks identified by the Government inhere in conduct that violates section 2243(a) even if there is no extreme age disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Additionally, the Background Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 provides as follows: \u201cAny criminal sexual abuse with a child less than twelve years of age, regardless of \u2018consent,\u2019 is governed by \u00a7 2A3.1.\u201d The government\u2019s argument implies that, even absent sufficient indicia of violence or force, \u201cMatt\u2019s\u201d young age \u2014 thirteen\u2014renders \u00a7 2A3.1 applicable. Were we to agree, we would necessarily adopt a categorical rule mandating the application of \u00a7 2A3.1 instead of \u00a7 2A3.2 when the contemplated sexual offense involves a thirteen year old victim. Given that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Guidelines currently provide for such a categorical rule with respect to victims who are under the age of twelve, we decline to extend the rule to thirteen year old victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Second, the Government argues that the Background Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 controls our decision. It reads in toto as follows: \u201cThis section applies to sexual acts that would be lawful but for the age of the victim. It is assumed that at least a four-year age difference exists between the victim and the defendant, as specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a). An enhancement is provided for a defendant who victimizes a minor under his supervision or care.\u201d The Government directs our attention to the first sentence and asserts that the test of lawfulness should be under state law. Because Virginia outlaws the particular sexual acts Rice proposed, the Government believes U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 should be excluded from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We do not accept the Government\u2019s argument. The statute under which the defendant was prosecuted expressly requires that the sexual act intended be one as defined by federal law, and prosecutable as well as a federal offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">A person who travels in interstate commerce ... for the purpose of engaging in any sexual act (as <em>defined in section 22\u00ed6 ) </em>with a person under 18 years of age <em>that would be in violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and temitorial jurisdiction of the United States </em>shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2423(b) (emphasis added). Given these statutory requirements, we decline to pull a sentence out of the Background Commentary to impose another layer of consideration that would be based on the vagaries of state laws regulating sexual activities. Indeed, to do so would be inconsistent with the policies underlying the Sentencing Guidelines. A primary Congressional aim in establishing the Sentencing Guidelines was the promotion of \u201creasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.\u201d U.S.S.G. Ch. 1 Pt. A, p.s. Although we recognize that the Sentencing Guidelines direct us to refer to state law on occasion, <em>see, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include \u201coffense[s] under federal or state law\u201d), we should read the Guidelines with federal law in mind unless specifically instructed otherwise. <em>See United States v. Reed, </em>94 F.3d 341, 344 (7th Cir. 1996) (explaining that \u201c[l]ike any other federal statute, the Guidelines must be interpreted in accordance with federal law, even when those Guidelines refer to some event occurring in state court\u201d and noting that the Guidelines section at issue contained \u201c[n]othing ... suggesting] that [the court] should look to state law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">In sum, we conclude that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, the statutory rape guideline, is the most analogous guideline for Rice\u2019s offense. Accordingly, we vacate Rice\u2019s sentence and remand for the sentencing court to apply that guideline and for further consideration, including whether an upward departure would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\">. There is some discrepancy in the record about whether the investigator initially indicated that \u201cMatt\u201d was thirteen or fourteen years old, but Rice concedes that the investigator eventually told him that \"Matt\u201d was thirteen years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. Rice also pled guilty to using certain personal property in the commission of the underlying offense and agreed to the forfeiture of the property. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253 (West 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">. Likewise, Rice's charged misconduct simply does not indicate that Rice attempted to employ deception and \u201cpsychological force\u201d in persuading \"Matt\u201d to agree to a rendezvous. The Government argues that Rice applied \"psychological force\u201d by telling \"Matt\u201d that Rice was a \"father figure\u201d who could not only instruct \u201cMatt\u201d in sexual matters but could also provide exciting opportunities for \"Matt\u201d to participate in various activities that would interest a thirteen-year-old boy. None of this evidence, however, was charged in the indictment or put into the record during Rice's guilty plea. Thus, it would be inappropriate to consider this evidence <em>in the initial selection </em>of the proper guideline. <em>See Lambert, </em>994 F.2d at 1092 (explaining that \u201cselection of the appropriate sentencing guideline must turn ... on the perceived similarity of the crime charged in the indictment and the guideline ultimately selected\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.2 comment, (backg\u2019d) (\"Where a stipulation ... made between the parties on the record during a plea proceeding specifically establishes facts that prove a more serious offense ... than the offense [charged in the indictment], the court is to apply the guideline most applicable to the more serious offense.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
