Arrous pleaded guilty to and was convicted of intentionally assaulting and intimidating a flight attendant in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46504; he was sentenced to two months in the custody of the Attorney General to be followed by one year of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution to the victim in the amount of $388.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">On appeal, Arrous argues, and the government agrees, that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) when it ordered him to pay restitution without having warned him during the plea hearing that restitution might be part of his sentence. We agree. Rule 11(c)(1) clearly requires that the district court inform the defendant \u201cthat the court may also order the defendant to make restitution to any victim of the offense.\u201d We have previously held that failure to do so cannot be harmless error where, as here, the court subsequently imposes restitution. <em>See United States v. Showerman, </em>68 F.3d 1524, 1527 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">We therefore vacate and remand the sentence. As we recognized in <em>Showerman, </em>we have broad authority to devise a remedy where Rule 11(c)(1) sentencing violations such as this have occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 1528-29. We conclude that the proper remedy in this case is for the district court either (1) to withdraw its direction to make restitution, or (2) to allow Arrous to withdraw his plea of guilty and proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">For the reasons set forth above, the sentence imposed by the district court is VACATED AND REMANDED; on remand, the court shall either (1) withdraw its direction to make restitution, or (2) allow Arrous to withdraw his plea of guilty and proceed to trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
