We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. In the briefing order, Taylor was warned that this court would not consider issues not specifically raised in his informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. Local R. 34(b). Nonetheless, Taylor\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the district court\u2019s order, but instead addresses only the merits of his \u00a7 1983 claim. Accordingly, we affirm. We also deny Taylor\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
