New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Pulido-Noriega contends that the district court erred when it increased his base offense level by 16 points, because the fact that his prior deportation followed an aggravated felony conviction was neither admitted nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. He further contends that <em>Apprendi </em>calls into question the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Pulido-Noriega\u2019s contentions, however, are foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413-14 (9th Cir.2000), <em>amended </em>(Feb. 8, 2001). <em>United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED. We REMAND to the district court with directions to correct the judgment of conviction to exclude the reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). <em>United States v. Herrerar-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000) <em>(sua sponte </em>remanding to the district court with directions to correct judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-23\">AFFIRMED in part, REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-24\">.
