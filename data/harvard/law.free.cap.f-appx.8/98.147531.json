Messih, </em>224 F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2000). The district court was well-justified in finding that plaintiffs mark was weak, and also in finding that the parties used their respective slogans in connection with the names of their firms. Accordingly, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiff did not demonstrate sufficient likelihood of success on the merits to justify the grant of preliminary relief. The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
