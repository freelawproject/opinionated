Specifically, Feldman argues that he was unfairly prejudiced when the prosecutor improperly used the term \u201cwe know,\u201d contended incorrectly that the defense bore the burden of proof, incorrectly stated that particular events were uncontroverted, improperly questioned defense counsel\u2019s decisions not to cross-examine certain state witnesses, improperly contended that certain witnesses had not been impeached by the defense, incorrectly stated that a certain witness did not know Feldman, and indirectly commented on Feldman\u2019s decision not to testify. The record indicates that with respect to each of these comments, the trial court either sustained objections to them, issued curative instructions to the jury, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-21\">We affirm for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum and order. <em>See Feldman v. McGinnis, </em>No. 00-1941, slip op. at 1-3 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-22\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
