Hurd, <em>Judge) </em>granting the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing her complaint, which alleged violations of her constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against them in its entirety.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>McKeon v. Daley, </em>101 F.Supp.2d 79 (N.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">As the factual background of this case is adequately related in the District Court\u2019s opinion, it will not be repeated here. The District Court dismissed McKeon\u2019s claims against Defendant-Appellant County of Herkimer because McKeon failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of any municipal custom or policy relating to her prosecution for perjury. The District Court also dismissed her claims against Defendant-Appellant Michael E. Daley (\u201cDaley\u201d) in his official capacity in light of the state\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity. As to McKeon\u2019s claims against Daley in his individual capacity, the District Court found that Daley was entitled to absolute or qualified immunity for his actions relating to her claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution. As to McKeon\u2019s remaining claim against Daley, regarding his alleged unlawful custodial interrogation of her before her grand jury testimony, the District Court found that McKeon failed to raise sufficient facts to establish a violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. McKeon challenges all of these findings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">For essentially the reasons provided by the District Court, we affirm the dismissal of McKeon\u2019s claims alleging malicious prosecution and false arrest against Daley in his individual capacity, her claims against Daley in his official capacity, and her claims against the County of Herkimer. Even presuming that Daley gave Ahern the expired subpoena, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that McKeon failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding Daley\u2019s alleged violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. As the District Court indicated, McKeon recognized the subpoena was \u201cexpired\u201d be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>fore she agreed to accompany Ahern; she consulted with her attorney before agreeing to accompany Ahern to Daley\u2019s office; and she received the benefit of her attorney\u2019s presence and advice at Daley\u2019s office. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>916 F.2d 814, 819 (2d Cir.1990) (listing factors to determine whether a reasonable person, in light of all the circumstances, would feel that he was not free to leave); <em>cf. United States v. Waksal, </em>709 F.2d 653, 660 (11th Cir.1983) (finding violation of Fourth Amendment rights when officers retained suspect\u2019s airline ticket and driver\u2019s license and gave no indication that suspect was free to leave, to refuse consent to a search, or to contact an attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">For the reasons provided above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-12\">. Although the caption to the appeal indicates that the New York State Division of Police was also a defendant below, it was terminated as a party on February 11, 1998 shortly after the complaint was filed. The case against the remaining defendant, John F. Ahern (\u201cAhern\u201d), proceeded to trial, with the jury returning a verdict in favor of Ahem.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
