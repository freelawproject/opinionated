We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal, <em>Wyler Summit P\u2019ship v. Turner Broad. Sys., </em>135 F.3d 658, 661 (9th Cir.1998), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">Because Commissioner Leininger\u2019s actions constituted \u201cfunctions normally performed by a judge,\u201d judicial immunity bars appellant\u2019s contentions. <em>See Franceschi v. Schwartz, </em>57 F.3d 828, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Appellant failed to allege any facts to state a claim that the County of Orange violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Appellant waived his claim that Judge Carter was liable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act because he conceded to the district court that Judge Carter\u2019s actions were proper and did not oppose her motion to dismiss to the district court. <em>See, e.g., Mendoza v. Block, </em>27 F.3d 1357,1360 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-20\">Because appellant alleged no facts indicating that statutory procedures were not followed or that a statute was improperly applied to him, the district court properly granted the remaining defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Stone v. Travelers Corp., </em>58 F.3d 434, 437 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">We deny appellees\u2019 request for judicial notice, filed February 22, 2001, as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
