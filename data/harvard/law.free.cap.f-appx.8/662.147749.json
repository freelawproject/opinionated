We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir.1998), and may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>see Henry v. Gill Indus., Inc., </em>983 F.2d 943, 950 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment as to the ADA and section 1983 claims because those claims were barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 266-67, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-19\">Even if Cisneros\u2019 attempts to seek an administrative remedy for his academic dismissal tolled the one-year statute of limitations on his federal claims, he nevertheless failed to bring an action within the time required by the statute of limitations. <em>See Elliott v. City of Union City, </em>25 F.3d 800, 802 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">To the extent that Cisneros asserts that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his state law claims, the assertion is not persuasive. <em>See Executive Software N. Am., Inc. v. United States Dist. Court, </em>24 F.3d 1545, 1555-56 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims if the court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
