Upon de novo review, <em>see Springdale Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Springdale Sch. </em>Dist., 133 F.3d 649, 651 (8th Cir.1998), we conclude that Hogrobrooks\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed as barred by res judicata and the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> doctrine, <em>see Costner v. URS Consultants, Inc., </em>153 F.3d 667, 673 (8th Cir.1998) (res judicata bars further claims by parties based on same cause of action); <em>Neal v. Wilson, </em>112 F.3d 351, 356 (8th Cir.1997) (under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over challenge to state bar disciplinary proceedings). We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions or denying appointment of counsel. <em>See Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (sanctions); <em>Stevens v. Redwing, </em>146 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir.1998) (appointment of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-13\">.
