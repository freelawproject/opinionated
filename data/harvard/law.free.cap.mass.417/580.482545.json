L. c. 151B (1992 ed.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 (1992 ed.) (equal rights act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff alleges that, on March 22, 1991, he was terminated by the defendant Muzi Motors, Inc., because of his age or national origin in violation of the equal rights act. He concedes that he did not proceed under G. L. c. 151 B, because he failed to file a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) within the six-month period required by G. L. c. 151 B, \u00a7 5. A judge in the Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>rior Court, reasoning that the equal rights act does not provide a remedy for discriminatory discharge, allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted the plaintiffs application for direct appellate review and now affirm. We hold that, where G. L. c. 151B is applicable, employees alleging discriminatory conduct by their employer must comply with the administrative requirements of c. 151B and failure to do so precludes actions by employees based on the equal rights act. Therefore, the plaintiffs failure to invoke the protection of G. L. c. 151B required the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">1. <em>Exclusivity provision of G. L. c. 151B. </em>The plaintiff contends that the equal rights act provides alternative remedies for employment discrimination in concert with c. 151B. We do not agree. We base our decision on the language of c. 151B, legislative intent, and our precedents interpreting its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Chapter 151B creates an administrative procedure for the enforcement of antidiscrimination statutes of the Commonwealth. See <em>Black </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Malden, </em>365 Mass. 197, 202 (1974), <em>S.C., </em>369 Mass. 657 (1976). As this court has stated, \u201cthe clear purpose of G. L. c. 15IB is to implement the right to equal treatment guaranteed to all citizens by the constitutions of the United States and the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>365 Mass. 357, 366 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\u201cAs a starting point for our analysis we assume, as we must, that the Legislature was aware of the existing statutes in enacting [the equal rights act], <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contribu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>tory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>335 Mass. 610, 614 (1957), and that if possible a statute is to be interpreted in harmony with prior enactments to give rise to a consistent body of law. <em>Everett </em>v. Revere, 344 Mass. 585, 589 (1962).\u201d <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977). The Legislature is \u201c \u2018presumed to understand and intend all consequences\u2019 of its acts.\u201d <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>408 Mass. 572, 578 (1990), quoting <em>Rambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 771, 774 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Chapter 151B provides a detailed framework to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth against employment discrimination. It defines terms and prohibited practices and establishes procedures for the filing, investigation, and disposition of complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">One court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cAn antidiscrimination statute such as Chapter 151B reflects the legislature\u2019s balancing of competing interests. Employees are protected against certain types of discharge. Employers are protected from unnecessary litigation by a relatively short statute of limitations, <em>see </em>ch. 151B \u00a7 5 (six months), and a mandatory conciliation process . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU5\"><em>Crews </em>v. <em>Memorex Corp., </em>588 F. Supp. 27, 29 (D. Mass. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Chapter. 151B provides \u201ctwo largely independent avenues for redress of violations of the antidiscrimination laws of the Commonwealth, one through the MCAD . . . and the other in the courts.\u201d <em>Christo </em>v. <em>Edward G. Boyle Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 815, 817 (1988). However, under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, a person claiming discrimination \u201cmay maintain a civil action only if she has previously filed a timely complaint with the [MCAD] and ninety days have passed (or a commissioner has assented to an earlier filing).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816. \u201cResort to the courts is not available for a complaint of discrimination within the jurisdiction of the MCAD unless the person claiming to have been the object of unlawful discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>first makes a timely complaint to that agency.\u201d <em>Cherella </em>v. <em>Phoenix Technologies Ltd., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 919 (1992), citing <em>Melley </em>v. <em>Gillette Corp., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 512-513 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>397 Mass. 1004 (1986). <em>Sereni </em>v. <em>Star Sportswear Mfg. Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 428, 430 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>405 Mass. 446, 452 (1989), we concluded that G. L. c. 151B did not provide an employee with the option to proceed with a de nova judicial hearing under \u00a7 9 after a final decision of the MCAD pursuant to \u00a7 6. \u201cBy providing for judicial review of MCAD decisions, and by foreclosing agency action once a party has sought a judicial remedy pursuant to \u00a7 9, the Legislature signaled its intent that the parties would be bound by an MCAD decision, subject only to judicial review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In view of the carefully crafted procedures of c. 151B, it is unlikely that, in adopting the equal rights act, the Legislature intended to create a parallel and competing alternative to dealing with the problem of employment discrimination in the Commonwealth. The statutory language supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Section 9 of G. L. c. 151B provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cas to acts declared unlawful by section four, the procedure provided in this chapter shall, while pending, be exclusive; and the final determination therein shall exclude any other action, civil or criminal, based on the same grievance of the individual concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cAny person claiming to be aggrieved by a practice made unlawful under this chapter ... or by any other unlawful practice within the jurisdiction of the commission, may, at the expiration of ninety days after the filing of a complaint with the commission, or sooner if a commissioner assents in writing . . . bring a civil action for damages or injunctive relief or both in the superior or probate court . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The suggestion that the phrase \u201cwhile pending\u201d of \u00a7 9 means that c. 151B is the exclusive remedy solely for actions filed with the MCAD is incorrect. This interpretation ignores the legislative intent to subject all discrimination claims to some administrative scrutiny. In essence the words \u201cwhile pending\u201d are an acknowledgment that a complaining employee must first file his claim with the MCAD, and that the pending claim may be decided administratively with judicial review of the final administrative decision. If the employee opts for judicial determination of his claim, he may do so only ninety days after filing the claim (or sooner with permission) in which case the administrative process terminates, and the claim is no longer pending before the MCAD. Thus the election to pursue a claim of discrimination in court applies only after the first step of filing with the MCAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Our appellate decisions have consistently applied this view of the exclusivity of c. 151B remedies. In an opinion whose analysis and conclusion we have adopted, the Appeals Court decided that a new common law remedy for employment discrimination should not be created where G. L. c. 151B applies. See <em>Melley </em>v. <em>Gillette Corp., </em>397 Mass. 1004 (1986). The Appeals Court reasoned that, \u201cwhere, as here, there is a comprehensive remedial statute, the creation of a new common law action based on the public policy expressed in that statute would interfere with that remedial scheme. Not only would the legislative preference for an administrative solution be circumvented, but serious problems would be posed as to the extent of the remedy provided.\u201d <em>Melley </em>v. <em>Gillette Corp., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 513 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">More recently, the Appeals Court examined the relationship between G. L. c. 151B and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I (1992 ed.). In <em>Mouradian </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 538 (1987), a plaintiff alleged that he was wrongfully terminated because of age discrimination in violation of c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1B), and c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I. The plaintiff had filed a complaint with the MCAD that was dismissed because it was not filed within the relevant limitations peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ads prescribed by c. 151B. The <em>Mouradian </em>court, <em>id. </em>at 543, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cThere may be a case in which the termination of an at-will employee could give rise to a tenable complaint seeking relief under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I. This is not such a case, as the only \u2018right [ ] secured by the . . . laws of the commonwealth\u2019 (the operative words of c. 12, \u00a7 11H, in this instance) is the right which could have been enforced under the procedures established by c. 151B. In the circumstances, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I, do not create an independent right to vindicate an alleged wrong which might have been the subject of investigation and possible vindication under G. L. c. 151B, were it not for [the plaintilFs] delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The decisions in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686 (1987), and <em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 11 (1982), are not to the contrary. In <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, supra </em>at 693, where c. 151B was inapplicable, the court decided that its exclusivity provisions do not preclude an independent claim of a violation of an employee\u2019s equal protection rights under art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments. In <em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 20, we ruled that an employee was not foreclosed by c. 15IB from raising a tort claim under common law principles established prior to adoption of c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We therefore conclude that, where applicable, G. L. c. 151B provides the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination not based on preexisting tort law or constitutional protections, and that the plaintiffs failure to adhere to the requirements of G. L. c. 151B required the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-4\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 4 (1), 4 (1B), &amp; 4 (5) (1992 ed.), provide: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201c1.

Given the <em>Patterson </em>decision, the Superior Court judge determined that G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 do not provide a remedy for a discriminatory discharge. The judge further reasoned that, if the Legislature had \u201cintended to overrule Patterson,\u201d it would not have used the identical words that the <em>Patterson </em>court had interpreted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
