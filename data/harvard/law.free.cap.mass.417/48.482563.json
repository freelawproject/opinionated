L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (1992 ed.), and G. L. c. 93A (1992 ed.). General Laws c. 176D regulates trade practices in the insurance industry. General Laws c. 93A, known as the Consumer Protection Act, regulates business practices for the protection of consumers. The relevant portions of the statutes are set forth in the margins.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">This case arose out of a medical malpractice suit originally filed by the plaintiffs, Jean and Bill Poznik, in 1989. In 1991, the plaintiffs amended their complaint joining the MMPIA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as a defendant. The amended counts (counts 17 and 18) alleged that the MMPIA had engaged in unfair claim settlement practices. The MMPIA moved to dismiss counts 17 and 18 on the grounds that it is not subject to G. L. c. 93A and c. 176D. A Superior Court judge filed a well-reasoned memorandum and allowed the motion. The plaintiffs appealed. We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The plaintiffs filed a malpractice suit against the defendant\u2019s insured, Dr. Rowland Meyer. The plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>complaint alleged that Dr. Meyer had performed a total abdominal hysterectomy on Jean Poznik without her consent. Bill Poznik, Jean\u2019s husband, sought damages for loss of consortium. In the amended counts against the MMPIA, the plaintiffs claimed that the MMPIA had failed to negotiate a settlement in good faith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In 1975, most insurance companies had stopped issuing medical malpractice policies and were threatening to cancel outstanding policies. The Legislature established the MMPIA in response to this malpractice insurance crisis. The MMPIA was created in order to \u201cguarantee the continued availability of medical malpractice insurance.\u201d St. 1975, c. 362. The MMPIA is a temporary, nonexclusive, nonprofit joint underwriting association whose purpose is to provide medical malpractice insurance on a self-supporting basis. St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 6, third par.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><em>\u201cBusiness of Insurance. \u201d </em>The plaintiffs assert that \u2022 the MMPIA is engaged in the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d because it is empowered to issue policies of insurance, underwrite the insurance, collect premiums, adjust claims, and pay losses. In . addition, the plaintiffs argue that the Legislature\u2019s intent to subject the MMPIA to liability is clear from its failure to exempt it from c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The Superior Court judge concluded that the MMPIA was not in the business of insurance: \u201cBecause the [MMPIA] can have no private profit, assumes no risk of loss, and has no discretion on whom it insures or on rates, it is not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u2018business of insurance\u2019 so as to be subject to G. L. c. 176D.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The MMPIA provides insurance policies pursuant to legislative mandate, but it is not in the <em>business </em>of insurance. As the Superior Court judge observed, the business of insurance involves \u201cprofit driven business decisions about premiums, commissions, marketing, reserves and settlement policies and practices.\u201d The MMPIA is a non-profit association. Any revenue received by the MMPIA which exceeds liabilities and expenses must be returned to its policyholders or held as reserves to cover future liabilities. St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 6, fifth par. In addition, the MMPIA must provide medical malpractice coverage to every physician and hospital in the Commonwealth who meets the underwriting standards and cannot obtain coverage through a private insurer. St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 6, sixth par. It has no discretion as to whom it may insure. Nor does the MMPIA make decisions regarding its premiums. Its premium rates are set by the Commissioner of Insurance \u201con an actuarially sound basis . . . calculated to be self-supporting.\u201d St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 6, ninth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Moreover, unlike a private insurer, the MMPIA assumes no risk of loss. If the MMPIA operates at a deficit, it may seek to recover from all \u201clicensed physicians or hospitals insured under a policy of medical malpractice insurance, whether obtained through the joint underwriting association or not.\u201d St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 6, eighth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The legislative guidelines governing the MMPIA indicate that the MMPIA is a legislatively created and controlled entity. Its function is to ensure the availability of medical malpractice insurance to doctors and hospitals, which \u201chelps to maintain the smooth operation of the medical care marketplace.\u201d <em>Risk Management Found. of the Harvard Medical Insts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 498, 506 (1990). There was no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that the MMPIA is not in the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d and therefore not subject to liability under G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\"><em>\u201cTrade or Commerce.\" </em>The plaintiffs assert that the MMPIA is engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiffs argue that the Legislature intended G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>to be interpreted as broadly as possible to protect the rights of consumers, and none of the narrow exceptions to the applicability of c. 93A applies to the MMPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The Superior Court judge determined that the MMPIA did \u201cnot have the business context or business motive characteristics considered important in the case law.\u201d He concluded that the MMPIA, as a government created and controlled entity, \u201cis not engaged in \u2018trade or commerce\u2019 and is not subject to suit under G. L. c. 93A.\u201d There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We have said that \u201cthe proscription in \u00a7 2 of \u2018unfair or deceptive acts or practices . . . \u2019 must be read to apply to those acts or practices which are perpetrated in a <em>business </em>context\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 611 (1978). The question whether a transaction occurs in a business context must be determined by the facts of each case. <em>Begelfer v. Najarian, </em>381 Mass. 177, 190-191 (1980). The factors we consider include \u201cthe nature of the transaction, the character of the parties and their activities, and whether the transaction was motivated by business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>All Seasons Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston, </em>416 Mass. 269, 271 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774 (1992), we determined that the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund was not engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The character of the MMPIA as a \u201cstatutorily mandated, nonprofit\u201d association is similar to the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund. The MMPIA\u2019s transactions, like those of the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, are \u201cmotivated by legislative mandate, not business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The purpose of G. L. c. 93A is to improve the commercial relationship between consumers and business persons and to encourage more equitable behavior in the marketplace. See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 12 (1983). Chapter 93A imposes liability on persons seeking to profit from unfair practices. The deterrence goals of c. 93A are inapplicable in a non-business context.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The Legislature has granted the MMPIA only limited powers. It has mandated that the MMPIA operate on a self-sustaining basis. The MMPIA does not operate in the general marketplace. Its customers are those who cannot obtain insurance from insurance companies in the general marketplace. The MMPIA does not assume the risk of loss. In sum, it is not engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 2 <em>(a) </em>(1992 ed.), provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall engage in this commonwealth in any trade practice which is defined in this chapter as, . . . an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance.\u201d Section 1 defines \u201cperson\u201d as: \u201cany individual, corporation, association, partnership . . . and any other legal entity or self-insurer which is engaged in the business of insurance, including agents, brokers, and adjusters. For purposes of this chapter, operators of any medical and hospital service plans shall be deemed to be engaged in the business of insurance.\u201d General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a) (1992 ed.), provides in pertinent part: \u201cUnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d Section 1 <em>(b) </em>states: \u201c \u2018Trade\u2019 and \u2018commerce\u2019 shall include the advertising, the offering for sale, rent or lease, the sale, rent, lease or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, any security . . . and any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value wherever situate, and shall include any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The Massachusetts Medical Professional Insurance Association changed its name in May, 1993.
