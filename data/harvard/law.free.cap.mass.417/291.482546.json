The claim is that the denial violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to the Constitution of the United States and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes a defendant\u2019s right to make a closing argument in a criminal trial. See <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 862-863 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 10, 12-13 (1986). Perhaps because a probationer in a revocation hearing does not have the full range of constitutional rights applicable in a criminal trial (see <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782 [1973]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 112 [1990]), the defendant does not argue here that the denial of his request to make a closing argument violated either his State or his Federal constitutional right to counsel. See also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>350 Mass. 732, 736-737 (1966), concerning a court rule requirement that counsel be appointed for an indigent defendant in a probation revocation matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In the summer of 1989, the defendant was convicted of various charges and received concurrent sentences of incarceration, twenty-four months to be served, and the balance of each sentence suspended with probation for five years. Based on the issuance on September 28, 1992, of a restraining order against the defendant under G. L. c. 209A (1992 ed.), a notice of surrender was issued to the defendant on February 4, 1993. A Superior Court judge held a final probation revocation hearing on February 23, 1993, and ordered the defendant\u2019s probation revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The testimony before the judge warranted the conclusion that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation and justified the entry of an order revoking the defendant\u2019s probation. Although the judge failed to make findings of fact or to state the reasons for his conclusions, the defendant does not challenge those omissions on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The testimony of the defendant\u2019s wife indicated, among other things, that in February, 1992, the defendant beat her so badly that she had to be treated at a hospital; in April, 1992, she received seven stitches as a result of the defendant\u2019s punching her; in May, 1992, the defendant threw his stepson\u2019s hamster against a wall, killing it; in August, 1992, he broke the neck of the family\u2019s pet rabbit and bit his wife\u2019s leg, leaving marks still visible at the time of the probation revocation hearing; in September, 1992, his wife had to go to a hospital because of his violent acts; and on the day before the G. L. c. 209A order was entered, the defendant chased his wife out of their house, saying, \u201cI am going to bury you in the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony, counsel for the defendant said that he would like to make an argument on behalf of his client. The judge replied, \u201cThere are no arguments.\u201d Defense counsel objected and pressed the point that the defendant would like to be heard before the judge made a decision, but the matter proceeded with the entry of orders that the sentences previously imposed be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The defendant could have argued to us that the judge erred in not making written findings of fact and in not setting forth his reasons for the revocation of probation. See note 1 above. If the defendant had done so and had pressed his rights, he could have discovered whether the judge erred because of a mistaken belief that the defendant was before him for violating a restraining order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is reason to believe from statements of the judge during the hearing that he may have thought that probation revocation was proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>because the defendant had violated a court order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Allowing defense counsel to present a final argument might have eliminated any uncertainty on this point. On the other hand, the defendant could have protected his rights by requesting written findings and reasons (as he did), pressing for action on his request, and appealing from any failure of the judge to act on the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We are aware of no authority that says that the failure to grant final argument in a probation revocation hearing is a violation of a probationer\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law: Cf. <em>Ruedas </em>v. <em>State, </em>586 S.W.2d 520, 523-524 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979) (refusal to allow closing argument in probation revocation proceeding violates State constitutional right to counsel). The requirements of due process in these circumstances are flexible. See <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 613 (1985) (\u201cour precedents have sought to preserve the flexible, informal nature of the revocation hearing, which does not require the full panoply of procedural safeguards associated with a criminal trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 113-114 (1990). \u201cThe written statement required by <em>[Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778 (1973)] and <em>[Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471 (1972)] helps to insure accurate factfinding with respect to any al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>leged violation and provides an adequate basis for review to determine if the decision rests on permissible grounds supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, supra </em>at 613-614. We decline to impose a universal due process requirement that a defendant in a probation revocation hearing has an absolute right to make a closing argument. Of course, better practice would permit such a defendant to present at least a brief closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">We also decline to answer the question whether on the specific facts of this case there was a denial of due process because no final argument was allowed. It is apparent that the judge believed enough of the wife\u2019s testimony to revoke the defendant\u2019s probation. It is doubtful that defense counsel could have said anything to the judge that would have led to any orders different from those that were entered. The judge may have proceeded on a false premise, but the defendant could have presented this issue by insisting on findings and reasons that would have disclosed whether the judge did so. We will not permit the defendant\u2019s tactical choice not to press for findings and reasons to force this court to reach a constitutional issue that we would not otherwise have to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The orders of the Superior Court revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and committing the defendant in execution of the sentences imposed are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The judge\u2019s failure to make findings of fact and to set forth his reasons for revoking probation was error. See <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973); <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972); <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 498, 504-505 (1980). The defendant filed a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>for findings and reasons on March 2, 1993, but no action was taken on the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">As we shall explain, the defendant\u2019s failure to press this point is the most significant factor influencing our conclusion that we need not decide whether the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated because of special circumstances in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The order was issued after the violent events set forth above in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In the midst of the recross-examination of the defendant\u2019s supervising probation officer, the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Defense counsel: \u201cAnd there\u2019s no criminal sanctions imposed for having a restraining order issued against you; is there . . . ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The witness: \u201cIn this case \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The judge: \u201cA violation of a 209 [sic] order is a criminal offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADo4\">Defense counsel: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a violation here, Judge.

A violation of a 209 [sic] order is a criminal offense. The 209 [sic] order, the issuance, is a civil matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b311-7\">Liacos, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMq\">(dissenting). In identifying the procedural requirements of due process for probation revocation hearings, the United States Supreme Court has observed that \u201cthe decision to revoke probation typically involves two distinct components: (1) a retrospective factual question whether the probationer has violated a condition of probation; and (2) a discretionary determination by the sentencing authority whether violation of a condition warrants revocation of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>bation.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, 471 </em>U.S. 606, 611 (1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court today appears to overlook the second component. The court suggests that the only purpose that closing argument could have served was to clarify a potential misunderstanding by the judge as to the basis for revocation. If this were correct, the court\u2019s refusal to consider the defendant\u2019s due process challenge because of his \u201ctactical choice not to press for findings and reasons,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 295, would, in my view, suffice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This \u201ctactical choice\u201d however, has no bearing on the defendant\u2019s principal argument (and the one to which he devotes the bulk of his brief), that is, that the judge\u2019s refusal to hear him at the close of evidence denied him his opportunity to be heard, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 113 (1990), and prevented the judge from exercising informed discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">A probationer\u2019s right to present material relevant to the discretionary phase of a revocation proceeding is well established. The \u201cprobationer is entitled to an opportunity to show not only that he did not violate the conditions [of probation], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>but also that there was a justifiable excuse for any violation or that revocation is not the appropriate disposition.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, supra </em>at 612. \u201cMoreover, where the factfinder has discretion to continue probation, the procedures required by <em>[Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778 (1973)] and <em>[Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471 (1972)] assure the probationer an opportunity to present mitigating evidence and to argue that alternatives to imprisonment are appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614. \u201cIt is not enough that a violation of probation condition has been admitted or established at a hearing. A further and equally important step is necessary to determine whether such a violation warrants revocation and, if so, what sentence shall be imposed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz-Burgos, </em>601 F.2d 983, 985 (9th Cir. 1979). \u201cAlthough the probationer may not call witnesses with respect to the second stage of the hearing, <em>he has the right to address the court and present it with mitigating </em>circumstances\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>889 F.2d 328, 332 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The defendant in this case clearly had something to say, through his counsel, at the conclusion of the evidence. After his request for argument had been turned down once (over his objection), counsel stated: \u201cMr. Marvin would like to be heard, your Honor, before you impose your sentence, before making a decision, your Honor.\u201d The judge did not respond. I believe this was error. The opportunity to be heard on disposition is an essential aspect of the accommodation in probation revocation hearings of \u201cthe interests involved in a manner that satisfies procedural due process.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, supra </em>at 614. The defendant was denied this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I cannot agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cIt is doubtful that defense counsel could have said anything to the judge that would have led to any orders different from those that were entered.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 295. This is not the point. Nor is there any basis in the record for this conclusion. But revocation of probation was certainly not the <em>only </em>possible decision, and it is not inconceivable that the defendant could have presented information that would have swayed the judge to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>different result. See <em>Morin, supra </em>at 332. For the process to maintain its integrity, the requirements of due process must be respected. In this case, they were not. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">These procedural requirements include \u201c \u2018(a) written notice of the claimed violations of [probation or] parole; (b) disclosure to the [probationer or] parolee of the evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a \u201cneutral and detached\u201d hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking [probation or] parole.\u2019 <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>[408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972)].\u201d <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973).
