The Superior Court judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the Connecticut statute applies to this action and bars the plaintiffs claim for relief. The plaintiff appealed and we granted his application for direct appellate review. We reverse the judgment, and remand this case for further proceedings. The few relevant facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The plaintiff, Daniel Cosme, at all relevant times was a resident of the Commonwealth, and was employed in Connecticut. On July 21, 1986, while in the course of his employment, he was injured while cleaning a machine at his place of employment. The machine which allegedly caused his injuries is a Whitin full roller card machine. The machine was designed and manufactured in 1939 by the defendant, Whitin Machine Works, Inc. (Whitin), then a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. The machine was delivered to the plaintiffs place of employment in 1939, and has remained there since.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The plaintiff commenced this action in the Superior Court on March 13, 1987. The plaintiff alleges that his injuries were caused by Whitin\u2019s negligent design and manufacture of the machine, failure to warn of the dangerous condition of the machine, and breach of express and implied warranties concerning the machine. After a period of discovery, Whitin moved the court for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs action is barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-577a (a) (1993),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides in part that certain products lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>bility actions shall not be brought after ten years from the date that the product left the control of the defendant. The judge granted Whitin\u2019s motion, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant. The judge ruled that under Massachusetts choice-of-law rules, the Connecticut statute of repose applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We examine whether the ten-year repose provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-577a (a) applies in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Traditionally, in matters of tort, the courts of this Commonwealth apply the substantive laws of the jurisdiction wherein the tort occurred. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>389 Mass. 327, 333 (1983). Generally, however, Massachusetts courts will apply their own rules of procedure. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>307 Mass. 64, 66 (1940). Where it is not clear that a rule of law is procedural in the Commonwealth for choice-of-law purposes, we take a functional approach in determining the choice-of-law issue, using established conflicts criteria and considerations. See <em>Bushkin Assocs. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>393 Mass. 622, 631-636 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The Commonwealth considers statutes of limitation as procedural: \u201cMassachusetts views statutes of limitation as relating to the remedy, and it applies its own law as the law of the forum.\u201d <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Riverside Park Enters., Inc., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 421 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>399 Mass. 533 (1987), and cases cited. We have not determined whether statutes of repose are procedural with respect to choice of law. We have ruled in another context, however, that statutes of repose are distinguishable from statutes of limitation, in that they \u201ccompletely eliminate [] a cause of action,\u201d <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>412 Mass. 617, 622 (1992), quoting <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 702 (1982), whereas statutes of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tian \u201c[are] procedural measure[s] which \u2018normally govern[ ] the time within which legal proceedings must be commenced <em>after the cause[s] of action accrue[ ] </em>(emphasis supplied).\u2019 \u201d <em>McGuinness, supra </em>at 621, quoting <em>Klein, supra. </em>Because statutes of repose are not clearly procedural for choice of law purposes in the Commonwealth, we examine the issue using a functional approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In examining conflicts issues using a functional approach, \u201cwe have not elected by name any particular choice-of-law doctrine.\u201d <em>Bushkin Assocs., supra </em>at 631. Rather, we consider choice-of-law issues \u201cby assessing various choice-influencing considerations,\u201d <em>id., </em>including those provided in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971), and those suggested by various commentators. See <em>id. </em>at 631-632; <em>Cohen, supra </em>at 336. We examine the present issue guided by the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Section 145 of the Restatement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides the general principle \u201capplicable to all torts and to all issues in tort,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 145 comment a, and \u00a7 146 of the Restatement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>principle applicable in issues concerning causes of action involving personal injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both sections require an examination of the relevant issue in accordance with the principles provided in \u00a7 6 of the Restatement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">We begin by examining the contacts which Connecticut a\u00f1d Massachusetts have with the parties and the occurrence in this case. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 145 (2). Connecticut is the place where the injury occurred, and the place of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. In addition, the plaintiff, after being injured, received compensation pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s compensation statute. Massachusetts is the plaintiff\u2019s place of residence, Whitin\u2019s principal place of business and former State of incorporation, and the State wherein the alleged conduct causing the plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Under \u00a7 146, the law of Connecticut \u2014 as the \u201cstate where the injury occurred\u201d \u2014 applies, unless Massachusetts has a \u201cmore significant relationship\u201d to the parties and the occurrence under the considerations provided in \u00a7 6. We thus examine the various relevant considerations provided in \u00a7 6 as they relate to the issue at hand to determine whether Massachusetts has a more significant relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We recognize the basic policies underlying the field of products liability. Generally, providing a cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>compensation of individuals injured is the policy behind products liability actions: \u201c[Pjublic policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them . . . and that the [user] of such products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the hands of someone, and the proper persons to afford it are those who market the products.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment c (1965), quoted in <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 354-355 (1983). There exists a corresponding policy of holding accountable those whose defective products cause injuries: \u201cRecognizing that the seller is in the best position to ensure product safety, the law of strict liability imposes on the seller a duty to prevent the release of \u2018any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer,\u2019 into the stream of commerce.\u201d <em>Correia, supra </em>at 355, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 402A(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Legislature of Connecticut has chosen to limit the products liability cause of action to a period of ten years from the date that the product was released from the possession or control of a party. See Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-577a (a). The courts of Connecticut have recognized that this provision was intended to protect defendants, and presumably the courts of Connecticut, from \u201cstale claims.\u201d See <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Mach. Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 583 (1986). Massachusetts has not limited products liability actions with a statute of repose, and it therefore has illustrated no similar policy of protecting defendants from claims for injuries caused by older products. We examine the relative interests of Connecticut and Massachusetts in applying their policies in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Connecticut has an obvious interest in having its law apply, as it is the place where the plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred. However, Connecticut\u2019s interest in protecting defendants from claims concerning older products is not as compelling in the circumstances as it would be if Whitin were a Connecticut business, and Connecticut\u2019s corresponding interest in pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tecting its courts from such claims is obviously not at stake. It is worth noting that the Supreme Court of Connecticut has ruled that Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-577a is procedural in nature: \u201cSection 52-577a does not create a right of action in the product liability context. That right of action is created by the common law or the product liability act. Thus, \u00a7 52-577a must be considered procedural.\u201d <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 509, 525 (1989). Thus, Connecticut does not view Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-577a as part of its substantive law, and it therefore likely has a diminished expectation of having it apply in other jurisdictions as part of its substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Massachusetts has a significant interest in seeing that its resident plaintiff be compensated, and that its resident defendant, Whitin, be held accountable for its conduct, which took place in Massachusetts, and which allegedly caused the plaintiffs injury. \u201c[T]he fact that the domicil and place of business of [the plaintiff and the defendant] are grouped in a single state is an important factor to be considered in determining the state of the applicable law. The state where these contacts are grouped is particularly likely to be the state of the applicable law if either the defendant\u2019s conduct or the plaintiffs injury occurred there.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 145 comment e, at 421. The interests at stake for Massachusetts, because of its relationship to the parties and the conduct causing the plaintiffs alleged injury are greater than those of Connecticut. Clearly, Massachusetts has a dominant interest in seeing its policy enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The needs of the interstate system do not point us in any particular direction. \u201cDeference to sister state law in situations in which the sister state\u2019s substantial contacts with a problem give it a real interest in having its law applied . . . will at times usefully further this part of the law\u2019s total task.\u201d R.A. Leflar, American Conflicts Law \u00a7 104, at 293 (4th ed. 1986). As discussed above, although Connecticut has some interest, its contacts to the parties and the occur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>renee do not demonstrate a significant interest in applying its statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The protection of justified expectations is not here a concern. \u201cThis is because persons who cause injury on nonprivileged occasions, particularly when the injury is unintentionally caused, usually act without giving thought to the law that may be applied to determine the legal consequences of this conduct. Such persons have few, if any, justified expectations in the area of choice of law to protect, and as to them the protection of justified expectations can play little or no part in the decision of a choice of law question.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 145 comment b, at 415-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Similarly, the values of certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result do not point us in the direction of applying Connecticut law. The interests of the Commonwealth in allowing the plaintiff\u2019s action are too strong to be affected by the general value of having Connecticut\u2019s law apply uniformly to all actions having a connection with that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Simplification of the judicial task fails to suggest that we apply the law of either State. The courts of this Commonwealth are more familiar with the laws and rules of Massachusetts than with those of Connecticut; however, application of the Connecticut statute of repose would end the action, and thus, in effect also simplify the judicial task.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">In sum, Massachusetts has a more significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence than does Connecticut. We recognize that we are not following the result in the case of <em>Alves </em>v. <em>Siegel\u2019s Broadway Auto Parts, Inc., </em>710 F. Supp. 864 (D. Mass. 1989) where the facts ar\u00e9 somewhat different. We hold that the repose provision found in Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-577a (a) shall not apply to this action. We reverse the judge\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of the defendant, and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Connecticut Gen.
