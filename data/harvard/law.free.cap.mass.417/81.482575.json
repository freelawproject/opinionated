Tobin, Sr. (respondent), from the practice of law for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">On April 2, 1990, bar counsel filed a petition for discipline against the respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 5, 1991, a hearing committee (committee) of the board conducted an evidentiary hearing and subsequently recommended that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of not less than sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The respondent and bar counsel both appealed and an appeal panel adopted the committee\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law but concluded that the committee\u2019s recommended discipline was inadequate for the seriousness of the respondent\u2019s conduct. The panel consequently recommended a three-year suspension from the practice of law and that the respondent be required to take and pass the Multi-State Professional Responsibility Examination as a condition of reinstatement. The board voted to adopt the panel\u2019s recommendation on September 14, 1992, with two members voting for a two-year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The board filed an information with this court on November 10, 1992, and a single justice subsequently ordered that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law in the Commonwealth for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\"><em>Facts as found by the hearing committee. </em>The respondent was admitted to practice law in Massachusetts on March 31, 1951. During the period in question he practiced with his brother, Albert G. Tobin, at their firm (Tobin and Tobin) in the Roslindale section of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In 1983, Albert Tobin prepared wills for Walter Arnold and his wife, Mary Arnold (complainant). Walter Arnold died on August 12, 1986. All of his property, except the family automobile, was held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship in his wife. The automobile, though registered in Arnold\u2019s name, was driven by both Arnolds as a pleasure vehicle and, pursuant to G. L. c. 90D, \u00a7 15A (1992 ed.), was effectively held jointly with right of survivorship. Arnold left no debts or claims on the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On or about August 19, 1986, the complainant, accompanied by John Mulloy, her son from a previous marriage, met with the respondent to discuss the disposition of her husband\u2019s estate. The respondent knew that all of Walter Arnold\u2019s assets were held jointly with right of survivorship and that such joint assets did not become part of the probate estate and were not subject to administration in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Department. The respondent also knew his work on the Arnold estate could be limited to filing the will, preparing an estate tax return, and discharging the Massachusetts estate tax lien on the Arnolds\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Nevertheless, the respondent intentionally advised the complainant inaccurately and incompletely respecting her options and raised exaggerated and baseless concerns for the purpose of inducing the complainant to retain him for full probate of her husband\u2019s estate so that he could realize unwarranted and excessive legal fees for himself and his firm. The respondent\u2019s testimony and proffered explanations for his actions were frequently inconsistent and implausible, and his conduct following the meeting was improper and done for the purpose of concealing the fact that there was no necessity to probate Walter Arnold\u2019s estate. His actions included:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">1. In his petition for allowance of the will, the respondent misrepresented that Walter Arnold died possessed of solely-owned real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">2. He filed an affidavit misrepresenting that all of Walter Arnold\u2019s heirs at law were devisees or legatees under his will, although he knew that the complainant was the sole actual legatee under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>3. He prepared and filed an inventory in Probate Court which misrepresented that Walter Arnold\u2019s bank accounts were solely-owned although he knew that the accounts were jointly held and that jointly-held assets were not to be listed as part of the probate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">4. He prepared and filed an affidavit of error as to inventory in which he misrepresented that Walter Arnold solely owned the marital house, even though he knew that the property had been held by the Arnolds as tenants by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">5. He had the complainant sign a \u201crelease of all demands\u201d in which he misrepresented that he had paid over all the estate assets, even though he had never held any such assets and he knew that the complainant had held legal ownership and control of the assets since her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The respondent then sent the complainant a bill for $4,140 for his firm\u2019s services and $180 for disbursements. Although he had agreed to charge at a rate of between $75 and $125 an hour, the fee was actually based on a Massachusetts Bar Association minimum fee schedule (MBA schedule) that had been withdrawn<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and not on time spent or the agreed upon hourly rate. The respondent kept no contemporaneous time records.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The committee ultimately concluded that the respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u201c(1) induced [the complainant] to retain him with the intent of thereby collecting unwarranted fees; probated the Estate of [the complainant\u2019s] husband under false pretenses; intentionally performed and billed for unnecessary and improper legal services; and made false and fraudulent representations to the Probate Court, to [the complainant] and her family, and to the Bar Counsel, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>violation of Canon One, DR 1-102 (A) (4) [,] (5), and (6);[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201c(2) charged and attempted to collect a grossly excessive fee, in violation of Canon Two, DR 2-106(A) and (B);[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201c(3) failed to seek the lawful objectives of his client and prejudiced and damaged [the complainant] during the course of the professional relationship, in violation of Canon Seven, DR 7-101 (A) (1) and (3).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The respondent contests several aspects of the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the committee and adopted by the panel and the board. His assertions essentially culminate in a broad argument that the conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence and he urges us to credit his version of events over the complainant\u2019s. The committee, however, is the \u201csole judge of the credibility of the testimony presented at the hearing.\u201d <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 328 (1989), quoting S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (3), as appearing in 381 Mass. 784 (1980). <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Provanzano, </em>5 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 300, 303-304 (1987). In appropriate circumstances we will review the record to determine whether the single justice\u2019s decision is supported by sufficient evidence, free from errors of law, and free from any abuse of discretion. <em>Matter of Kenney, </em>399 Mass. 431, 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The respondent argues that he did not charge a clearly excessive fee and, therefore, did not violate any of the disciplinary rules. He claims prejudicial error because the committee did not make a finding of what would have been a reasonable fee for the necessary attorney services that he performed. He contends that his fee was reasonable because it is consistent with rates set under the former MBA fee schedule for nonprobate estate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Although these arguments fail, the more important consideration is that\" they are beside the point. The committee found that the respondent intentionally induced the complainant to retain him for full probate of her husband\u2019s estate so that he could realize unwarranted and excessive legal fees for himself and his firm. Moreover, the fee was unrelated to the hourly rate that the respondent had agreed to charge. Disciplinary Rule 2-106 prohibits charging a clearly excessive fee. Since the probate of the estate was unnecessary, the finding was clearly warranted that the fee for probating the estates was excessive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Neither was it error for the committee to conclude in the absence of expert testimony that the respondent needlessly probated the will. Expert testimony is unnecessary to prove ethical violations. <em>Matter of Saab, supra </em>at 329. Neither did the presence of the complainant\u2019s son at the time of the interview have any impact on the respondent\u2019s duty accurately to inform the complainant of her options.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The respondent argues that his misrepresentations to the Probate Court were not material and, therefore, did not violate the disciplinary rules. None of the case law cited by the respondent supports his position. Furthermore, any \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\u201d is prohibited. DR 1-102 (A). The finding that the respondent made false and fraudulent representations to the Probate Court, to the complainant and her family, and to bar counsel provides a proper basis to establish a violation of DR 1-102 (A) (4), (5), and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Finally, the respondent argues that he was denied due process because he did not have the same rights of discovery as bar counsel. He makes no claim, however, that he sought discovery orders from the committee which were denied or that the committee prevented him from utilizing discovery tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u201cThere is no doubt that [the respondent] has a constitutionally protected interest in his license to practice law and that he must be afforded due process of law before he can be deprived of that interest.\u201d <em>Matter of Kenney, supra </em>at 435. Parties to judicial or quasi judicial proceedings, however, are not entitled to pretrial discovery as a constitutional right. <em>In re Herndon, </em>596 A.2d 592, 594 (D.C. 1991). \u201cThe right to discovery stems from statutes or court rules providing for discovery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">There is authority for the proposition that an administrative agency must grant discovery to a party in a contested case regardless of whether the enabling statute or agency rules provide for it, if refusal to grant discovery would so prejudice the party as to amount to a denial of due process. <em>In re Herndon, supra </em>at 595. See <em>P.S.C. Resources, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>576 F.2d 380, 386 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Here, however, the board\u2019s rules provide for discovery or production of data at prehearing conferences, and for depositions with the approval of the hearing committee. The respondent failed to seek any discovery orders through these avenues. Board of Bar Overseers Rules \u00a7\u00a7 3.24-3.26, 4.9 and 4.10 (1993). Since the respondent failed to request discovery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>he cannot now claim he was denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Having reviewed the record and the respondent\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the single justice\u2019s decision is supported by sufficient evidence, free from errors of law, and free from any abuse of discretion. See <em>Matter of Kenney, supra </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We next turn to the issue whether the sanction imposed by the single justice was appropriate. The applicable standard for evaluating an appeal from a sanction imposed by a single justice is whether the sanction is \u201c \u2018markedly disparate\u2019 from the judgments in comparable cases.\u201d <em>Matter of McCarthy, </em>416 Mass. 423, 428 (1993), quoting <em>Matter of Neitlich, </em>413 Mass. 416, 421 (1992). <em>Matter of Palmer, </em>413 Mass. 33, 37-38 (1992). <em>Matter of Saab, supra </em>at 325. <em>Matter of Alter, </em>389 Mass. 153, 156 (1983). \u201cIn applying this standard, it is appropriate for us to consider the cumulative effect of the several violations committed by the respondent.\u201d <em>Matter of Palmer, supra </em>at 38. Moreover, we are mindful that the board\u2019s recommendation is entitled to substantial deference. <em>Id. </em>at 40. <em>Matter of Alter, supra </em>at 157-158.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We have reviewed the cases relied on by the respondent and conclude that most of them involve conduct that was less egregious than the respondent\u2019s or that special mitigating circumstances dictated lesser sanctions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In cases that we feel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>more closely approximate the facts before us, however, this court has generally imposed a sanction of less than three years\u2019 suspension.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Matter of Neitlich, </em>413 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Mass. 416, 420 (1992), this court sustained a one-year suspension where the respondent failed to make full disclosure as ordered by the court and where his misrepresentations to the Probate Court and opposing counsel constituted \u201cknowing concealment\u201d and were \u201cdeliberate, planned attempts . .. to conceal from the Court and his opponent the full terms of [a] proposed sale.\u201d Similarly, in the <em>Matter of Palmer, supra </em>at 33, we imposed a public censure on an attorney who, \u201cwhile acting as executor and attorney for an estate, charged a clearly excessive fee, filed a probate account containing misrepresentations and inaccurate statements as to amounts received and expended by the estate, and neglected a legal matter pertaining to the estate.\u201d In <em>Matter of Aronson, </em>3 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 13, 17 (1982), the single justice imposed a two-year suspension on an attorney who filed a false affidavit in an effort to collect funds from the Superior Court for representing an indigent client despite having been paid by his client\u2019s family. In <em>Matter of Pike, </em>408 Mass. 740, 745 (1990), we imposed a six-month suspension on an attorney who represented a client-lessee and the client\u2019s lessor without disclosing to the lessee that he received a commission from the lessor. Finally, we recently imposed a one-year suspension on an attorney who: elicited false, sworn testimony from his client; submitted in evidence false documents; and failed to correct the record at an eviction hearing before a rent control board when he had an opportunity to do so. <em>Matter of McCarthy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In the instant case, the respondent\u2019s inducement of his client to retain him for unnecessary services and his willingness to place his own financial interest above his client\u2019s right to dispassionate professional advice cuts to the heart of the attorney-client relationship and is a \u201cserious breach\u201d of his duties. <em>Matter of Pike, supra </em>at 745. His misrepresentations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the court and charging an excessive fee would each separately warrant at least a public censure. <em>Matter of Palmer, supra </em>at 38-39. Additionally, the board\u2019s consideration of the respondent\u2019s discipline history, a private censure for neglect of a legal matter in 1980, was \u201centirely appropriate.\u201d <em>Matter of Anderson, </em>416 Mass. 521, 525 (1993). See also <em>Matter of Saab, supra </em>at 327. Moreover, he presents no special mitigating circumstances. See <em>Matter of Anderson, supra </em>at 527 (only \u201cextraordinary mitigating circumstances\u201d should affect sanction otherwise warranted by attorney\u2019s conduct). We reject the respondent\u2019s assertion that his conduct in dropping his petition for counsel fees, with prejudice, should mitigate his sanction. Where an attorney has induced a client to retain him for unnecessary legal services and charged an excessive fee, his prudence in dropping his petition for counsel fees will not reduce the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">While this case most closely resembles <em>Matter of Palmer, supra, </em>the respondent\u2019s conduct was significantly more egregious in that he intentionally and fraudulently induced the complainant to retain him for unnecessary probate services. The serious nature of the respondent\u2019s cumulative ethical violations and his past disciplinary record clearly warrant a suspension. However, we disagree with the length of the suspension imposed by the single justice. Accordingly, we direct that a judgment suspending the respondent from the practice of law for eighteen months be entered in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The petition also named Albert G. Tobin, the respondent\u2019s brother. See <em>Matter of Tobin, post </em>92 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The Massachusetts Bar Association adopted a minimum fee schedule in 1967, which provided guidance to establish what it considered proper legal fees for attorney services. 2 G.

See <em>Matter of Knox, </em>412 Mass. 569 (1992) (pleaded guilty to conspiracy and structuring currency violations [\u201cmoney laundering\u201d] and used client trust accounts to conceal large amounts of cash knowing he was concealing illegal drug profits); <em>Matter of Weissman, </em>8 Mass.
