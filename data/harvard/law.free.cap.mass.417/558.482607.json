Reed, appeals. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>397 Mass. 440 (1986). On appeal after retrial, the defendant raises a single issue. The defendant claims that he was denied access to the treatment records of the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness, in violation of his rights under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant does not seek reversal or a new trial. His only request is that he be granted access to the treatment records. We conclude that there was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s request for the witness\u2019s treatment records. We affirm the conviction of murder in the first degree. Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1992 ed.), we have reviewed the entire record and conclude that there is no reason to order a new trial or enter a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Police discovered the body of a young woman, strangled to death, in a wooded area of Middleborough on November 8, 1981. At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witness linking the defendant to the crime was Patton Flannery, an inmate at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Bridge-water (Bridgewater). Flannery is serving a term of from thirty-six to seventy-two years for rape and assault with intent to commit murder. Flannery and Reed were inmates together at Bridgewater for approximately five years. The two became friends, and Reed continued to visit Flannery after his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Flannery testified he told the police that the defendant and his wife had visited him at Bridgewater a week after the murder, and that Reed confessed to him. According to Flannery, Reed admitted picking up the victim hitchhiking, forcing her to perform oral sex, and then strangling her with her blouse. Reed also admitted that he and his wife attempted to cover up the crime by burning Reed\u2019s automobile, abandoning the vehicle and reporting it stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Visitation records at Bridgewater indicated that the defendant visited Flannery on November 14, 1981. There also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>was evidence that Reed\u2019s wife reported their automobile stolen on November 8, 1981. On November 9, police recovered the Reeds\u2019 burned station wagon in a wooded area in Plympton, very close to where the defendant\u2019s aunt owned a home. The defendant\u2019s brother testified that, as a child, Reed frequently picked blueberries and grapes in the remote area where the burned automobile was found. A police chemist testified that a single rabbit hair found in the front seat of the abandoned automobile was similar in color and microscopic characteristics to hair samples taken from the victim\u2019s rabbit coat which was found near her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The defendant did not testify. The only defense witness was the previous owner of the Reeds\u2019 automobile who testified that she kept rabbits as pets and often transported them in the vehicle. The primary theory of the defense was that Flannery was biased, prejudiced, and motivated to lie by his desire to improve his conditions of incarceration and expedite his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">1. <em>Access to treatment records. </em>The defendant sought access to all of Flannery\u2019s Bridgewater \u201ctreatment\u201d records. Flannery\u2019s records consisted of two binders, one containing administrative records, the other psychological treatment records. In support of his discovery motion, defense counsel alleged that Flannery was \u201cin all probability\u201d a pathological liar. He requested that a defense expert be permitted to review Flannery\u2019s psychiatric files in order to obtain expert opinion testimony \u201con Flannery\u2019s veracity based upon his Bridgewater records.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the records would \u201cprovide a background and foundation\u201d for the expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The Commonwealth contends that the issue of Flannery\u2019s credibility was not a proper subject of expert testimony. Because expert testimony on Flannery\u2019s \u201ccapacity to tell the truth\u201d would have been inadmissible, the Commonwealth ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>gues that the judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s request for the records. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It is well settled that an expert may not offer an opinion on a witness\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987). See also <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 364 (6th ed. 1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue of credibility of a witness includes both the individual\u2019s ability and willingness to tell the truth. <em>Ianello, supra </em>at 202, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Widrick, </em>392 Mass. 884, 888 (1984). Expert testimony, offered by the defendant, on Flannery\u2019s veracity would have been inadmissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504 (1991). Thus, it was not an appropriate basis for discovery of the witness\u2019s treatment records. There was no error in denying the defendant access to the records on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Defense counsel also requested access to Flannery\u2019s records in order to inspect them for exculpatory evidence consisting of rewards, inducements, or promises made to Flannery in exchange for his testimony. Defense counsel submitted an affidavit which stated that after testifying at Reed\u2019s first trial, Flannery was permitted to participate in a community access program, which allowed him to leave the Bridgewater facility in order to work in the community. Defense counsel asserted, \u201c[i]t is obvious that Flannery is being rewarded for his testimony in the Reed case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Defense counsel submitted an affidavit stating his grounds for believing the records contained evidence of promises, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ducements, or rewards. In particular, defense counsel pointed to Flannery\u2019s ability to leave the Bridgewater facility, unsupervised, daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and the improvement in his living conditions after testifying at Reed\u2019s first trial. The Commonwealth repeatedly denied that it had made any promises or rewards to Flannery.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Based on the defendant\u2019s assertions, a judge of the Superior Court determined that in camera review of the records was justified. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 58 (1987). After reviewing the records, the judge found them to be \u201cdevoid of any such indication . . . [of] favored treatment or consideration.\u201d Having ascertained that the records did not contain relevant material on promises, inducements, or rewards, the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s request for access to privileged communications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993) <em>(Stockhammer </em>and <em>Bishop </em>were decided after defendant\u2019s trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Defense counsel was able to conduct a thorough cross-examination of Flannery. Defense counsel impeached Flannery\u2019s credibility with his prior criminal convictions. Defense counsel also impeached Flannery with a written document listing the \u201cguarantees\u201d Flannery sought from Bridgewater officials in exchange for further testimony and cooperation. Defense counsel showed the jury photographs of Flannery\u2019s improved living quarters, which he referred to as the \u201ccottage.\u201d Defense counsel brought out that Flannery was not happy with his parole date of August 15, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In addition, the jury was made fully aware of Flannery\u2019s freedom to leave the Bridgewater facility in his own automobile due to his participation in the community access program. Flannery told the jury that he came to court unes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>carted in his own car, and that he was paid a witness fee each day. Flannery admitted that he decided to testify in part so that he \u201cwould be seen in a good light\u201d by the parole board. Similarly, defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury focused on Flannery\u2019s motivation to lie and his desire for personal rewards. The thorough and vigorous cross-examination and defense counsel\u2019s argument brought the issue of Flannery\u2019s credibility to the jury\u2019s attention with force and clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Last, we note that the Commonwealth had an ongoing duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defendant. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963). The Commonwealth has consistently denied that any promises, inducements, or rewards were made to Flannery in exchange for his testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s in camera review of the records confirmed that no promises, inducements, or rewards were made to Flannery. There was no error in denying defense counsel access to the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">2. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, 33E, we also review the denial of defense counsel\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress. Defense counsel moved to suppress all statements made by the defendant to police officers when he was arrested in Cary, North Carolina. The defendant argued that his arrest in North Carolina for a probation violation was a pretext, and that he was never given his Miranda warnings with respect to the charge of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">After an evidentiary hearing, a judge in the Superior Court found that the arrest was not a pretext. He found no evidence of trickery or deceit on the part of the police. The defendant knew the police wanted to question him in relation to the Middleborough murder. The judge found that the police twice warned the defendant pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The defendant signed two writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ten waiver forms. After examining the totality of the circumstances, the judge concluded the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Medeiros, 395 Mass. 336, 345 (1985). There was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We have examined the whole record to determine whether justice requires that a new trial be ordered or a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt be entered. We conclude that such relief is not required or appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The defendant states that as the issue. In his brief, he also invokes the due process clause of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights as a basis for his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The judge did not make explicit findings with respect to the privileged status of the documents. We assume, for purposes of discussion, that the records are privileged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Other courts also follow this long-standing rule. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Azure, </em>801 F.2d 336, 340-341 (8th Cir. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>151 Ariz. 378, 382-383 (1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Visgar, </em>120 Ill. App. 3d 584, 593 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>506 A.2d 1143, 1148 (Me. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Saldana, </em>324 N.W.2d 227, 231-232 (Minn. 1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Souvenir, </em>83 Misc.2d 1038 (N.Y. 1975); <em>Gale </em>v. <em>State, </em>792 P.2d 570, 576 (Wyo. 1990). See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Beckley, </em>434 Mich. 691, 728 (1990), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, supra </em>at 385 (\u201cPsychologists and psychiatrists are not, and do not claim to be, experts at discerning truth. Psychiatrists are trained to accept facts provided .by their patients, not to act as judges of patients\u2019 credibility\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AVR\">The records were not submitted with the briefs as a part of the record appendix or as an exhibit. We requested that the records be submitted to us. We have reviewed the records. We agree with the trial judge that the records contained no evidence of promises, inducements, or rewards made by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The parties assumed, for the purposes of argument, that the Department of Mental Health had the authority to grant rewards to Flannery in exchange for his cooperation with the Commonwealth. In those circumstances, <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963), would require the prosecution to turn over any exculpatory material in the records.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
