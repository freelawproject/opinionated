Sena and Catherine Rude-Sena, appeal from the entry of summary judgments in favor of the defendants, the Commonwealth, town of Carver, James Henderson, and Lawrence Cabeceiras. We transferred this case to this court on our own motion. The uncontroverted facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">This case arises out of the arrest, prosecution, and acquittal of the plaintiffs on charges of receiving stolen property. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>September, 1981, the plaintiffs purchased a nickel-plated Colt .45 caliber revolver at the Brimfield Flea Market for $1,400. On the walnut grips of the gun were engraved the initials, \u201cW.E.,\u201d and on the backstrap was engraved \u201cWyatt Earp 1879.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiffs spent almost two years and over $10,000 researching the gun\u2019s history and authenticating it as a gun actually owned by Wyatt Earp.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In July, 1983, the plaintiffs consigned the revolver to a Beverly Hills, California, establishment which advertised it for sale at $350,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">During their research of the gun\u2019s history, the plaintiffs realized that it possibly had been owned by F. Nelson Blount, the deceased owner of Edaville Railroad (Edaville) and a collector of guns. The plaintiffs communicated with Frederick Richardson, the executor of Blount\u2019s estate, who advised them that their gun appeared to be one that was stolen from Edaville in 1968. Richardson subsequently wrote to the plaintiffs, advising them that he was \u201cvery sure\u201d that theirs was the gun stolen from Edaville.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In January, 1984, after an article written about the plaintiffs and their acquisition was published in a national magazine, George Bartholomew, owner of the Bartholomew Enterprises, Inc., which acquired Edaville in 1970, telephoned the defendant town\u2019s police department. Bartholomew thought that the plaintiffs\u2019 gun was in fact the one stolen from Edaville in 1968. The police checked their records of the Edaville burglary, but they had no list of what had been stolen. Edaville then supplied them with a list of what had been taken in the 1968 burglary. The list indicated that the following had been stolen: \u201c.45 Colt Birdshead Grip - 7!/2 [inches] (1879) Wyatt Earp\u2019s name engraved on stock.\u201d A birdshead grip is significantly different from the \u201cstandard\u201d grip of the plaintiffs\u2019 pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>John Bryden, a long-time employee of Edaville, communicated with the plaintiffs, inquiring about their revolver. Bryden did not disclose, to them that he was an employee of Edaville. The plaintiffs sent him a detailed photograph of their gun. On the basis of this photograph, Bryden concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 gun was the same gun that had been on display at Edaville prior to the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">After a lapse of time, Bartholomew complained to one of the town\u2019s selectmen about how little he thought the police had been doing to investigate the case. Thereafter, Thomas Orr, chief of police met with the plaintiffs. After the meeting, he concluded that there was some disparity between the plaintiffs\u2019 gun and the description of the gun that was stolen. The investigation continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The defendants James Henderson, a Carver police officer, and Lawrence Cabeceiras, a State trooper, were assigned to investigate the case further. Henderson and Cabeceiras eventually came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 revolver was the same gun stolen from Edaville, and they sought warrants for the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest. A clerk-magistrate issued the requested warrants. The State police arrested Sena on May 10, 1985, for receiving stolen property. He was confined for approximately twenty-four hours before being released on posting of bail. Rude-Sena thereafter surrendered on May 13. She was confined for a short period before being released on her own recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Prior to the criminal trial, the plaintiffs moved to dismiss the criminal complaints for lack of probable cause for their arrest. Briefs were submitted by the plaintiffs and the Commonwealth. On April.1, 1985, the motion was denied. Trial began on January 27, 1987, on which day the trial judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a required finding of not guilty. The plaintiffs were found not guilty on September 15, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The plaintiffs commenced this action in the Superior Court on January 28, 1988. The complaint included claims for negligence under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2 (1992 ed.), violations of the plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988) and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H and 11I (1992 ed.), abuse of process, mali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>clous prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">After some discovery, the Commonwealth and Cabeceiras moved for summary judgment on April 17, 1990. A Superior Court judge granted their motion. On the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the judge revoked his prior ruling and ordered a motion hearing. On August 27, 1990, the judge reinstated his original ruling, again granting summary judgment in favor of the Commonwealth and Cabeceiras.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">On October 15, 1990, the town and Henderson moved for summary judgment. On December 18, 1990, another Superior Court judge granted the motion, adopting the memorandum which had been issued for the motion of the Commonwealth and Cabeceiras. Final judgment was entered on July 22, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The plaintiffs argue error in granting the town and the Commonwealth summary judgment on their claims for negligence under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. As to Henderson and Cabeceiras, the plaintiffs assert error in allowing summary judgment for their claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H and 11I, and their common law claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">We examine the issues. We are mindful of our obligation to consider the record in a light favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>405 Mass. 168, 173 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">1. <em>G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11. In </em>their complaint, the plaintiffs asserted claims against the town and the Commonwealth under G. L. c. 258, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, for negligence in their criminal investigation and in pursuing warrants for the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest. The motion judge granted summary judgment on these claims, ruling that the conduct of the defendants\u2019 employees falls within the discretionary acts exception to the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act provided in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (b). The plaintiffs argue error, and assert that the conduct of the police officers in investigating the criminal matter and in pursuing arrest warrants was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ministerial, and therefore actionable. We agree with the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"ARq\">Section 2 of G. L. c. 258 provides in part: \u201cPublic employers shall be liable for injury . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any public employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d Exempted from liability, however, are claims \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a public employer or public employee, acting within the scope of his office or employment, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>We must determine whether the acts of the police officers were \u201cdiscretionary functions\u201d as to \u00a7 10 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We have long recognized that c. 258 tracks the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) et seq. (1988) (Federal Act). See <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co. </em>v. Lowell, 412 Mass. 139, 142-143 (1992); <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 408, 414 (1987). Thus, in interpreting c. 258, we have found Federal court decisipns construing provisions of the Federal Act helpful. See <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co., supra </em>at 142-143. In particular, Federal case law concerning the Federal Act\u2019s discretionary functions exception has been a source of general guidance in our examination of \u00a7 10 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Most recently, in <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 141, we adopted a two-prong inquiry utilized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Berkovitz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988), for determining whether certain conduct falls within the discretionary functions exception. \u201cThe first step ... is to determine whether the governmental actor had any discretion at all as to what course of conduct to fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>low. . . . The second and far more difficult step is to determine whether the discretion that the actor had is that kind of discretion for which \u00a7 10 (b) provides immunity from liability.\u201d <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co., supra. </em>In expanding on the second step, we stated, \u201cDiscretionary actions and decisions that warrant immunity must be based on considerations of public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">As to the first step of our inquiry, it is obvious in the present case that the government actors \u2014 Henderson on behalf of the town and Cabeceiras on behalf of the Commonwealth \u2014 had discretion as to what course of conduct to follow. As law enforcement officers, they had to make numerous choices regarding their course of investigation of the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct, and regarding whether and when to seek warrants for the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest. Thus, they constantly had to rely on their own judgment, based on their experience and their' knowledge of the law, to determine what evidence to seek, how to gather that evidence, and whether and when to apply for warrants for arrest. There obviously is no objective scale with which a law enforcement officer can weigh the evidence he accumulates in any particular case to determine whether and when that evidence would support a finding of probable cause. The law, of course, often defines the outer bounds of this determination. Beyond that, however, the officers\u2019 decisions constitute quintessential discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The second prong of our inquiry requires that we determine whether the officers\u2019 discretion in question \u201cis that kind of discretion for which \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>provides immunity.\u201d <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co., supra </em>at 141. We conclude that it is. The decisions of law enforcement officers regarding whether, when, how, and whom to investigate, and whether and when to seek warrants for arrest are based on considerations of, and necessarily affect, public policy. So long as they are within the bounds of the law, and therefore within the officers\u2019 discretion, they are public policy decisions. Cf. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 753 (1984) (\u201cNo reasonable basis exists for arguing that a police officer is making a policy or planning judgment in deciding whether to remove from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>roadways a driver who he knows is intoxicated. Rather, the policy and planning decision to remove such drivers has already been made by the Legislature\u201d). Thus, we hold that the conduct of law enforcement officials in investigating potentially criminal conduct and in seeking warrants for the arrest of those whom they investigate, are discretionary functions and therefore fall within the exception in \u00a7 10 <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Our decision is consistent with Federal cases on this issue. Federal courts generally have held that decisions regarding whether, when, how, and whom to investigate or to prosecute are discretionary and fall within the discretionary functions exception. See <em>K.W. Thompson Tool Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>836 F.2d 721, 729 (1st Cir. 1988) (decision to prosecute plaintiff corporation criminally was a decision \u201cconcerning when, whether and whom to prosecute [which has] traditionally been considered discretionary and [has] been held to fall within the discretionary function exception of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680[a]\u201d); <em>Pooler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>787 F.2d 868, 871 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 849 (1986) (police officer\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>vestigation and his subsequent decision to file criminal complaints and to apply for arrest warrants, where the charges against the plaintiffs were ultimately dropped, were discretionary acts and therefore not actionable under Federal Act)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; <em>Gray </em>v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 514-516 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1100 (1984) (decision of the United States Attorney General to prosecute plaintiff, and the alleged improper investigatory conduct, as \u201cinextricably tied\u201d to the decision to prosecute, are discretionary with respect to Federal Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Additional factors which we provided in <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 219 (1977), further support our conclusion. First, the imposition of tort liability in the present circumstances could \u201cjeopardize the quality and efficiency of the governmental process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Tort liability for negligent conduct would likely cause more restrictive investigatory practices, thereby burdening enforcement of the laws. Second, close judicial scrutiny of investigatory practices could \u201c[usurp] the power and responsibility of the legislative or executive branches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Continuing judicial criticism of investigatory practices not otherwise unlawful, and therefore within the discretion of law enforcement officials, would impinge on the long-standing domain of the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The injury suffered by the plaintiffs \u2014 embarrassment, inconvenience, and pecuniary expense \u2014 while not insubstantial, cannot be wholly unexpected in our unavoidably imperfect system of law enforcement. Unfortunately, to maintain the effective enforcement of our laws, the citizens of this Commonwealth must sustain the risk of being wrongly accused, since in many cases, the propriety of a prosecution ultimately can be determined only by a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Here, the plaintiffs were found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">There was no error in the motion judge\u2019s determination that the conduct of Henderson and Cabeceiras falls within the discretionary functions exception of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">2. <em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. </em>The plaintiffs asserted claims against the individual defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of their rights protected by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The motion judge granted summary judgment on these claims in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appeal from the judge\u2019s determinations made with respect to the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">a. <em>The Fourth Amendment. </em>In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the warrants issued for their arrest were not supported by probable cause. The judge, in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, ruled that, because the issue of the existence of probable cause was raised in the criminal proceeding and was considered and determined by the judge in favor of the Commonwealth, the plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue in the civil action. The plaintiffs argue error in the judge\u2019s ruling. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">To start, we recognize that arrests made absent probable cause may warrant relief under \u00a7 1983. See <em>Wagenmann </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>829 F.2d 196, 205-206 (1st Cir. 1987). We also acknowledge that the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is not generally barred from application in \u00a7 1983 actions. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 103-105 (1980). Thus, we must determine whether application of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>doctrine in the circumstances of the present case is otherwise appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues determined in prior actions between the parties or those in privity with the parties. See <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Norrington, </em>395 Mass. 751, 753 (1985). Issues precluded under this doctrine must have been actually litigated in the first action, <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Niziolek, 395 </em>Mass. 737, 742 (1985), and determined by a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scala, </em>380 Mass. 500, 506 (1980); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). We have implied that for a decision to be final it must have been subject to appeal or actually reviewed on appeal. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., supra </em>at 745 (\u201cWe see no unfairness in authorizing the offensive use of collateral estoppel in cases like this one .... [The defendant] had every incentive to defend the prosecution vigorously . . . and to take an appeal, which he did\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scala, supra </em>at 506 (\u201cthe prerequisite of an appeal as of right is not satisfied here\u201d). We now state conclusively that for collateral estoppel to preclude litigation of an issue, there must have been available some avenue for review of the prior ruling on the-issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In the present case, there was no avenue for review of the criminal court ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause. The denial of their motion to dismiss was not subject to interlocutory appeal, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E (1992 ed.), and because the trial concluded with the plaintiffs\u2019 acquittal, there was no other means available to review the ruling for error. Thus, the issue of the existence of proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ble cause to support the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest is not precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from being litigated in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We must therefore reverse the allowance of summary judgment as to that portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim concerning the Fourth Amendment, and remand this case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">b. <em>The Fifth Amendment. </em>The plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants, at one point during their investigation, visited the plaintiffs at their home and requested to examine their revolver. Although the plaintiffs openly admitted ownership and possession of their gun and were willing to discuss the gun, they refused to produce it at that time. The plaintiffs now assert that these defendants\u2019 subsequent pursuit of warrants for their arrest was intended as punishment for their refusal to produce the gun, and is conduct violative of \u00a7 1983. The motion judge, in granting summary judgment on this claim, noted that the facts alleged cannot support a claim under \u00a7 1983. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Courts have held that \u00a7 1983 may provide relief where an individual is punished for assertion of a constitutional right. See <em>Hardwick </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>289 F.2d 529 (7th Cir. 1961) (defendant police officers beat plaintiff for refusing to incriminate himself by taking breath test). Here, the plaintiffs were not punished; the defendants merely continued their investigation and applied for warrants for the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest. The plaintiffs have referred to no authority to support their contention that such conduct is actionable with respect to \u00a7 1983. The judge\u2019s ruling stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">3. <em>G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I. </em>The plaintiffs asserted claims against Henderson and Cabeceiras under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I, the Massachusetts civil rights statute. The Superior Court judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on these claims, ruling that the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>alleged conduct is not actionable under \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I. We agree that summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Sections 11H and 11I provide a cause of action for individuals whose rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States or the Commonwealth have been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, by threats, intimidation, or coercion. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 11I was intended to provide a remedy coextensive with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 822-823 (1985). The State statute, however, unlike its Federal counterpart, does not require State action. Further, whereas \u00a7 1983 provides relief for direct violations of one\u2019s rights, relief under \u00a7 11I is available only where one\u2019s rights are interfered with or attempted to be interfered with by threats, intimidation, or coercion. We now examine the defendants\u2019 alleged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The plaintiffs again allege that, during the criminal investigation, the defendant officers interviewed them at their home. At the time, the officers had neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant. During the meeting, the officers \u201cdemanded\u201d that the plaintiffs produce their gun for inspection. The plaintiffs refused, but tried to arrange for a future meeting at which they would produce the gun for observation and where they would be accompanied by counsel. In response, the officers announced that the meeting was over, and alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>edly stated that the next time the plaintiffs saw them, they would \u201chave warrants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The officers\u2019 statement that they would have warrants the next time the plaintiffs saw them could be considered a threat. See <em>Willitts </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 202, 210 n.10 (1991).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, at most, what implicitly is threatened is the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest through lawful means. Generally, by itself, a threat to use lawful means to reach an intended result is not actionable under \u00a7 11I. See <em>Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. 771, 782 (1987). We therefore conclude on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the officers\u2019 alleged conduct is not actionable under \u00a7 11I.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the allowance of summary judgment as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">4. <em>Intentional infliction of emotional distress. </em>The plaintiffs argue error in the trial judge\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of Henderson and Cabeceiras on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2019 conduct, in obtaining arrest warrants and in subsequently arresting the plaintiffs, was extreme and outrageous conduct which was intended to, and did, result in severe emotional distress to the plaintiffs. The trial judge, in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, ruled that the alleged conduct was, as a matter of law, not extreme and outrageous. We examine this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">To sustain a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant intended to cause, or should have known that his conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>would cause, emotional distress; (2) that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the plaintiffs distress; and (4) that the plaintiff suffered severe distress. <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144-145 (1976), and cases cited. To be considered extreme and outrageous, the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \u201cbeyond all bounds of decency and . . . utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 comment d (1965). Liability cannot be founded upon mere insults, threats, or annoyances. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. 82, 99 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The conduct of which the plaintiffs complain as a matter of law cannot be deemed extreme and outrageous. Neither applying for an arrest warrant, nor making an arrest pursuant to an issued warrant can be considered \u201cutterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Agis, supra </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">5. <em>Loss of consortium. </em>The plaintiffs also asserted claims against Henderson and Cabeceiras for loss of consortium. Summary judgment for these claims was allowed in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs again argue error. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">As a general rule, a claim for loss of consortium requires proof of a tortious act that caused the claimant\u2019s spouse personal injury. See <em>Agis, supra </em>at 146-147; <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 161-168 (1973); <em>Mouradian </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 543-544 (1987). See also W. P. Prosser &amp; R. E. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 125, at 931-934 (5th ed. 1984). Although we have determined that a claim for loss of consortium is independent of the spouse\u2019s cause of action, see, e.g., <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 607-608 (1981), we have not repudiated the implicit prerequisite that the injured spouse have a viable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">As discussed above, in the present case, neither plaintiff has a viable claim for personal injury. As to the claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \u201c[t]he spouse of an alleged federal civil rights victim is not permitted an ancillary cause of action for loss of consortium.\u201d <em>Tauriac </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>716 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>672, 673 (D. Mass. 1989), and cases cited. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for loss of consortium fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the Superior Court judge erred in allowing summary judgment in favor of Henderson and Cabeceiras as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for infringement of their Fourth Amendment rights. There is no error as to the claims under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11; G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I; and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as to the Fifth Amendment; and the plaintiffs\u2019 common law claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium. We remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">According to folklore, Wyatt Earp, his brothers, Morgan and Virgil, and \u201cDoc\u201d Holliday sent Ike Clanton and his gang to their graves during a shoot-out at the Q.K.

Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (a) excludes from liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act the following: \u201cAny claim . . . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We recognize, of course, that certain aspects of the investigatory process may not be characterized as discretionary for purposes of the discretionary functions exception. For example, where the conduct of a defendant police officer in investigating a crime or in seeking a warrant violates officially established departmental procedures, that conduct likely would not be protected. Indeed, as to the first prong of our inquiry, such conduct likely is outside of the officer\u2019s discretion; as to the second prong, such conduct likely would not constitute a public policy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We also recognize that an officer who carelessly or recklessly misstates or fails to disclose relevant information he has to a magistrate evaluating a warrant application, and thereby \u201csubvert [s] the integrity of [the warrant process] by \u2018selling\u2019 [the magistrate] \u2018shoddy merchandise\u2019 without appropriate disclaimers,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 854 (1984), would likely not be engaged in a discretionary activity for purposes of the discretionary functions exception. We need not decide that issue, however, because the pleadings do not fairly raise it. The plaintiffs\u2019 c. 258 claim focuses specifically on the officers\u2019 alleged negligence in conducting their investigation, alleged negligence in assessing probable cause against the plaintiffs before seeking complaints against them, and alleged negligence in assessing the likelihood that the plaintiffs would appear for arraignment and trial. The pleadings cannot fairly be read as raising the issue of negligence in the officers\u2019 actual communication of information to the magistrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The factual background of <em>Pooler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>787 F.2d 868 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 849 (1986), is analogous to that of the present case. The plaintiffs in <em>Pooler </em>were investigated, arrested, and prosecuted for narcotics sales at a Veterans\u2019 Administration (VA) Hospital, and the charges against them were ultimately dropped. <em>Id. </em>at 869. In their complaints, the plaintiffs alleged, first, that the VA police officer\u2019s investigation was deficient, in that the officer unreasonably relied on an informant and failed to corroborate the informant\u2019s information, and second, that in pursuing criminal charges against the plaintiffs, the defendant failed to disclose deficiencies in his investigation. <em>Id. </em>In holding that the officer\u2019s conduct was protected by the discretionary functions exception, the court declared, \u201c[W]hen the sole complaint is addressed, as here, to the quality of the investigation as judged by its outcome, the discretionary function [exception] should, and we hold, does apply. Congress did not intend to provide for judicial review of the quality of investigative efforts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871.
