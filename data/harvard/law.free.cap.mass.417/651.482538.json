A judge of the Superior Court, who had before him a statement of agreed facts and exhibits and cross motions for summary judgment, decided that the limiting clauses in the two insurance policies were mutually repugnant, and, as a result, USF&amp;G and Hanover were required to prorate the damages. We conclude that USF&amp;G is responsible for the entire loss. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and direct the entry of a new judgment declaring that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The record discloses the following. On October 5, 1988, Brian D. Mulvagh decided to test drive a motor vehicle owned by Springfield Auto Sales-East, Inc. While Mulvagh was driving in Chicopee, he lost control of the vehicle and struck a telephone pole. A passenger in the vehicle was seriously injured. Mulvagh\u2019s liability for the accident was \u201creasonably clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Springfield Auto Sales-East, Inc., had a so-called \u201cgarage policy\u201d with Hanover. The maximum amount of optional bodily injury coverage available- under the policy was $100,000. In its policy, Hanover imposed limitations on Coverage B (optional bodily injury), \u201cin consideration of [a] reduced rate of premium.\u201d Under its \u201cLimited Customer Coverage,\u201d Hanover agreed to provide coverage only if \u201cno other valid and collectible automobile liability insurance, either primary or excess, with limits of liability at least equal to . . . the limits required by the Massachusetts Compulsory Automobile Liability Security Act ... is available.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Mulvagh was married to, and lived in the same household as, Louise E. Mulvagh. She owned a 1987 Buick Century automobile which was insured by USF&amp;G under a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy. The parties have stipulated that Mulvagh was an insured under this policy. Part 5 (the provision for optional bodily injuries to others, which also provided a maximum of $100,000 in coverage) of Mrs. Mulvagh\u2019s USF&amp;G policy provided, \u201c[i]f someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own af the time of the accident, the owner\u2019s auto insurance must pay its limits before we pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Mulvagh\u2019s passenger gave a notice of claim to both USF&amp;G and Hanover. The \u201cfull and fair compromised value\u201d of the claim was $100,000. Hanover concluded that \u201cother insurance\u201d was available under the USF&amp;G policy to cover Mulvagh\u2019s liability. Based on its limiting clause, Hanover refused to pay. For its part, USF&amp;G concluded that Hanover was responsible for covering Mulvagh\u2019s liability. After reserving its rights against Hanover, however, USF&amp;G paid the passenger its policy limits of $100,000. In return the passenger released all claims against both the Mulvaghs and USF&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">USF&amp;G then commenced an action in the Superior Court against Hanover on multiple theories requesting an order that Hanover pay all, or at least one-half of, the $100,000. USF&amp;G and Hanover filed a statement of agreed facts and exhibits, together with cross motions for summary judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (a) and (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), which led to the decision and judgment now before us finding each insurer liable for $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492 (1988), we discussed three types of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, pro rata, escape and excess,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the methods employed by courts to resolve conflicts between them. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>noted in the <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>decision that, in an. effort to resolve such conflicts in the context of automobile insurance, \u201c \u2018the majority of courts have embraced a humanistic rule of construction \u2014 insurance clauses that conflict are to be reconciled and interpreted upon the determination of the sense and meaning of the terms the parties used.\u2019 . . . This approach generally has resulted in giving excess clauses preference to escape and pro rata clauses and declaring mutual repugnancy where either excess or escape clauses appear in both policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, quoting Kurtock, Overlapping Liability Coverage \u2014 The \u201cOther Insurance\u201d Provision, 25 Fed\u2019n Ins. Couns. Q. 45, 46-47 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>decision further noted that, when mutual repugnancy occurs, each insurer should be \u201crequired to contribute to .the loss, for to give effect to both clauses would result in no coverage for the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496 n.4 (a finding that the insured has no coverage could leave the injured person without a recovery, a result which would contravene public policy where insurance exists). We concluded in the <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>decision (which involved a conflict between two excess clauses) that repugnancy existed, and that the insurers had to contribute equally to the loss. <em>Id. </em>at 499. Finally, we emphasized in the <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>decision that, in resolving conflicting \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, we have acted consistently with the modern trend discussed above, <em>id. </em>at 496, and tried to apply an \u201canalytical approach of giving effect to the policy language\u201d in the antagonistic insurance contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 497, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The dispute in this case does not involve two excess clauses or an excess clause and a so-called \u201cbasic\u201d escape clause, namely one that provides an insurer is not liable if other coverage is available. This dispute concerns a conflict between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the excess clause in the USF&amp;G policy and the so-called \u201csuper-escape\u201d clause in the Hanover policy which denies coverage when other valid and collectible insurance, <em>either primary or excess, </em>is available. See 8A J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4906, at 349-350 (rev. ed. 1981) (defining super-escape clauses).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">When conflict occurs between a super-escape clause and an excess clause, courts are divided on how the conflict should be resolved. Some courts give effect to the specific language of a super-escape clause over that of an excess clause. See, e.g., <em>Royal Globe Ins. Cos. </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co., </em>560 S.W.2d 22 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977); <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Globe Indem. Co., </em>415 S.W.2d 581 (Ky. Ct. App. 1967); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Western Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., 477 </em>S.W.2d 421, 425-427 (Mo. 1972); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 269 </em>N.C. 341 (1967). Other jurisdictions, however, have decided that the policy with the super-escape clause is primary. See, e.g., <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>575 F.2d 1070 (3d Cir. 1978) (applying Pennsylvania law); <em>Protective Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>361 So. 2d 1058 (Ala. 1978); <em>Automobile Underwriters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Casualty Co., </em>49 Ill. 2d 108 (1971). Still other courts have found the clauses to be mutually repugnant and have decided that damages should be shared proportionately. See, e.g., <em>Dette </em>v. <em>Covington Motors, Inc., </em>486 So. 2d 805 (La. Ct. App. 1986); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>610 A.2d 127 (R.I. 1992); <em>Hardware Dealers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exch., 444 </em>S.W.2d 583 (Tex. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">As has been discussed, we follow the majority approach which seeks, whenever possible, to reconcile conflicting policy clauses based on the sense and meaning of the terms in an effort to effectuate the language of the insuring agreements. <em>Mission Ins. Co., supra </em>at 495-496. As has also been discussed, this approach generally results in giving excess clauses preference to escape clauses, <em>id. </em>at 496, at least where the escape clause is of the basic type. See 16 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 62:77 (rev. 2d ed. 1983); Note, Resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>tian of Conflicting \u201cOther Insurance\u201d Clauses, 46 Ind. L.J. 270, 278 (1970-1971). The rationale behind the preference considers a policy constituting excess insurance as not furnishing \u201cother collectible [or available] insurance\u201d as far as the basic escape clause is concerned. <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>54 N.C. App. 551, 555 (1981), citing 16 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 62:76 (2d ed. 1966). A super-escape clause, however, specifying that even other insurance that labels itself \u201cexcess\u201d will be primary, reverses that result, rendering the excess policy as one providing primary coverage. See Note, Resolution of Conflicting \u201cOther Insurance\u201d Clauses, <em>supra </em>at 279-280. 8A J.A. Appleman, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4910, at 470-473, and cases cited; 16 G. Couch, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 62:76, and cases cited. This outcome is based on examination of the contract language. \u201c[W]hen the escape clause expressly provides \u2018that the insurance does not apply to any loss covered by other specified types of insurance, including the excess insurance type, it has been held that the insurer whose policy so provides is absolved from liability.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., supra, </em>quoting 16 G. Couch, Insurance, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 62:75. We conclude, after applying these principles to the conflicting clauses in this case, that the explicit and comprehensive language of the Hanover super-escape clause brings into effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the excess coverage provided by USF&amp;G, making the latter solely responsible for the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we have considered and rejected the arguments made by USF&amp;G seeking to have its excess clause preferred or, at the minimum, declared to be a clause which creates a mutual repugnancy. We comment on those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">(a) USF&amp;G refers to the fact that, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 2B and 113A (1992 ed.), its policy language has been provided by the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) to be used as a \u201cstandard policy.\u201d The Hanover policy is not such a policy. It is therefore suggested that any ambiguity in the clauses should not be held against USF&amp;G, because its policy was \u201cdrafted\u201d by the commissioner, but should be held against Hanover because its policy essentially is its own product. USF&amp;G goes on to suggest an interpretation of the Hanover clause which would, in effect, make it ambiguous and reduce it to a basic escape clause. Putting aside discussion of whether the required standard of the USF&amp;G policy can be said to have been forced on USF&amp;G, see the discussion by Justice Kaplan in <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Koch, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 387-388 (1988), the particular coverages at issue are \u201coptional provisions whose content is not prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. More directly, we do not see any ambiguity in the Hanover clause, and we discern that, if the full scope of USF&amp;G\u2019s arguments is accepted, virtually no effect would be given to the words \u201ceither primary or excess\u201d in the Hanover clause. We consider the result suggested by USF&amp;G at odds with the <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>decision which calls for conflicting clauses to be reconciled, whenever possible, and their language given effect. <em>Mission Ins. Co., supra </em>at 495-496.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">(b) USF&amp;G points to the requirement in the Hanover clause that other insurance be \u201ccollectible\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d as defeating the intent of the Hanover super-escape clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>With or without the phrase \u201ceither primary or excess,\u201d USF&amp;G says, its,coverage is not \u201cavailable\u201d because, being excess, it \u201cis not triggered until all other primary coverage is exhausted.\u201d This argument is circular because it presupposes that Mulvagh is an insured under the Hanover policy, the exact point in issue. The argument, however, appears to go further, on the assumption by USF&amp;G that the terms \u201ccollectible\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d are interchangeable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that both mean that the policy referred to (the USF&amp;G policy) must be \u201cprimary\u201d by its own definition for the super-escape clause to be effective. To be \u201cavailable\u201d and, therefore, primary, it would have to be shown that the USF&amp;G policy had become primary because the owner of the automobile, Springfield Auto-Sales, Inc., either had no insurance at all, or a policy with limits insufficient to cover the passenger\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">This argument also is not persuasive. Our task is to determine what coverage Mulvagh had.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mulvagh had express coverage under the USF&amp;G policy (as a household member of his wife, the named insured in the USF&amp;G policy), even though that policy sought to look to another insurer to pay on any loss first. An insured remains an insured as long as the policy is in effect. This is not entirely the case with automobile liability insurance subject to a super-escape clause. Such a policy unambiguously provides that one may be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>insured in some circumstances, but not in others. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Burgin, </em>752 F. Supp. 877, 886 (W.D. Ark. 1990) (applying Arkansas law). The <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>decision, <em>id. </em>at 498, directs us to determine the relationship between insurer and insured as the first step in analyzing these conflicts. Mulvagh\u2019s relationship with USF&amp;G as its insured, and his relationship with Hanover as a possible insured, are fundamentally different.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Hanover\u2019s named insured was a company which could be expected, at any given time, to be handling and dealing with vehicles that might occasionally be driven by customers. Hanover could reasonably anticipate that these customers would have their own liability insurance. The garage owner and the insurer, therefore, would be justified in expecting coverage through other automobile liability insurance. In view of the standard form of the Massachusetts operator\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy, the garage owner and insurer could anticipate that coverage for liability arising out of someone driving a nonowned vehicle might declare itself \u201cexcess.\u201d In the face of these facts, they also could reasonably enter a contract for insurance coverage for customers, in the relatively restricted circumstances of what happened here, a test drive, only in the unexpected event that the customer had no insurance, either primary or excess. The express terms of the Hanover policy, therefore, effectuate the intent of limiting the coverage provided to customers based on the realities of a garage operation. In this case, Mulvagh had no insurance under the Hanover policy, and it is proper under the USF&amp;G policy to invoke coverage for the loss he caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">(c) No legislative purpose is subverted by preferring the Hanover super-escape clause since coverage is afforded under some policy in an amount at least equal (in fact, well beyond) to what is required by the motor vehicle financial responsibility law. The purpose of the law \u2014 the protection of the traveling public and victims of motor vehicle accidents \u2014 is not compromised or affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Legislature has not manifested any intent to provide \u201ctwo tiers of coverage\u201d for optional bodily injury. The appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>cable statute, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C (1992 ed.), requires insurers to offer optional bodily injury coverage in specified minimum amounts, but is silent as to an insurer\u2019s limiting or conditioning such coverage on the existence of other insurance. Further, neither the Legislature nor the commissioner has expressed a position on conflicting \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in the context of automobile insurance. See <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., supra </em>at 495. It cannot be argued convincingly that a clause in a garage policy like Hanover\u2019s violates public policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to enter declaring and adjudging that USF&amp;G is responsible for the $100,000 in damages in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In October, 1988, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, required limits of $10,000/$20,000 for bodily injury coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\u201cPro rata clauses provide that, if other insurance is available to the insured, the policy containing the pro rata clause will contribute to the loss in the proportion that its policy limit bears to the total limit of all available policies. Escape clauses provide that, if there is other insurance available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>to the insured, the policy containing the escape clause will pay no benefits. Excess clauses provide that, if there is other insurance available to the insured, the policy containing the excess clause will pay no benefits until such other insurance is exhausted. See generally 8A J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4906, at 345-350 (rev. ed. 1981).\u201d <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492, 495 n.3 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The court in <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>54 N.C. App. 551, 556 (1981), describes the logic supporting this conclusion in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201c1. Parties may contract as they please, and their contract will be enforced by the court as written;</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\u201c2. Escape clauses and excess insurance clauses are not like provisions that are indistinguishable from each other so as to require the loss to be prorated between the carriers;</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\u201c3. When the parties contract that coverage will be precluded by the existence of other insurance, the existence of a policy with an excess insurance clause is not such an event as will set into motion the exclusionary provision in the first policy;</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">\u201c4. However, when the other insurance escape clause is a super escape clause and expressly provides that coverage is precluded by the existence of excess coverage, the existence of a policy with an excess insurance clause <em>is </em>an event that sets in motion the provisions in the first policy\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The other insurance must also be \u201cvalid\u201d in order for the Hanover clause to be effective. However, \u201cvalidity,\u201d denoting, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>USF&amp;G, proper execution and facial legality, does not appear to be at issue here. USF&amp;G has never claimed that its policy was not valid in the sense described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The better definition of \u201ccollectible\u201d in this context, and the one which would not make the word redundant, may be that the insurer is not insolvent and is capable of paying claims due. See <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>399 Mass. 598, 599-600 n.2 (1987); <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Koch, </em>25 Mass.

Generally, it is noted, such usage is local and for a limited period of time, and is often an accommodation, as where a customer is provided with a \u201cloaner\u201d while his own vehicle is being repaired, (or is permitted to test drive a vehicle) rather than the primary focus of the garage operation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4910, at 458.
