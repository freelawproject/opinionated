L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1992 ed.), Norwood Hospital (hospital) appealed from a decision of the Department of Public Welfare (department) that Mary Addley, an undocumented alien, who was a patient at the hospital until her death, was not eligible for medical assistance. The department determined that, under the Medical Care and Assistance Program, G. L. c. 118E (1992 ed.), Addley was not treated for an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>that term is defined in 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600 (Mar. 1, 1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge affirmed the department\u2019s determination and entered judgment for the department. The hospital appeals. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">1. <em>The facts. </em>Addley, a citizen of Ireland born in 1926, came to the United States in 1987 on a six-month visitor\u2019s visa. After this visa expired in 1988, Addley remained in this country without a valid visa. On or about January 29, 1990, at approximately 10 a.m., Addley appeared at the hospital\u2019s emergency room and said that she had been experiencing difficulty in walking for approximately three months. Hospital personnel noted that Addley\u2019s skin and her eyes were yellow and her abdomen was distended. After conducting several routine tests on Addley, the attending physician admitted her to a semi-private room. After her admission, Addley\u2019s physician noted her diagnosis as follows. \u201cInitial appearance is alcoholic liver disease with cirrhosis, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, possible hepatorenal syndrome.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On February 8, 1990, after consultation with Addley\u2019s son, a physician entered a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order that instructed the hospital staff to refrain from taking life-prolonging measures with respect to Addley. On March 27, 1990, Addley died from hepatic and renal failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>On April 23, 1990, the Norwood office of the department denied the application for medical assistance which the hospital filed on Addley\u2019s behalf shortly before her death on the ground that she was neither a United States citizen nor a lawfully-admitted alien residing in the United States under color of law. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 503.200 (A) (1) and (2) (Mar. 1, 1993). The hospital appealed from this denial to the department\u2019s division of hearings officers pursuant to G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 22 (1992 ed.), and 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 343.100 et seq. (Mar. 1, 1993). The hospital contended that, notwithstanding Addley\u2019s status as an undocumented alien, she was eligible for medical assistance pursuant to 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600, because she was admitted for treatment of an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d The hearing officer determined that Addley\u2019s condition did not satisfy the criteria for an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d under 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600. The hospital appealed from that determination to the Superior Court, contending that the department\u2019s interpretation of what constituted an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d under 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600, was improper. The Superior Court affirmed the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">2. <em>The validity of the department\u2019s determination that the hospital did not treat Addley for an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d as that term is defined in 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600. </em>The department denied the application for medical assistance which the hospital filed on behalf of Addley on the ground that her condition did not constitute an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d as that term is defined in 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which requires the State to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To qualify as an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d under either 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600 or its Federal counterpart, an undocumented alien\u2019s medical condition must be so severe that \u201cthe absence of <em>immediate </em>medical attention could reasonably be expected to <em>result in: </em>i. placing the [alien\u2019s] health in serious jeopardy; ii. serious impairment of bodily functions; or iii. serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The department does not dispute that Addley was seriously ill when she sought and received treatment from the hospital. However, the department contends that the language of 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600 does not permit it to determine that an undocumented alien has an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d based solely on the fact that the undocumented alien is seriously ill or has a serious chronic illness. If it did, the department observes, any undocumented alien with a serious medical condition would be deemed eligible for medical assistance regardless of whether \u201cthe absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>immediate </em>medical attention could reasonably be expected to <em>result in </em>placing the [alien\u2019s] health in serious jeopardy\u201d (emphasis added). The department argues that the language of 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600 does not permit that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The department interprets 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600 as providing that an undocumented alien only will be deemed to have an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d if the absence of <em>immediate </em>medical attention could reasonably be expected to <em>result in </em>placing the alien\u2019s health in serious jeopardy. The department asserts that 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600 requires it to determine that an alien does not possess an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d if the absence of <em>immediate </em>medical attention could not reasonably be expected to <em>result in </em>placing the alien\u2019s health in serious jeopardy because the alien\u2019s bodily functions have already been seriously impaired. Pursuant to its interpretation of 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600, the department concluded that Addley did not possess an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d because her \u201cchronic alcoholism had [so] compromised her liver and . . . central nervous system . . . before she appeared at [the hospital] . . . that the lack of <em>immediate </em>medical attention would not have <em>resulted in </em>more serious jeopardy to her health\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We have said that \u201can agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is entitled to great weight,\u201d <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976), and that it should only be overturned if it is \u201carbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489, 498 (1986). The department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>interpretation of 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. There was no error in the Superior Court\u2019s determination that there was substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s decision that the hospital did not treat Addley for an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Effective November 1, 1993, 106 Code Mass.

The hearing officer\u2019s findings were based largely on the testimony of Dr. Richard Cohen, who, after reviewing the medical records in question, testified that Addley \u201cwas chronically sick for a long time. I don\u2019t think it mattered . . . whether she came into the hospital that day or a week later. I think the outcome would have probably been the same. . . . She [had] a serious impairment of bodily functions before she came into the hospital.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The department argues that, in addition to 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 507.600, the question whether Addley is eligible for medical assistance should be considered in light of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255 (c) (1) (1990), which limits medical assistance to undocumented aliens to circumstances in which the emergency medical condition has a \u201csudden onset.\u201d 55 Fed. Reg. 36,813, 36,816 (1990). However, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255 (c) (1) did not take effect until October 9, 1990, more than eight months after the hospital decided to treat Addley and more than six months after that treatment ended. Because 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255 (c) (1) had no legal effect during the period in which the hospital treated Addley, its \u201csudden onset\u201d provision is inapplicable to the question whether the hospital treated Addley for an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
