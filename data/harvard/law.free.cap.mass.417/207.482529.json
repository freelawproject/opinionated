L. c. 231A (1992 ed.), that the defendant, Fall River Housing Authority (authority), was bound to follow the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws governing the construction of public buildings, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H (1992 ed.), in awarding a contract for the renovation of Hillside Manor, an existing low income housing development, located in Fall River. The plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the authority from awarding a contract in violation of the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws. A judge in the Superior Court entered a preliminary injunction barring the authority from proceeding under bid documents issued in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. After a nonjury trial, another judge in the Superior Court concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws did not apply to a renovation project wholly funded by the Federal government. Judgment was entered for the defendant and the plaintiffs appealed. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the authority must comply with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, in awarding the contract for the renovation of Hillside Manor.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>The parties\u2019 statement of agreed facts and exhibits indicate that the authority issued bid documents in June, 1993, for the renovation of Hillside Manor. The renovation project (designated Mass. Project 6-3) consists of the rehabilitation and modernization of residential apartments, construction of a community center, rehabilitation of an existing maintenance building, and the adaptation of an existing structure as a storage facility. The estimated cost of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has agreed to provide funds to the authority equal to the cost of the renovation contract through the Comprehensive Grant Program developed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14371 (1988 &amp; Supp. III 1991). This Federal legislation has as its primary purpose the improvement of \u201cthe physical condition of existing public housing projects.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14371(a)(1). Grants awarded through the Comprehensive Grant Program are subject to Federal regulations promulgated by HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">It is agreed that the bid documents issued by the authority do not comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. The documents fail to require: filed subbids in various statutory subtrade categories, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44F (1); general contractor certificates of eligibility, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1) (a); and that general bids be submitted in accordance with the statutory bid form, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44E (2). Due to the pendency of this appeal, construction on the project apparently has not commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">2. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>As an initial matter, this court\u2019s jurisdiction must be addressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 44H, outlines an administrative procedure before the Department of Labor and Industries (department) for resolution of a question concerning the applicability of the competitive bidding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>provisions to a contract for a public building.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not file a formal protest with the department before seeking declaratory relief in the Superior Court. As a general rule, a party\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies precludes resort to a court for declaratory relief. See <em>Ciszewski </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Bd., </em>367 Mass. 135, 140-141 (1975); <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 446-451 (1973). In certain circumstances, exceptions to the general rule have been recognized. In cases where resort to an administrative agency obviously would be futile, and there is no fact-finding function for the agency to perform, a court may exercise jurisdiction despite a plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies. See <em>Construction Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>406 Mass. 162, 166-167 (1989); <em>Ciszewski </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Bd., supra </em>at 141; <em>Belfer </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>363 Mass. 439, 441-442 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It was appropriate for the judge to exercise jurisdiction in this case. The parties have stipulated to the facts and exhibits. The judge found that, during the demolition phase of the project, the plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought relief from the department on the ground relied on in this appeal. The judge also noted that, in several recent decisions concerning other construction projects, the department has concluded that a local housing authority constructing a project with Federal assistance is an agent of the Federal government, and, therefore, exempt from compliance with the requirements of the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws. The department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>position is clear, and it obviously would be futile for the plaintiffs to seek relief from the department. The question whether the competitive bidding laws apply to public construction projects funded by the Federal government is a matter of public interest, which affects the rights of subcontractors beyond those involved in the present controversy. See <em>Construction Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., supra </em>at 167. That question, as it applies to Hillside Manor, is one of law. Moreover, additional delay in the renovation of public housing should be avoided whenever possible. The case is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">3. <em>The judge\u2019s decision. </em>As has been indicated, the trial was based on a statement of agreed facts and exhibits. Over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, the judge also accepted in evidence two letters from David Myers, chief of HUD\u2019s technical services branch in the Boston regional office. The first letter, dated March 4, 1993, concerned the \u201cdemolition phase\u201d of the Hillside Manor renovation. With respect to procurement, that letter stated: \u201cAll references to State bidding requirements will be removed from said specification, especially filed sub-bids are not required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The second letter, dated July 1, 1993 (after the authority issued the bid documents for the construction phase of the Hillside Manor renovation project), was sent to \u201cprovide [the authority] with guidance on the subject of procurement, specifically the State regulations for filed sub-bidders.\u201d Myers informed the authority that procurement associated with demolition, construction, or rehabilitation at Hillside Manor must comply with the Federal procurement regulations in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.36 (1993), and the provisions of HUD Handbook 7460.8, REV-1 (Jan. 1993). The letter then quoted from a decision of the department, Carpenters Union Local No. 49 vs. Lowell Hous. Auth. (July 18, 1988), in which the department concluded that \u201c[w]hen ... a housing authority is functioning exclusively as an agent of the federal government, with only federal and no state funds on a federally controlled project in a federally operated building with tenants from a federal tenancy list, that housing authority is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>not acting as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision of the Commonwealth,\u201d and, consequently, the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws do not apply. On the basis of this decision, Myers\u2019s letter informed the authority that it too was acting as an agent of the Federal government, and did not need to comply with the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws in awarding the contract for the Hillside Manor renovation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Apparently relying on Myers\u2019s letter of July 1, 1993, the judge concluded that \u201cthe documents submitted in the instant action disclose that [the authority] is functioning exclusively as an agent of the federal government, using only federal funds (that must be segregated for the project) on a federally-controlled project in a federally-operated building with tenants from a federal tenant list. Under these circumstances, the [authority] is not acting as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision of the Commonwealth within the meaning of [G. L.] c. 149, \u00a7 44A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The July 1, 1993, letter cannot support such a conclusion. The paragraph of the letter on which the judge appears to have relied was a quotation from a department decision pertaining to a wholly different project which is located in another city.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No other document before the judge confirmed that Hillside Manor is \u201cfederally operated\u201d or \u201cfederally controlled,\u201d or that tenants are selected from a \u201cfederal tenant list.\u201d The agreed exhibits are to the contrary. The Annual Contributions Contract<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> between HUD and the author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ity identifies the authority as the owner of public housing in Fall River developed with HUD assistance. The bid documents for the construction project also identify the authority as the owner of Hillside Manor, and they indicate that the authority has operational control of the renovation of Hillside Manor.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Whether the authority acts as a Federal agent, so as to excuse it from compliance with the requirements of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, when it renovates a housing project that it owns, with Federal funds awarded to it through the Comprehensive Grant Program, is a question of law, open for our resolution on this record. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 384 (1993). It is obvious that the receipt of Federal funds, without more, does not suffice to convert a local housing authority into an agent of the Federal government. In our opinion, HUD\u2019s regulations, binding on the agency, require that State procurement laws be followed in renovation projects funded through the Comprehensive Grant Program. No provision of State law excuses a housing authority from complying with the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws when it renovates a development owned by it, unless the receipt of Federal funds is conditioned on compliance with Federal requirements superseding, or in conflict with, the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">4. <em>Receipt of Federal funds. </em>\u201cThe Federal Government in no sense controls \u2018the detailed physical performance\u2019 of all the programs and projects it finances by gifts, grants, contracts, or loans.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orleans, </em>425 U.S. 807, 816 (1976), quoting <em>Logue </em>v. <em>United States, </em>412 U.S. 521, 528 (1973). A State housing authority is not a Federal agent merely because it receives Federal funds, is subject to audit by the Federal government,- and must comply with Federal standards and regulations. <em>Orleans, supra </em>at 815. It is a Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>eral agent only if \u201cits day-to-day operations are supervised by the Federal Government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Federal legislation concerning subsidized housing \u201cis superimposed upon and consciously interdependent with the substructure of local law relating to housing.\u201d <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 11 (1st Cir. 1977). State governments and local authorities retain a significant measure of control over the administration of, and policies pertaining to, public housing. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>400 Mass. 826, 829-831 (1987). This is particularly true with respect to renovation projects funded through the recently developed Comprehensive Grant Program, which h\u00e1s among its basic goals the provision of \u201cconsiderable discretion to [public housing authorities] to decide the specific improvements [to existing public housing stock], the manner of their execution, and the timing of the expenditure of funds,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 968.301 (2) (1993), and the allocation of \u201cgreater control in planning and expending funds for modernization, rehabilitation, maintenance and improvement of public housing developments,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 968.301 (5) (1993), to public housing authorities. A public housing authority participating in the Comprehensive Grant Program develops its own five-year plan for the modernization of its existing stock of public housing, and it assumes responsibility for spending Federal grant funds in compliance with this plan. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 968.305 (1993). As a participant in the Comprehensive Grant Program, the authority, and not HUD, has day-to-day control of the operations and modernization of Hillside Manor. The authority cannot be said to be acting as an agent of the Federal government as the United States Supreme Court has defined the term. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orleans, supra </em>at 815-819.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">5. <em>HUD regulations. </em>The applicable procurement provision of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.36 (b) (1993), provides: \u201cGrantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.\u201d The HUD handbook referenced in Myers\u2019s letter of July 1, 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>states, as to procurement: \u201c[Housing authorities] are also required to follow applicable State or local laws on procurement .... If State or local law is stricter than Federal standards, then State or local law will apply.\u201d The parties agree that the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, are more stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Regulations properly promulgated by a Federal agency have the force of law. Their application may not be waived at will by an agency\u2019s personnel. See <em>United States ex rel. Accardi </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 265 (1954); <em>Montilla </em>v. <em>INS, </em>926 F.2d 162, 166-167 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>California Human Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>762 F.2d 1044, 1049 (D.C. Cir. 1985); 3 J.A. Stein, G.A. Mitchell &amp; B.J. Mezines, Administrative Law \u00a7 13.03 [1] (1977 &amp; Supp. 1993). In this instance, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.36 (b), referred to as the \u201ccommon rule\u201d for grantees, was promulgated by HUD in 1988, at the direction of the Federal Office of Management and Budget. 53 Fed. Reg. 8034, 8068 (Mar. 11, 1988). It is not contended that the regulation, which would seem to mandate compliance with the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws, was promulgated improperly or was beyond the scope of HUD\u2019s authority. Federal law thus requires compliance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, unless State law provides to the contrary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a final point, we examine that issue and conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">6. <em>The effect of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11. </em>The authority argues that it is an agent of the Federal government based on G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 <em>(b) </em>(1992 ed.), which enumerates certain powers of housing authorities. That legislation provides, in pertinent part: \u201cEach [housing authority] shall have . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>following powers <em>...(b) </em>To act as agent of, or to cooperate with the federal government in any clearance, housing, relocation, urban renewal or other project which it is authorized to undertake . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Lawrence Hous. Auth., </em>358 Mass. 202 (1970), relying in part on G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 <em>(b), </em>this court concluded that a local housing authority was permitted to act as a Federal agent for purposes of acquiring public housing developed by the \u201cturnkey\u201d method,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that, when a housing authority did so, the department lacked the power to require the housing authority to comply with the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding and minimum wage laws. <em>Id. </em>at 210. A housing authority desiring to acquire public housing through the turnkey program was obligated to comply with the Federal regulations governing the program. The regulations governing the program set the salaries and wages of those employed in the construction of a turnkey project. <em>Id. </em>at 208-209.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">It was reasoned in the <em>Lawrence Hous. Auth. </em>opinion that, where Federal regulations defined a program, and where those regulations conflicted in certain respects with otherwise applicable State standards, \u201cthe Legislature intended that local housing authorities be able to take advantage of any available Federal assistance in developing low-rent projects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209-210. The power conferred on a local housing authority to act as an agent of the Federal government, and to cooperate with the Federal government in any housing project, see G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 <em>(b), </em>was considered sufficiently broad to excuse compliance with State standards, if insistence on those standards would preclude participation in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Federal program. <em>Id. </em>at 210 &amp; n.11. In <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>345 Mass. 406 (1963), a similar conclusion was reached. Where compliance with the Commonwealth\u2019s minimum wage laws would have conflicted with budgetary requirements of the Federal Public Housing Administration (the predecessor of HUD), and led, perhaps, to a loss of Federal funding, it was decided that the Legislature, by permitting a local housing authority to cooperate with the Federal government, and to receive Federal funds and loans, intended to excuse the authority from compliance with otherwise applicable provisions of State law. <em>Id. </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In contrast to the situations described in the preceding cases, the Federal regulations for the Comprehensive Grant Program contemplate compliance with State procurement laws in the States which have standards as stringent as, or more stringent than, Federal standards. This court has observed frequently that the Commonwealth\u2019s competitive bidding laws serve important goals. They enable \u201cthe awarding authority [to] obtain the lowest price among responsible contractors, [and] to establish an open and honest procedure for competition for public contracts.\u201d <em>Modern Continental Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 840 (1984). See <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982); <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757-758 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A, make clear that the Legislature did not intend to permit public instrumentalities to avoid compliance with competitive bidding laws solely on the basis of Federal involvement. Section 44A (2) states quite directly that <em>every </em>contract for construction of a building by a public agency shall be awarded in accordance with the procedures set out in \u00a7\u00a7 44B-44H. Section 44A (3) adjusts certain deadlines to accommodate the need for Federal approval, when it is necessary to obtain such approval. Exceptions to the application of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, are few, and those that exist are narrowly and carefully drawn. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (4) and (5) <em>(a). </em>We do not think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>that the Legislature intended to permit a local housing authority to rely on G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 <em>(b), </em>to classify itself as a Federal agent based solely on the receipt of Federal funds, and so evade compliance with the competitive bidding laws when the relevant Federal regulations explicitly direct that State procurement laws should be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">7. <em>Relief. </em>The judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a new judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, declaring that the authority must comply with the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, in connection with the contract for Mass. Project 6-3, and for the grant of such other relief as may be determined to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">A subcontractor, which has the right to be considered as a subbidder on a contract for the construction of a public building, has standing to challenge the award of a construction contract alleged to violate G.
