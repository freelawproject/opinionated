Weitzel, filed a complaint in Superior Court to enforce an agreement with the defendant, Travelers Insurance Companies (Travelers), to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The complaint alleged unlawful discontinuance of benefits in violation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8 (1992 ed.). A judge in the Superior Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Weitzel appealed. We transferred the case on our own motion. We conclude that the.Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) has primary jurisdiction to hear workers\u2019 compensation claims. Therefore, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the plaintiff first should seek relief from the DIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Weitzel alleges that she was injured while at work on December 7, 1991. Her employer, Limited Express, filed an \u201cemployer\u2019s first report of injury\u201d with the DIA on January 24, 1992. Travelers insures Limited Express for workers\u2019 compensation. On January 28, 1992, Travelers began disability payments to Weitzel of $44 per week, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 3, 1992, Travelers orally agreed to increase Weitzel\u2019s weekly payments to $105, and adjusted her benefits retroactively. On June 2, 1992, after receiving a medical report stating that Weitzel was capable of returning to work, Travelers filed a notification of termination of weekly compensation with the DIA and discontinued payments. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Weitzel filed this complaint to enforce Travelers\u2019 oral agreement to pay her compensation at the rate of $105 per week. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 12 &amp; 19 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiff contends that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 19, permits employees to enforce obligations for payment under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7, either in the Superior Court or by filing a complaint with the DIA. She argues that, by including the language \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by [\u00a7 7],\u201d the Legislature intended to exempt \u00a7 7 payments from the requirement that compensation agreements be written, and allow agreements under \u00a7 7 to be enforced in the Superior Court. The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 19 gives the Superior Court concurrent jurisdiction with the DIA to hear claims for unlawful termination of \u00a7 7 payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The plaintiff asserts that construing \u00a7 19 in a more restrictive way would frustrate the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation act, which is to be construed \u201cliberally for the protection of an injured employee.\u201d See <em>Hepner\u2019s Case, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 212 (1990). In addition, the plaintiff contends that the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 19 is to afford relief from the evil of unlawful discontinuances which place hardships on employees who are injured. The plaintiff argues that she is entitled to seek relief from the agency or from the Superior Court for the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Superior Court judge dismissed Weitzel\u2019s complaint because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in the Superior Court. The issue raised by the appeal is whether a claimant must first seek relief from the DIA based on the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. See <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 23, 26 (1990). See also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-221 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The doctrine of primary jurisdiction promotes the proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with regulatory duties. <em>Id. </em>at 220-221, quoting <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 290, 303 (1976). The Superior Court judge noted that \u201c[t]he right of action in superior court under \u00a7 12 is designed to place the power of the court behind actions of the [DIA] and is normally invoked only after the board has reviewed a claim and rendered a decision or order.\u201d See <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6, 9-10 (1977). \u201c[A]flowing the administrative process to run its course before permitting full appellate review gives the administrative agency in question a fair and full opportunity to apply its expertise to the statutory scheme which, by law, it has the primary responsibility of enforcing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is applicable \u201cwhere that procedure would secure \u2018[u]niformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency,\u2019 or \u2018when the issue involves technical questions of fact uniquely within the expertise and experience of an agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>392 Mass. 876, 879 (1984), quoting <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., supra </em>at 303-304. In order to ensure uniformity and consistency in the enforcement of G. L. c. 152, courts should defer to the agency. The DIA should have an opportunity to approve the agreement between the parties and consider the insurer\u2019s allegedly unlawful termination, before any review by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Legislature has authorized the DIA to approve written compensation agreements. The Superior Court judge noted that neither party had submitted an \u201cAgreement to Compensation\u201d form which is available to memorialize binding agreements to settle compensation claims. The parties have fully briefed and argued the question whether \u00a7 19 requires that compensation agreements be written in order to be enforceable in the Superior Court. Therefore, we briefly address the question. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"AIC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The language of \u00a7 19 is clear. Any payment of compensatian \u201cshall be by written agreement by the parties and subject to the approval of the department.\u201d Where the language of a statute is plain, the courts enforce the statute according to its wording. See <em>Massachusetts Community College Council MTA/NEA </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>402 Mass. 352, 354 (1988). Section 19 requires that compensation agreements be written and subject to DIA approval in order to be enforceable in the Superior Court. Nothing in \u00a7 7, which allows insurers to make initial payments without prejudice, creates an exception to the requirement in \u00a7 19 that compensation agreements must be written.</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 7 (1992 ed.), allows insurers to make initial payments to an injured employee without prejudice to the insurer\u2019s right to contest the employee\u2019s claim. Section 7 provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) Within fourteen days of an insurer\u2019s receipt of an employer\u2019s first report of injury ... the insurer shall either commence payment of weekly benefits under this chapter or shall notify the division of administration, the employer, and, by certified mail, the employee, of its refusal to commence payment of weekly benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 8 (1992 ed.), provides in part: \u201c(1) An insurer which makes timely payments pursuant to subsection one of section seven, may make such payments for a period of one hundred eighty calendar days from the commencement of disability without affecting its right to contest any issue arising under this chapter.\u201d Section 8 was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 23, extending the time period from sixty to 180 calendar days. The effective date of the amendment was December 24, 1991, after the date of Weitzel\u2019s injury, but prior to the filing of the \u201cemployer\u2019s first report of injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 12 (1992 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any party in interest presents a certified copy of an order or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>decision of a board member or of the reviewing board and any papers in connection therewith to the superior court department . . . the court shall enforce the order or decision . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 19 (1992 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by section seven, any payment of compensation shall be by written agreement by the parties and subject to the approval of the department.
