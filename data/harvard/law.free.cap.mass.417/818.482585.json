L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D (1992 ed.), which provides for the grant of \u201cgood conduct credits\u201d to be applied to the sentences of prisoners who participate in certain approved educational, training, and work programs. The precise issue is whether such credits should be applied to sentenced prisoners for their prior participation in approved programs while they were held in custody awaiting trial. The Commissioner of Correction (commissioner) argues that \u00a7 129D does not apply to pretrial detainees. The plaintiff, Douglas McNeil, argues for himself, and for similarly situated prisoners, that the statute requires that good conduct credits be awarded to pretrial detainees as well as to prisoners serving sentences, and that, even if such awards are not required by the statute, they are required by the equal protection provisions of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions. A judge in the Superior Court agreed with the plaintiff on his statutory argument and ordered relief for him and prisoners similarly situated. We conclude that \u00a7 129D provides for the earning of good conduct credits only by sentenced prisoners, and that, so interpreted, the statute complies with Federal and State constitutional equal protection guarantees. Accordingly, we vacate the relief ordered in the Superior Court and order the entry of a new judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The background of the case is as follows. The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking a declaration of rights under G. L. c. 231 A, and injunctive relief, requiring the commissioner to award him earned good conduct credits under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, for his participation in approved programs during the period of time he spent in pretrial de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>tention. The plaintiff\u2019s original complaint was amended, a record prepared, and cross motions for summary judgment filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (a) and (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). A judge of the Superior Court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion and allowed the plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Subsequently, numerous other prisoners filed pro se pleadings which were docketed as \u201ccomplaint [s] for contempt\u201d seeking relief similar to that given the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed motions to (a) amend his complaint to add class action allegations; (b) certify a class consisting of all sentenced prisoners who had participated in, or were participating in, programs that would qualify for earned good conduct credits but for the prisoners\u2019 participation in those programs while in pretrial detention; and (c) enter partial final judgment on his claims pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974). These motions were allowed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it was ordered that the sheriffs of the Commonwealth\u2019s fourteen counties be joined as necessary parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, at the judge\u2019s direction, a preliminary injunction entered ordering the commissioner to credit \u201call sentenced Massachusetts state prisoners\u201d with the maximum days of earned good conduct credits under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, for each full calendar month of their pretrial detention until the commissioner received sufficient records to determine the actual credit appropriate for each prisoner. A partial final judgment also entered in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. A single justice of the Appeals Court entered a stay of the preliminary injunction at the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>sioner\u2019s request. Proper appeals were taken by the commissioner from the grant of the preliminary injunction and the partial final judgment, and all matters were consolidated in this court for purposes of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">1. Section 129D provides that prisoners may earn good conduct credits \u201cwhile confined at a correctional institution of the commonwealth, or any jail or house of correction.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the inclusion in \u00a7 129D of the reference to a \u201cjail\u201d demonstrates that the provision was intended to include pretrial detainees, because, as the plaintiff contends, \u201c[i]n Massachusetts, a county jail, or the \u2018jail side\u2019 of a combined county correctional facility, means the facility or portion of the facility used to hold persons who are awaiting trial, whereas the house of correction, or \u2018house side\u2019 of a county correctional facility, is for sentenced prisoners.\u201d We analyze \u00a7 129D under the general rule that \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). We also apply two other principles of statutory construction. First, \u201cwhere two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 513-514. Second, \u201cthe statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We initially note that in our view the plaintiff reads too much into the inclusion of the word \u201cjail\u201d in \u00a7 129D. As the plaintiff acknowledges, G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), provides that jails are used both \u201cfor the detention of persons charged with crime and committed for trial,\u201d and for those \u201ccommitted pursuant to a sentence upon conviction of crime.\u201d See also G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 21 (1992 ed.) (permitting the classification of \u201cprisoners sentenced and committed to jails and houses of correction\u201d); G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A (1992 ed.) (directing judge to credit pretrial detention time \u201con imposing a sentence of commitment to a correctional institution of the commonwealth, a house of correction, or a-jail\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Determination whether \u00a7 129D was intended to apply to pretrial detainees necessarily must go beyond the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>word \u201cjail\u201d in the statute and requires a closer look at the statutory structure of which \u00a7 129D is part.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We begin by observing that G. L. c. 127 is primarily, if not exclusively, devoted to sentenced prisoners. The chapter is entitled \u201cOfficers and Inmates of Penal and Reformatory Institutions. Paroles and Pardons.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The reference to \u201cpenal and reformatory\u201d institutions clearly suggests that it is convicted prisoners who are at issue; because pretrial detainees are presumed innocent, they are considered not to need punishment or reform. The provisions of G. L. c. 127 cover such various topics as solitary confinement, inmate privileges, parole, and pardons, all of which apply to convicted prisoners. Moreover, \u00a7 129D itself is included in that part of G. L. c. 127 entitled \u201cPermits To Be at Liberty and Discharge,\u201d which includes not only the various statutes providing for reductions in sentence but also statutes governing parole. This further suggests that \u00a7 129D is intended to apply to convicted prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The general impression discussed above is borne out by the specific language of \u00a7 129D. Section 129D describes the programs approved thereunder, as those that are \u201cvaluable to [the] prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d As the United States Supreme Court has said, \u201cit would hardly be appropriate for the State to undertake in the pretrial detention period programs to rehabilitate a man still clothed with a presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>McGinnis </em>v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 273 (1973).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This notion of rehabilitation is supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>statutes that establish the three basic types of programs under which prisoners can earn good conduct credits under \u00a7 129D; all of these statutes suggest that the programs are intended for convicted prisoners. First, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 48 (1992 ed.), which provides for the establishment of \u201ceducation, training and employment programs,\u201d does so only for persons committed to the custody of the department of correction or to county \u201ccorrectional facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither G. L. c. 124, governing the Department of Correction, nor G. L. c. 125, governing \u201ccorrectional facilities,\u201d evidences any indication that they are meant to apply to pretrial detainees, in contrast to G. L. c. 126, governing jails and houses of correction, which specifically mentions persons held for trial. Second, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 71 (1992 ed.), which governs the handling of funds from prison industries, refers to the participants in such programs as \u201ccommitted offenders,\u201d a category that includes only convicted prisoners.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Third, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 86F (1992 ed.), which provides for work release programs, states that sheriffs may establish such programs for \u201cpersons sentenced to the house of correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In addition, \u00a7 129D, unlike several related statutes, indicates that accrual of the credits for which it provides is to occur <em>while </em>the prisoner is serving his or her sentence. Section 129D allows a \u201cdeduction of sentence ... for each month while said prisoner is [participating in approved programs].\u201d Because a pretrial detainee has no sentence from which to deduct earned good conduct credits, and because the statute does not provide for an accumulation of the credits, this language indicates that \u00a7 129D was intended to apply only to convicted prisoners. This conclusion is strength<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ened by the contrasting language of related sections governing deductions from sentence, which specifically refer to factors beyond a prisoner\u2019s current status. Section 129B, for example, provides that time served is to be deducted from \u201c[t]he sentence of any prisoner in any correctional institution of the commonwealth or in any house of correction or jail, who was held in custody awaiting trial . . . .\u201d The specific reference to prisoners\u2019 possible pretrial detention distinguishes \u00a7 129B from \u00a7 129D, and makes it unreasonable to infer from provision in \u00a7 129B for sentence credit for pretrial detention that the same rule should be applied to earned good conduct credits under \u00a7 129D. Similar considerations obtain in \u00a7 129, which provides for statutory good time, namely good time that requires no affirmative effort on the part of a prisoner but is awarded for a good conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Finally, some guidance as to the legislative intent regarding \u00a7 129D is also available from a legislative report that was prepared prior to the statute\u2019s adoption and that proposed a statute substantially similar to what is now \u00a7 129D. See Final Report of the Special Committee of the Senate Authorized to make an Investigation and Study of the Corrections System of the Commonwealth, 1973 Senate Doc. No. 1504, App. C, at 93-94. The report is dated February 5, 1973, and \u00a7 129D was approved on July 10, 1973, see St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>1973, c. 528, approximately five months later. In the report\u2019s discussion of the desirability of a statute like \u00a7 129D, it repeatedly refers to the potential recipients of earned good conduct credits as \u201coffenders,\u201d a term which suggests that it is convicted prisoners that are contemplated. 1973 Senate Doc. No. 1504, at 50. Cf. G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 <em>(c) </em>(1992 ed.) (defining \u201ccommitted offender\u201d as \u201ca person convicted of a crime and committed, under sentence, to a correctional facility\u201d). For example, the relevant portion of the report concludes that \u201c[t]he committee recommends that the superintendent of the corrections institutions in which the offender resides, be given the authority to award additional good-time deductions for behavior or achievements on the part of the inmate which is [sic] meritorious.\u201d 1973 Senate Doc. No. 1504, at 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that \u00a7 129D was intended to apply only to sentenced prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">2. The plaintiff argues next that, if G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, is interpreted to apply only to convicted prisoners, the statute is violative of the equal protection guarantees of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions. This issue was not reached by the judge who found for the plaintiff on his statutory interpretation argument. We shall resolve the issue because the record is adequate. We shall also interpret our equal protection guarantee as identical to Federal equal protection guarantee. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arment, </em>412 Mass. 55, 63 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 235 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">We first must decide whether the distinction drawn by \u00a7 129D is subject to strict scrutiny or to the more lenient rational-relationship test. The plaintiff argues that the constitutional status of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, should be examined under strict scrutiny. He points, however, to no decision supporting that argument, and exactly the opposite conclusion has been reached by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263 (1973). The <em>McGinnis </em>decision considered a New York statutory scheme under which prisoners\u2019 earliest parole dates were calculated by in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>eluding credits for good time, but only good time after sentencing. The Court stated that the statutory classifications \u201crequire[d] only some rational basis to sustain them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We see no need to diverge from that analysis, and shall apply a rational relationship test to the problem in this case. See <em>Chestnut </em>v. <em>Magnusson, </em>942 F.2d 820, 823-824 (1st Cir. 1991) (collecting cases and concluding that \u201c[t]he indigency that may lead to an inability to post bail does not suffice to create a class calling for strict scrutiny rather than a rational relationship analysis\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Under the rational relationship test, we \u201cinquire only whether the challenged distinction rationally furthers some legitimate, articulated state purpose.\u201d <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, supra </em>at 270. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arment, supra </em>at 63. The commissioner states that his interpretation of \u00a7 129D, \u201cfurthers the legitimate government purpose of rehabilitating convicted criminals and maintaining discipline in the prison setting.\u201d He argues that drawing a distinction between pretrial detainees and sentenced prisoners is rational in light of these purposes because only sentenced prisoners need rehabilitation and because the prospect of a possible future sentencing hearing is sufficient to motivate pretrial detainees.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>We agree with the commissioner that, distinguishing for the purposes of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, between pretrial detainees and sentenced prisoners is rationally related to the statute\u2019s articulated rehabilitative purpose. The Legislature could reasonably believe that the importance of attempting to rehabilitate convicted offenders does not extend, at least not to the same extent, to persons who are being held prior to trial. This has been the conclusion reached by the courts that have considered good time statutes with rehabilitative, rather then disciplinary, purposes. See <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, supra, Lemieux </em>v. <em>Kerby, </em>931 F.2d 1391, 1394 (10th Cir. 1991) (\u201cWe are satisfied that [the good time statute at issue] serves a rational purpose of rehabilitating criminals . . .\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aqui, </em>104 N.M. 345, 349 (\u201c[I]t is clear that the distinction our statutes draw between the treatment of presentence detainees and sentenced prisoners reflects an articulated state purpose of rehabilitation and industry, and that that purpose is legitimate and nonillusory\u201d), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 917 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Furthermore, the plaintiff acknowledges that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, \u201cgrants [the commissioner] the authority to determine whether to offer a rehabilitative program.\u201d The commissioner has established such programs primarily in State correctional facilities. Any lack of approved rehabilitative programs for pretrial detainees provides an additional basis for distinguishing between pretrial detainees and sentenced prisoners.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, supra </em>at 271 (\u201cWhile appellees do point to the existence of some rehabilitative or recreational facilities within some county jails, it is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>nothing comparable to the State\u2019s rehabilitative effort exists\u201d [footnote omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nyborg, </em>122 Wis. 2d 765, 771 (Ct. App. 1985) (\u201cIt is undisputed that our state prisons have educational and work programs and our county jails have few. As in <em>McGinnis, </em>this difference is significant and is a rational basis for distinguishing between persons who serve their entire sentence in prison and those who serve part of their sentence in county jails\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">3. Our conclusion that \u00a7 129D applies only to sentenced prisoners, and that the statute does not offend equal protection guarantees, makes it unnecessary to consider the issues pertaining to the propriety and scope of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">4. The preliminary injunction entered on January 14, 1994, is vacated. The partial final judgment entered in the plaintiff\u2019s case on February 11, 1994, is vacated. A new judgment is to enter declaring that the plaintiff, and members of the certified class, are not entitled to credit under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D, for participation in any approved programs thereunder, during the period they were held in pretrial confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-5\">A class \u201ccomprised of all sentenced Massachusetts prisoners who have participated, or are participating, in work, educational or other rehabilitative programs while they were held in jail awaiting trial, and who would have qualified for earned good conduct deductions for such activities had they been serving sentences at the time of such participation\u201d was certified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The record does not disclose whether the sheriffs actually have been added to the case as defendants.

L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 129 and 129C], a further deduction of sentence of not more than two and one-half days per program or activity for each month while said prisoner [is participating in the program or activity]; provided, however, that in no event shall said deductions exceed a maximum monthly total of seven and one-half days. Such further deduction of sentence shall be added to any deduction to which the prisoner is entitled under [\u00a7\u00a7 129 and 129C] for reducing the term of imprisonment by deduction from the maximum term for which he may be held under his sentence or sentences, and for reducing from the minimum term of the sentence or sentences the good conduct credits earned under this section for parole eligibility as provided under [G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133].\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The plaintiff also makes the related argument that, when the Legislature added the phrase \u201cor any jail or house of correction\u201d to \u00a7 129D, see St. 1981, c. 181, it was presumably aware of a distinction between jails (housing pretrial detainees) and houses of correction (housing convicted prisoners), and that it therefore intended to include pretrial detainees in \u00a7 129D. This argument is undercut by the Legislature\u2019s addition of the effectively identical phrase \u201cor in any house of correction or jail\u201d to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B, see St. 1961, c. 74, in a context in which it is clearly not intended to refer to pretrial detainees. The added phrase in \u00a7 129B applies, as it does in \u00a7 129D, to the word \u201cprisoner,\u201d but that word in \u00a7 129B is part of the phrase \u201c[t]he sentence of any prisoner.\u201d In that context, it obviously cannot include pretrial detainees. We shall therefore not assume that it does so in \u00a7 129D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">\u201cChapter headings and captions between sections are part of the General Laws . . . .\u201d Editorial Notes, General Laws of Massachusetts i (1992 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The plaintiff points out that <em>Burno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 399 Mass. 111 (1987), describes the purpose of \u00a7 129D as to \u201cencourage activity that will make incarceration a more personally rewarding experience and improve prisoners\u2019 lives outside of prisons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120 n.8. Contrary to the plaintiffs contention, we do not believe that this description is inconsistent with a rehabilitative purpose. Nor does the plaintiffs observation, no doubt true, that education and training activities .can be of benefit to pretrial detainees as well as convicted prisoners overcome the impression that \u201crehabilitation\u201d is likely to be aimed at sentenced prisoners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In addition, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 49 (1992 ed.), provides that a prisoner may participate in education, training, and employment programs outside his correctional facility if he \u201chas served such a portion of his sentence or sentences that he would be eligible for parole within eighteen months.\u201d The statute thus assumes that the prisoners eligible for these programs have been sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">A \u201ccommitted offender\u201d is defined as \u201ca person convicted of a crime and committed, under sentence, to a correctional facility.\u201d G.

The plaintiff provides no evidence that this is the case, nor does the commissioner concede that this is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">If such a policy exists, it would be supportable under the specific language of \u00a7 129, not present in \u00a7 129D, which provides that with statutory good time a prisoner is \u201centitled to have the term of his imprisonment reduced by a deduction from the maximum term for which he may be held under his sentence or sentences.\u201d The commissioner could base a policy of allowing statutory good time for pretrial detention by treating pretrial detention as part of \u201cthe maximum term for which [a prisoner] may be held.\u201d Because a convicted prisoner who served time in pretrial custody was indeed \u201cheld\u201d for that time, such an interpretation would be reasonable. The interpretation would rely on the definition of \u201cmaximum term,\u201d however, and it would not suggest that the term \u201cprisoner\u201d in \u00a7 129, or in \u00a7 129D, includes pretrial detainees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The New York statutory scheme did include presentence good time credits in its calculation of the latest date at which a prisoner could be paroled. <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 267 (1973). In that respect it was unlike the present case, in which no presentence earned good conduct credits are included for any prisoner release dates. However, the <em>McGinnis </em>decision did not suggest that that was a factor in its application of a rational basis test. Instead, it referred to the fact that \u201cthe distinction of which appellees complain arose in the course of the State\u2019s sensitive and difficult effort to encourage for its prisoners constructive future citizenship while avoiding the danger of releasing them prematurely upon society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269-270. Those considerations are equally at stake here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We are aware that in both <em>Griess </em>v. <em>State, </em>624 F. Supp. 450 (D. Colo. 1985), aff'd, 841 F.2d 1042 (10th Cir. 1988), and, arguably, <em>People </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>26 Cal. 3d 498 (1980), the courts applied a strict scrutiny standard to failures to award good time credits for pretrial detention. Those courts, however, were considering good time credits more akin to those for \u201cstatutory\u201d good time than for the earned good conduct at issue in the present case. We are not persuaded by these decisions that strict scrutiny analysis is required in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">It may be true, as the plaintiff argues (although with only partial support in the record), that \u201cmost of the county correctional facilities\u201d have programs approved by the commissioner for credit under \u00a7 129D. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 411.08 (1990). Even if so, it does not follow that it would be irrational for the commissioner to distinguish between pretrial detainees, who may have access to the rehabilitative programs, and sentenced prisoners. The commissioner could provide such programs to pretrial detainees while still rationally believing that it is necessary to provide the extra encouragement to take advantage of them only to sentenced prisoners.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
