A judge in the Superior Court concluded that the automobile should be forfeited because the son of the record owner had \u201ccomplete control of the vehicle and [had] full knowledge of its use as required by subparagraph (7) (C) (3) of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (1992 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ed.).\u201d At trial, the issue was limited to ownership of the vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On November 18, 1991, the automobile was impounded by the Greenfield police department after officers observed what they perceived to be a sale of crack cocaine by its operator, Gordon Scott Stover. Found on the front floor of the vehicle were plastic bags containing 8.6 grams of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth brought before the Superior Court an action in the nature of a proceeding in rem seeking the forfeiture of the Volkswagen on the ground that it was used in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Superior Court judge found that Faythe Stover, Gordon\u2019s mother, acquired title to the Volkswagen on Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>her 22, 1991, and that she had no knowledge of its use for distributing crack cocaine. However, the judge determined that, despite the fact that Faythe Stover was the record owner of the Volkswagen, Gordon Stover was its \u201cowner in fact\u201d and that he had the requisite knowledge of the use to which it was being put to subject the vehicle to forfeiture.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Although title to the Volkswagen was in Faythe Stover\u2019s name, the judge determined that Gordon Stover exercised dominion and control over the vehicle, as evidenced by the fact that the. automobile was parked regularly at an address in Greenfield, where Gordon Stover resided with his girl friend,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> not in Springfield, where Faythe Stover resided. He also determined that Gordon Stover \u201crigged\u201d the automobile \u201cwith an elaborate sound system\u201d that was intended for his benefit, not for that of his mother.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>2. <em>The ownership issue. </em>The Superior Court judge\u2019s determination to order the Volkswagen forfeited to the Commonwealth was based on his conclusion that Gordon Stover was its \u201cowner\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (c) (3). General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(c) </em>(3), does not specifically define the term \u201cowner.\u201d \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose. . . . We derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other leg\u00e1l contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The Commonwealth correctly notes that the meanings which we have assigned to the term \u201cowner\u201d in the context of other statutes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the dictionary definition of the word \u201cowner\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> shed little light on how we should interpret that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>term as it appears in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (c) (3). However, this does not mean that there are no guideposts available to assist us in determining to whom the innocent owner provision of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (c) (3), may apply. General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47, is modeled in large part on the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 (1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 538 n.2 (1992). General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (c) (3), substantially tracks the Federal forfeiture statute\u2019s \u201cinnocent owner\u201d provision, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 (a)(4)(C). See notes 3 and 9, <em>supra. </em>Because our statute tracks the Federal statute, we have looked to the Federal case law for guidance in interpreting our forfeiture statute. See <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., supra </em>at 538-541 &amp; nn.2-5; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1976 Cadillac DeVille Auto., </em>380 Mass. 411, 419-422 &amp; nn.9, 11-16 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1977 Pontiac Grand Prix Auto., </em>375 Mass. 669, 672-675 (1978). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1978 Ketch Named \u201cSnow White,\u201d </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 399, 401-402 &amp; n.2 (1987). We therefore turn to Federal case law to determine whether the Superior Court judge correctly concluded that Gordon Stover\u2019s dominion and control over the vehicle was sufficient to order the vehicle forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The Federal courts have held that to be able to invoke the Federal forfeiture statute\u2019s \u201cinnocent owner\u201d provision, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>claimant must prove that he or she has \u201can [ownership] interest in the property sufficient to establish . . . standing ... to contest the seizure and resulting forfeiture.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Premises Known as 526 Liscum Drive, Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, </em>866 F.2d 213, 216 (6th Cir. 1989). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>$38,000 in U.S. Currency, </em>816 F.2d 1538, 1544 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 18th Century Colombian Monstrance, </em>802 F.2d 837, 838 (5th Cir. 1986), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>481 U.S. 1014 (1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 1954 Douglas C-54 Aircraft, </em>647 F.2d 864, 866 (8th Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Stumpff </em>v. <em>United States, </em>454 U.S. 1143 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In determining whether such an ownership interest exists, the \u201c[c]ourts generally look to indicia of dominion and control such as possession, title and financial stake.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 1981 Datsun 280ZX, </em>563 F. Supp. 470, 474 (E.D. Pa. 1983). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 1945 Douglas C-54 Aircraft, </em>604 F.2d 27, 28-29 (8th Cir. 1979), on appeal after remand, 647 F.2d 864, 866 (8th Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Stumpff </em>v. <em>United States, </em>454 U.S. 1143 (1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fifteen Thousand Five Hundred Dollars, </em>558 F.2d 1359, 1361 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>General Fin.

Pa. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Because \u201c[t]he intent of the [Federal forfeiture statute] is to deprive criminals of the tools by which they conduct their illegal activities . . . [and because a] failure to look beyond bare legal title would foster manipulation of nominal ownership to frustrate this intent,\u201d the Federal courts have determined that \u201cpossession of bare legal title by one who does not exercise dominion or control over property may be insufficient to establish standing to challenge a forfeiture.\u201d <em>Premises Known as 526 Liscum Drive, Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, supra </em>at 217. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>A Single Family Residence, </em>803 F.2d .625, 630 (11th Cir. 1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 1978 Piper Navajo PA-31 Aircraft, </em>748 F.2d 316, 319 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>One 1945 Douglas C-54 Air</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>craft, supra </em>at 28; <em>One 1971 Porsche Coupe Auto., supra </em>at 746-748. The Federal courts have concluded that ownership of an item should be determined by \u201clook[ing] to who would actually suffer from [its] loss.\u201d <em>One 1981 Datsun 280ZX, supra </em>at 475. See <em>One 1971 Porsche Coupe Auto., supra </em>at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In <em>One 1971 Porsche Coupe Auto., supra, </em>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania considered who would suffer from a vehicle\u2019s loss to determine who had a sufficient ownership interest in the automobile to contest its forfeiture. The court found that the claimant paid for the vehicle and held title to it. <em>Id. </em>at 746. However, the court further found that the automobile was purchased for the benefit of the claimant\u2019s son, who \u201chad sole possession and exercised dominion and control over it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748. Based on these facts, the court determined that it was the son, not the claimant, \u201cwho [would] suffer the loss occasioned by forfeiture\u201d and, therefore, that \u201cthe [claimant] lackfed] the requisite real interest in the car [to contest its forfeiture].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The facts of the instant case are substantially similar to those of <em>One 1971 Porsche Coupe Auto.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While the Superior Court judge made no determination as to whether Gordon Stover\u2019s possession of the Volkswagen was exclusive, the judge\u2019s well-supported findings establish that Gordon Stover exercised dominion and control over the automobile and that he would suffer the loss occasioned by the vehicle\u2019s forfeiture. See notes 5 and 6, <em>supra. </em>It is true that, as the Volkswagen\u2019s record owner, Fay the Stover would, as a result of forfeiture, suffer its loss as an asset. However, as the Federal court implicitly concluded in <em>One 1971 Porsche Coupe Auto., </em>a person with a financial stake in an automobile does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not possess a sufficient ownership interest to contest its forfeiture unless the -person also exercises dominion and control over the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">On appeal, the claimant argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove that \u201cthe vehicle was used in the business of dispensing, manufacturing, or distribution of drugs.\u201d At trial, the Commonwealth stated that it \u201cwas prepared to introduce evidence . . . [as] to the specifics of how the seizure took place.\u201d Counsel for the claimant stated that the only issue was \u201cownership of the car.\u201d We therefore limit our consideration to the issue of ownership of the automobile. \u201cThe theory of law on which by assent a case is tried cannot be disregarded when the case comes before an appellate court for review . . . .\u201d <em>Santa Maria </em>v. <em>Trotto, </em>297 Mass. 442, 447 (1937). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Roberts, 407 Mass. 731, 737 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 667 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>409 Mass. 675, 678 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>346 Mass. 373, 383 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 933 (1964) (\u201cAn issue not fairly raised before the trial judge will not be considered for the first time on appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">A complaint was brought against Gordon Stover in the Greenfield District Court for violations of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 34 (1992 ed.). The Commonwealth dismissed the case after the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence against him was allowed. The fact that the criminal proceedings against Gordon Stover have been dismissed has no bearing on this forfeiture proceeding because \u201ca vehicle may be forfeited even though the criminal prosecution results in acquittal, or is dismissed by the government, or, indeed, is never brought.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1976 Cadillac DeVille Auto., </em>380 Mass. 411, 421 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>(3) (1992 ed.), provides: \u201cAll conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles or vessels used, or intended for use, to transport, conceal or otherwise facilitate the manufacture, dispensing, distribution of or possession with intent to manufacture, dispense or distribute, a controlled substance in violation of any provision of [\u00a7 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u00a7 32A, \u00a7 32B, \u00a7 32C, \u00a7 32D, \u00a7 32E, \u00a7 32F, \u00a7 32G, \u00a7 32I, \u00a7 32J, or \u00a7 40 shall be subject to forfeiture to the Commonwealth].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (c) (3) (1992 ed.), provides, in part: \u201cNo conveyance or real property shall be subject to forfeiture unless the owner thereof knew or should have known that such conveyance or real property was used in and for the business of unlawfully manufacturing, dispensing, or distributing controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The Superior Court judge incorrectly placed the burden of proof on the Commonwealth.

Skerritt of the Greenfield police department, who resides at 6 Harris Court in Greenfield, testified that he observed Gordon Stover coming to and going from 14 Harris Court at all hours of the day on an almost daily basis throughout most of 1991. Officer Skerritt further testified that the Volkswagen was parked overnight at 14 Harris Court every night between October 22, 1991, and November 17, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Detective John Newton of the Greenfield police department said that the Volkswagen contained an AM/FM Realistic brand stereo and tape recorder which was bolted into the dashboard; a stereo amplifier which was bolted into the floor beneath the rear passenger seat on the driver\u2019s side and which was connected to the stereo and tape recorder; four speakers, two of which were very large and occupied virtually the entire hatchback compartment of the vehicle; and a cassette carrying box which contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>cassettes of rap-style music. The claimant, who was fifty years old at the time of trial, said that she was unfamiliar with the sound system in the Volkswagen.

It varies from an absolute proprietary interest to a mere possessory right. In some instances, it connotes a general property right, and in others a somewhat tenuous interest. . . . The mere definition of a word having such a broad significance is of little aid in determining what particular meaning the Legislature intended it should have in the enactment of [a particular] statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1105 (6th ed. 1990), defines the term \u201c[o]wner\u201d as \u201c[t]he person in whom is vested the ownership, dominion, or title of property; proprietor. He who has dominion of a thing, real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal, which he has a right to enjoy and do with as he pleases, even to spoil or destroy it, as far as the law permits, unless he be prevented by some agreement or covenant which restrains his right. The term is, however, a nomen generalissimum, and its meaning is to be gathered from the connection in which it is used, and from the subject-matter to which it is applied. The primary meaning of the word as applied to land is one who owns the fee and who has the right to dispose of the property, but the term also includes one having a possessory right to land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>or the person occupying or cultivating it. The term \u2018owner\u2019 is used to indicate a person in whom one or more interests are vested for his own benefit ... to say without more that a person has title to certain property does not indicate whether he holds such property for his own benefit or as trustee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 (a)(4)(C) (1988) provides: \u201cThe following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States ...

It is possible, therefore, that the claimant in the <em>One 1971 Porsche Coupe Auto, </em>case did not pay for the vehicle\u2019s insurance while the claimant in this matter did purchase insurance. We view that distinction as being insignificant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
