Kraft, was appointed a Boston police officer in 1983 and served with an unblemished record for several years. In 1988 the defendant police commissioner terminated Kraft\u2019s employment after discovering that, in completing application forms for the police officer position, Kraft had failed to disclose that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>been hospitalized for mental illness. At the time of his discharge, Kraft was a detective in the drug control unit. Kraft brought an action in the Superior Court challenging his discharge, and a judge determined that the commissioner\u2019s action had been unlawful. After that determination was made, the judge conducted a hearing on damages incurred through January 16, 1990. The parties agreed that from that date forward Kraft would be placed on administrative leave with a rate of pay of a detective with the same rank and title he had held before his employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">After the completion of the hearings, the judge ordered the defendant to \u201creinstate [the] plaintiff ... to his former position as a detective assigned to the Drug Control Unit, without loss of benefits or seniority.\u201d A few weeks later the judge amended the order to require the defendant to \u201creinstate [Kraft] to the position, by rank, title, and salary, of detective [not necessarily assigned to the drug unit] without loss of benefits or seniority.\u201d The judge also awarded Kraft damages for \u201clost wages, benefits, overtime and paid detail during this period and damages for emotional distress\u201d \u201cup to and including January 16, 1990,\u201d and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The judge stayed Kraft\u2019s reinstatement to active duty, pending appeal. On May 15, 1991, this court affirmed the judgment. <em>Kraft </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>410 Mass. 155 (1991) <em>(Kraft I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The plaintiff appeals and the defendant cross appeals from an order that the judge issued on January 29, 1992, approximately eight months after this court\u2019s decision. <em>Kraft I. </em>We transferred the case to this court on our own initiative. The January 29 order was in response to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cPetition for Contempt: and/or Motion to Clarify and Enforce Judgment.\u201d The facts relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s petition, taken from the judge\u2019s written findings, are as follows: \u201cOn June 13, 1991 [the] plaintiff returned to active duty. After a week of training at the Boston Police Academy, [the] plaintiff was assigned to the Identification Unit of the Department with the same rate of pay he was earning while on administrative leave. At this time [the] plaintiff was denied recertification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>for use of a department service revolver, despite [the] plaintiffs request for recertification. [The] [p]laintiff was informed that in order to be recertified for use of a handgun, he would have to take a psychological test and undergo an examination by the police department psychologist. After consulting with his attorney, the plaintiff complied with these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201cOn August 16, 1991 [the] plaintiff was provided a copy of the police department psychologist\u2019s report. The report recommended that [the] plaintiff not be reinstated to the position of police detective and that he not be certified for use of a firearm. On August 19, 1991 counsel for [the] plaintiff was informed by counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff would not be recertified for use of a service revolver and that he would remain in his present assignment in the Identification Unit. The Identification Unit does not offer any opportunity for overtime work and, without a service revolver, [the] plaintiff has been unable to obtain other available overtime and paid detail work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The judge did not hear testimony in connection with the plaintiffs petition. However, he was provided with numerous materials including an aEdavit of the plaintiffs counsel, an aEdavit of the plaintiff with the police department psychologist\u2019s report and other exhibits attached, and the reports and curriculum vitae of a psychologist and a psychiatrist of the plaintiffs choosing. In his aEdavit, the plaintiff disputed several factual assertions bearing on his medical history as described in the department psychologist\u2019s report. Also, in response to an assertion in the department psychologist\u2019s report, he disputed that he had \u201cever tr[led] to \u2018beat the test\u2019 on any test given to [him] by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist.\u201d Repetition here of the contents of the psychologists\u2019 and psychiatrist\u2019s reports is unnecessary. It is enough to say that the department psychologist expressed an opinion that, in light of the plaintiffs being \u201cunwilling or unable to be truthful when the truth may cast a negative light on him\u201d and the plaintiffs mental health and substance abuse history, the plaintiff \u201cis ... an unacceptable risk.\u201d The department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>psychologist declined to recommend Kraft for reinstatement to the position of police detective, and he advised that Kraft \u201cshould certainly not have his firearm returned to him, nor should he be given a permit to carry a firearm at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The psychologist chosen by the plaintiff, on the other hand, was highly critical of the department psychologist\u2019s report, and concluded that Kraft \u201chas made a remarkable recovery from the impediments of an early childhood and young adulthood\u201d and \u201cis capable of performing his job as Detective with the Boston Police Department,\u201d including the carrying of a weapon. The psychiatrist\u2019s report, too, was favorable to the plaintiff. The psychiatrist concluded that \u201cMr. Kraft is fit to be a police officer and it is safe for him to carry a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">By his \u201cPetition for Contempt: and/or Motion to Clarify and Enforce Judgment,\u201d the plaintiff seeks a judgment that, by refusing to recertify him to use a service revolver and by limiting him to \u201cnon-detective\u201d services in the identification unit, thereby depriving him of an opportunity for overtime work and paid details, the defendant police commissioner violated the order of the Superior Court judge, affirmed in <em>Kraft I, supra, </em>that the plaintiff be reinstated to the position of detective. The plaintiff seeks an adjudication of contempt or, as an alternative if such an adjudication should be denied, a new order more clearly requiring the commissioner to re-certify him to carry a service revolver and to receive assignments customarily given to detectives. Only in that way, the plaintiff contends, will he be \u201cmade whole\u201d following the unlawful termination of his employment as the judge\u2019s prior order contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Following oral argument on the petition and the submission of briefs by counsel, the judge awarded Kraft $38,668.73 in damages for the period from January 17, 1990, to August 19, 1991, the period the plaintiff was on administrative leave, plus interest, and ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s petition be dismissed. Kraft appeals from the dismissal of his petition. The police commissioner cross appeals from the award of damages. In his memorandum of decision ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>plaining his reason for dismissing the petition, the judge focused on \u201cthe well-recognized authority of the Boston Police Commissioner to determine the fitness of an officer to perform his duties including the fitness of an officer to carry a firearm. <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 625, 630 (1981). See St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1 (14); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98; <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s </em>(Ass\u2019n), <em>Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 225-227 (1979) (a \u2018compendium of legislation\u2019 regulating who shall carry a firearm and under what conditions \u2018demonstrates a clear policy statement by\u2019 the Legislature that \u2018the carrying of firearms is to be controlled by specified officials\u2019).\u201d In addition, the judge noted that \u201cit is also clear that a police commissioner may require an officer returning to active duty to undergo a psychiatric examination before reissuance of a firearm. <em>Nolan, supra </em>at 626 and 629 n.4; <em>Boston, supra </em>at 227.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The judge continued as follows: The \u201c[pjlaintiff has suggested that the defendant\u2019s requirement that he undergo a further psychiatric examination was undertaken in retaliation for his success in bringing his discrimination claim <em>[Kraft </em>I]. [The] [pjlaintiff has failed, however, to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of retaliation. <em>Radvilas </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 431, 439-440 (1984). Absent a showing that the defendant has \u2018abused his managerial powers,\u2019 this Court has no authority to interfere with the defendant\u2019s administrative prerogative to decide who shall carry a firearm. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 227.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u201cTo constitute civil contempt there must be a clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.\u201d <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 36 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, </em>413 Mass. 407, 411 (1992). In this case, the police commissioner was commanded to \u201creinstate [Kraft] to the position ... of detective,\u201d that is, to restore Kraft to the position from which he had been unlawfully removed. The commissioner was not commanded, however, to put Kraft in a better, more protected, position than he had been in before he was discharged. As the cases and statutes on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>judge relied establish, until his employment was terminated Kraft\u2019s right to carry a service revolver, and therefore to perform police functions requiring possession of such a weapon, was subject to the police commissioner\u2019s determination that he was fit to do so, and. that discretionary decision could properly have been aided by mandated psychiatric or psychological testing. On reinstatement, Kraft\u2019s rights were subject to the same managerial prerogatives of the police commissioner. Thus, in the absence of a showing that, in requiring the psychological testing and in refusing recertification, the commissioner was engaged in pretext or device motivated by hostility toward the plaintiff rather than by a desire to fulfil his managerial responsibilities, see <em>Mayor of Somerville </em>v. <em>Caliguri, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 335, 339 (1979), there was no inconsistency between the order of reinstatement and the commissioner\u2019s conduct, and contempt was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">It is apparent from the judge\u2019s memorandum that he was satisfied that the materials submitted to him did not constitute a <em>\u201cprima facie </em>showing\u201d that the police commissioner\u2019s insistence on psychological testing and his decision to deny recertification to the plaintiff had been motivated by concerns other than public safety. Stated another way, it is apparent that the judge concluded that, without assessing credibility but rather viewing the evidence contained in the affidavits and experts\u2019 reports in their light most favorable to the plaintiff, it could not fairly be inferred that the police commissioner\u2019s conduct was other than a good faith exercise of managerial discretion. The issue before the judge was not whether the plaintiff was fit to carry a service revolver. That decision was for the police commissioner to make. The issue before the judge was only whether the commissioner\u2019s decision was made in a good faith effort to fulfil his statutory managerial function. If it was, there was no contempt of the Superior Court order. If it was not, contempt was established. We think the judge was correct in determining that no prima facie showing of pretext or device had been made. If the submitted materials are accepted in their light most favorable to the plaintiff, it has not been shown that, in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>quiring psychological testing or in relying on the department psychologist\u2019s report despite the challenges to it, the police commissioner was not concerned with public safety but instead was motivated by a desire to retaliate or by other unlawful considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the judge committed prejudicial error by not taking live testimony. We disagree. No contention was made below, nor is it made here, that, had the judge permitted live testimony, the plaintiff could have produced evidence in addition to the materials submitted to the judge that would have warranted a finding that the commissioner\u2019s conduct was unlawfully motivated. Indeed, after submitting the materials to which we have referred, the parties engaged in oral arguments and submitted briefs without any suggestion that live testimony would be appropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff waived any right he may have had to an evidentiary hearing involving live testimony. <em>Milano </em>v. <em>Hingham Sportswear Co., </em>366 Mass. 376, 379 (1974) (\u201cA defendant in a contempt proceeding may, of course, waive his right to an evidentiary trial. .'. . Such a waiver may result, in effect, from a failure to assert rights in the trial court in a manner which permits effective appellate review\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s order, affirmed in <em>Kraft I, </em>was a clear and unequivocal command, thus obviating the need for a \u201cclarification\u201d as sought by the plaintiff in lieu of, or in addition to, an adjudication of contempt. We also are satisfied, however, that the plaintiff has failed to show a \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience\u201d of that command. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., supra. </em>No contempt has been proven. Thus, the judge\u2019s order dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s petition was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We turn very briefly to the police commissioner\u2019s cross appeal. The commissioner challenges the award of compensation for the period Kraft was on administrative leave, that is, from January 17, 1990, to August 19,' 1991, when, as the judge concluded, the commissioner \u201clawfully removed [Kraft] from his street assignment.\u201d The commissioner- argues that damages for that period should not have included compensation for loss of overtime or detail pay since such an award requires undue speculation. The commissioner had the opportunity to raise that question in his initial appeal <em>(Kraft I) </em>but did not do so and therefore waived a right of review at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In a reply brief to the Superior Court dated December 6, 1991, Kraft complained that the police commissioner had made factual assertions in his brief that were unsupported by the submitted materials. He stated, \u201cAll of these allegations are false, or at the very least disputed by [the] plaintiff. No affidavit or other evidence has been submitted by the defendant to support these spurious allegations. If such factual assertions are relevant they must be resolved after evidentiary hearing.\u201d It is apparent from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that he did not rely on the referenced factual assertions but instead considered whether the submitted material made a prima facie showing of retaliation or any other form of contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
