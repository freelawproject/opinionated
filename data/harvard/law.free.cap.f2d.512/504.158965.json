They contend that it was an abuse of discretion for the referee to deny a discharge to both or at the least to Marilyn McBee individually. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The McBee creditors challenged the voluntary petition in bankruptcy on the ground that the bankrupts had failed to maintain books or accounts to satisfactorily explain a loss of $14,000 in assets as required by 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 32. By their objections, the creditors brought to the fore the petitioner\u2019s burden to explain what happened to the money. Minella v. Phillips, 5 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 687; 1A Colliers on Bankruptcy \u00a7 14.12, p. 1310 (1973 rev.). Together the McBees testified that the $14,000 \u2014 Marilyn McBee\u2019s separate property \u2014 was placed in a closet in their home for approximately two weeks. Then Hal McBee, unbeknownst to his wife, took the money and went on a junket to a Las Vegas gambling casino in an attempt to recoup enough to pay his debts. Within 24 hours he had lost all at the black jack tables and flew home with only airline ticket stubs and hotel receipts to account for the $14,000 loss. He was able to testify that the Sands was the scene of his debacle but except for the fact that the dealer had a mustache, McBee\u2019s memory of specific bets and the manner of the losses was vague. Who hit whom or with what and when was never revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The referee found the gambling spree explanation unacceptable to justify the absence of any records to account directly for the loss. He emphasized the cavalier, nonchalant attitude shown by the McBees toward their loss, as well as the fact that this was a substantial sum as compared to the petitioners\u2019 income\u2014 $10,000 to $12,000 a year. While allowing that gambling records were by their nature hard to come by, the referee concluded that a bankrupt had to produce some kind of direct evidence in order to defeat an objection to his petition based on a failure to explain loss of assets. Since there was no justification offered by the petitioners for their failure to maintain records of the loss, the discharge was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Broad discretion is vested in the referee to grant or deny a bankruptcy petition based on a determination that books or records are adequate under the terms of the statute and the facts of each case. Goff v. Russell Company, 5 Cir., 1974, 495 F.2d 199, 202. Where the referee\u2019s determination has been upheld by the District Court, it will not be overturned \u201cexcept for the most cogent reasons.\u201d Baum v. Earl Millikin, Inc., 7 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 811. By this standard we find no justification in the arguments offered by petitioners or the facts of their case to justify reversal. For himself Hal McBee contends that the inherent impracticability of maintaining gambling records is adequate justification. In addition, his lack of technical legal title to his wife\u2019s separate property should, he contends, eliminate any responsibility he may have to account for the $14,000. First, he misunderstands his burden under the statute. It is to convince the referee either by direct or circumstantial evidence that the money was in fact lost and the gambling explanation was not merely a ruse to evade creditors. <em>See generally </em>1A Colliers on Bankruptcy \u00a7 14.12, pp. 1303-06 (1973 rev.). Second, Hal McBee had absolute control over his wife\u2019s income and assets. Therefore, he cannot avoid the responsibility to account for sums that inured to his benefit. <em>See, e. g., </em>In Re Gentile, W.D.Ky.1954, 123 F.Supp. 723, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> Similarly, we affirm the denial of a discharge to Marilyn McBee despite some slight hesitancy. While it is true that- \u2014 if Hal McBee is to be believed\u2014 the property was lost through no fault of her own, she did participate in what can only be judged as a very stealthy handling \u2014 if not outright concealment\u2014 of the money. While there is no contradiction to her story that Hal McBee did not disclose his gambling mission until after his return, we would point out that such collusion would be virtually impossible to prove. In any case, the burden under the bankruptcy law to explain the loss and justify the absence of records applies as evenly to Marilyn McBee as it does to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
