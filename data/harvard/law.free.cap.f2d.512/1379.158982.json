Fidelity and Deposit Co., (5th Cir.) 512 F.2d 1375, announced today. In that action, C &amp; C sought damages under an injunction bond posted by its competitor, Premier Industrial Corp. (Premier), with Fidelity acting as surety thereon, for the wrongful suing out of a state court injunction restraining C &amp; C and Roy A. Marlow,' its district sales manager, from engaging in alleged unlawful competitive practices. This court affirmed a jury award of 16,326.06 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-17\">After C &amp; C filed suit in federal district court against Fidelity, Premier brought this suit for declaratory judgment against Roy A. Marlow asserting that he would bring a similar suit for damages, and seeking damages for an alleged conspiracy between Marlow and C &amp; C to pirate Premier employees and for breach of fiduciary duty. The district court dismissed Premier\u2019s claim holding that litigation of Marlow\u2019s and C &amp; C\u2019s alleged unlawful activities was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that declaratory judgment was improper since Premier had failed to show an \u201cactual threat\u201d of litigation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-20\">Premier\u2019s challenge to application of the doctrine of res judicata under the facts of this case is adversely controlled by our holding in C &amp; C Products, Inc. v. Fidelity and Deposit Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-21\">Premier\u2019s secondary contention, that denial of declaratory relief was improper, falls with the affirmance of the first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
