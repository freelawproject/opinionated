Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1352-15\">PER CURIAM;</author>\n<p id=\"b1352-16\">The sole question presented in this appeal is whether the District Court correctly held that defendant-appellee was not \u201cdoing business\u201d in Georgia, which resulted in the dismissal of appellant\u2019s action for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-17\">Appellant, the Trustee in Bankruptcy for the estates of three bankrupt corporations, filed the instant action in the Northern District of Georgia, alleging preferential transfers by the bankrupts to Toyomenka in the amount of $99,524. Process was served on Toyomenka, a New York corporation, at its New York address under the Georgia Long Arm Statute, Georgia Code \u00a7\u00a7 24-113.1 \u2014 24-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-18\">Toyomenka answered, denying that it had transacted any business within Georgia such as to enable service under the Georgia Long Arm Statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then filed a motion to dismiss. The District Court granted this motion to dismiss, and it is from this judgment that appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-19\">There have been no allegations that would make sub-sections (b), (c), or (d) of Georgia\u2019s Long Arm Statute applicable. Consequently, the sole question involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>is whether or not Toyomenka has, under the Georgia definition, \u201ctransacted business\u201d within Georgia, and thereby conferred <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction on that state\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\">The evidence established that Toyomenka transmitted communications from New York to Georgia by means of telephone and mail. It sent goods into Georgia, and was paid by checks drawn on Atlanta banks. However, Toyomenka has never had an agent or employee located in Georgia, has never manufactured any product in Georgia, and has never been domesticated or authorized to conduct business in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">It appears that the District Judge has accurately interpreted Georgia law. In Coe &amp; Payne Company v. Wood-Mosaic Corporation, 125 Ga.App. 845, 189 S.E.2d 459 (1972), reversed on other grounds, 230 Ga. 58, 195 S.E.2d 399 (1973), jurisdiction over two non-resident corporations was asserted under sub-sections (a) and (c) of the Georgia Long Arm Statute. In considering jurisdiction under sub-section (a), the Georgia Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-6\">\u201cWe would point out that it (transacting business) would seem to encompass more than mail orders which require acceptance in a nonresident state. Furthermore, transacting business would not be involved where the sole local performance was delivery of items ordered to this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">Also relevant is J. C. Penney Company v. Malouf, 230 Ga. 140, 196 S.E.2d 145 (1973). In that case, Malouf, a foreign corporation, sold merchandise to Penney, which was resold by Penney at retail. When the plaintiffs filed suit against Penney for damages allegedly caused by this merchandise, Penney sought to bring Malouf in as a third party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">In allowing Penney to join Malouf, the Supreme Court of Georgia stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-9\">\u201cWe conclude that the manufacture and shipment of merchandise by Malouf for delivery to Penney in Georgia placed the merchandise in the stream of commerce for resale at retail to Georgia citizens; and placing the merchandise in that stream pursuant to the warranty-indemnity contract previously referred to amounted to \u2018transacting any business\u2019 in Georgia by Malouf under subsection (a) of our Long Arm Statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">Thus it was only when coupled with a warranty-indemnity contract that the Georgia Supreme Court held that shipping goods into Georgia constituted \u201ctransacting business\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-12\">Appellant discounts <em>Penney </em>by pointing out that on a motion for rehearing, the Court summarized its earlier action as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-13\">\u201cWe held that by manufacturing merchandise and placing it in the stream of commerce in Georgia, Malouf was doing business in Georgia. In connection with that doing business in Georgia, Malouf entered into a contract with Penney agreeing to hold Penney harmless for any and all expenses and damages arising or resulting from any \u2018alleged defect\u2019 in its merchandise. Penney was sued in Fulton County for an \u2018alleged defect\u2019 in the merchandise. The \u2018act\u2019 causing expenses and damages to Penney occurred when the suit was brought in Fulton County. The bringing of the suit in 1968 in Fulton County against Penney activated the obligations of Malouf to Penney contained in the contract of indemnity.\u201d <em>Penney, supra, </em>at 149.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-14\">Appellant contends that this opinion on rehearing puts the emphasis on placing goods in the stream of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-15\">However, this opinion was written with only the venue question in mind. By saying \u201cWe <em>held . . </em>. \u201d, the</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-16\">Court does not seem to intend to modify its original holding, but merely to refer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-17\">Finally, appellant cites Delta Equities, Inc. v. Larwin Mortgage Investors, 133 Ga.App. 382, 211 S.E.2d 9 (1974). The parties agree on the holding in <em>Delta. </em>It holds that where a non-resident corporation\u2019s agents made two trips into Georgia to negotiate a contract, the \u201cmini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>mum contracts\u201d necessary to constitute \u201ctransacting business\u201d were satisfied. Although it was established that Toyomenka sent agents into Georgia to meet with the bankrupts on the accounts at issue, the business had already been consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">. Georgia Long Arm Statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-8\">24-113.1. <em>Personal jurisdiction over nonresidents of State. </em>\u2014 A court of this State may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident, or his executor or administrator, as to a cause of action arising from any of the acts, omissions, ownership, use or possession enumerated in this section, in the same manner as if he were a resident of the State, if in person or through an agent, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-9\">(a) Transacts any business within this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-10\">(b) Commits a tortious act or omission within this State, except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWP\">(c) Commits a tortious injury in this State caused by an act or omission outside this State, if the tortfeasor regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayc\">(d) Owns, uses or possesses any real property situated within this State.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
