We find the challenge without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">A federal grand jury charged Kenneth Wayne Parker (\u201cParker\u201d) with conspiracy to kidnap two women under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(c), and following Parker\u2019s arrest, the government moved to detain him without bail under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. A federal magistrate conducted a detention hearing, at which Parker did not testify, and ordered Parker detained pending trial because the magistrate found by clear and convincing evidence that Parker posed a threat to witnesses or jurors and a danger to the community. The district court subsequently denied Parker\u2019s motion to revoke the detention order, and Parker timely appealed. On appeal, Parker challenges the validity of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), specifically 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142, on the grounds that it deprives a criminal defendant of the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to effective assistance of counsel and that it undermines the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Parker contends that the Act is facially unconstitutional for reasons not addressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987). To successfully challenge the Act on its face, however, Parker must establish \u201cthat no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>Salerno, </em>107 S.Ct. at 2100. He does not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">\n<em>A. Self-Incrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">The Act provides that a judicial officer must consider certain factors in determining whether to detain a criminal defendant, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged and the weight of the evidence against the accused. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g). Consequently, Parker contends that the Act vitiates a defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination because it requires the judicial officer to address the merits of the government\u2019s allegations and thus compels the defendant to testify in order to rebut those allegations. Parker\u2019s argument is merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">We squarely rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Dohm, </em>618 F.2d 1169, 1173-74 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc), where we held that a bail hearing does not compel a criminal defendant to testify in violation of the fifth amendment and that a defendant need not divulge the facts of his case in order to secure his release. Although <em>Dohm </em>was decided under the prior law, Congress derived most of the current factors in section 3142(g), including the two cited by Parker, from the former bail statute. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g) <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(b) (1982) (repealed 1984). Thus the focus of a detention hearing has not significantly changed. <em>See United States v. Ingraham, </em>832 F.2d 229, 238 (1st Cir.1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charging instrument and the government\u2019s evidence will provide in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>formation concerning the factors, and the Act does not demand further explanation by the defendant. If the defendant wishes to rebut the government\u2019s allegations and evidence, he need not personally testify because he may present evidence through hearsay or by proffer. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f). Moreover, the factors that cause Parker concern are not the only relevant ones; a defendant may focus his evidence on other factors that are unrelated to the alleged offense, such as his character, employment history, family status, and community ties. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(3); <em>see also </em>Ingraham, 832 F.2d at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"AFY\">\n<em>B. Presumption of Innocence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">The Act provides that a rebuttable presumption arises if the judicial officer finds probable cause to believe that the defendant committed certain offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). Parker contends that the presumption of innocence is destroyed because the judicial officer makes the finding of probable cause at a public hearing and thereby places a stamp of approval on the indictment that did not exist before and that is broadcast to the community. This argument is frivolous. A judicial finding of probable cause at a detention hearing no more damages the presumption of innocence than does the indictment itself or a similar finding at a preliminary hearing. Apparently, Parker\u2019s real concern is the effect of pre-trial publicity; that concern, while important, does not render the Act unconstitutional. Adequate safeguards exist to guard against prejudicial pre-trial publicity, and a criminal defendant\u2019s remedy is to avail himself of those safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">\n<em>C. Effective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AyO\">Finally, Parker asserts that the Act denies a pre-trial detainee the effective assistance of counsel because it limits the detainee\u2019s access to his attorney and his participation in preparing a trial defense. This contention is similarly without merit. The Act provides that a detention order must direct that the detainee \u201cbe afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel,\u201d and a judicial officer may subsequently order the temporary release of the detainee \u201cto the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person\u2019s defense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(i). Those provisions are sufficient to defeat Parker\u2019s facial challenge to the Act \u201cwhether or not they might be insufficient in some particular circumstances.\u201d <em>See Salerno, </em>107 S.Ct. at 2103. Moreover, Parker\u2019s argument does not depend on a provision of the Act but applies to any case in which a criminal defendant is detained pending trial. We decline to hold that pre-trial detention is itself unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"AKF\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Asv\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying revocation of the magistrate\u2019s pre-trial detention order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. In certain cases, the Act may implicate fifth amendment concerns because it provides a re-buttable presumption of dangerousness. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). The Third Circuit has interpreted the Act to require the grant of use-fruits immunity in cases where the presumption arises. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>788 F.2d 100, 115-16 (3d Cir.1986). We need not decide the issue here, however, because no presumption operated at Parker\u2019s detention hearing and he simply rests his facial challenge on previously rejected arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
