S. Patent No. 2,-704,309 on the same day the present application was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The present application discloses an invention which relates to the assembly of known conductor bars for conducting electricity in electrical distribution systems for traveling cranes, hoists and the like. Such conductor bars have a cross section in the shape of a figure 8, with two vertically spaced, circular lobes connected by a fiat web. The bars may be either of hollow tubular construction formed from sheet metal or they may be solid, with sockets formed in the ends of the lobe portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">A conductor installation is made up of a plurality of individual bars connected with their ends in abutting relationship. Connector pins are inserted into openings in the ends of each of the abutting lobes of adjacent bars. The invention claimed is described in appellant\u2019s brief as \u201cHowell\u2019s simple invention of putting the openings adjacent the ends of the bar sections so that one person, operating a simple tool, can, without moving from his place, produce a strong force fit connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">The \u201csimple tool\u201d referred to by appellant is a pivoted lever type connector tool having attaching pins on one pair of movable ends for connecting the tool in the holes provided in the flat web portions of adjacent but spaced conductor bars. By applying pressure to the other ends of the pivoted levers, force is applied to move the ends of the conductor bars together and to press the connector pins into tight engagement in the recesses provided in the abutting lobes of the adjacent bar sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Appealed claim 22 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATaB\">\u201c22. As a new article of manufacture, a conductor bar for industrial electrical distribution systems adapted to be connected in end-to-end relation with other bars of the same construction to form an elongated conductor of electricity, said bar being 8-shaped in cross section having spaced hollow parts of circular cross section connected by a flat web part, a pin of full circular cross section having its length partially received within the end part of at least two of said hollow parts and having a part protruding therefrom to be received in the hollow circular part of an adjacent aligned conductor bar, and two transverse openings through said flat web part of the bar which are respectively adjacent the ends of the bar and are spaced from' their respective ends by a distance such that the transverse openings in the adjacent ends of aligned conductor bars will receive elements on the arms of a manually operable lever tool whereby the protruding parts of the pins of one of the aligned conductor bars may be forced into the aligned hollow parts of the adjacent conductor bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Claim 23, like claim 22, is drawn to a single conductor bar but in addition calls for a sheath of electrically insulating material mounted on the conductor bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">Claim 24 recites a conductor bar assembly made up of conductor bars in abutting relationship and, in addition, calls for a sheath as recited in claim 23 but specifies that a separate sheath surrounds the end parts of the bars which are not covered by the first sheath.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">The rejection is based on the following references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-13\">Sollmann 653,970 July 17, 1900</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agz\">Benzel 1,055,253 March 4, 1913</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avx\">Cowen 1,109,968 Sept. 8, 1914</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3i_\">Connell 2,668,199</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asq\">(filed Sept. 2,1947) Feb. 2, 1954</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-23\">The examiner held claims 22, 23 and 24 unpatentable over Connell in view of Cowen and Benzel while additionally making reference to Sollmann. In affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection, the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Appeals agreed with the examiner that these references show that the claimed subject matter would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">The \u201cReasons of Appeal\u201d in appellant\u2019s notice of appeal to this court are that the Board of Appeals erred (1) in rejecting claims 22, 23 and 24 on the Sollmann, Benzel, Cowen and Connell patents and (2) in not allowing claims 22, 23 and 24. Because of the general nature of these \u201cReasons of Appeal,\u201d the solicitor in his brief stated that the court \u201cis confronted with the question of whether such general statements comply with the requirement of 35 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 142 that appellant \u2018shall file in the Patent Office his reasons for appeal, <em>specifically </em>set forth in writing\u2019.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">As this court stated in In re Kopplin, 146 F.2d 1014, 1015, 32 CCPA 848, 849:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_V\">\u201cAppellant has clearly advised us and the Patent Office of the issue, and it is not necessary for us to search the record in order to discover the basis of the appeal. The Solicitor in his brief discussed and applied all of the references. Therefore we will consider all of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The precise ground of the examiner\u2019s rejection is not altogether clear. As interpreted by the board, it is a rejection for obviousness based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. We agree with this interpretation. The cited prior art discloses the factual background for this rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The Cowen patent discloses a railroad track for toy electric trains. Track sections are formed of sheet metal and have .a cross section in the shape of the figure 8. Pins of semi-circular cross section are inserted into the hollow portions at -each end of the track sections. When the sections are fitted together, the portions \u2022of the semi-circular pins extending from \u2022one section are fitted into the remaining semi-circular openings of the adjoining .section to bring the ends of the sections into abutting relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The Benzel patent discloses a joint con.struction for rail sections comprising a track portion joined by an intermediate web to a base portion. As shown, the ends of each rail section includes vertically spaced joint elements, such as a projecting pin and a socket. A joint is formed by placing the ends of the adjacent rail sections in abutting relationship with the pin in one section fitting into the corresponding recess in the other section. The rail sections are provided with openings in their webs near their ends. A plate having openings coinciding with the openings in the adjacent rail sections, is placed on each side of the joint, with bolts passing through the openings to secure the sections together.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">The Sollmann patent discloses a toy electric railroad track of conventional construction. A track section is made up of two rail portions mounted in parallel relationship. Each rail portion is made up of sheet metal shaped to provide a hollow tread portion of circular cross section. Track sections are joined by pins which fit half way into the ends of the hollow tread of each rail to make \u201cgood electrical and mechanical connection\u201d between the abutting ends of the adjacent rail sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">The examiner\u2019s reliance upon Connell to show the particular conductor bar construction with which appellant\u2019s invention is to be used has been challenged by appellant for the reason that the present application, while filed on March 15, 1955, is entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the parent application of appellant and four others which was filed on August 29, 1952 and thus is entitled to an effective filing date earlier than the Feb. 2, 1954 issue date of the Connell patent. Appellant\u2019s position is that the Connell patent does not describe the same invention as that here claimed and thus is not available as a reference under section 102(e). Appellant also argues that such a reference cannot be used to show \u201cobviousness\u201d of the claimed invention to support a rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 since at the time of filing the parent application, Connell\u2019s invention was not known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>It is unnecessary to determine the issue thus raised by appellant. Connell but corroborates the known state of the art as to the particular \u201cfigure eight\u201d conductor bars which were described in the application of the parent patent on which appellant relies for his earlier effective filing date, and which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-4\">\u201cIn detail, the invention is particularly adapted to be employed in connection with a \u201cfigure eight\u201d type of conductor track or trolley wire * * *. The figure eight\u201d tubular conductor or trolley track is particularly popular for sliding shoe trolleys because, in cross-section it comprises a pair of generally circular vertically spaced enlarged portions formed from a unitary section of sheet metal which greatly enhances the bending resistance of the conductor track without unduly increasing its weight.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The Connell patent describes the same conductor bar construction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-6\">\u201cIn conventional electrified systems employing overhead rails, overhead conductor bars are employed for supplying electric current to hoisting means and the like mounted upon the conveyors being used * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-7\">* * # * \u2022\u00bb -\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-8\">\u201cThe construction illustrated in the drawings includes a conventional elongated conductor bar 15 for carrying electric current, this bar being of the conventional so-called figure 8 construction having a connection web 15a integrally joining the upper and lower lobes of the figure 8 bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Thus, it is clear that the figure-8 type conductor track was well-known to persons of ordinary skills in this art at a time prior to appellant\u2019s effective filing date. Connell, thus is not used as a technical \u201creference\u201d in the sense of 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 102. It corroborates as of its filing date in 1947, the statement made by appellant that the \u201cfigure eight\u201d type of conductor track was \u201cconventional\u201d prior to appellant\u2019s effective filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Appellant also objects to the use of the Cowen, Sollmann and Benzel patents as references on the basis that they are said to be from \u201cborderline non-analogous arts.\u201d He concedes, however, that these patents should not be completely disregarded as references, but contends that their disclosures must be strictly construed in determining whether the claims in issue are patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">This court stated in In re Krogman, 223 F.2d 497, 501, 42 CCPA 1037, 1042:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-eb\">\u201cWhether a reference is pertinent, or a combination of references is proper, depends solely upon what is reasonably and realistically taught, thereby in relation to that which is claimed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">We think the Board of Appeals properly answered appellant\u2019s argument as to the non-analogous status of these references by indicating that the significant function disclosed and claimed in the present application is the same as the functions disclosed in the references. The fact that the patents to Cowen and Sollmann, relate to toy railroad tracks, and that the Benzel patent, is directed to-regular railroad track, does not change the fact that all involve disclosures of' means for providing joints or connections between such track sections. In the case of the Cowen and Sollmann references the joints provide an electrical as well as a mechanical connection between the-track sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">In In re Kylstra, 87 F.2d 487, 488, 24. CCPA 938, 940, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-14\">\u201cIt does not seem to us that the broad differences between the arts of street car operation and machine gun firing are decisive of the issue here. The actual <em>art </em>is numbering or counting, with a display of the result at a. desired location, and we regard such. <em>art </em>as being the same in both the device of appellant and that of the Cravath patent. In re Weingartner,. 58 F.(2d) 442,19 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1202.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>The art with which we are here concerned is the art of connecting adjacent ends of electrically conductive rail sections. The disclosures in Cowen, Sollmann and Benzel are directed to this identical art and, therefore, provide a proper basis for the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Appellant asserts in his brief that two of the \u201csalient features\u201d of his invention are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-6\">\u201c1. The 8-shaped conductor bar with hollow circular lobes to tightly receive connecting pins. (All three claims).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-7\">\u201c2. A hole in the web of the bar at each end thereof and spaced from the end of the bar by such a distance that the holes in adjacent ends of two bars may be engaged by pins on a lever tool to pull the hollow circular lobes of the bar onto the connecting pins.\u201d (All three claims).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">The examiner and the Board of Appeals found these \u201csalient features\u201d of the appealed claims to be obvious to one of ordinary skills in the art at the time the invention was made. We think that the examiner and board were correct in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">The \u201c8-shaped conductor bar\u201d was known to the art prior to appellant\u2019s effective filing date in 1952. Appellant disclosed in his application that, while he \u25a0\u201cpreferably\u201d uses the hollow tubular construction, \u201ca solid conductor of similar -outer configuration\u201d may be employed. There is no patentable distinction between these two embodiments insofar as the presently claimed invention is concerned. The use of pins to be inserted into either the hollow lobes or a socket In the solid lobes of an adjacent section is a. well-known method of connecting sections of track as shown by Sollmann, Benzel and Cowen. That the pins are received \u201ctightly\u201d is merely a requirement of good design.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Benzel\u2019s use of openings adjacent to the ends of his rail sections for securing fish plates in position would suggest to one of ordinary skills in the art the desirability of connecting adjacent ends of figure-8 shaped conductor bars by the use of a bolted fish plate connecting means. Such modification would involve providing transverse openings through the webs of the bars adjacent the ends. Appellant urges that the opening near each end of his bar is \u201cso positioned with respect to the end of the bar that lever tool parts may be received within the opening and the similarly positioned opening in the adjacent bar for tightly forcing the bar sections together onto the connecting pins.\u201d The corresponding references to a lever tool in the claims relate only to the manner of utilizing the openings in the bar or bars being claimed. It is not seen how the reference to the lever tool can impart patentability to the claims which are directed to the conductor bar per se. In following the teaching of Benzel, the holes in the web of the track sections to be joined, whether they be figure-8 or those shown by Benzel, would meet the precise requirements of appellant's claims. Thus these openings would be spaced from the ends of the bar a relatively short distance and clearly could \u201creceive elements on the arms of\u201d an appropriately designed \u201cmanually operable lever tool\u201d suitable for forcibly connecting the ends of the adjacent bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that both of appellant\u2019s \u201csalient features\u201d as defined in claim 22 would have been obvious to one of ordinary skills in the art at the time the invention was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">Claims 23 and 24 include recitations relating to the U-shaped insulation sheath. The mere addition of such a sheath does not impart patentability to the old article claimed in claim 22. The longitudinal length limitations in claims 23 and 24 that one sheath is so designed to leave exposed the end parts of the conductor bar and another is designed to cover them, are but claims to an obvious feature of the known insulated conductor tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">We agree with the Board of Appeals that it constituted a matter of obvious choice to limit the extent of the sheath so as to leave exposed the end parts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>conductor bar containing the transverse openings. , If the entire length of the bar assembly is to be covered by a sheath, it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to cover the abutting end portions of adjacent bars, extending beyond the transverse openings, with a section of sheath separate from the section on the central portion of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">From our consideration of the appealed claims and from our study of the references we find nothing in claims 22, 23 and 24 which would not have been obvious, at the time of the appellant\u2019s effective filing date in 1952, to a person having ordinary skill in the art of connecting in end-to-end relationship the adjacent ends of conductor bars for industrial electrical distribution systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">.
