Preliminary Report published 1951, Fart 1 of Final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Report published July 30, 1952, Part 2 of Final Report published May 31, 1953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-7\">\u201cDigitron,\u201d published by Parsons Corporation, Traverse City, Michigan, February 8,1952.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Appellant\u2019s application discloses a process of machining workpieces of metal or other materials by using data derived from a design drawing to control a milling machine automatically. A study of the drawing of the article to be formed is first made to determine the machine movements and corresponding time periods necessary in the machining operation. The results are tabulated. Ordinarily the tabulation of movements is in terms of three right angularly related coordinates constituting the familiar \u201cx,\u201d \u201cy\u201d and \u201cz\u201d axes of an orthogonal coordinate system since they correspond to the directions of relative motion of the workpiece and cutter customarily afforded in machine tools. The process then involves the following four steps:</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">1. Forming a digital record of the tabulated values representative of distance, direction and time for movements of the machine by punching said values in a tape, preferably according to the binary system of numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">2. Converting the numerical values on the punched tape into a plurality of modulated electrical signals, including a reference signal and a signal carrying the information necessary for controlling movement along each of the three coordinates, and recording the signals simultaneously on a magnetizable tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">3. Transporting the magnetizable tape from the location where step 2 was performed to the location of the machine tool which is to machine the workpiece.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">4. Playing back the magnetizable tape to reproduce the modulated electrical signals and applying those signals to control means associated with the machine tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">The publication of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, comprising three reports and entitled \u201cA Numerically Controlled Milling Machine,\u201d and the publication of the Parsons Corporation, entitled \u201cDigitron,\u201d together describe a system for automatic control of a milling machine referred to by the Board of Appeals as the \u201cMIT system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-17\">That system utilizes data representing increments of relative movement of the milling machine cutter and workpiece, as well as the corresponding periods of time, determined from drawings of the workpiece to be produced. A first mechanism permits application of the data to a punched paper tape. Complex electronic mechanism then converts the data on the tape into modulated electrical signals representative of the movements along the x, y and z axes and the corresponding time periods. The signals are then applied to means which respond thereto to control the milling machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-18\">Referring to that system, the Parsons publication states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-19\"><em>\u201cTransmission of Digitron Data. </em>Since the punched tape is compact and easily portable, economies in computing and tape preparation might be effected by centralizing this function and having one organization process blueprints and provide punched tape for a number of different companies \u2014 in much the way that teletype news services now furnish coded punched tape which can be fed directly to typecasting machines. Telegraphic reproduction of the tape is also possible if desired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">The Livingston et al. patent discloses controlling the operation 'of a machine tool automatically by means of modulated electrical signals recorded on a magnetizable tape. The signals are originally produced from the tool movements which result while the tool is operated by manual control to machine the workpiece into the desired configuration. The signals are recorded on the tape. Playing back the tape reproduces the signals which are then applied to control means on the machine tool to cause a repetition of the original machining operation. Thus, additional pieces of work of the same configuration as that produced under manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>control can be produced automatically under control of the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The Leaver et al. patent also discloses making a magnetizable tape recording of electrical signals representative of the movements of a machine tool in producing an article which it is desired to reproduce. It is disclosed that the recording may subsequently be employed to operate the same machine tool or a plurality of like machine tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">The board regarded the claimed method as a modification of the MIT system with \u201cthe use of magnetizable tape to separate the system into components\u201d being \u201cthe feature of the recited method upon which appellant is predicating patentability.\u201d Appellant does not dispute that evaluation but does argue that, if what he did \u201cis a \u2018separation\u2019 of the MIT system, it is one that involved much more than a routine splitting of one operation into two parts.\u201d He contends that it \u201cinvolved adding two steps to the previous procedure and resulted in advantages far out of proportion to what ordinarily might be expected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">It seems to us that what appellant has done is separate the MIT apparatus into two parts. The first part consists of the steps up to and including production of the modulated electrical signals which are suitable for application to the control device of the milling machine. The second part consists of the application of those modulated signals to the machine. To do that, appellant introduced the two additional steps of recording the signals produced from the first part of the process on magnetizable tape and then played back the tape to reproduce the signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The board referred to the portion of the Parsons publication quoted above and found \u201ca clear recognition of the economic problem inherent in the MIT system and a suggested solution of that problem by the separation of the MIT system into components capable of being performed at different locations.\u201d Recognizing that the separation which Parsons describes is at the point where the data has been applied digitally to the punched tape rather than at the later point where appellant separates the system, the board further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-9\">\u201c * * * Once the separation of the MIT system had been suggested, it would appear to us that one skilled in the art would be led to consider other possible points of separation in order to concentrate as much of the system as possible at the central organization referred to by Parsons. We believe it would be obvious to the skilled worker that the point on the MIT system which would permit the maximum concentration of equipment at the central organization would be immediately prior to the machine tool. With the disclosure of Livingston et al. before him we are of the opinion that one skilled in the art would have the suggestion of effecting this separation of the MIT system by the use of magnetizable tape, wherein the electrical impulse trains of the MIT system would magnetize the tape of Livingston et al. and the magnetized tape used to control the machine tool in the manner disclosed by Livingston et al.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">We find no error in the board\u2019s position. It is our opinion that appellant has done no more than modify the MIT system in a manner that would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art in view of the Parsons publication and the Livingston et al. patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Appellant\u2019s affidavits showing that his process has enjoyed commercial success have been considered. Although commercial success may be relevant in a doubtful case of patentability, it may not be used to create a doubt on the question where none would otherwise exist. In re Coey et al., 190 F.2d 347, 38 CCPA 1200. We agree with the board that appellant has done nothing more than would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in this particular field at the time the alleged invention was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
