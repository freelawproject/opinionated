The first die has a cross-sectional configuration such that the working faces form a \u201cV\u201d shape. The second die fits within, and is embraced by, portions of the \u201cV\u201d shaped working faces of the first die. The cross-sectional configuration of the second die has a \u201cW\u201d shape so that the outer sides of the \u201cW\u201d are at the same angle as the sides of the \u201cV\u201d in the first die.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">The Hughes, Bergan and Hennessey patents were relied on by the board only to show that it is well known to make crimped connections \u201cbetween relatively soft metals by the approach of comparable metal parts.\u201d They need not be discussed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">The sole reference relied on by the examiner and the board to reject the claims is the Hebert patent. Hebert relates to die stocks and in particular to \u201cjaws\u201d or guide members which keep the work piece in proper alignment during a threading operation. The jaws consist of two elements which have the same cross-sectional configuration as appellant\u2019s dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">In affirming the examiner, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">\u201cWe have compared appellant\u2019s disclosed die conformations with the work contacting members 6, 7 of Hebert and see no distinguishing contour or essential differences in force of application, proportion, or strength requirements. It appears to us that claim 15 recites no more than the disclosed pair of mating elements found both in appellant\u2019s drawings and at 6, 7 in Hebert. Under such circumstances we share the examiner\u2019s view that no structurally novel apparatus is presented and patentability cannot be predicated upon a mere new use of old devices. * * * <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">Appellant contends that the board erroneously thought that Hebert\u2019s \u201cjaws\u201d were, in fact, dies. We cannot agree with that contention. Although the board did make a single reference to \u201cthe die 6 of Hebert,\u201d we find that, reading the decision as a whole, the board did not consider the jaws to be dies <em>per se </em>but rather to be elements whose structure is substantially the same as the structure of appellant\u2019s dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">Appellant also contends that his \u201cdie\u201d and Hebert\u2019s \u201cguide jaw\u201d are entirely different and distinct elements. However, as pointed out in the solicitor\u2019s brief, the term \u201cdie\u201d implies both structure and use and the differences between the \u201cdie\u201d and the \u201cjaw\u201d here lie in their use, not in their structure. The physical structures are identical, as can be seen from even a cursory examination of the drawings of the respective elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-21\">Further, appellant contends that the board \u201cinferentially combined nonanalogous art\u201d by referring to the Bergan, Hughes and Hennessey patents. We do not agree with that contention. The sole reference made to those patents, as noted above, was in the nature of setting forth a fact well known in the art. The references were not applied to any portion of the structure of appellant\u2019s dies. We note that the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-22\">\u201cIn arguing the rejection at page 3 of the answer the examiner states that the rejection is upon Hebert and not upon a combination of references. The examiner\u2019s position is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that Hebert discloses all structural features designated by the rejected claims and that patentability is not established by a new use for [an] old structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Finally, appellant points out that only his second die need be changed if larger or smaller work-pieces are utilized whereas the prior art required a change of both dies. He further states that Hebert does not disclose that feature. In disposing of that contention we need only look to appellant\u2019s claims which state in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201c * * * <em>whereby </em>the first die will accommodate any one of a plurality of mating dies over a range of sizes to form a confined symmetrical crimped connection having a plurality of equal sides.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Such a clause does not distinguish over Hebert\u2019s jaw which, it appeal\u2019s, could also \u201caccommodate any one of a plurality of mating\u201d elements if that were desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
