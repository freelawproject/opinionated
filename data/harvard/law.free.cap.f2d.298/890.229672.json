Mrs. Green worked at Sears, Roebuck and Company in Dayton and commuted, Mr. Green maintained a small office in Greenville in his mother-in-law\u2019s home. His entire business for the years in question was in Dayton, Ohio where he utilized telephone answering services and places for receiving mail. His stationery and cards, in the main, listed Dayton, Ohio as his headquarters for business. During each year in question he spent 300 days in Dayton, traveling otherwise for which he did get deductions, and was at his residence a very few days. His whole activities in business and his places of lodging and eating during these years were in Dayton \u2014 only incidentally was he in Greenville. He claims the expenses for board and lodging in Dayton as deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-21\"> The subsection of Internal Revenue Code relied upon by petitioners concerns deductions for traveling expenses which include .meals and lodging. Traveling connotes moving from place to place and the deductions are for transportation expense and meals and lodging while so traveling. Mr. Green was in Dayton all the period of time for which he claims deductions. The evidence reveals that his business headquarters in Dayton was indefinite and indeterminate. His situation is not within the concept of the allowable deductions for traveling expense. Commissioner v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203; Peurifoy v. Commissioner, 358 U.S. 59, 79 S.Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">In any event we decide this case in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions from a district court in a trial without a jury. [26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7482].</p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">From the undisputed facts, the Tax Court ruled that the petitioners were not entitled to deductions for the years in question for traveling expense under said section 162(a) (2) of the Internal Reve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>nue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 162(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The factual findings of the Tax Court must stand unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d This rule applies to factual inferences from undisputed basic facts. Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">We conclude that the findings of the Tax Court were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
