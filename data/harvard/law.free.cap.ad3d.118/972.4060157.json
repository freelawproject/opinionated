The defendants established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing those causes of action by adducing evidence demonstrating that they did not knowingly induce or participate in any breach of fiduciary duty allegedly perpetrated by the president of the plaintiff\u2019s general partner against the plaintiff <em>(see Roni LLC v Arfa, </em>15 NY3d 826 [2010]; <em>Baron v Galasso, </em>83 AD3d 626 [2011]; <em>Global Mins. &amp; Metals Corp. v Holme, </em>35 AD3d 93, 101 [2006]; <em>Kaufman v Cohen, </em>307 AD2d 113, 125 [2003]). In opposition to this prima facie showing, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320, 324 [1986]).</p><p id=\"b728-10\">For the same reasons, the plaintiff failed to establish its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the subject causes of action.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
