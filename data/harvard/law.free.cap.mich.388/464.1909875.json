This act provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u00abN0 * * * policy * * * shall be delivered * * * unless coverage is provided therein * * * for the protection of persons insured thereunder * * * in limits * * * set forth in [the Motor Vehicle Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] * * * unless the named insured rejects such coverage in writing * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The general question in each of these cases is the extent to which the above statute allows a person injured in an accident by an uninsured motorist to recover on more than one so-called \"other insurance\u201d policy where the damages suffered exceed the limits of one or both policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The particular issues in this case are:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">I. Does the specific language of the \"other insurance\u201d limitation against recovery on other insurance policies as well as the primary policy in the uninsured motorist coverage apply to the facts of the instant case?</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>II. If so, does 1965 PA 388; MCLA 500.3010; MSA 24.13010 invalidate such \"other insurance\u201d limitation? Specifically, can the insured guest passenger of an insured host driver, who is injured in an accident through the fault of an uninsured motorist, combine recoveries <em>(i.e. </em>stack or pyramid) from the two different insurance companies which covered the guest passenger and host driver in excess of the limitation provisions?</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">On August 27, 1966, Jerome Blakeslee was riding as a guest passenger in the car of the host driver and owner Bernard Butcher. A collision occurred between the host driver and an uninsured motorist. The guest passenger suffered fatal, injuries in the automobile collision. The host driver had uninsured motorist liability coverage through Riverside Insurance Company providing benefits of $10,000 payable for injuries to or death of one person occupying the automobile. The guest passenger had a similar policy issued by defendant Farm Bureau which covered the insured while riding as a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Decedent\u2019s wife, in her capacity as the administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate, instituted suit against the driver of the uninsured automobile, to recover damages resulting from the alleged wrongful death of Jerome Blakeslee. She recovered on her suit in the amount of $112,007.71 with a' reduction upon the judgment in the amount of $18,300 as monies received by the administratrix under the host driver\u2019s policy and from the Michigan Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund. The net judgment against the driver of the uninsured vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>cle was, therefore, $93,707.71.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Subsequent to the judgment against the uninsured motorist, plaintiff administratrix brought suit against defendant Farm Bureau seeking recovery of the $10,000 uninsured motorist coverage provided for in the policy issued to decedent. The cause was submitted to the circuit court before the Honorable Donald L. Reisig. Defendant denied liability based upon an \"other insurance\u201d limitation contained in the policy which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\"Other Insurance: With respect to bodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile not owned by the named insured, the insurance under Part IV shall apply only as excess insurance over any similar insurance available to such insured and applicable to such automobile as primary insurance, and this insurance shall then apply only in the amount by which the limit of liability for this coverage exceeds the applicable limit of liability of such other insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\"Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph if the insured has other similar insurance available to him and applicable to the accident, the damages shall be deemed not to exceed the higher of the applicable limits of liability of this insurance and such other insurance, and the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss to which this coverage applies than the limit of liability hereunder bears to the sum of the applicable limits of liability of this insurance and such other insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Judge Reisig held that this \"other insurance\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>limitation conflicted with the plain language of the uninsured motorist statute and thus was invalid and entered judgment for plaintiff administratrix for the full sum of $10,000. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, finding that the insurer was no longer free, as he had been prior to the statute, to insert language restricting the coverage to less than the statute requires. 32 Mich App 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The limiting language of the other insurance provision of decedent guest passenger\u2019s policy issued to him by the defendant appears to definitely cover a guest passenger insured in a third-party host driver\u2019s car. The relevant language of the policy is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\"Other Insurance: * * * while occupying an automobile not owned by the named insured, the insurance * * * shall apply only as excess insurance over any similar insurance available to such insured and applicable to such automobile as primary insurance * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Defendant claims nonliability because of this limitation, and cites our decision in <em>Horr v Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, </em>379 Mich 562 (1967) as controlling in not allowing stacking. In <em>Horr, </em>this Court held that the \"other insurance\u201d limitation clauses in two separate policies of insurance required pro-rata contribution by the two insurance companies, but only until a total of $10,000, the maximum average contained in each policy had been paid to the claimant. Thus, each insurance company could be held liable for only $5,000, no matter how large the claimant\u2019s damages were.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The <em>Horr </em>decision is clearly distinguishable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The accident which gave rise to the controversy in <em>Horr </em>occurred in 1963 when there were no statutes requiring the inclusion of an offer of uninsured motorist coverage in policies of insurance. This Court specifically did not take MCLA 500.3010; MSA 24.13010 and MCLA 257.504(d); MSA 9.2204(d) into consideration in arriving at our decision in <em>Horr. </em>The Court noted this in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\"We find no statutory or decisional law of this State applicable in 1963 to the insurance clauses requiring our interpretation and the parties assert there were none. Consequently, our task is limited to determining the intent of the contracting parties.\u201d <em>Horr, supra, </em>566.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Thus, the disposition of this case turns on the effect of 1965 PA 388; MCLA 500.3010; MSA 24.13010 on the \"other insurance\u201d limitation in defendant\u2019s policy. In other words, does the \"other insurance\u201d limitation contravene the policy of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Though a matter of first impression with this Court, several other jurisdictions have considered the problem in interpreting similar uninsured mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>torist statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cases are divided. There are 19 states plus 1 Federal case applying state law which disallow such limitations as contrary to the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There are eight states with a contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>doctrine but only three of them are directly on point \u2014 in three there is no uninsured motorist statute involved, in two the statute itself allows prorating.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This leaves a heavy preponderance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>favor of disallowing such limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The trend of the most recent decisions where an uninsured motorist statute is involved is toward allowing stacking <em>(i.e. </em>voiding \"other insurance\u201d clauses). This is persuasive but not decisive. Determinative must be the apparent policy of the Michigan Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Defendant argues that \"the purpose of the statute in making uninsured motorist coverage compulsory * * * is to give the same protection to a person injured by an uninsured motorist as he would have if he had been injured in an accident caused by an automobile covered by a standard liability insurance policy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We are unable to accept defendant\u2019s construction of the statute. The language of the statute is plain, unambiguous and <em>mandatory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">It unequivocally requires that \"[n]o * * * policy * * * be delivered * * * unless coverage is provided therein\u201d. Stated in the affirmative, <em>every </em>policy <em>must have </em>this coverage. Only after the mandatory offer is made can the insured reject it in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Nowhere in the statute does the Legislature attempt to fix any maximum amount of recovery less than the amount of the loss. The lack of proration language in the statute is conspicuous and can only weigh in favor of an inference of allowing stacking recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">As was said in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Co v Murphy, </em>226 Ga 710, 714; 177 SE2d 257, 260 (1970), \"The statute is designed to protect the insured as to his actual loss, within the limits of the policy or policies of which he is the beneficiary\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>It would be unconscionable to permit an insurance company offering statutorily required coverage to collect premiums for it with one hand and allow it to take the coverage away with the other by using a self-devised \"other insurance\u201d limitation. Nothing could more clearly defeat the intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">As Judge Levin convincingly argued, concurring in <em>Collins v Motorists Mutual Insurance Co, </em>36 Mich App 424, 435-436 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\"Read in conjunction with the motor vehicle accident claims act it is apparent that the legislative purpose in adding \u00a7 3010 to the insurance code * * * was to reduce claims against the fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\"Having in mind that legislative purpose, it is clear that allowing insurance carriers to eliminate or reduce their liability in situations where the insured person has or can recover under other insurance would be contrary to the intent of the Legislature and on that ground I agree with my colleagues that an 'other insurance\u2019 clause is invalid to the extent of the statutorily required $10,000/$20,000 uninsured motorist insurance protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Given this clear purpose and the mandatory language of the statute, such language must be read into those provisions of a policy of insurance that differ or vary from the statutory language.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Defendant fails to properly differentiate between reducing insured\u2019s loss and escaping liability. Under the statute, a payment to decedent\u2019s estate from other sources merely reduces the loss of the injured party and not the $10,000 liability of dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>dent\u2019s insurer. \"If an insured\u2019s loss has been totally compensated by other insurance he is no longer 'legally entitled\u2019 to recover damages.\u201d <em>Collins, supra, </em>432-433. That is, the insured may pyramid recovery until his judicially determined loss has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">If this Court allowed an insured to recover amounts above his actual loss, only then would the insured reap an unjust windfall. This, clearly, is not our holding. The only windfall in this case would be that going to defendant if it were allowed to charge premiums for coverage it would not deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We believe that the rule stated in <em>Safeco Ins Co of America v Jones, </em>286 Ala 606, 614; 243 So 2d 736, 742 (1970) represents the better reasoning as well as the majority rule, which we now adopt. There the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\"We hold that our statute sets a minimum amount for recovery, but it does not place a limit on the total amount of recovery so long as that amount does not exceed the amount of the actual loss; that where the loss exceeds the limit of one policy, the insured may proceed under other available policies; and that where the premiums have been paid for uninsured motorist coverage, we cannot permit an insurer to avoid its statutorily imposed liability by its insertion into the policy of a liability limiting clause which restricts the insured from receiving that coverage for which the premium has been paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed with all costs going to the plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b673-8\">T.
