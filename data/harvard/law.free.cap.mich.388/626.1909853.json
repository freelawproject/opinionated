The opinion heretofore rendered is reaffirmed without change. However, the following is added thereto for the purpose of clarification. Where the county is authorized under appropriate statute to be a \"borrower\u201d (unlike present Act 31) then the computation of the county\u2019s indebtedness as a borrower would at any time equal the outstanding principal plus accrued payable interest.</p>\n<judges id=\"b826-7\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams and Swain-son, JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b826-8\">Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOY\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I would deny these applications, without expatiation.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b826-9\">T. E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOR0\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I would deny the application without further comment. It is patently contradictory to \"reaffirm without change,\u201d and then change the opinion by adding four lines \"for clarification.\u201d It was my view that the original opinion badly muddied the waters of municipal finance in Michigan. I tried in vain to dissuade the Bench from its course. Having made a mistake, and being unwilling to undo it, we ought at least have the consistency to stick by it.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>T. G. Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWq8\"><em>(dissenting). </em>When we decided this case we held that the Detroit Stadium Bonds were not revenue bonds within the definitions of MCLA 123.951 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.301(1) <em>et seq., </em>and MCLA 141.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2731 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">I signed the majority opinion because I was (and am) persuaded that this is the correct holding on this, the only point necessary to decision of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The profession, should be reminded that the office of obiter dicta is usually to illustrate the holding of the case and not to decide the other points discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">From the petitions for rehearing and clarification in this case it is apparent that such obiter dicta has confused, rather than assisted the profession, and for this reason I favor granting rehearing or the issuance of a limited opinion to eliminate the confusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
