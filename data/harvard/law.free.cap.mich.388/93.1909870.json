So was <em>People v Ayers, </em>182 Mich 241 (1914), another unitary decision. <em>Gengels, Trzil </em>and <em>Ayers </em>were prosecutions for statutory rape. <em>Ayers </em>cited and followed <em>People v Davis, </em>175 Mich 594 (1913); a prosecution of male and female for <em>adultery </em>The following quotation, taken from <em>Ayers, </em>discloses fairly the primary reason for reversal of the <em>Ayers </em>and <em>Da vis </em>convictions (pp 243-244):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\"The following question was asked by the prosecution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">\" 'Did he have intercourse with you after you knew you were in the family way?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\"An objection to this was overruled, and she answered 'Yes.\u2019 This ruling was error. <em>People v </em>Davis, 175 Mich. 594 (141 N.W. 667), and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The apparent if not actual conflict between <em>Gen-gels </em>and <em>Trzil </em>on the one hand, and <em>Ayers </em>and <em>Davis </em>on the other, led to our order granting leave to review the instant defendant\u2019s conviction for statutory rape (385 Mich 778).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Conceding that there is room for doubt, not of clarity of the recorded writings of our distinguished predecessors but of the selectively rightful occasions for evidentiary employment thereof, our reports show that trial judges have experienced near to an approximate century of difficulty in determining when and when not the relevant rulings of the Court, starting with <em>People v Jenness, </em>5 Mich 305, 319-325 (1858),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Upon reading Justice Fellows\u2019 opinion of <em>People v Rice, </em>206 Mich 644, 650-658 (1919), one might well have concluded that all such misgivings had been brought to a prosperous conclusion. The opinion was endorsed by the entire Court. In my view the language employed was deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>designed to enlarge a known exception to the \"well established\u201d general rule; such rule being \"that upon trial for felony the prosecution will not be permitted to give evidence tending to establish the guilt of defendant of another distinct and independent crime.\u201d (p 650.) Whatever our thoughts in such regard, it is readily perceivable that <em>People v Rice </em>was \u2014 languagewise and otherwise \u2014 the forerunner of that which was enacted as part of the criminal code of 1927, No 175, ch VIII, \u00a7 27, p 321 (1929 CL 17320; MCLA 768.27; MSA 28.1050). The section has remained unchanged ever since. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\"Sec. 27. In any criminal case where the defendant\u2019s motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing an act, is material, any like acts or other acts of the defendant which may tend to show his motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing the act, in question, may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto; notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another or prior or subsequent crime by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Justices of the Court who were \"around\u201d when the Code of 1927 was drafted, debated and enacted, not Justices seated 40-odd years later, presumably knew best the legislative purpose of section 27 of chapter VIII.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1934 they wrote of one mind, regarding what is now \u00a7 768.27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\"The object of the statute above quoted was to make testimony relevant which might otherwise not be so; to broaden the scope of inquiry as to similar transactions; to make relevant evidence of transactions which in the absence of the statute would not be relevant. Ordinarily a witness may not be impeached upon questions relating to a separate and distinct offense at another time and place. A witness may not be impeached upon a collateral issue. <em>Mills v Warner, </em>167 Mich. 619 [1911]. But the purpose and object of the statute above quoted was to do away with the rule as to proof of other offenses and permit the introduction of such testimony even though it might show or tend to show the commission of another prior or subsequent offense by defendant.\u201d <em>(People v Rose, </em>268 Mich 529, 535-536 [1934].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Upon strength of \u00a7 768.27 I vote to affirm. The subsequent acts were admissible as tending to prove the defendants\u2019 \"scheme, plan or system in doing an act\u201d which the testimonial record \u2014 if believed by the jury \u2014 portrays vividly. It was simply that of arranging a marriage between the male defendant and underage Jacqueline so that the whole family might live better, in defendant Smith\u2019s house, in a financial way.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-5\">Adams, T. E. Brennan, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred with Black, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b295-6\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. G. Kavanagh, J. concurred in the result.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> Justice Christiancy commenced his discussion <em>(Jenness </em>at 320):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">\"The general rule in criminal cases is well settled, that the commission of other, though similar offenses, by the defendant, can not be proved for the purpose of showing that he was more likely to have committed the offense for which he is on trial, nor as corroborating the testimony relating to the commission of such principal offense. But the courts in several of the states have shown a disposition to relax the rule in cases where the offense consists of illicit intercourse between the sexes; and it is principally to the American cases that we are to look for authorities upon this subject, as such intercourse is not generally rendered criminal in England, or prosecuted by indictment; being only of ecclesiastical cognizance.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> We have agreed, unanimously <em>(Husted v Consumers Power Co, </em>376 Mich 41, 54 [1965]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\"Bearing in mind that legislative intent is determinable properly by what was at the time of enactment, rather than what might appear a half century later \u2014 by hindsight <em>(Wayne County Road Commissioners v Wayne County Clerk, 293 </em>Mich 229, 235 <em>[1940]; Platt v Union Pacific R. Co, </em>99 US 48, 63-64 [25 L Ed 424] [1878]; 50 Am Jur, Statutes, \u00a7 236, p 224), we depend much upon what members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Court wrote at the time of or shortly after enactment of statutory provisions which, considered then as to purpose and intent, have remained unamended in substance (see comment, <em>Dyer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>350 Mich 92, 95 [1957]).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
