The prosecution sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>impeach one of the alibi witnesses by showing that the witness had made a prior inconsistent statement to one Taylor, a detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">During the cross-examination of the alibi witness, one King, a foundation for the admission of the prior inconsistent statement was laid \u2014 that is to say King was asked if he had made the prior statement, and he denied having made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The making of the prior inconsistent statement being put in issue, Taylor was called to establish that the prior inconsistent statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\"><em>\"Q. </em>Can you tell me what Mr. King told you that evening relating to the facts in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\"><em>\"A. </em>Mr. King related to me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\"><em>\"Mr. Sherman [counsel for defendant]: </em>That would be hearsay, Your Honor.

He didn\u2019t say it was the first time, he said it was when he took this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-22\"><em>\u201dMr. Sherman: </em>I wanted to find out whether he has taken other statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-23\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Court: </em>That would be the subject of cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-24\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>(By Mr. Sherman) Where was this statement taken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-25\"><em>\u201dA. </em>This statement was taken at 2249 South Electric in the City of Detroit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>\u201dQ. </em>And had you acknowledged ever taking a statement from Mr. King to me before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><em>\"A. </em>I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did Mr. King sign that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\"><em>\u201dA. </em>No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And whose handwriting is that statement in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\"><em>\u201dA. </em>This is my handwriting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did you ask Mr. King to sign that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\"><em>\u2019A. </em>Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And he refused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\"><em>'A. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\"><em>\"Mr. Sherman: </em>I have nothing further but I object to the use of that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\"><em>\"The Court: </em>On what grounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\"><em>\"Mr. Sherman: </em>On the grounds that the statement is solely hearsay given out of the presence of the Defendant, unsigned, uncooperative in any respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\"><em>\u201dThe Court: </em>It isn\u2019t offered in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-17\"><em>\u2019Mr. Sherman: </em>Well, it is being offered by impeachment, Your Honor, and there is no basis for the admission of this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-18\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Court: </em>It isn\u2019t offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-19\"><em>\u201dMr. Sherman: </em>Well, he is asking him to read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-20\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Court: </em>That\u2019s present recollection, the classic case of present recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-21\">\"Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-22\"><em>\u201dMr. Bianco: </em>Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-23\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Witness: </em>This is the statement of Samuel King taken by Detective Charles Taylor at 2249 South Electric, Detroit, Michigan. Time: 1:30 A.M. Saturday, June 14, 1969: T went to the game that night. I saw Larry there but it wasn\u2019t until after the game. Anyway, the game was over I don\u2019t know what time it was but Larry did not go to the Castle with me. We were parked in the Castle parking lot. Larry might have come over sometime during the time he was at the Castle and got in my car and got right back out but he didn\u2019t go to the Castle with me. They told me to say that he was with me but I told them I wasn\u2019t going to lie for them and I didn\u2019t want to get involved.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\"That is what he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\"><em>\"Mr. Bianco: </em>You realize you\u2019re still under oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\"><em>\"The Witness: Yes, </em>sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\"><em>\"Mr. Bianco: </em>And that\u2019s what he told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\"><em>\"The Witness: </em>Yes, sir.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The written memorandum was read to the jury. This constituted its admission in evidence. This was error. The writing was prepared by the Detective Taylor, out of court and was not signed by the witness King. The writing was hearsay. It was an extrajudicial statement (by Taylor) offered to prove the truth of the thing said (that King had spoken the words imputed to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">There was nothing to prevent Taylor from testifying verbally. He could have related his conversation with King. If he could not recall the conversation, he could have been shown the memorandum to refresh his memory. If he could not then testify without the aid of the memorandum, the written memorandum might then have been introduced in evidence and read to the jury provided a proper foundation was laid. <em>Jaxon v City of </em>Detroit, <em>Department of Street Railways, </em>379 Mich 405, 413 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Under the circumstances here, the writing was inadmissible. The dissenting opinion of Judge Levin in the Court of Appeals contains an exhaustive analysis. We adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b717-13\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams, T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred with T. E. Brennan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b717-14\">Black, J., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
