All defendants, General Motors excepted, were dismissed with prejudice. Trial against General Motors ended with rendition of an instructed negative verdict and entry of a negative judgment. Division 2 affirmed (28 Mich App 7). Other than as amplified in the ensuing opinion, counsel for General Motors have supplied a generally satisfactory statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\"Michael McDonough, a journeyman iron worker employed by Paragon Bridge &amp; Steel Company, was killed on October 3, 1963 in a construction accident at the Chevrolet assembly plant in Flint. His employer had contracted to erect the structural steel framework for an additional floor which was to be built above the then-existing plant. Sometime before the day of the accident, Paragon had installed several steel trusses which were to become part of the structure. At the time of the accident, Mr. McDonough was standing on one of these trusses. The Paragon crew of which he was a member had just completed the erection and rigging of a stiff-legged derrick, owned by Paragon, which was to be used to lift steel beams onto the roof of the plant. It was then late in the afternoon and it appeared that the derrick would not be used until the following morning. Following the customary practice in the industry, the crew proceeded to tie the boom of the derrick to a permanent truss in order to secure it for the night. While Mr. McDonough was bending under the boom attempting to secure it to the truss the boom fell, due either to careless operation of the derrick or faulty installation of the boom cable. It struck him and ca\u00fcsed serious injuries which resulted in his death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Division 2 did not meet squarely plaintiff\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>peal to the exception which, by our decisions, has been engrafted into the general rule of nonliability of an owner-contractee, when the work contracted for by him is \"inherently dangerous\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For an up to date statement of the exception, see <em>Vannoy v City of Warren, </em>15 Mich App 158, 163-164 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\"In Michigan the inherently or intrinsically dangerous activity doctrine is founded upon a theory which is closely akin to, but not exactly the same as, strict liability. The principle is applied 'where a duty is imposed upon the employer in doing work necessarily involving danger to others, unless great care is used, to make such provision against negligence as may be commensurate with the obvious danger. It is this duty which cannot be delegated to another so as to avoid liability for its neglect.\u2019 <em>Inglis v Millersburg Driving Association </em>(1912), 169 Mich 311, 321, 322.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The <em>Inglis </em>decision seems to mark the first occasion when this Court applied the exception to facts tending to show that the work contracted for was inherently dangerous or perilous. In that case the Court approved expressly an extended passage taken from <em>Covington, etc, Bridge Co v Steinbrock &amp; Patrick, </em>61 Ohio St 215; 55 NE 618; 76 Am St Rep 375 (1899), and then went on to conclude <em>(Inglis </em>at 321-322):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\"The principle involved cannot be better stated than it is in the sentence last quoted, <em>supra. </em>It is not applied to those cases where the injuries occur which are collateral to the employment, like the dropping of material by the servant of a contractor upon a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>passing by, but where a duty is imposed upon the employer in doing work necessarily involving danger to others, unless great care is used, to make such provision against negligence as may be commensurate with the obvious danger. It is this duty which cannot be delegated to another so as to avoid liability for its neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Subsequent cases following <em>Inglis </em>and applying its rule are <em>Huntley v Motor Wheel Corp, </em>31 Mich App 385, 393 (1971); <em>Vannoy v City of Warren, </em>15 Mich App 158, 163-164 (1968); <em>Utley v Taylor &amp; Gaskin, Inc, </em>305 Mich 561, 572 (1943); <em>Grinnell v Carbide Chemicals Corp, </em>282 Mich 509, 527 (1937); <em>Watkins v Gabriel Steel Co, </em>260 Mich 692, 695 (1932), and <em>Wight v H G. Christman Co, </em>244 Mich 208, 215 (1928). Probably the best statement of the mentioned exception to the general rule, succinct and specific as always when written by Mr. Justice Cooley, was quoted in <em>Inglis </em>(from 2 Cooley on Torts, 3d ed, p 1091):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\"If I employ a contractor to do a job of work for me which, in the progress of its execution, obviously exposes others to unusual perils, I ought, I think, to be responsible, * * * for I cause acts to be done which naturally expose others to injury.\u201d <em>(Inglis </em>at p 319.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The foregoing Michigan rule is echoed now by 2 Restatement of Torts 2d, particularly sections 416 and 427 (pp 395 and 415 respectively):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\"416. One who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create during its progress a peculiar risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the failure of the contractor to exercise reasonable care to take such precautions, even though the employer has provided for such precautions in the contract or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\"427. One who employs an independent contractor to do work involving a special danger to others which the employer knows or has reason to know to be inherent in or normal to the work, or which he contemplates or has reason to contemplate when making the contract, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to such others by the contractor\u2019s failure to take reasonable precautions against such danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The first question is whether plaintiff made out, as against defendant General Motors\u2019 motion below, a case which tended to show that this contract of construction involved \"danger to others unless great care is used\u201d and that defendant General Motors failed to see that such \"great care\u201d attended execution of the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We think she did, and that the issue of actionable negligence as charged in the first count of her complaint was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">True, plaintiff bore a burden of legal persuasion that was, by the very nature of the stated rule and its exception, much heavier than obtains in the typical case where ordinary negligence is charged. There must be proof or inference from proof, not only of contracted work that is inherently dangerous, but also proof or inference from proof that \"great care\u201d was not used. We hold that such proof was supplied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Generally, and as already known by comparing the ever steepening rates of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance, judicial notice may be taken that the assigned task of overhead riggers and assemblers of heavy steel beams and shapes is usually fraught with out-of-ordinary danger to such employees as well as others. Taking such notice, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>prima facie apparent (but no more than that) that the job called for by this contract had to be performed with \"great care\u201d lest employees \u2014 not only of Paragon but of Chevrolet workmen below \u2014 be or become endangered by such performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Promptly taken photographs of the scene of this fatal accident were received in evidence. They provide striking proof of the inherently dangerous character of this contracted steel construction job. The crew was not framing a new building. It was framing a new floor and new roof over an existing floor and roof of a great manufacturing plant, with work proceeding below as before. The risk on favorable view was that much greater, for it extended to more workmen than those employed by the independent contractor. Had the boom of Paragon\u2019s derrick, which the crew had just lengthened from 50 feet to 60 feet, <em>not </em>fallen partly across the closest of the trussed girders which the crew had fastened into place, it is not unlikely that the boom or some heavy part thereof would have crashed through or partly through the original roof of the plant, beneath which Chevrolet workmen presumably were at work or, considering the time of day, were coming and going between shifts. When the wrong sized cable,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which through a succession of sheaves connected the drum of the derrick with the end of the boom, snapped and dropped the boom, the outer end of the latter caught on and was held by the girder; a fact we regard as fortunate for all nearby, plaintiffs decedent excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>We do <em>not </em>say that the mentioned exception applies here <em>as a matter of law </em>or, for that matter, that it applies <em>as a matter of law </em>to other like cases. We say only that the evidence adduced warranted submission of the question of liability as charged, under the rule of <em>Inglis </em>and subsequent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">General Motors however claims immunity from liability under two provisions of the construction contract. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">\"11. <em>Contractor\u2019s Responsibility: </em>The Contractor shall be responsible for his work and every part thereof and for all materials, tools, appliances and property of every description used in connection therewith. The Contractor shall assume all risks of damage or injury to property or persons used or employed on or in connection with the work, and of all damage or injury to any persons or property wherever located, resulting from any action or operation under the Contract or in connection with the work, and shall protect, defend and save harmless the Owner from and against all claims on account of any such damage or injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\"30. <em>Protection of Premises and Persons: </em>The Contractor shall take all necessary precautions, provide barricades, guards, signs, notices, and such protection as may be required by laws and regulations for the protection of the Owner\u2019s and other Contractors\u2019 property, as well as adjacent property, on both new and existing work. By such provisions, the Contractor shall also protect all persons who may be on the premises or in adjacent areas affected by the Contractors\u2019 operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The exception we have considered precludes matter-of-law employment of these allegedly ex-emptive contractual provisions. As said regularly in the cited authorities, the owner \"cannot escape this duty by turning the whole performance over to a contractor\u201d; nor can he delegate that duty \"so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>as to avoid liability for its neglect\u201d. The decedent was not a party to the contract and neither he nor his personal representative became bound thereby. Hence, the most that may be said for such provisions is that they may or may not, as between the contracting parties, have provided some right of indemnity or contribution should General Motors be held to respond in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A separate question is raised and briefed. Since the case is to go back for retrial, we should and do consider it. Plaintiff states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">\"Does an employer of a contractor doing major building construction who retains the right to control the safety performance, methods and program, enjoy immunity from suit for the negligent exercise of that control?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">General Motors counterstates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">\"Does a property owner, who contracts to have construction work performed on his property and who does not retain control over the methods and procedures of a subcontractor, owe a duty of due care to protect an employee of the subcontractor from injury caused by the careless installation, use or the improper condition of the subcontractor\u2019s own equipment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">The questions thus stated and counterstated are of course argumentative. We think the issue may be couched best by inquiring whether, by what is contractually designated as the \"Architect-Engineer\u2019s Supervision\u201d, General Motors provided for such measure of control over the conduct of the work, by its architect-engineer, as might or did create the same jury question as the Court found in <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, </em>39 Mich 492 (1878); a decision we shall presently review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Exhibit 53a sets forth General Motors\u2019 \"Structural Steel\u201d specifications. These specifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>were drafted for General Motors by its architectural firm, Albert Kahn Associated Architects and Engineers, Inc. The architect-engineer was General Motors\u2019 overall administrator of the construction job as contracted. His legal position was, the contract documents considered, poised delicately\u2014 and ambiguously \u2014 between that of a general superintendent of major construction, and that of a mere consultant having no right to interfere or duty other than of advice. Consider his \"status\u201d (Exhibit 53a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><em>\"Architect-Engineer Status: </em>The Contractor agrees the Architect-Engineer and his representative shall have access to the work at all times and that the Architect-Engineer shall have the right to act in any and all of the various capacities assigned to him under the Contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\"The administration, inspection, assistance and other actions by the Architect-Engineer or the Architect-Engineer\u2019s Superintendent, as hereinbefore provided, shall not be construed as undertaking supervisory control of the construction work or of means and methods employed by' the Contractor, and shall not relieve the Owner or the Contractor from any of their responsibilities or obligations under the Contract; nor shall the Owner or the Contractor request or require the Architect-Engineer or the Architect-Engineer\u2019s Superintendent to undertake such supervisory control or to administrate, supervise, inspect, assist or to act in any manner so as to relieve the Owner or the Contractor from such responsibilities or obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Between the two extremes thus forensically submitted lies the correct answer, review here being that of grant of motion for direction of a negative verdict. General Motors did <em>not </em>as a matter of law, retain \"control\u201d. Nor can it be said, as a matter of law, that General Motors retained such \"control\u201d. We have here a mixed question of fact and law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>determinable as usual in these cases by due interpretation and application of factual testimony, expert testimony and \u2014 particularly here \u2014 contract documents which on account of the very length thereof are likely to be susceptible of variant conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Having pored over 470 pages of contract documents forming a part of the original record,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and having done so in conjunction with a mass of testimony adduced by plaintiff having to do with what in the record is known as General Motors\u2019 \"Safety Program\u201d, one certain conclusion comes to the surface. It is that General Motors, drafter of all these contract documents, did upon view favorable to plaintiff reserve a measure of firm control over the job to be done for it by Paragon, and that it then (again on favorable view) attempted to water the legal stock of that conclusion by the quoted \"Architect-Engineer Status\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">An owner contracting to have construction work done on his property cannot reserve to himself \"[t]he administration, inspection, assistance and other actions\u201d which do or may authorize some measure of influence or dominion over the way the work is to be done, and yet maintain as a matter of law that such reservation \"shall not be construed\u201d as undertaking supervisory control of the work \"or the means and methods employed by the Contractor\u201d. When a statutory action (MCLA 413.15; MSA 17.189) is brought by one not a party to such an Owner-Contractor \"Agreement\u201d, and it is shown either in fact or law that the relationship of employer and employee did not exist between the owner and the plaintiff or personal representative bringing suit, the applied construction of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>agreement is for the court to determine according to its processes; not the drafter of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">For a decision that is closely analogous, both in law and fact, review <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, supra. </em>There as here \"[t]here was no employment relation\u201d between the owner and the plaintiffs decedent. Justice Campbell proceeded (pp 497-498):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\"It is proper first to consider the respective positions of the parties. Day and McEncroe [officers of the mining company] stood in the place of the mining company in making these contracts. There was no employment relation between them and Erickson, who was laboring under the contractors. So far as this changed the relative liabilities of the parties it must operate in this case. But while there are cases in which there is no duty or legal privity between principals and the servants of those who contract with them, this lack of privity is not universal and absolute. If, for example, a railway company were to contract with a firm of car-builders to build cars according to given plans in places under the entire control of the builders, there could be no possible corporate responsibility for injuries received by workmen in their callings. But on the other hand it might be quite possible for men to be employed in piecework in the shops of such companies where they retained more or less control, when for the failure of a corporate duty the workmen or strangers injured by that failure might have a cause of action for the wrong directly against the corporation, although it had not employed them.\u201d (Citing Michigan cases.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\n<em>TO CONCLUDE:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">1. Since the issue may arise on retrial, note is made of plaintiffs alternative contention that the record supports her allegation that General Motors, contracting thus with Paragon, knew or should have known that it had engaged \"an incompetent contractor\u201d. We find in the record no evidence or permissible inference from evidence tend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ing to justify submission to the jury of that alternative theory of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"ASa\">2. To avoid possible interpretation that this opinion affects that type of case mentioned in <em>Inglis, </em>\"where the injuries occur which are collateral to the employment, like the dropping of material by the servant of a contractor upon a person passing by\u201d, the profession is advised that the question of application of the exception to such a case, is expressly reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Reversed and rem\u00e1nded for new trial. Costs of all three courts to plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b644-8\">Black and Swainson, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">SUPPLEMENT, by Justice Black (October 31, 1972):</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">This appeal was duly assigned to me in accordance with the practice of the Court. It was argued March 9, 1972. April 3 I submitted to the Justices a proposed opinion headed \"Per Curiam\u201d which, to the paragraph commencing \"[a] separate question is raised and briefed\u201d <em>(ante 442), </em>remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">That opinion as proposed was amended by the writer August 9, so as to include treatment of the second question above. My August 9 memo to the Justices advised and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">\"The reason for treatment of the second question was my discovery of the uncited case of <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, </em>39 Mich 492 [1878]. I called Justice Brennan\u2019s attention to this case prior to the time he prepared and turned in his opinion, and he has dealt with it according to his views. In addition to this information the Chief Justice says he expects to propose for consideration at our next conference some additional material he deems pertinent both to the <em>Me</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Donough Case </em>and the yet unsubmitted <em>Funk v General Motors Case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\"The foregoing, I believe, will get the case back on schedule so that it may move along.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Now that the day of around-the-table judgment has arrived, it appears that the submitted Per Curiam opinion will make no precedent; hence this explanation to the profession.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> The panel stated what to it was the dispositive issue (28 Mich App 9):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\" * * * whether a property owner, who contracts to have construction work performed on his property and who does not retain control over the methods and procedures of a subcontractor, has an affirmative legal duty to protect an employee of the subcontractor from injury caused by the negligent use by the subcontractor or improper condition of the subcontractor\u2019s equipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> \"Great care\u201d, in cases as at bar, means some sort of a safety precaution program, initiated and maintained by the contracting owner.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5WT\"><em>(concur in part, dissent in part). </em>Although I fully agree with the Per Curiam construction and application of the doctrine of \"inherently dangerous activity,\u201d I am unwilling to foreclose, by exclusive and restrictive reliance upon this doctrine, the applicability to this or future cases of other rules of tort law which affix liability upon the landowner who, for economic benefit or otherwise, engages an independent contractor and then negligently injures an employee of the independent contractor. To base liability of negligent landowners upon a single doctrine ignores the innumerable factual circumstances giving rise to the cause of action and varying relationships of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The doctrine of \"inherently dangerous activity,\u201d as relevant to the type of action brought against a landowner by an injured employee of an independent contractor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has, of course, been recognized in Michigan jurisprudence for nearly 100 years. As concluded by Chief Justice Campbell in <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, </em>39 Mich 492, 502-503 (1878):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\"Under such circumstances it is very plain that the company being the owners of the dangerous property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and inviting men to work on it, their responsibility for its protection cannot be changed by the fact that the work is done by the ton instead of by the day, or by the fact that the men who contract with them have laborers of their own. By employing men to act for them in either way they hold out the assurance that they can work in the mine on the ordinary conditions of safety usually found in such places. They guarantee nothing more than is usual among prudent owners, and they do not insure against that which is purely accidental. But they do tacitly represent that they have not been and will not be reckless themselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The fact that <em>Erickson </em>arose before the advent of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws, as noted by Justice T. E. Brennan\u2019s opinion, is of no consequence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The law and logic of <em>Erickson </em>has, if anything, gained force and recognition with the passage of time and irrespective of enactment of remedial and protective legislation. In <em>Clark v Dalman, </em>379 Mich 251 (1967), we reiterated that the general duty of a contractor who under the facts of that case was constructively in possession and control of the property, \"to act so as not to unreasonably endanger the well-being of employees of either subcontractors or inspectors, or anyone else lawfully on the site of the project, is well settled.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>also 2 Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 27.12, p 1481.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">There is little room for argument with that part of Justice T. E. Brennan\u2019s statement that .\"[t]he rule [of inherent dangerous activity] is not designed, nor was it ever intended to benefit the contractor * * * .\u201d But, it violates logic and established law to conclude that the independent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tractor\u2019s employee \u2014 who after all derives no personal economic benefit, other than that of any ordinary employee, from the contractual relationship between the landowner and his employer \u2014 is relegated to a class outside the protection of negligence law or that the rule of liability is so restrictive as to only \"protect innocent third parties\u201d. To capsulize <em>Clark v Dalman, supra, </em>the rule protects <em>everyone </em>lawfully on the site of the project. Thus, where evidence is adduced demonstrating that work to be done involves \"special danger\u201d or is \"inherently dangerous,\u201d the rule advanced in the Per Curiam opinion and its supporting authorities, <em>e.g., 2 </em>Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 427, is fully applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">On the other hand, I find as quite cogent the reasoning of Justice T. E. Brennan\u2019s opinion, relating to reliance upon the independent contractor\u2019s and likewise his employees\u2019 expertise to perform the job and/or repairs for which they were hired. It is fair to assume that the landowner retains the independent contractor because of the latter\u2019s expertise to perform the task properly and carefully. Absent special factors, such as supervening control by the landowner, the method and means of executing the task are entrusted to the independent contractor and his employees. Thus, there is little basis for shifting liability upon the landowner where for example, and modifying Justice T. E. Brennan\u2019s analogy slightly, the landowner engaged the independent contractor to remove a tree stump and the latter\u2019s employee, while using a chain saw \u2014 certainly a dangerous instrumentality in the hands of the inexperienced \u2014injures himself or another lawfully on the premises. Whether the contractor uses a double-edged ax or cross-cut saw or chain saw, one can presume, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>leaving aside the factors of landowner\u2019s control and direction, that the contractor not only has the familiarity and experience with his tools, but also will use them in such fashion as to avoid injury to himself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The inherently dangerous activity doctrine, however, does not encompass the factual situations presented by the majority of the cases. More typically, the employee of an independent contractor is injured by some cause not arising out of or related to the contractual relationship. This brings to bear the general rule stated in 31 ALR2d 1375 at 1381-1384:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\"There is a line of cases supporting the proposition that, as an exception to the general rule requiring the owner or occupier of premises (contractee) to furnish a safe place of work to an independent contractor and the latter\u2019s employees, the owner or occupier is under no duty to protect them against risks arising from or intimately connected with defects of the premises, or of machinery or appliances located thereon, which the contractor was undertaken to repair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\"Closely related to the exception stated above is the rule that the owner is not liable for death or injury of an independent contractor or one of his employees resulting from dangers which the contractor, as an expert, has known, or as to which he and his employees 'assumed the risk.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\"In support of the exception to the 'safe place\u2019 doctrine, it has been pointed out that, before repairs of any kind can be made to a structure or thing, it is first necessary to find out what is wrong with it, that it is the responsibility of the repairman to determine what that defect is, that the contractor, under his contract to repair, has the duty of discovering any latent defect, and if he fails to do so he fails not only to fulfil <em>[sic] </em>his contract but also to perform his duty to his employee, and that the contractor has an equal or even a better opportunity to discover any defects than has the contractee. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\"On the other hand, where a risk separate and distinct from those created by the defects to be repaired under the contract resulted in the injury or death of a contractor or an employee of the latter, it has been held that a contractee cannot successfully invoke the defense of assumption of risk, and that the general rules (which are not the same in all jurisdictions) governing the extent of his duty to furnish an independent contractor and his employees a safe place of work and to warn them of hidden dangers are applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Under this rule, and continuing Justice T. E. Brennan\u2019s analogy, if the independent contractor is hired to remove a stump but in the process is electrocuted by a high voltage line negligently left lying on the ground by the landowner, then the landowner cannot escape liability simply because he turned the premises and job over to the contractor. Of course, the determination of whether the risk is in fact separate and distinct from those created by the defects to be repaired must be resolved by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Under the facts of the instant case, sufficient proofs arid reasonable inferences therefrom were presented and give rise, at least, to a jury submissible question of whether the work to be performed by plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s employer is an inherently dangerous activity, and whether that degree of care was used which an ordinarily prudent person would use under the same or similar circumstances. I agree that the judgment and opinions below must be reversed and the caus\u00e9 remanded for new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b649-6\">Adams, J., concurred with T. M. Kavanagh, C.

E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWa\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The general rule of law is that an owner of premises is not liable to persons injured through the negligence of an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">There is a well developed exception to that rule, in cases where the contract calls for the performance on an inherently dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In such cases, it is said that a nondelegable duty reposes with the owner; that he may not insulate himself from the performance of that duty by the employment of a contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The application of this well settled exception is clear in cases where the injured person is a stranger to the inherently dangerous activity. In <em>Inglis v Millersburg Driving Association, </em>169 Mich 311 (1912), the inherently dangerous activity was burning, and the plaintiff was a neighboring landowner; in <em>Grinnell v Carbide &amp; Carbon Chemicals Corp, </em>282 Mich 509 (1937), the danger was explosion, the plaintiff a purchaser of a stove; in <em>Watkins v Gabriel Steel Co, </em>260 Mich 692 (1932), the dangerous activity was elevated steel construction, the plaintiff a mason contractor; in <em>Olah v Katz, </em>234 Mich 112 (1926), the danger was an open pit, the plaintiff a neighboring child; in <em>Detroit v Corey, </em>9 Mich 165 (1861), the danger was an open ditch, the plaintiff a passer-by; in <em>Darmstaetter v Moynahan, </em>27 Mich 188 (1873), the danger was a wall of ice in the roadway, the plaintiff a sleigh rider; in <em>McWilliams v Detroit Central Mills Co, </em>31 Mich 274 (1875), the danger was a railroad switching operation, the plaintiff a passer-by. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>leading case from our sister state of Ohio, <em>Covington &amp; Cincinnati Bridge Co v Steinbrock &amp; Patrick, </em>61 Ohio 215; 55 NE 618 (1899), was an instance of unsupported walls which fell upon and injured a neighbor. The English cases discussed in <em>Covington </em>are mostly based upon the theory of lateral support and involve injury or damage to neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Indeed, there are almost no cases which have come to notice in which the suit is brought by or on behalf of a plaintiff who was himself actively engaged in the inherently dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Those few precedents which are cited seem to be founded upon other grounds. Thus <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, </em>39 Mich 492 (1878), was a suit by a workman engaged in mining. The danger there was a falling rock, not shored up by the mine owners. Liability was predicated upon the <em>condition of the premises, </em>and the undelegated as opposed to nondelegable duty of the mine owners to guard against falling rocks.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\"They testified, and the jury must have believed them, that the company reserved the power of determining when and where dangerous rock in the wall should be removed, if requiring removal by blasting, and of locating the supporting pillars or placing timbers to prop the wall. Such timbering would be expensive, and is not provided for by the contracts which are confined to rock and ore blasting and removal. Either the mine must be unguarded, or else, on this state of facts, the company must guard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\"Under such circumstances it is very plain that the company being the owners of the dangerous property, and inviting men to work on it, their responsibility for its protection cannot be changed by the fact that the work is done by the ton instead of by the day, or by the fact that the men who contract with them have laborers of their own. By employing men to act for them in either way they hold out the assurance that they can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>work in the mine on the ordinary conditions of safety usually found in such places. They guarantee nothing more than is usual among prudent owners, and they do not insure against that which is purely accidental. But they do tacitly represent that they have not been and will not be reckless themselves.\u201d <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, supra, </em>502-503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson </em>arose before the advent of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. It was then competent for the workman to bring suit against his employer. The points of law cited by both litigants in their briefs to the Court demonstrate that the case was essentially such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><em>Utley v Taylor &amp; Gaskin, Inc, </em>305 Mich 561 (1943), was a similar case to <em>Watkins v Gabriel Steel Co, supra, </em>with one added twist. In <em>Watkins, </em>the mason contractor was injured through the negligence of the structural steel subcontractor and the mason was permitted to recover from the general steel contractor on the principle of the <em>Inglis, Olah and Wight </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In <em>Utley, </em>the injured mason was an employee of the general contractor. At that time, 1937, the workmen\u2019s compensation law gave the employee the option of claiming compensation benefits or maintaining a tort action against a responsible third party. Moore, the mason, chose workmen\u2019s compensation, and the plaintiff Utley was the general contractor who as Moore\u2019s subrogee brought suit against the negligent structural steel subcontractor. In <em>Utley, </em>it was the defendant who relied on <em>Olah, Wight </em>and <em>Watkins.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\"In other words, defendant claims that, steel construction work being inherently or intrinsically dangerous, the exception to the independent contractor rule is applicable; that under such rule plaintiff is liable for the negligence of defendant as an independent contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tor; and that such negligence, imputed to plaintiff, bars his recovery.\u201d <em>Utley v Taylor &amp; Gaskin, Inc, supra, </em>571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">There, it was held that <em>plaintiff Utley </em>as statutory subrogee, stood in the shoes of the injured workman. Plaintiffs own negligence was not imputed to the workman, and was held not to bar recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">An excellent statement of the rationale of the \"inherently dangerous activity\u201d doctrine is found in <em>Covington, </em>cited above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\"It is urged as unreasonable that one who has work to perform, that he himself cannot perform, from want of knowledge or skill, should be held liable for the negligence of one whom he employed to do it, since, if he did reserve control, it would avail nothing from his own want of knowledge and skill. There is a seeming force in this, but only so. It is' not agreeable to the principles of distributive justice. For it is equally a hardship that one should suffer loss by the negligent performance of work which another procured to be done for his own benefit, and which he in no way promoted and over which he had no control. Hence, where work is to be done that may endanger others, there is no real hardship in holding the party, for whom it is done, responsible for neglect in doing it. Though he may not be able to do it himself, or intelligently supervise it, he will nevertheless, be the more careful in selecting an agent to act for him. This is a duty which arises in all cases where an agent is employed; and no harm can come from stimulating its exercise in the employment of an independent contractor, where the rights of others are concerned.\u201d p 229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The foregoing quotation, and the statement from Cooley on Torts, quoted in my Brother\u2019s opinion, emphasize that the rule of liability is designed to protect innocent third parties injured by the execution of an inherently dangerous undertaking. The rule is not designed, nor was it ever intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to benefit the contractor who undertakes the dangerous work, or his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Thus, if I employ a contractor to remove a tree stump from my yard by use of explosives, I am liable to my neighbor whose garage is damaged by the concussion. This is because it is I who have set the project in motion; it is I who have created the unusual peril; it is for my benefit that the explosives were used. As between myself and my neighbor, I ought not to be permitted to plead that it was the contractor\u2019s negligence and not my own which damaged his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">But if the contractor should blow up his own truck, I should not be liable. He is the expert in explosives and not me. I had neither the legal right nor the capability to supervise his work. The same would be true if the contractor\u2019s workman had injured himself, or been injured by the. carelessness of a fellow workman or the negligence of his employer. Neither the contractor nor his employees are \"others\u201d, as contemplated in Cooley\u2019s statement of the rule. Indeed, they are privy to the contract which creates the peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The mischief of today\u2019s decision is not its result, but its logic. One assumes that a company like General Motors has no want of access to expertise. It may well have safety engineers on its payroll far more knowledgeable about structural steel than the decedent\u2019s employer. But to predicate liability here on the Inglis, <em>Olah, Wight </em>and <em>Watkins </em>line of cases is to impose upon many, many other, less sophisticated defendants the same burden to attend to the safety of the employees of independent contractors.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-7\">T.
