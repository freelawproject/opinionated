She was hired by defendant as a teacher for the 1966-1967 school year and rehired for the 1967-1968 school year. During both school years, plaintiff was on probationary status. The last day of the 1967-1968 school year was June 7, 1968, and the sixtieth day before the close of that school year was April 9, 1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-13\">\"At a special meeting of defendant held April 3, 1968, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the superintendent recommended that plaintiff be placed on a third year of probation because of unsatisfactory classroom discipline. For the same reason, the board voted to terminate her employment at the end of the 1967-1968 school year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-4\">\"April 8, 1968, the following letter was mailed to plaintiff by certified mail:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">\" 'Miss Evelyn Weckerly 3711 Henry Street, Apt. 113 Muskegon, Michigan 49441</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APAv\">\" 'Dear Miss Weckerly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">\" 'Under conditions and terms of the Michigan Tenure Act it is my responsibility to notify you that because of unsatisfactory work, your contract will riot be renewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\">\" 'Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">/s/ Wm. A. Luyendyk, Superintendent\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\">\"The same day plaintiff\u2019s principal told her that her contract would not be renewed and that she would be so advised by mail. April 9, 1968, a postal employee attempted delivery of the certified letter but plaintiff was at school. A mail-arrival notice was left in plaintiff\u2019s mailbox. Plaintiff testified that she searched for the <em>expected </em>letter April 8, 9, 10 and 11, but that she found neither the letter nor the mail arrival notice until April 12th. [The correct date was April 11.] She actually received the letter April 13th and it was read to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">\"August 26, 1968, the State Tenure Commission ordered that plaintiff be returned to her employment by defendant as a tenure teacher. Defendant appealed to Ingham County Circuit Court which vacated the order of the commission.\u201d 28 Mich App 243, 244-245 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">On December 1, 1970, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of Honorable Jack W. Warren in Ingham County Circuit Court. Rehearing denied on January 13, 1971. On January 30, plaintiff and appellant filed application for leave to appeal. Leave was granted on March 14, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">At what point the required written statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>has been <em>provided </em>is a question of first impression in this Court. Previously this Court has ruled on other points relating to the \"written statement\u201d. We have held that if no written statement is provided, the statute requires it \" 'shall be considered as conclusive evidence\u2019 that the [teacher\u2019s] work is satisfactory.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have also held that if the written statement that a contract would not be renewed fails to state whether or not the teacher\u2019s work had been satisfactory, the written statement does not meet statutory requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, we have interpreted this section of the Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act quite literally in favor of the legislative purpose of protecting teachers\u2019 rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">The exact words of the statute are consequently important. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-7\">\"At least 60 days before the close of each school year the controlling board <em>shall provide </em>the probationary teacher with a definite <em>written statement </em>as to whether or not his work has been satisfactory. Failure to <em>submit a written statement </em>shall be considered as conclusive evidence that the teacher\u2019s work is satisfactory. Any probationary teacher or teacher not on continuing contract shall be employed for the ensuing year <em>unless notified in writing </em>at least 60 days before the close of the school year that his services will be discontinued.\u201d MCLA 38.83; MSA 15.1983. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The operative sentence is the first and the key word is \"provide\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The first sentence is the critical one, because it is the one in which the Legislature prescribes what must be done. The second and third sentences merely describe the consequences if the prescribed action is not taken. Therefore the reference words \"submit\u201d and \"notified\u201d in the second and third sentences respectively are merely descriptive of the key word \"provide\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">The common meaning of \"provide\u201d as found in Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary is:</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">\"1. To look out for in advance; to procure beforehand.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">\"2. To supply for use; afford; yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">\"3. To furnish; stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">While all three paragraphs describe some of the flavor intended by the Legislature, \"[t]o supply for use\u201d most nearly conveys what is here intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Applying this construction of the statute to the facts of the case, two things are immediately clear. First, the oral communication of the message in no way satisfies the literal requirements of the statute, <em>viz. </em>providing the written notice. Second, the postman\u2019s leaving the notice of attempted delivery of the letter enclosing the written notice is not providing the written notice, which was returned to the post office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Since the actual delivery of the letter to the teacher\u2019s residence did not occur \"60 days before the close of the school year\u201d, the written statement was not provided or supplied for use on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the Tenure Commission is reinstated. No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b934-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams, T. E. Brennan, T. G.
