These provisions define who must report suspected child abuse and when and how a report must be filed, \u00a7\u00a7 5-704 and 5-705, the procedures by which law enforcement and social services agencies must conduct investigations of such reports, \u00a7 5-706, and the procedures by which children endangered by child abuse can be protected. \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014 709 to 5-713. The statute divides the responsibilities of investigating and reporting on child abuse or neglect among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the State\u2019s Department of Human Resources (DHR), the Social Services Administration (SSA) within the DHR, the local departments of social services in each county (\u201clocal departments\u201d), and law enforcement agencies. The statute also provides certain protections to a person suspected of child abuse, by limiting the uses to which records and reports can be put and providing certain procedures by which an alleged abuser can challenge the conclusions drawn by an investigating social worker. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1, 5-706.2, 5-707, 5-714(c), 5-715.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Upon receiving a report of child abuse, \u00a7 5-706(a) requires a local department of social services or law enforcement agency to \u201cmake a thorough investigation.\u201d This investigation includes examining and interviewing the child and his or her caretaker, and requires the department to determine the nature and cause of the abuse. \u00a7\u00a7 5-706(b) and (c). Within 10 days after the suspected abuse is first reported, the local department must report its preliminary findings to the local State\u2019s Attorney, and it must provide the State\u2019s Attorney with a complete written report of its findings within 5 days of the investigation\u2019s completion. \u00a7\u00a7 5-706(h) and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The local department may make one of three-findings when it completes the investigation. If the local department finds that \u201cthere is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did occur,\u201d then it must find that child abuse was \u201cindicated.\u201d \u00a7 5-701(k); <em>see also </em>Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (CO-MAR) 07.02.07.12(A) (1996) (providing guidelines for determining when abuse is \u201cindicated\u201d); COMAR 07.02.07.13(A) (providing guidelines for when child neglect is \u201cindicated\u201d). If it finds that \u201cabuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did not occur,\u201d then the alleged child abuse has been \u201cruled out.\u201d \u00a7 5 \u2014 701(t); <em>see also </em>COMAR 07.02.07.12(C) and 07.02.07.13(C). Finally, if \u201cthere is an insufficient amount of evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out,\u201d the local department may find that the abuse was \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d \u00a7 5-701(v); <em>see also </em>COMAR 07.02.07.12(B) and 07.02.07.13(B). Following each investigation, the local department must determine which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of these three labels should be applied and document the factors upon which it made its determination. COMAR 07.02.07.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">After it completes its investigation, if it finds that the abuse or neglect was indicated or unsubstantiated, the local department must notify the person allegedly responsible for the abuse or neglect of the department\u2019s finding and that the person may request an administrative hearing to appeal the finding. \u00a7 5-706.1(a). If an administrative hearing is requested, the local department\u2019s records must be reviewed to determine whether its finding should be modified or expunged. \u00a7 5-706.1(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the finding is not changed to \u201cruled out\u201d as a result of this review, the department shall forward all of its reports and records to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), the agency that must conduct the hearing. \u00a7 5-706.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Section 5-706.2 defines the procedures under which this hearing must be conducted. For example, \u00a7 5-706.2(a) allows the alleged abuser to request that the administrative law judge (ALJ) conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the full report or record to determine its accuracy and sufficiency. Section 5-706.2(c) provides that after the ALJ determines that the information in the report is \u201csufficient and accurate for purposes, of determining an issue in a proceeding,\u201d the ALJ may provide the full report or record to the alleged abuser, so long as the ALJ takes measures to protect the confidentiality of the persons who provided the information to the local department. The alleged abuser can submit additional written information to the ALJ, and the ALJ must determine the correctness of the local department\u2019s finding based upon the department\u2019s report and this additional information. \u00a7 706.2(d)(1). If the ALJ determines that the finding is incorrect, the ALJ must order the department to change the finding. \u00a7 706.2(d)(2). The hearing and administrative review mechanism provided in \u00a7\u00a7 706.1 and 706.2 is commonly referred to as a \u201cChapter 318 hearing,\u201d in reference to the legislative act creating \u00a7\u00a7 706.1 and 706.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">There are several different ways in which information relating to child abuse is stored by the local departments of social services and by the Social Services Administration. First, each local department is required to maintain a case record of all investigations. COMAR 07.02.07.15(A). This paper record includes the written report of the department\u2019s findings, copies of medical records, pertinent letters, and any other documentation relating to the investigation. COMAR 07.02.07.15(B). This record is expunged within 120 days of the conclusion of the investigation if abuse or neglect was ruled out and no further reports are received. \u00a7 5 \u2014 707(b)(2); CO-MAR 07.02.07.18(B). If the alleged abuse or neglect was unsubstantiated, the reports must be expunged within 5 years if no further reports are received. \u00a7 5 \u2014 707(b)(1); COMAR 07.02.07.18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In addition to the local department\u2019s report, \u201c[tjhe Social Services Administration and each local department may main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tain a central registry of cases reported [under the child abuse statute].\u201d \u00a7 5 \u2014 714(a). Information stored in such a central registry is at the disposal of the protective services staff of the SSA. \u00a7 5 \u2014 714(c)(1). In addition, the protective services staffs of the local departments and law enforcement personnel have access to the central registry when they are investigating a report of suspected abuse or neglect. \u00a7 5-714(c)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Certain protections are provided to persons suspected of abuse or neglect in relation to central registries. First, before a name can be entered in a central registry, the alleged abuser is entitled to notice. \u00a7 5-715(b). In addition, unless the person has already been adjudicated a child abuser, such as in a criminal proceeding, the alleged abuser may request an administrative hearing \u201cfor the purpose of allowing the person to appeal the entry of the person\u2019s name in the central registry.\u201d \u00a7 5 \u2014 715(c)(1). No person\u2019s name may be entered into the central registry unless that person has been adjudicated to be a child abuser, or was given the hearing provided for in \u00a7 5-715(c) and was unsuccessful, or failed to request a hearing within 15 days of notification by the department seeking to enter the alleged abuser\u2019s name in a central registry. \u00a7 5 \u2014 715(d). Once a person\u2019s name has been entered in a central registry, it must be removed after seven years if no further entries have been made for that person. \u00a7 5-715(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In addition to the local department\u2019s paper records and state and local central registries, information about suspected child abusers is stored in an \u201cautomated master file\u201d or \u201cclient information system.\u201d The automated master file (AMF) or client information system (CIS) is defined in DHR\u2019s regulations as \u201cthe automated electronic system that maintains data related to services provided by a local department.\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.02(B)(3); COMAR 07.02.07.02(B)(9). The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee has referred to the AMF as \u201ca statewide, comprehensive database containing records of all cases, including those of suspected child abuse, which are handled by local departments of social services.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis for House Bill 617, at 1 (1993). No statutory provisions refer to the AMF by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>name, and DHR has asserted that it is not a \u201ccentral registry\u201d because it is not \u201cdesigned solely to list the names of adjudicated child abusers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On November 26, 1993, the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (PGDSS) notified C.S. that it had conducted an investigation and concluded that C.S. was responsible for an incident of \u201cindicated\u201d abuse, and that it was entering C.S.\u2019s name on the central registry. After C.S. requested a hearing, the PGDSS reviewed its records and declined to modify its finding. After the file was transferred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), an ALJ conducted an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents. C.S. was allowed to submit additional written information to support his position that abuse was not \u201cindicated,\u201d and oral argument was presented before the ALJ. The ALJ upheld the local department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On July 25, 1994, C.S. filed with the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County a petition for judicial review and a motion to stay the ALJ\u2019s order affirming the PGDSS. The PGDSS moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that judicial review was not provided for in the statute and that the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)' providing judicial review in some cases do not apply to findings of indicated child abuse. In an opinion and order filed on January 26, 1995, the circuit court (Platt, J.) dismissed the petition on the grounds that the PGDSS was not a state agency and that the APA\u2019s provisions granting judicial review in contested cases only apply to actions taken by state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>C.S. filed an appeal with the Court of Special Appeals and at the same time petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. We granted certiorari before the Court of Special Appeals heard arguments in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">C.S. contends that the circuit court was incorrect in dismissing his petition and that he is entitled to judicial review of the decision made by the ALJ. First, C.S. notes that he seeks review of the ALJ\u2019s order, which constitutes an action taken by the OAH, a state agency. C.S. argues that judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s order is appropriate, because the dispute with the PGDSS is a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of the APA and that review is therefore available under that statute. C.S. also contends that his rights to due process under the Maryland and federal constitution will be violated if he is denied judicial review in a case where the state seeks to label him as a child abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The PGDSS concedes that the ALJ\u2019s order is an action of a state agency, but contends that the circuit court\u2019s decision was correct even if for the wrong reasons. The PGDSS argues that the legislature did not intend Chapter 318 proceedings to be contested cases within the meaning of the APA, and that the APA therefore provides C.S. with no grounds upon which to request judicial review. The PGDSS also asserts that C.S. has no due process right to judicial review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">After reviewing the relevant statutes, the relevant legislative history, and the regulations promulgated under the statutes, we find no need at this time to address whether an alleged abuser can seek judicial review of a Chapter 318 hearing. Instead, we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, which implement Chapter 318 hearings, are only applicable to a review of the local department\u2019s records. Section 5-715 provides an alleged abuser with a separate and independent right to an administrative hearing before his or her name may be entered into a central registry. We further hold that the hearing under \u00a7 5-715 qualifies as a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>under the APA, and that it was improper to provide C.S. with only the limited hearing specified by Chapter 318. For this reason, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and remand this case to the circuit court. We shall further direct the circuit court to remand the case to the OAH in order for it to hold a hearing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We have repeatedly stated that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the true intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753 (1993). To discern the legislative intent, we must consider the \u201cgeneral purpose, aim, or policy behind the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While great weight is given to the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s language, <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986), we examine this language in the context in which it was adopted. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Mohler, </em>318 Md. 219, 225, 567 A.2d 929 (1990). In this light, \u201c[i]t is often necessary to look at the development of a statute to discern legislative intent that may not be as clear upon initial examination of the current language of the statute.\u201d <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 492, 632 A.2d 753 (citing <em>Mohler, supra, </em>318 Md. at 225-27, 567 A.2d 929). The statute before us embodies thirty years of legislation, in which the legislature has repeatedly balanced the need to report and investigate child abuse with its desire to protect those who have been falsely accused. It is helpful, therefore, to review the history of those provisions relating to the central registries, as well as those provisions restricting the use of information relating to alleged abusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">By ch. 743, Laws of Maryland (1963), the legislature adopted Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 11A, criminalizing child abuse in Maryland and requiring physicians to report suspected cases of child abuse to the police department. The Legislature amended \u00a7 11A in 1966 and expanded it to include reporting to and investigations by local depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ments of welfare in addition to criminal enforcement of the law. As amended, the statute provided guidelines for the state and local welfare agencies to follow when investigating child abuse, and gave them authority to take steps to remove the child from the home of an abuser. See ch. 221, Laws of Maryland (1966); Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 11 A. As a part of this expanded role of welfare agencies, the Legislature provided for a central registry of child abuse cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">The State Department of Welfare shall maintain a central registry of cases reported under this Act, which data shall be furnished by the respective local welfare boards throughout the State of Maryland and this data shall be at the disposal of public welfare, social agencies, public health agencies, law enforcement agencies, as well as licensed health practitioners and health and education institutions licensed or regulated by the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 11A(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The next significant alteration to this provision was made in 1973, when the Legislature enacted ch. 835.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That Act amended the central registry provision, now codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 35A(i), to provide that \u201c[t]he State Department of Social Services shall and each local Department of Social Services may maintain a central registry of cases.\u201d No alterations were made by this Act to the provision granting access to the central registry to the various organizations and individuals quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">When the legislature next addressed the central registry, it enacted ch. 504, Laws of Maryland (1977), which added a new subsection to Art. 27, \u00a7 35A; it provided procedures by which alleged child abusers could attempt to clear their names <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>before the names could be entered on the central registries. Originally codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol., 1978 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 35A(j), the subsection provided three new protections for those whose names were to be entered on the registry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, the statute required the Department of Human Resources to enact regulations to \u201cprotect the rights of suspected child abusers.\u201d \u00a7 35A(j). Second, it required the Department of Human Resources to provide notice to the alleged abuser, and if requested by the alleged abuser, to hold a hearing at which that person could appeal the decision to enter his or her name on the registry. \u00a7 35A(j)(1) and (2). The statute specifically forbade the DHR from putting a person\u2019s name on the registry unless such an appeal was unsuccessful or was not requested. \u00a7 35A(j)(3). Finally, if a person\u2019s name was entered on the central registry, the entry would be expunged from the registry after seven years if no further entries' were made for that individual and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>individual requested the removal. \u00a7 35A(j)(4). Neither the bill nor its legislative history reflect whether \u00a7 35A(j) was intended to apply only to the central registry managed by the Department of Human Resources, or whether it was intended to apply to the registries managed by the local departments as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In 1981, the legislature shortened the list of individuals and organizations who were eligible to use the information kept in the central registry. Ch. 770, Laws of Maryland (1981) amended Art. 27, \u00a7 35A to provide that the data in the central registry \u201cshall be at the disposal of protected services staff of the Social Services Administration, protective services staff of the local departments of social services who are investigating a report of suspected child abuse, and law enforcement personnel who are investigating a report of suspected child abuse.\u201d This change limited the uses to which the information in the central registry could be put in two distinct ways. First, even though law enforcement personnel and the local departments of social services still had access to the central registry, such access was now expressly limited to instances where they were investigating a report of suspected child abuse. In addition, while licensed health practitioners and health and education institutions had previously been given access to the central registry, ch. 770 removed any reference to these individuals and organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In 1984, Art. 27, \u00a7 35A was moved to the new Family Law Article, and the provisions relating to the central registry were codified as \u00a7 5-911 and \u00a7 5-912 of that Article. Ch. 296, Laws of Maryland (1984). In 1987, the legislature combined the statutes relating to child abuse and child neglect and recodified the central registry provisions in their present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>location, \u00a7\u00a7 5-714 and 5-715. Ch. 635, Laws of Maryland (1987). In both instances, no substantive changes were made to these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In 1991, the legislature provided additional protection to persons who had been alleged to be abusers, but who had been cleared following an investigation. Ch. 461, Laws of Maryland (1991) limited local departments\u2019 ability to retain files in cases where abuse was \u201cruled out\u201d by requiring the local departments to expunge reports where abuse was ruled out within 120 days of the report. The previous version of \u00a7 5-707 had allowed the local departments to retain such reports for up to five years. The 1991 amendments to \u00a7 5-707 also added the requirement that local departments expunge all assessments and investigative findings as well as the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The legislature added a new avenue of procedural protection in 1993 when it enacted ch. 318, Laws of Maryland (1993). That bill enacted \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, the provisions allowing alleged abusers to request administrative review of the findings made by a local department. The legislature was prompted to enact these measures by the plight of David and Marsha Hodge, who were denied any review by the DHS and local departments of records held by those departments, even though it had been proven beyond any doubt that no child abuse had occurred. <em>See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report for House Bill 617 (1993); <em>see generally Hodge v. Carroll County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>812 F.Supp. 593, 594-600 (D.Md.1992), <em>rev\u2019d, Hodge v. Jones, </em>31 F.3d 157 (4th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 581, 130 L.Ed.2d 496; Patrick J. Kiger, <em>Abused By the System, </em>Baltimore Magazine, April 1993, at 49 (discussing in detail the Hodges\u2019 circumstances and subsequent federal lawsuit). The DHR and local departments asserted that their records were not \u201ccentral registries\u201d and that no review was necessary. Floor Report for House Bill 617. After a federal court ordered the agencies to release their records to the Hodges, it was discovered that the records incorrectly stated that sexual abuse was indicated, even though no sexual abuse had ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>been alleged and any physical abuse had been ruled out. Kiger, <em>supra </em>at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The legislature sought to address this problem by establishing \u201cprocedures to allow a person who has been accused of child abuse or neglect access to reports and records concerning the alleged abuse or neglect and allowing] the person to request an administrative hearing.\u201d Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 1. In its report on House Bill 617, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee stated that the legislature intended that the bill provide a remedy <em>in addition </em>to the previously existing hearings under \u00a7 5-715:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">The bill is intended to more fully protect persons who are wrongly accused of child abuse or neglect ... by creating another mechanism by which they can contest the findings of investigations carried out by local departments of social services. This bill stands apart from the notice and hearing provisions concerning central registries, thereby giving persons a clear and independent basis from which to contest findings of investigations into alleged child abuse and neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In addition to creating a new hearing procedure, ch. 318 also broadened the scope of \u00a7 5-715. Ch. 318 replaced each reference to \u201cthe\u201d central registry in \u00a7 5-715 with a reference to \u201ca\u201d central registry. Following this amendment, \u00a7 5-715\u2019s right to a hearing clearly applies to all central registries in Maryland, not one single central registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Since 1993, only two minor changes have been made to the relevant statutes. In 1994, \u00a7 5-715 was amended to require the DHR to automatically remove the name of a person suspected of abuse or neglect after seven years. The previous version of \u00a7 5-715 provided for removal after seven years only upon request of the alleged abuser. <em>See </em>ch. 281, Laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Maryland (1994). In 1995, \u00a7 5-706.1 was amended to insure that when a Chapter 318 hearing was requested, and the child who was allegedly abused or neglected was the subject of a Child In Need of Assistance petition, the Chapter 318 hearing would be postponed until after the CINA proceedings had been concluded. Ch. 570, Laws of Maryland (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The amendments to Maryland\u2019s child abuse laws, and the legislative history behind those amendments, evidence a deep concern on the part of the legislature to give individuals alleged to have committed child abuse or neglect an opportunity to clear their name. This history also demonstrates the legislature\u2019s concern that before information relating to alleged child abuse can be disseminated state-wide, that information must have been demonstrated to be accurate either through adjudication or an administrative hearing. Clearly, \u00a7\u00a7 5-701 to 5-715 grant broad authority to social services and law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of child abuse and to prevent its recurrence. At the same time, the legislature has also shown that this authority must be tempered to ensure that individuals are not labelled as child abusers on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The hearing procedures codified as \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2 are implemented in the DHR\u2019s regulations at COMAR 07.02.26. These regulations provide a limited review of the local department\u2019s documentation, to ensure the accuracy of the paper record. They do not provide for any type of hearing other than this limited documentary review. At the same time, COMAR 07.02.07.19 implements the DHR\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 5-714 and 5-715. That regulation provides that all appeals of an agency\u2019s decision to enter a person\u2019s name on a central registry must be performed in accordance with COMAR 07.02.26. Thus, COMAR 07.02.07.19 limits hearings granted under \u00a7 5-715 to the hearing procedures codified as \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We hold that COMAR 07.02.07.19 fails to properly implement the legislative scheme because the Chapter 318 hearing was created by the legislature as a new and independent means of review. Thus, Chapter 318 hearings were intended to supplement, rather than replace, the pre-existing administrative review of an agency\u2019s decision to enter a person\u2019s name on a central registry, available under \u00a7 5-715. This conclusion is mandated both by the language of the statute and by the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The language used in \u00a7\u00a7 5-715 and 5-706.1 demonstrates that two separate review processes have been created. The two sections contain duplicate provisions that would be unnecessary if they referred to a single review process. For example, both sections specify where the hearing will be conducted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-706.1(e); 5 \u2014 715(c)(2). Also, while \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2 specify the procedures by which the Chapter 318 hearing must be held in some detail, \u00a7 5 \u2014 715(d)(2) provides only that its hearing must be conducted \u201cunder procedures established by the Department and this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The evolution of the child abuse statutes and the legislative history also support this conclusion. Section 5-715 was enacted in 1977, sixteen years before the passage of \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2. The legislature in 1977 obviously could not have intended to limit hearings provided under \u00a7 5-715 to the procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, since the 1977 Act contained <em>no </em>such provisions. Unless the legislature in 1993 intended Chapter 318 to supersede \u00a7 5-715\u2019s pre-existing right to a hearing, the procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2 do not apply to \u00a7 5-715.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We have already described Chapter 318\u2019s legislative history, which demonstrates that the 1993 enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2 were not intended to affect the pre-existing hearings under \u00a7 5-715. As stated in the floor report, Chapter 318 \u201ccreat[ed] another mechanism by which [alleged abusers] can contest the findings of investigations carried out by local departments of social services\u201d that \u201cstands apart from the notice and hearing provisions concerning central regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tries\u201d and gives them a \u201cclear and independent basis from which to contest findings of investigations into alleged child abuse and neglect.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993). We conclude therefore, that the statute contains no requirement that the procedures under \u00a7 5-715 be conducted in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Having determined that the legislature did not intend for the hearing provided in \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2 to supplant the hearing required by \u00a7 5-715, we must determine the nature of the hearing to which C.S. is entitled under \u00a7 5-715. Here, we focus upon whether \u00a7 5-715 provides a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing as defined by Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-201 through 10-217 of the State Government Article. We make this determination because \u201c[u]nder the terms of the APA, when a proceeding meets the definition of a \u2018contested case,\u2019 the agency is required to provide certain trial type procedures during the course of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf v. Waste Disposal, </em>323 Md. 641, 651, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991). Thus, if \u00a7 5-715 provides a contested case hearing, the DHR cannot limit a hearing under that section to the procedures specified in \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1 and 5-706.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Section 10-202(d)(1) of the APA defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d to include proceedings before an agency that determine \u201ca right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d One of the key elements of a contested case hearing is whether the entity conducting the hearing acts in an adjudicatory capacity, <em>ie. </em>by determining the facts of a case and applying those facts to some legal standard in order to reach a conclusion. <em>See Sugarloaf supra, </em>323 Md. at 653, 594 A.2d 1115 (finding that where a hearing was merely \u201cpreliminary,\u201d it was not a contested case hearing); <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 612 A.2d 241 (finding that a hearing as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>whether a permit should be granted was adjudicatory rather than legislative) (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The hearing provided by \u00a7 5-715 falls within the definition of a contested case. Section 5-715(c) provides the right to a hearing, and \u00a7 5-715(d) provides that a person\u2019s name may not be entered on a central registry unless their appeal at the hearing is unsuccessful or the hearing is not requested. The sole question at a hearing under \u00a7 5-715 must necessarily be whether the alleged incident of abuse or neglect is correctly labelled as \u201cindicated\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d In determining this issue, the ALJ must sift between potentially conflicting information presented by the DHR and the alleged abuser to determine whether there are sufficient facts to meet the definitions of the two categories provided in \u00a7 5-701(k) and (v). We conclude that the legislature has provided a right not to have one\u2019s name on the central registry unless it is determined in an administrative hearing that child abuse was indicated or unsubstantiated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Since \u00a7 5-715 provides a right to a contested case hearing, the DHR cannot limit a hearing under that section to the procedures of a Chapter 318 hearing. It is true that \u201cthe statute or regulation which grants the right to a hearing may negate the fact that the hearing is to be a \u2018contested case\u2019 or \u2018adjudicatory hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf, supra, </em>323 Md. at 653, 594 A.2d 1115. The statute providing for the hearing, however, \u201cshould not be construed to override the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act unless [it] does so expressly or by clear implication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666 n. 6, 594 A.2d 1115. We find no such implication in \u00a7 5-715.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">It is true that \u00a7 5-715 requires that the hearings be held \u201cunder procedures established by the Department and this section.\u201d The mere fact, however, that the Department may establish some procedures relating to the hearing is not sufficient by itself to override the APA\u2019s definition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201ccontested case.\u201d We therefore hold that \u00a7 5-715 entitles C.S. to a contested case hearing before the DHR or PGDSS can enter his name on a central registry created under \u00a7 5-714.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\n<em>ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO ABIDE THE RESULT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\">. As codified, \u00a7 5-706.1(d) is ambiguous as to whether the local department or the DHR must review the record. Throughout the subtitle, the local departments are consistently referred to as \"local department\u201d and the DHR is referred to as the \"Department.\u201d Section 5-706.1(d), however, provides that \u201cthe department\u201d shall review the record. The Department of Human Resources, in its regulations, provides that this review will be performed by the local department. COMAR 07.02.26.08. As we discuss below, however, the DHR\u2019s regulations improperly apply \u00a7 706.1 on a number of points. <em>See infra, </em>section II.B. It is possible that this section was intended to refer to \"the Department\u201d but was codified incorrectly. \u00a7 5-706.1 was enacted by House Bill 617 (1993) and became ch. 318, Laws of Maryland (1993). Because \u00a7 706.1 comprised new matter added to existing law, the statutory section was enacted entirely in capital letters. <em>See </em>ch. 318, Laws of Maryland at 1858 (1993); <em>see also </em>Laws of Maryland at 5 (1993) (describing significance of various type-faces in 1993 legislative enactments). Thus, the word \"DEPARTMENT\u201d could have been intended to be either \"department\u201d or \"Department.\u201d In its Fiscal Note for House Bill 617, the General Assembly\u2019s Department of Fiscal Services assumed that DHR would conduct the pre-hearing review of the local department\u2019s report. The Fiscal Note states that \"[t]he Department of Human Resources (DHR) is required to review records and reports concerning a request for an administrative hearing and determine, prior to the hearing, whether an indicated or unsubstantiated finding must be amended, modified, or expunged.\u201d We do not resolve this ambiguity at this time, but note its presence so that our discussion in the text is not taken as a resolution of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">.
