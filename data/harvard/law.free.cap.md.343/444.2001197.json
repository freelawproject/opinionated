The two handgun convictions were based upon the same acts or transaction. In addition to the sentences for assault, Wilkins was sentenced to five years imprisonment without the possibility of parole for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and three years imprisonment for unlawfully wearing or carrying a handgun. All sentences were concurrent. Wilkins did not, in the circuit court, object to the separate sentences for use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>handgun in the commission of a felony and for wearing or carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Wilkins argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court \u201cerred in failing to merge [his] conviction for wearing or carrying a handgun into his conviction for use of a handgun in the commission of a\u201d felony. (Appellant\u2019s brief in the Court of Special Appeals at 6). The State, in its Court of Special Appeals\u2019 brief, agreed, affirmatively arguing that Wilkins\u2019s \u201csentence for wearing and carrying a handgun should merge into his ... sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a\u201d felony. (State\u2019s brief in the Court of Special Appeals at 2). The State did not rely upon Wilkins\u2019s failure to raise this issue at trial and did not argue that the issue was not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals, in affirming the judgments in an unreported opinion, refused to consider the merger issue. The intermediate appellate court held that, because of the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the separate sentence for unlawfully wearing or carrying a handgun, the merger issue \u201chas not been preserved for our review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Wilkins filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the single question of whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in \u201crefusing] to order merger of\u2019 the sentence for wearing or carrying a handgun. The State, in its answer to the petition, agreed with Wilkins that the Court of Special Appeals erred; the State urged us to grant the petition and order that the sentence for wearing or carrying a handgun be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We have granted the certiorari petition, and we shall summarily reverse that part of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment relating to the sentence for wearing or carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 510, 540 A.2d 1125, 1133 (1988), we held that the Legislature did not intend that a separate punishment should be imposed for carrying, wearing, or transporting a handgun in addition to that imposed for using a handgun during commission of a felony or crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>violence. We took the position that the sentence for carrying, wearing, or transporting the handgun should merge into the sentence for using the handgun during the commission of a felony or crime of violence. In <em>Hunt, </em>the separate sentence for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun was held to be illegal, and we vacated it. <em>See also Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 401, 583 A.2d 218, 224 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 835, 112 S.Ct. 117, 116 L.Ed.2d 86 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On numerous occasions this Court has pointed out that \u201c \u2018illegal sentences may be challenged at any time, even on appeal,\u201d <em>Spitzinger v. State, </em>340 Md. 114, 122, 665 A.2d 685, 688-689 (1995), quoting <em>Campbell v. State, </em>325 Md. 488, 509, 601 A.2d 667, 677 (1992). <em>See, e.g., Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 161, 591 A.2d 875, 880 (1991) (even though the defendant did not raise the issue at trial, \u201cJordan has not waived his right to object to the unlawful sentence\u201d); <em>Osborne v. State, </em>304 Md. 323, 326 n. 1, 499 A.2d 170, 171 n. 1 (1985) (\u201cwhere the trial court has allegedly imposed an illegal sentence, the issue may be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court\u201d); <em>Matthews v. State, </em>304 Md. 281, 287-288, 498 A.2d 655, 658 (1985); <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Consequently, Wilkins\u2019s separate sentence for wearing or carrying a handgun should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE SENTENCE FOR WEARING OR CARRYING A HANDGUN. COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE. COSTS IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
