We shall hold that the defendant was entitled to credit for time spent in home detention because he was committed to the custody of the Warden of the Wicomico County Detention Center (\u201cWCDC\u201d) and, under a home detention agreement, was subject to prosecution for escape for any unauthorized absence from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Robert Dedo was arrested on August 15, 1993, and charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 286. On October 14, 1993, he was released on bond. He was subsequently indicted and convicted of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Dedo requested a deferral of sentencing until the end of August 1994. He indicated that he would be willing to accept any arrangement that the court determined would assure his appearance for sentencing. The following colloquy occurred between the court and the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>THE COURT: ... Are we ready to proceed with sentencing today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, as a result of some discussions with [the prosecutor] which I think you are aware and as a result of Mr. Dedo\u2019s having some insurance available until the end of August, we would be asking for a deferral of sentence and any type of arrangement to assure that he comes back would be agreeable to the defendant. THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Just for the record, I will show [the prosecutor], this is his last appointment where he is insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">THE COURT: It is my understanding the State has no objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">[STATE]: With some qualifications, Your Honor. I believe there have been some discussions about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">THE COURT: He will be placed on home detention pending scheduling of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">THE COURT: ... The defendant will be ordered on home detention. How is that arranged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">[STATE]: And with the stipulation that he have electronic monitoring, and the defense would request that as well. Your Honor, I would ask\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">THE COURT: You want electronic monitoring and any violation of the home detention will result in him being incarcerated pending sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">[STATE]: Your Honor, I further request that the defendant be directed to report immediately to the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">THE COURT: All right. He will be ordered to report there directly after court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">The court order committing Dedo to home detention pending sentencing reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-15\">TO: WARDEN, WICOMICO COUNTY DETENTION CENTER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED TO RECEIVE THE BODY OF THE ABOVE NAMED DEFENDANT, WHO IS COMMITTED FOR FURTHER ACTION AS FOLLOWS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">Awaiting Further Proceedings before the Circuit Court for Wicomico County: Sentencing \u2014 Defendant on Home Detention and electronic monitoring until sentencing after August 30, 1994.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Dedo signed a Wicomico County Department of Corrections home detention contract that provided that \u201c[a]ny unexcused or unexplained absence during curfew hours will be considered an escape and you will be charged accordingly.\u201d Dedo agreed to be \u201cincarcerated\u201d in his home and to be subject to custodial monitoring by both telecommunications technology and surveillance by home detention staff members. Dedo agreed to permit the County Department of Corrections to connect a portable video camera to his telephone to conduct the electronic monitoring. Dedo also agreed to permit members of the home detention staff to enter his home at any time to install or inspect the equipment and to ensure his compliance with all rules, regulations and conditions of the Home Detention Program; to refrain from possessing or using alcoholic beverages; to submit to random urinalysis and breath alcohol testing; and to disciplinary action for any lateness, failure to call in, busy phone line for an extended time, or failure to respond to a call. The agreement also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">I further understand that if I violate any of the above conditions of Home Detention, my sentence may be terminated and I will be returned to the Wicomico County Detention Center for the remainder of my sentence. At the absolute discretion of the Home Detention Director and on the Director of the Wicomico County Detention Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">On September 2, 1994, the court sentenced Dedo to two years in the Department of Corrections. Dedo requested credit against his sentence for the time he spent in home detention. The State objected and argued that the period of time Dedo spent in home detention \u201cwas a pre-trial release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>situation,\u201d not incarceration, and therefore, he was not entitled to credit against his sentence. The judge refused to give Dedo credit for the time he spent in home detention, stating that \u201c[h]ome detention is not in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Dedo appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, holding that Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) \u201cdoes not require credit to be awarded for time spent in home detention after conviction but prior to sentencing.\u201d <em>Dedo v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 438, 453, 660 A.2d 959, 966 (1995). Relying on <em>Balderston v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 364, 612 A.2d 335 (1992), the intermediate appellate court held that the time Dedo spent in home confinement pending sentencing did not constitute \u201ccustody\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) because Dedo requested home detention and the conditions of his home detention would have allowed him \u201cto leave his house to visit the doctor.\u201d <em>Dedo, </em>105 Md.App. at 454, 660 A.2d at 966. The court also noted that there was \u201cno ... indication in the record as to what restrictions were placed on appellant\u2019s home detention or whether the home detention was a condition of his continued release on bond.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 453, 660 A.2d at 965. We granted Dedo\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Dedo contends that under Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a), a defendant sentenced to a term of confinement is entitled to credit against his sentence for time spent in custody as a result of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>charge. He argues that he is entitled to credit for the presentence confinement he spent in home detention because he was committed to the custody of the WCDC Home Detention Program, a program the County operates pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 645-11. He asserts that under that program a defendant is entitled to credit for each day of any court imposed sentence he serves in home detention. He recognizes, as he must, that he was committed to the program <em>pending </em>sentencing. He argues, however, that Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) makes presentence confinement the equivalent of post-sentencing confinement for purposes of credit. Therefore, he concludes that he is entitled to credit. In addition, Dedo contends that under Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a), he was entitled to receive credit against his sentence for the time he spent under home detention because he was \u201cin custody\u201d; that is, he was actually in the constructive custody of the WCDC even though he was physically confined in his home. He further asserts that he was in \u201ccustody\u201d while in home detention because the Home Detention Contract provided that he could be charged with escape under Art. 27, \u00a7 139 for any unauthorized departure from his home. Alternatively, Dedo contends that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying credit for the time he served in home detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The State argues that Dedo is not entitled to credit against his sentence for the time he spent in home detention while awaiting sentencing because home detention is not \u201ccustody\u201d within the contemplation of the statute, nor can it be considered the equivalent of custody. The State views Dedo\u2019s participation in the home detention program as voluntary, and thus, not the equivalent of incarceration, because home detention was imposed at Dedo\u2019s behest to enable him to visit his personal physician. The State also argues that he was not committed to a jail or a correctional facility. The State also suggests that home detention was utilized by the court as a \u201cform of conditional bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Article 27, \u00a7 6380(a) mandates that where an individual is in custody before trial and is subsequently convicted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the charge for which that individual was held, the \u201ctime spent in custody prior to the imposition of sentence must be credited against the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Fleeger v. State, </em>301 Md. 155, 160, 482 A.2d 490, 493 (1984). The statute has a dual purpose: to preclude a defendant from \u201cbanking\u201d time before he or she commits a new offense and to eliminate \u201cdead\u201d time, which is time spent in custody that will not be credited to a future sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 163-65, 482 A.2d at 494-95. We observed in <em>Fleeger </em>that \u201c[b]y enacting \u00a7 6380(a), the General Assembly sought to ensure that a defendant receive as much credit as possible for time spent in custody as is consistent with constitutional and practical considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 482 A.2d at 495; <em>see also Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 101, 532 A.2d 1066, 1074 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The question is whether commitment to the custody of the Warden of the WCDC with placement in home detention subsequent to conviction but before sentencing constitutes \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of the credit statute. In order to come within the purview of the statute, Dedo must show that he is (1) \u201cin custody\u201d and (2) in a jail, correctional institution, hospital, mental hospital or other agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987), we had occasion to consider the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the custody of any state, county or city jail, correctional institution, hospital, mental hospital or other agency\u201d within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a). Maus contended that under the statute, he was entitled to credit against his sentence for the time he spent at Second Genesis, a residential drug treatment program, imposed at his request as a condition of his probation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>This Court rejected his argument that his stay at Second Genesis was the functional equivalent of imprisonment and found that residence in a facility such as Second Genesis is not custody within the context of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a). <em>Maus, </em>311 Md. at 104, 532 A.2d at 1076. In construing the meaning of the word \u201ccustody,\u201d we found that the plain language of the statute was of little assistance because the statute does not provide a definition of \u201ccustody\u201d and does not make clear whether the legislature intended to allow credit for time spent in a facility such as Second Genesis. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 532 A.2d at 1074. We observed, however, that the statute appeared to be modeled on \u00a7 3.6(a) of the ABA Standards for Criminal Jus<em>tice </em>\u2014 Standards <em>Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures </em>(Approved Draft 1968), and thus, the ABA Standards provided valuable guidance in interpreting Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a). We concluded that under \u00a7 3.6(a) of the ABA Standards, credit should be awarded for time spent in a drug treatment facility, when the defendant \u201cis civilly committed to the treatment facility and when, in cases of unauthorized departure, he or she is guilty of the crime of escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 532 A.2d at 1075. We deemed mere supervision insufficient to qualify as custody; in order to qualify for credit, the custody \u201chad to be involuntary and pursuant to a court commitment to a public institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 532 A.2d at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We held that the legislature did not intend to provide credit for time spent in facilities such as Second Genesis. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 532 A.2d at 1076. We noted that the court could not have committed a defendant to Second Genesis and that participation in the program was voluntary. Nor could the court have imposed \u201cimprisonment\u201d as a condition of Maus\u2019 probation. <em>Id.; see also Flaherty v. State, </em>322 Md. 356, 364, 587 A.2d 522, 525 (1991); <em>Stone v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 329, 335, 405 A.2d 345, 348 (1979). We found it highly significant that Maus could not have been punished with escape under Art. 27, \u00a7 139 for an unauthorized departure from the Second Genesis program. <em>See Maus, </em>311 Md. at 104, 532 A.2d at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">In <em>Balderston, </em>the Court of Special Appeals considered whether home detention, requested by the defendant as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>condition of probation, was custody under Art. 27, \u00a7 6380(a). 93 Md.App. at 365, 612 A.2d at 336. In that case, the defendant\u2019s probation had been revoked and the original sentence reimposed. The defendant argued that he should be given credit for the time spent in home detention because his confinement was tantamount to imprisonment and custody. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">[V]oluntary home detention, a situation in which a defendant can leave his home to go to work, and has freedom of movement and association within his home, cannot be considered \u201ccustodial,\u201d or the equivalent of custody. On the contrary, the reason appellant requested that he be permitted to participate in home confinement is because it is <em>not </em>the equivalent of custody, <em>i.e., </em>he could tend to his responsibilities and maintain his job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><em>Id., </em>93 Md.App. at 370, 612 A.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In the instant case, the Court of Special Appeals relied primarily on <em>Balderston </em>and <em>Maus </em>in concluding that Dedo was not entitled to credit for the time he spent in home detention post-conviction but pre-sentencing. The court noted, as well, that the majority of courts that have considered whether home confinement constitutes custody for purposes of crediting time have held that it does not. <em>Dedo, </em>105 Md.App. at 454, 660 A.2d at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We find, however, that both <em>Maus </em>and <em>Balderston </em>are distinguishable from the instant case. Where a defendant is punishable for the crime of escape for an unauthorized departure from the place of confinement, the custody requirement of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) is met. A defendant is not in \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) if the conditions of the defendant\u2019s confinement do not impose substantial restrictions on the defendant\u2019s freedom of association, activity and movement such that unauthorized absence from the place of confinement would be chargeable as the criminal offense of escape under Art. 27, \u00a7 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">This approach is consistent with the view we embraced in <em>Maus </em>and what appears to be the view of the majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>jurisdictions that have considered whether to grant credit against a sentence. <em>See Maus, </em>311 Md. at 103, 532 A.2d at 1075; <em>see also, e.g. Lock v. State, </em>609 P.2d 539, 545-46 (Alaska 1980) (defendant entitled to credit where residential treatment program placed substantial restrictions on freedom of movement and behavior such that unexcused departure considered escape); <em>State v. Babcock, </em>226 Kan. 356, 597 P.2d 1117, 1121-22 (1979) (denying credit because circumstances of defendant\u2019s placement in halfway house did not make unauthorized departure punishable under escape statute); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>207 N.J.Super. 126, 504 A.2d 43, 52 (App.Div.), <em>cert. denied, </em>103 N.J. 499, 511 A.2d 671 (1986) (credit for time spent in residential drug treatment facility available only if restrictions so confining that violations constitute offense of escape); <em>State v. Gilbert, </em>115 Wis.2d 371, 340 N.W.2d 511, 515 (1983) (suggesting that credit is due if any part of defendant\u2019s status would be considered \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of the criminal escape statute); <em>Prejean v. State, </em>794 P.2d 877, 879 (Wyo.1990) (credit is due when charge of escape from detention in community correctional facility will lie). This construction is also consistent with the purpose of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) which, as we earlier noted, was enacted to avoid the undesirable consequences of \u201cdead time.\u201d Construing Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) to provide credit for home detention prior to sentencing under the circumstances of this case would effectuate this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In the instant case, the restraints placed upon Dedo while in home detention clearly were sufficiently incarcerative to satisfy the custody requirement of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a). Initially, we note that the WCDC home detention contract characterized Dedo\u2019s confinement as incarceration. For any unexcused or unexplained absence from his home during curfew hours, Dedo could have been charged with escape under Art. 27, \u00a7 139. Moreover, Dedo was actually committed to the custody of the Warden of WCDC, and, throughout the period of his home detention, Dedo was subject to the control of the Warden and the Home Detention staff; any violation of the home detention would have resulted in his immediate imprisonment. Dedo\u2019s movements and activities were electronically monitored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>through telecommunications video surveillance equipment, and he was required to permit members of the home detention staff into his home at any time of the day to install and/or inspect the monitoring equipment and to ensure his compliance with the rules of his home detention. In addition, he was not permitted to possess or consume alcoholic beverages and was subject to random urinalysis and breath alcohol testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Further, we believe that where an individual is punishable for escape for any unexcused absence from the place of confinement, his confinement is necessarily involuntary. Following his conviction, Dedo requested \u201cany type of arrangement to assure that he comes back\u201d for sentencing in order to allow him to receive medical treatment. We are not persuaded that Dedo\u2019s request signifies that the time he spent in home detention was voluntary. <em>Cf. Lock, </em>609 P.2d at 545 (defendant faced with choice between probation in residential treatment program and imprisonment can not be said to have voluntarily chosen condition of probation). Because Dedo could have been charged with escape for any unexcused absence from his home during curfew hours, his participation in the home detention program was involuntary. <em>Compare Reyes, </em>504 A.2d at 52 (denying credit for time spent in residential drug program because violation of program restrictions did not constitute offense of escape). Accordingly, we find that the circumstances of Dedo\u2019s home detention clearly indicate that he was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We also find that under the circumstances of this case Dedo\u2019s home qualifies as an institution contemplated by the terms of Art. 27, \u00a7 6380(a). The trial court ordered Dedo committed to the Warden of the WCDC pending sentencing to be \u201cincarcerated\u201d at his home under the county\u2019s home detention program. Because Dedo was committed to the custody of the Warden for incarceration, he was in the constructive custody of a public institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">We note that the Attorney General, in a 1991 opinion letter, stated that an individual confined in home detention was \u201cincarcerated \u2018in a local detention center,\u2019 in the sense that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>prisoner\u2019s home can be said to be an extension of the local detention center.\u201d 91 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 189, 192 (1991). Further, in a 1994 opinion letter, the Attorney General stated that \u201c[a]n inmate on post-conviction home detention is in the custody of the Division of Corrections pursuant to a court order, and, upon violation of a condition of home detention, may be remanded to prison without further action by the court.\u201d 94 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 279, 283 (1994). While advisory only, we find the opinions persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Accordingly, we hold that under Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) the trial court was required to give Dedo credit against his sentence for the time he spent in home detention from June 15, 1994, until September 2, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
