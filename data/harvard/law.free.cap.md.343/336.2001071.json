That statute was designed to ensure that \u201ccertain basic principles of common sense, justice and fairness,\u201d including notice to interested parties, are applied in administrative procedures, <em>Id., </em>\u201cwithout unduly restricting the agencies in the performance of their various tasks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see also </em>Maryland Code (1995 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.) \u00a7 10-201 of the State Government Article (declaration of policy); Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act, Initial Report on Subtitles 2 and 4 of the APA 2 (1992). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (APA), adopted by Ch. 94 of the Acts of 1957 and based on the MSAPA, therefore, sought to balance the State\u2019s interest in efficient administration against the individuals\u2019 interest in fairness. <em>Cf. </em>Bonfield, <em>State Administrative Rule Making </em>\u00a7 1.2.2 (1986 &amp; Supp.1993) (discussing the 1981 MSAPA); <em>Woodland Private Study Group v.

The agency must publish the proposed regulation in the Maryland Register and may adopt the regulation 45 days later. \u00a7 10-111(a)(1). For 30 out of the 45 days, the agency must accept public comment on the proposed regulation. \u00a7 10-111(a)(3). The AELR Committee may delay adoption of the regulation to allow more time for review. \u00a7 10-111(a)(2)(i). The AELR Committee considers whether the regulation is in conformity with the statutory authority of the agency and the legislative intent of the statute under which the regulation is promulgated. \u00a7 10-111.1(b). If the AELR Committee votes to oppose adoption of the regulation, the agency may withdraw or modify the regulation, or submit it to the Governor for approval. \u00a7 10-111.1(c)(2). The Governor may then order the agency to withdraw, modify, or adopt the regulation. \u00a7 10-111.1(c)(3). Notice of the adoption of the regulation must be printed in the Maryland Register. \u00a7 10-114. This process is commonly known as \u201cnotice and comment\u201d rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The APA also provides for \u201cEmergency Adoption\u201d of regulations. If an agency deems it necessary, \u00a7 10-111(b)(1) allows immediate adoption of regulations by submitting the regulation and a fiscal impact statement to the AELR Committee. A majority of the AELR Committee or the chair or co-chair may approve the regulation. \u00a7 10 \u2014 111(b)(2)(i). A public hearing must be held at the request of any member of the AELR Committee. \u00a7 10 \u2014 111(b)(2)(ii). The circuit courts must declare invalid any regulation adopted in violation of these procedures. \u00a7 10-125(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is charged with developing a State plan to provide services to persons with developmental disabilities through \u201cconsultation, cooperation, contract, or direct operation\u201d of facilities. Maryland Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(1994 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.) \u00a7 7-303 \u2014 305 of the Health-Gen. Article. DDA may provide for community-based residential programs such as public or private group homes or alternative living units. \u00a7 7-601. The Chimes, Inc. is one of 93 private entities with which DDA contracts to provide such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In 1987, DDA established by regulation the \u201cProspective Payment System\u201d (PPS) for reimbursement of private providers. Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (COMAR) 10.22.17. The regulation incorporates by reference the \u201cProspective Payment System for Community Services to the Mentally Retarded and Developmentally Disabled Clients Procedures Manual (First Edition)\u201d (Manual). COMAR 10.22.17.02.A. The Manual explains that the PPS is \u201ca system based on a fixed price per day per client.\u201d Manual at 800-3. It is intended to give providers the incentive to provide quality care efficiently and the flexibility to develop innovative programs, as well as to give accountability to providers and DDA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">To be included in the PPS, a provider must operate under a grant contract for two years, giving DDA the opportunity to review the provider\u2019s costs. When a provider is accepted into the PPS, it is exempted from the State\u2019s competitive bidding requirements. Maryland Code (1995 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.) \u00a7 11-101(n)(2)(iii) of the State Fin. &amp; Proc. Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Under the PPS, payments to providers are based on two categories of costs or \u201ccost centers.\u201d COMAR 10.22.17.10.A. The first is the Client Assessment Sub-System, or \u201cthe costs of providing routine services to clients,\u201d COMAR 10.22.17.01.-B.(25), and is not at issue in this case. The second set of cost centers is the Provider Component which includes administration, general, capital, special, and transportation costs. CO-MAR 10.22.17.01.B.(51). DDA bases reimbursement rates upon reports submitted by the providers. COMAR 10.22.17.06. DDA eliminates costs that are not reimbursable, such as advertising and lobbying expenses, COMAR 10.22.17.13, and adjusts the reimbursement rate for inflation and attendance rates. Manual at 800-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Sections 7-205 and 7-234(a) of the State Finance &amp; Procurement Article prohibit State agencies from spending money in excess of budget appropriations. The DDA regulation, accordingly, establishes that the PPS \u201cis subject to the budget appropriations approved by the Legislature.\u201d COMAR 10.22.17.02.E. The regulation further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">The Department may take cost containment measures to control total expenditures on the prospective payment system. These cost containment measures may include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">(1) Sharing in any surplus on prospective payments less actual cost;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">(2) Establishing limits on the percentage of the prospective payment rate for any cost center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">COMAR 10.22.17.08.A. In addition, the Manual provides that \u201c[o]ther cost containment measures for budgetary control may also be necessary.\u201d Manual at 800-8. The regulation and the Manual were incorporated into the \u201cProvider Agreement\u201d between DDA and Chimes in paragraph IA in which Chimes agreed to comply with the applicable statutes and regulations, as well as \u201ctransmittals and guidelines issued by the Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">To stay within budget appropriations, DDA has instituted numerous cost containment measures over the years. In fiscal year (FY) 1990, DDA set a ceiling for certain cost centers at one standard deviation above the average cost for all providers. DDA cut the annual inflation rate from 6% to 2.5% in FY 1991 and again to 0% in FY 1993. In FY 1992, DDA froze the hourly rates in the Client Assessment Subsystem. In FY 1993, the ceiling rate was calculated using a weighted average and was cut to .75 standard deviations above the mean. Beginning in FY 1993, DDA cut $37 per client per month from each provider\u2019s rate for 21 consecutive months. Providers were notified of these cost containment measures by memoranda from DDA. Although the agency did not follow APA \u201cnotice and comment\u201d or emergency rulemaking proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>dures in instituting these cost containments, no provider challenged any of these actions prior to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In August 1993, DDA met with members of the Maryland Association of Community Services to discuss reimbursement rates for FY 1994. DDA subsequently notified providers in individually-addressed memoranda that it was taking several steps to control costs. At issue here is DDA\u2019s limitation on the growth in the administration, general, capital, and transportation cost centers to 7% for providers whose costs were below the mean and 4% for providers whose costs were above the mean. In FY 1994, DDA applied the \u201cgrowth cap,\u201d calculating averages for each cost center separately. In FY 1995, DDA again imposed the \u201cgrowth cap,\u201d using an aggregate of four cost centers to determine whether providers were above or below the mean. As a result of this action, Chimes\u2019 reimbursement rate was cut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Chimes initially appealed imposition of the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d to the PPS Appeal Board, which is empowered to hold evidentiary or oral hearings on the calculation of the reimbursement rate, the final reimbursement amount, and other disputes between providers and DDA. Manual at 700-3, 7. The PPS Appeal Board delegated its authority to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). The parties filed cross motions for summary decision. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), ruled in favor of DDA. OAH, the ALJ held, \u201cmay rule on whether a statute or regulation was appropriately applied by the agency, but has no authorization to determine the validity of the regulation itself,\u201d and was, thus, without jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Chimes then filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County claiming that DDA\u2019s adoption of the 4%/7% \u201cgrowth cap\u201d violated the rulemaking procedures required under the Maryland APA. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the circuit court held, on January 25, 1995, that the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d was a regulation under the APA and was not within the \u201cinternal management\u201d exception of \u00a7 10-101(g)(2)(i) of the APA. The court also rejected DDA\u2019s contention that the existing regulation (COMAR 10.22.17.08.A) grants DDA the authority to implement cost containment measures without following APA rulemaking procedures. It declared the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d invalid and later granted supplemental relief in the amount of $941,788 for FY 1994 and a similar amount for FY 1995, to be determined at the end of the fiscal year. DDA appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before arguments in that court, we granted a Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">DDA argues that \u201c[j]ust as an agency must have the discretion to decide whether to proceed by rulemaking or case-by-case adjudication, it must also possess the flexibility in applying existing regulations to respond to the myriad situations that it routinely confronts in the pursuit of its regulatory mission.\u201d Specifically, it says that the question presented is whether it must undergo \u201cthe rigorous and time-consuming requirements of the rulemaking process each time it seeks to implement existing regulations that authorize the State to take cost containment measures to stay within its budgetary appropriation in administering a government program through private contractors.\u201d It further says that the State\u2019s right to limit the amount that contractors may be reimbursed for their overhead costs does not constitute a quasi-legislative judgment giving rise to a new rule, but rather amounts to no more than the specific application of the core authority that underlies the entire PPS. In this regard, DDA explains that its action effected no change in existing law but merely applied a regulation that notified all participants in the PPS that the State has the right to impose the same cost containment measure that was implemented in this case. According to DDA, requiring that it amend its regulation each time it must account for unpredictable contingencies constitutes an unnecessary and costly burden on the State at the expense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>proper efficient and effective government. Thus, DDA maintains that it was authorized to impose cost containment measures without following APA rulemaking procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 501 A.2d 48 (1985), the Maryland Attorney General proceeded by adjudication against a company which sold diet pills through the mail, alleging that its advertising was false and misleading in violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 501 A.2d 48. The company claimed that since the same advertising practices were used industry wide, the rule would apply to many companies, and the Attorney General should have proceeded by rulemaking as required by the APA. <em>Id. </em>at 753, 501 A.2d 48. We held that the Attorney General was not required to proceed by rulemaking because he \u201cdid not change existing law or even formulate rules of widespread application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756, 501 A.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We again declined to require formal rulemaking procedures in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986). The Public Service Commission, when determining whether a utility is entitled to a fuel rate adjustment, is authorized by statute to consider whether the utility\u2019s plants operate at a \u201creasonable level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 501 A.2d 1307. The Commission partially denied BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s requests for fuel rate adjustments to recover the costs of purchasing supplemental power during forced outages at BG &amp; E\u2019s plants. The Commission determined that the outages were partially due to \u201cmanagerial imprudence\u201d and, thus, the plants were not operating at a \u201creasonable level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153-55, 501 A.2d 1307. We held that the Commission was not required to proceed by rulemaking because the Commission had not applied \u201cmaterially modified or new standards ... retroactively to the detriment of a company that had relied upon the Commission\u2019s past pronouncements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 501 A.2d 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The only time we have mandated that an agency proceed by rulemaking was in <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 692-93, 575 A.2d 324 (1990). In that case, the Comptroller used a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>method of calculating Maryland\u2019s share of CBS\u2019s advertising receipts. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 575 A.2d 324. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">The effect of the Comptroller\u2019s audit was to announce a substantially new generally applicable policy with respect to apportionment of the network advertising income of national broadcasting corporations. That change, for practical purposes, amounted to a change in a generally applicable rule. Unlike the agency action in <em>Consumer Protection, </em>it <em>was </em>an effective \u201cchange [in] existing law\u201d and <em>did </em>\u201cformulate rules of widespread application.\u201d Unlike the agency action in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec, </em>it <em>was </em>\u201ca case ... in which materially modified or new standards were applied retroactively to the detriment of a company that had relied upon the [agency\u2019s] past pronouncements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 699, 575 A.2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In this case, DDA did not formulate new rules of widespread application, change existing law, or apply new standards retroactively to the detriment of an entity that had relied upon the agency\u2019s past pronouncements. The \u201cgrowth cap\u201d at issue here applied only to a limited number of providers in their capacity as contractors with a state agency pursuant to contracts between the parties subject to termination by either side. Furthermore, the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d applied only in a particular program, in a particular year, and in response to a particular budget crisis. Thus, the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d was not a rule of widespread application.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The \u201cgrowth cap\u201d did not, as we said, change existing law. Both the statute and regulation limited DDA\u2019s expenditures to budget appropriations and the regulation and Manual provided for cost containment. The regulation specifically contemplated the need for \u201cestablishing limits on the percentage of the prospective payment rate for any cost center.\u201d COMAR 10.22.17.08.A. The \u201cgrowth cap\u201d merely effectuated these policies, but did not change the law. <em>Cf. Radiological Soc. v. New Jersey State Dept. </em>208 N.J.Super. 548, 506 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>755, 760 (1986) (policy statement need not be promulgated as regulation where it \u201cwas simply a re-affirmation of the certificate of need requirements already enunciated in existing regulations ... and does not constitute a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position.\u201d); <em>Bendix Forest Etc. v. Div. of Occup. S. &amp; H., </em>25 Cal.3d 465, 158 Cal.Rptr. 882, 887, 600 P.2d 1339, 1344 (1979) (state agency did not engage in rulemaking when it required an employer to provide gloves for employees, but merely implemented a regulation that provided \u201c[h]and protection may be required for employees.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Finally, the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d did not apply new standards retroactively to the detriment of an entity that relied on prior agency pronouncements. The \u201cgrowth cap\u201d did not apply retroactively, but was instituted to control costs in the current fiscal year. The regulation and the Manual notified the providers that reimbursement was limited by budget appropriations and DDA had instituted numerous cost containment measures previously. In addition, DDA notified the providers that it needed to implement additional measures in FY 1994 and afforded them the opportunity to discuss various options for controlling costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Chimes\u2019 interest in fairness was substantially honored, despite the lack of APA procedures. On the other hand, DDA had a strong interest in adopting a cost containment policy as quickly as possible. DDA\u2019s FY 1996 adoption of the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d as a regulation through emergency adoption procedures took months to complete. Such a time lag is a huge burden on an agency administering a complex program such as the Prospective Payment System. As Judge Eldridge said for the Court in <em>Judy v. Schaefer, </em>\u201cflexibility is needed in the administration of the budget in order for the State to run efficiently and to avoid deficits.\u201d 331 Md. 239, 261, 627 A.2d 1039 (1993) (upholding statute authorizing Governor to reduce budget appropriations by up to 25%).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We hold, therefore, that following the standards enunciated in <em>CBS, Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec., </em>and <em>Consumer Protection, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cgrowth cap\u201d was not a \u201cregulation\u201d in the sense contemplated by the APA and need not have been promulgated according to APA rulemaking procedures. <em>See also Dep\u2019t v. Lions Manor Nursing Home, </em>281 Md. 425, 430, 378 A.2d 1351 (1977) (nursing home vendor payment schedule was valid as a contract amendment regardless of its status under the APA).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">BELL, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">.

Thus, the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d was not a rule of widespread application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcW\">In doing so, it stresses several factors: the purpose of the APA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; the existence of regulations and a manual pertaining to the PPS<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; the prohibition, contained in Maryland Code (1985, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1995 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 7-205<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 7-234(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the State Finance &amp; Procurement Article, against State agencies exceeding their budget appropriations; and the fact that DDA, in the past, without protest or challenge, had instituted other cost containment measures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of its conclusion that the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d rather than change existing law, simply effectuates existing policy, the majority asserts that one of the properly promulgated regulations, COMAR 10.22.17.08.A, contemplates \u201cestablishing limits on the percentage of the prospective payment rate for any cost center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>I gather from the foregoing that the majority does not view the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d as a regulation within the contemplation of APA \u00a7 10-101(g). The majority also seems to be saying that this particular cost containment measure is covered by the properly promulgated existing regulations and, in any event, it strikes the proper balance of being fair to the appellee and giving the agency the flexibility it needs to maintain an efficient operation. I am not persuaded. In fact, I find the reasoning of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Kahl, J.) to be compelling. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The appellant argued before the circuit court, as it has before this court, that the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d is not of widespread applicability. The circuit court rejected that argument, I think properly, relying on opinions of the Attorney General addressing that very point. I adopt its analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">The two best analyses of the notion of \u201cgeneral application\u201d in Maryland are found in 72 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>230 (July 8, 1987) and 75 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>15 (Jan. 23, 1990). Both opinions suggest that the term \u201cregulation\u201d has consistently been, and should be, construed \u201cas broadly as its language and apparent underlying intent direct.\u201d 75 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>15, 22 (quoting 72 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 230, 233). Accordingly, it would seem that any doubt should be resolved by finding the policy to be one of \u201cgeneral application\u201d.... The Attorney General has also set forth in 72 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>230, n. 4, which DDA has relied upon in support of its contention that policies aimed at those in contractual relations with the agency in question are ordinarily not of \u201cgeneral application.\u201d The Attorney General stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">In 72 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>230, 234 n. 4 (1987) we suggested that when \u201ca group of persons in a contractual relationship with a State agency [are] affected by agency directives authorized under the contract,\u201d those directives might not be of \u201cgeneral application\u201d and hence might be outside the definition of \u201cregulation\u201d in the APA. That suggestion, however, did not have in mind directives under a complex program like Medicaid, having effects on a large group of providers and, potentially on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>program beneficiaries as well. Thus, the better approach is to view Transmittal No. 91 as of \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d and then analyze its effects in considering whether the internal management exception applies to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">75 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>15, 24 n. 9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">Admittedly the PPS program is not as broad as Medicaid and covers, to date, only 93 providers, however the number of program beneficiaries to be impacted by the 1994 cost containment policy is potentially enormous. Accordingly, this Court adopts the rationale of the Attorney General set forth above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">The Attorney General has also opined that \u201c[e]ven though an action applies to persons within a small class, the action is of general application if that class is described in general terms and new members can be added to the class.\u201d 72 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>230, 234 n. 4 (quoting <em>Citizens for Sensible Zoning v. Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>90 Wis.2d 804, 280 N.W.2d 702, 707-708 (1979). As asserted by Chimes, the 1994 cost containment policy applies to all DDA providers, a class described in general terms. In addition, new members can join that class by executing provider agreements with DDA and providing services for a period sufficient to allow for calculation of historic costs____ Thus it appears the policy is, indeed, one of \u201cgeneral Application\u201d within the definition of SG 10-101(1)(e)(i), regardless of how this Court chooses to address that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The circuit court also properly rejected the appellant\u2019s argument, premised on the cost containment measure being merely reflective of existing regulations and, hence, simply effectuates the policy expressed therein. It relied on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r. v. Bankers Independent Insurance Company, </em>326 Md. 617, 624, 606 A.2d 1072, 1075 (1992). In that case, Chief Judge Murphy, the author of the majority opinion in this case, speaking for the Court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">[A] legislatively delegated power to make rules and regulations is administrative in nature, and it is not and can not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the power to make laws; it is only the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of the legislature as expressed by the statute. Legislation may not be enacted by an administrative agency under the guise of its exercise of the power to make rules and regulations by issuing a rule or regulation which is inconsistent or out of harmony with, or which alters, adds to, extends or enlarges, subverts, impairs, limits, or restricts the act being administered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asd\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">I note, at the outset, that the circuit court is absolutely correct \u2014 COMAR 10.22.17.08.A, upon which the appellant relies as authorizing it to proceed as it did and thus permits it to argue that the subject regulation is not a regulation at all, does not pass muster under <em>Bankers. </em>More fundamentally, I also agree with the circuit court that the subject \u201cgrowth cap,\u201d whatever the majority\u2019s characterization, is a regulation within the definition set forth in \u00a7 10-101(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The majority states that the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d is not the statement of a new policy and that it did not change existing policy. The majority misspeaks. A form of reimbursement that requires the payment of all expenses incurred by the provider in supplying the services overseen by the agency is significantly different from one that recognizes, for reimbursement purposes, only some of those expenses. The moment the agency issues a directive adopting the new formula, that draws the distinction, it has stated a new policy and it certainly has significantly altered the old one. The only similarity between the two policies is that they both are reimbursement methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Prior to issuing the regulation which is the subject of this case, the DDA regulations required the DDA to reimburse the PPS provider based on the reports they submitted, adjusting for inflation and attendance rates. See COMAR 10.22.17.06 and Manual at 800-9. After the regulation, reimbursement was based on the provider reports and a \u201cgrowth cap\u201d imposed by the agency. Contrary to the majority, I consider the difference quite significant. Moreover, I am hard-pressed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>find its authorization in the formally adopted regulations. There really is a difference between saying that certain measures may have to be taken in the future and, when the circumstances requiring the taking of the measures have occurred, formulating the precise responsive measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The APA prescribes the formal process, in accordance with which regulations must be promulgated and adopted. <em>See </em>APA \u00a7\u00a7 10-109-117.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It would indeed be a subversion of the purpose and intent of this aspect of the APA if, as Judge Kahl pointed out, an administrative agency were enabled to \u201csidestep [these] requirement[s] merely by allowing for implementation of \u2018regulations\u2019 by administrative fiat.\u201d But that is precisely the effect of the appellant\u2019s theory, adopted by the majority: a statement of agency policy otherwise meeting the definition of \u201cregulation\u201d somehow is rendered not a regulation by virtue of the agency having previously adopted a broad, open-ended rule contemplating future action by the agency. But a \u201cregulation\u201d is no less a \u201cregulation\u201d simply because a previous regulation has been drafted so as to recognize, if not anticipate, that, sometime in the future, it may be necessary to adopt other, different policies than those presently reflected in the formally adopted regulations, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>include those that are the subject of the \u201cregulation\u201d at issue. And because it is a regulation and remains one despite the reference in the existing regulation, it too must be promulgated with the required formality. Anticipating the need for the policies such a regulation would effectuate in advance of the need for their implementation provides no basis for the informal rule-making that occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">If the majority is correct, the benefits of formal rule-making will be significantly undermined. No longer will amendments to regulations to take account of changed circumstances be necessary. Each agency can be expected to include in the regulations it promulgates language indicating that it may be necessary for the agency to take future action of a general nature to address changed circumstances. Under this opinion, that would be all that is required to permit the agency to issue detailed directives, informed by the facts as they have developed, which significantly changes the policies announced by the original regulations. The fairness intended for the interested parties will be largely lost. At the same time, the very real potential for administrative agencies to abuse their power will concomitantly increase and at the expense of the very parties to whom the APA was intended to be fair. As the appellee puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Such a regulatory short-cut completely undermines the APA\u2019s goal of ensuring fairness and efficiency by allowing regulated populations who may be significantly affected by the proposed agency policy to participate in the rulemaking process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In short, taking the majority\u2019s approach skews the balance and it does it precipitously.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Neither time, expense, nor the need for flexibility warrants this result. When a regulation is required by the Legislature to be formally promulgated, it must be formally promulgated, notwithstanding the expense, the time involved, or the lack of flexibility that entails. <em>Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery County Lodge 35 et al. v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 172-79, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>680 A.2d 1052, 1061-65 (1996). Expediency simply should not be allowed to hold sway over the regular and rightful process to which an interested party is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In any event, I am not convinced that requiring the DDA to follow the proper procedure for adopting regulations is so time-consuming or costly as to warrant its avoidance. The emergency rule-making procedures, which, according to the majority, are also too burdensome, are, in fact, intended and designed to take account of, and accommodate, the need for the agency to act quickly and with dispatch, thus giving it the needed flexibility. At the very least, the agency should be required to follow those procedures whenever -it desires to change, expand or clarify the regulations pursuant to which it and the providers under the program it administers are working. To the majority, however, it appears that nothing short of complete authority informally to make rules will suffice. It, like the agency would completely abrogate the APA\u2019s requirement that amendments to existing regulations be adopted with the same formality that accompanied the original regulation. That approach renders nugatory the portion of \u00a7 10-101(g) that prescribes that requirement, contrary to the usual rules of statutory construction. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v.
