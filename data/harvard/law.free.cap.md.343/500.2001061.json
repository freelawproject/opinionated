Two of the plaintiffs were men suffering from asbestos-related mesothelioma, and another was the surviving wife of a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>who had died of mesothelioma. Their cases were consolidated for trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Today we address the numerous issues raised in appeals from judgments entered following the consolidated trial, in which three of the direct defendants were found liable by the jury for varying amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages were assessed against one of those defendants. We affirm all the liability verdicts and the compensatory .damages awarded by the jury, and reverse the punitive damages award for lack of sufficient clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">A. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">These suits were brought to recover damages resulting from asbestos exposure experienced by Harvey Scruggs, Ralph Garrett, and William Hohman. All three men worked with or near asbestos pi\u2019oduets for several years in a variety of jobs, described in more detail in the following paragraphs and later in the opinion when relevant to our analysis. Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Garrett, still alive when suit was instituted, have since died of malignant pleural mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer believed by medical experts to be caused almost exclusively by exposure to and inhalation of asbestos dust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lenora Scruggs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>as personal representative of Mr. Scruggs\u2019 estate,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Louis Bittner, as personal representative of Mr. Garrett\u2019s estate, were substituted as plaintiffs at trial and are appellees in this case. Mr. Hohman died in 1986 of mesothelioma and his wife Jeanette instituted suit both as personal representative of his estate and on her own behalf; she too died during trial and the personal representative of her estate, her daughter, Victoria Croghan, was substituted as a plaintiff in her mother\u2019s wrongful death action and as the successor personal representative of the estate of William Hohman. She is the third appellee in this case. For convenience, however, we will refer to the three men who died of mesothelioma, rather than their personal representatives, when discussing the issues presented in this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The three defendants/appellants before us are Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation (hereinafter \u201cOCF\u201d), Porter Hayden Company (hereinafter \u201cPH\u201d) and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cOI\u201d). PH was an insulation distributor and installer in industrial facilities around Baltimore. OCF and 01 manufactured and distributed products containing asbestos, notably pipe and boiler insulation. From the late 1940\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>to 1953, OI manufactured and distributed Kaylo, an insulation material containing asbestos. From 1953 to 1958, although OI was still the manufacturer of Kaylo, OCF distributed the product; in 1958, OCF bought the Kaylo manufacturing facility from OI and continued to manufacture and distribute Kaylo until 1972, when asbestos-free Kaylo was introduced. The other direct and cross-claim defendants in this consolidated case are not parties to this appeal, although liability of cross-claim defendants is an issue and will be addressed in part III, section B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">B. <em>Harvey Scruggs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">From 1968 to 1972, Mr. Scruggs was an equipment mechanic apprentice and journeyman at the Curtis Bay Coast Guard Shipyard in Baltimore as a civilian employee of the Navy. In 1970, for a two-month period of time, Mr. Scruggs was also trained to be and worked as a pipecoverer. During those four years, according to his own testimony, he worked mostly in the boiler and engine rooms of Coast Guard cutters, exposed daily to asbestos products:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cQ. When you were working in the engine and boiler rooms, Mr. Scruggs, did the dust from the asbestos products get in your hair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">Q. Did it get in your nose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">Q. Did it get in your mouth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">A. Some of it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">Q. What did your clothes look like at the end of any particular day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">A. Dusty. My face was dusty, my glasses were dusty, my hair was dusty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">Mr. Scruggs testified at trial that the asbestos dust came in part from the daily sawing and cutting of OCF Kaylo, an insulation available in block and pipecovering form, in the boiler rooms in which he worked. Kaylo was described thus in a 1956 marketing brochure produced by OCF:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201cKaylo\u00ae Block Insulation, a white, rigid hydrous calcium silicate heat insulation developed and manufactured by Owens-Illinois Glass Company and distributed nationally by Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, effectively insulates indoor and outdoor heated equipment up to 1200 \u00b0 F. Kaylo Block Insulation offers excellent heat insulation, high strength and moisture resistance to a variety of high temperature installations. A chemically-reacted material, it contains asbestos fibers for reinforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Kaylo contains approximately 15% asbestos. Jerry Helser, quality control supervisor at the Kaylo plant in Berlin, New Jersey in the 1960\u2019s, testified that asbestos fibers were critical to the production of Kaylo. Asbestos served as a reinforcement, or a bonding agent, to hold together in solid block form the variety of minerals which, when combined and heated under pressure in an autoclaving process, reacted to form the hydrous calcium silicate. The dust created by cutting or sawing Kaylo contained asbestos fibers which could be inhaled.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Mr. Scruggs and a co-worker, Donald Kaiser, also testified to seeing PH trucks at the shipyard delivering asbestos materials, including Kaylo and the products of a number of the cross-claim defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">After 1972 the areas of the ships where asbestos pipecovering was used were off-limits to all workers except those who actually installed the pipecovering. Mr. Scruggs continued working for the Navy in a series of office jobs until December of 1992, three months after he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma. He died during the trial, after testifying in a videotaped deposition and in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">C. <em>Ralph Garrett</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In 1942, Ralph Garrett worked full-time for approximately a year as a pipecoverer for Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock, using a variety of asbestos pipecovering, block, and cement insulation products on the ships in the yard. In his videotaped deposition shown to the jury, Mr. Garrett described the dust created in using the block insulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cQ. Mr. Garrett, do you recall what was \u2014 what type of work was done with this asbestos pipecovering that you have referred to? How was it used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">A. Well, it was put on pipes and joints of any such kind, which would be put mud around that. And if it were a big joint, they would put pieces of block on it and put the mud around it to hold, make it a form. <em>And you would have to saw this stuff, and it would make you look like a snowman. That would keep you white all day long, from the time you got there until you left.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Q. Mr. Garrett, do I understand that you, yourself, sawed this insulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">A. Oh, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">(Emphasis added.) During that time, according to his testimony and that of a co-worker William Moody, he used Kaylo pipecovering and block insulation, as well as other asbestos products.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Mr. Garrett then went to work as an electrician, and testified that around 1950, for approximately one year, he worked on a job at Crownsville Hospital near co-workers who were covering pipes using asbestos products and creating asbestos dust which got on his clothes. He identified during his deposition the products used as \u201csome of the ones that we have said before.\u201d This statement apparently referred to his testimony about materials at Maryland Shipbuilding and Dry-dock; Garrett did specifically but tentatively mention Kaylo.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">In 1955 he went to work for Western Electric as an electrician, where he worked for the next thirty years. During his tenure at Western Electric, Mr. Garrett regularly used and cut gasket material containing asbestos. His work with the gasket material created a small amount of asbestos dust, but Mr. Garrett also worked overtime weekends at least twice per month as a pipecoverer for Western Electric; it was on these shifts that he was exposed to asbestos dust from the pipecovering and the \u201cmud\u201d (the cement containing asbestos) used to seal the joints of the pipes. He again identified the brand names of the products they used for pipecovering at Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Electric as the same products he had used at Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock in 1942. His co-workers who testified at trial also identified Kaylo as one of the products used.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Mr. Garrett tentatively identified PH as one of the insulating contractors he worked with and around. One witness, John Lantz, also testified that PH was an outside contractor performing insulation work at Western Electric during 1957-59, installing asbestos pipecovering among other tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Mr. Garrett developed mesothelioma in 1993, and died before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">D. <em>William Hohman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">William Hohman worked for Continental Oil Company (hereinafter \u201cConoco\u201d) from 1952 until his retirement in 1986. His variety of jobs included mechanic helper, loader helper, loader, gauger, braker for the engineers, fire equipment man, and safety inspector. As Mr. Hohman died of mesothelioma in 1986, his co-workers had to testify at trial to the frequency and proximity of Mr. Hohman\u2019s exposure to asbestos products and asbestos dust. Otto Biden, who worked as a steamfitter in the \u201cboiler house\u201d at Conoco, described Mr. Hohman\u2019s exposure as essentially constant, testifying that \u201cBill Hohman, William Hohman was there on every job that was even done at Continental Oil\u201d in the boiler house, where asbestos was in constant use.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Because not all the witnesses at trial knew Mr. Hohman, plaintiffs put on evidence from which his exposure could be inferred. Eyewitnesses identified exactly which asbestos products and suppliers were present at the Conoco plant during Mr. Hohman\u2019s tenure. Documentary evidence of plant operations also confirmed the purchase of certain products, including Kaylo. We review the factual evidence in Mr. Hohman\u2019s case in depth in part III, section C of the opinion, but note preliminarily that some of the witnesses stated that Kaylo was in use at Conoco during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>E. <em>Trial History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The original complaints of the plaintiffs named dozens of defendants, who were all deemed automatically to be cross-claim defendants as well<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; only the three defendants/appellants before us today were found liable. Presentation of evidence in the consolidated trial began on April 7, 1994. Almost four months later, on July 22, 1994, the jury returned its verdicts. In the case of Harvey Scruggs, the jury found OCF and PH jointly and severally liable in negligence and strict liability for compensatory damages in the amount of $3.5 million. In the Garrett case, OCF and PH were found jointly and severally liable for compensatory damages of $1 million. In the Hohman case, the jury found all three appellants before us, OCF, OI and PH, jointly and severally liable for compensatory damages of $1.5 million. No cross-claim defendants were found liable for contribution. Finally, the jury assessed puni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tive damages of $1.5 million against OCF only in the Scruggs case. OCF and 01 moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, in the alternative, a new trial; PH moved for a new trial in the cross-claims proceedings only. The trial judge denied all post-trial motions. Defendants noted their respective appeals to the Court of Special Appeals; we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion before the cases were briefed in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Certain of the issues before us are common to all three defendants/appellants, but each appellant also poses questions unique to itself. We present the questions here in the order and groupings in which we shall address them:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">A. Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in failing to declare a mistrial based on potentially prejudicial events which occurred during trial and improper remarks during plaintiffs\u2019 closing arguments?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">B. Were the jury verdicts in favor of all cross-claim defendants against the weight of the evidence, and were the special verdict sheets unfairly prejudicial to the direct defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">C. Was there legally sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s finding that 01 Kaylo was a substantial contributing factor in Mr. Hohman\u2019s mesothelioma?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">D. Should the jury\u2019s verdicts of compensatory damages against the three defendants/appellants be reduced by the amount of the settlements between plaintiffs and other defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">E. Did Mrs. Hohman\u2019s claim for the wrongful death of Mr. Hohman abate upon Mrs. Hohman\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">F. Was there legally sufficient evidence, using a clear and convincing evidentiary standard, of actual malice on the part of OCF in the Scruggs case to sustain the jury\u2019s assessment of punitive damages against OCF?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">G. Were the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions on punitive damages proper? Moreover, did the trial judge violate OCF\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>due process rights when he failed to conduct a post-verdict review of OCF\u2019s liability for punitive damages? Finally, was the evidence legally sufficient that the twin goals of punishment and deterrence were furthered by the jury\u2019s assessment of punitive damages against OCF?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">A. <em>Motions for Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Defendants/appellants in this case complain that the trial judge abused his discretion in failing to declare a mistrial based on prejudicial events which occurred during trial and improper remarks during plaintiffs\u2019 closing arguments. Although we do not condone the conduct of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, under the circumstances we do not find an abuse of discretion. We shall summarize the parties\u2019 arguments, then set forth the applicable law and our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">OCF, 01, and, by adoption, PH, first contend they were irreparably prejudiced by the highly improper closing arguments of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, who, in the words of defendants, \u201crepeatedly hurled criminal accusations and invectives\u201d at them. Although the trial judge sustained several objections, warned the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and issued two curative instructions, defendants further complain that the trial judge\u2019s efforts to put a halt to the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct were \u201cpathetically inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">For example, counsel in Mr. Hohman\u2019s case stated in closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201cThis is a case of enormous proportions. The conduct of the defendant, of all of these defendants, is of great seriousness. If it were a criminal case, some of them would be on trial for murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">The trial judge sustained the objections to counsel\u2019s phrasing, and stated, \u201cLet\u2019s not mention any criminal activity,\u201d but did not issue a curative instruction to the jury at that time. Hohman\u2019s counsel went on immediately to describe his decedent\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cThe enormity of the injuries here is almost beyond description. The horrors of slow and painful wasting, suffocating, starving death. The worst features of what happened here are the way Mr. Hannon, Mr. Hohman, Mr. Garrett and Mr. Scruggs were tortured on the way to dying. It\u2019s worse than being shot, worse than being beaten to death. They suffered unmercifully from between six months to two years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APD\">Minutes later, despite the trial court\u2019s instructions, the same counsel alluded once again to the criminality of the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201c[The defendants\u2019 lawyers] use what they call the TLV defense, the threshold limit value.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] You know, if someone were to go to work every day, if someone were to go to work every day and poison the boss until the boss died, you know what they would call that. But if the asbestos company poisons a worker a little bit every day, they call it a threshold limit value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">He then accused the defendants of \u201cdeliberate, cold-blooded disregard for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel analogized the defendants to \u201cvillains,\u201d and further compared the defendants\u2019 recordkeeping to the recordkeeping of the Nazis during the Holocaust. They described the disease of mesothelioma dramatically, claiming that it \u201cstalked\u201d its victims, took them \u201chostage\u201d and \u201crobbed\u201d them of life. Finally, one counsel stated that the defendants \u201cstole\u201d the lives of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The trial judge overruled most objections made to these comments by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. He denied a motion for mistrial made several hours after one plaintiffs counsel\u2019s use of the term \u201cmurder,\u201d stating that there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aog\">\u201cno manifest necessity for granting a mistrial. The Court sustained the objection as soon as it was made. And I might parenthetically state that there was no request for a curative comment to the jury, which the Court would have made had one been made. And additionally, even if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>was at that time a manifest necessity, counsel have waived that by letting it pass until now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">One of the defendants\u2019 counsel then requested an immediate curative instruction, a request which was joined by some but not all of the other defense counsel. The attorney who did not join in the request expressed concern that giving the curative instruction so long after the improper remark would \u201cmake matters worse,\u201d a concern which the trial judge apparently heeded as he made only a veiled reference to the improper remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cMembers of the jury, there was an objection during Mr. Hoffman\u2019s opening argument, and I sustained that objection. Disregard the comments that were made by Mr. Hoffman at that time. We advise you that you should disregard those comments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Finally, after closing arguments and just before the jury began its deliberations, the trial judge reiterated his curative instruction, saying to the jury, \u201cComments made analogizing this case to criminal cases are improper and must be totally disregarded by you in your deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">OCF also argues that the prejudice to its case from the improper remarks of opposing counsel was compounded by other circumstances which occurred during the trial, rendering a fair trial impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Mrs. Hohman, decedent William Hohman\u2019s wife who was pursuing his claims and her own in the trial, died of a heart attack during the trial (not in the courtroom). The trial judge determined that the jury members had a right to know of her death and informed them; the transcript reflects \u201cgasps\u201d from the jury. All defendants moved for a mistrial at that time, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Mr. Scruggs, who had appeared in court to testify only weeks earlier, also died during the trial. Defendants objected to the trial judge\u2019s decision to inform the jury of his death as highly prejudicial, but the trial judge determined that the jurors needed to know of Mr. Scruggs\u2019 death and informed them. The transcript again reflected \u201csighs\u201d and \u201cgasps\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>from the jurors. Defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">In addition to the deaths of two plaintiffs occurring during the trial, proceedings were halted for three weeks while the trial judge was ill; one of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, William Whitley, experienced chest pains while testifying, left the stand abruptly, and had to be removed from the courthouse by ambulance; and finally, OCF\u2019s lead counsel had to withdraw from representation halfway through the trial for family reasons. After each of these instances defendants moved for a mistrial, which was denied each time. The judge explained at length to the jury the circumstances behind Mr. Whitley\u2019s sudden illness on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">All of these incidents, according to OCF, \u201ccontaminated the trial\u201d and, in combination with the prejudicial remarks of which all defendants complain, \u201ctranscended any curative effect of the trial court\u2019s cautionary instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As evidence of the prejudice they suffered, defendants point to the failure of the jury to find any cross-claim defendant liable, attributing the jury\u2019s findings in part to the vitriolic attacks directed by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel only at the direct defendants. Defendants maintain that evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 exposure to the products of certain cross-defendants was far greater than the evidence against the direct defendants, and therefore that the jury\u2019s verdict for the cross-defendants and against the direct defendants \u201cmust be interpreted as the result of the prejudicial and improper attacks by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s denial of a mistrial motion, we will not disturb the ruling absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>Medical Mut.

When trial judges exercise discretion, they \u201cbalanc[e] alternative solutions and deeid[e] which one to apply, in order to advance the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>interests of justice.\u201d <em>McCloud v.

State, </em>297 Md. 423, 426-31, 466 A.2d 1286, 1288-90 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Our first question in determining abuse of discretion in denying a mistrial motion is if and to what extent the movant was prejudiced by the denial. <em>See Evans, </em>330 Md. at 19-20, 622 A.2d at 112; <em>Rainville v.

Using alarming terms such as \u201crobbed,\u201d \u201cstole,\u201d \u201chostage\u201d and \u201cstalked,\u201d although not approved, are not likely to influence a reasonable jury unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We admonish plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for their repeated references to murder and analogies to \u201cNazis\u201d and the \u201cHolocaust.\u201d Such terms are unduly inflammatory; moreover, they raise certain images and specters which could be extremely upsetting and unfairly influential to jurors who may have personal experience with the persons and events behind the terms so carelessly tossed about in the courtroom. As the Court of Special Appeals stated in <em>Alexander &amp; Alexander, Inc. v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>88 Md.App. 672, 596 A.2d 687 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>326 Md. 435, 605 A.2d 137 (1992),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u201cThere is no need for snide remarks, pejorative, and unfounded hyperbole or exaggeration ... The search for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>truth, which is supposedly the principal function of a trial, is assisted much more by light than by heat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 704, 596 A.2d at 702-03. <em>See also Keene Corp. v. Hall, </em>96 Md.App. 644, 666-67, 626 A.2d 997, 1009 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Despite the improper nature of certain remarks in plaintiffs\u2019 closing arguments, we do not find overall that defendants were unfairly prejudiced such that the trial judge abused his discretion in failing to grant a mistrial. First, the trial judge actively sought to remedy the problem with two separate curative instructions; moreover, he is correct in noting that defendants\u2019 counsel did not request a curative instruction as they should have, nor did defense counsel request a mistrial at the proper time during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Second, the jury sat through four months of trial testimony and exhibits, sifted through reams of documents, and heard hours of closing arguments. We do not believe the utterance of a few improper words and phrases, while unquestionably a conscious attempt to inflame the passions of the jury, was enough to cancel out the jury\u2019s search for truth among the voluminous evidence. To hold otherwise would be to manifest an unfair mistrust of the jury and its ability to separate rhetoric from fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Finally, although we wish heartily to discourage exactly the type of argument plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made in this case, we cannot justify remanding for a new trial a four-month case with eighteen boxes of record and thousands of pages of transcript when overall the case was extremely well-tried. We do not mean to imply in any way that counsel in future cases should assess the performance of the trial judge and then determine whether it is safe to indulge in improper remarks; to the contrary, although we are unwilling to find undue prejudice here, another case in which unfairly prejudicial argument rears its ugly head might result in the opposite outcome. We simply mean that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he evaluated the conduct of the entire four-month trial, weighed the improper remarks against that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>backdrop, and determined that granting a mistrial would not be just.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">OCF\u2019s complaint about other prejudicial events during trial is barely worth comment. Mr. Scruggs was obviously dying of cancer, a fact of which the jury was fully aware; his death during the trial was hardly prejudicial and most certainly had to be communicated to the jury. Mrs. Hohman\u2019s death, while unexpected, was not prejudicial in any way we can discern, and OCF gives us no assistance. OCF merely states in conclusory fashion that the trial was \u201ccontaminated\u201d but does not explain how or why, nor does OCF explain how the other unforeseen events during the trial caused it unfair prejudice. We find it extraordinary that OCF complains in one breath that the trial judge was ill for three weeks and asserts his illness as a foundation for mistrial, and in the next breath asks for a mistrial based on <em>its own counsel\u2019s </em>personal reasons for withdrawing from the case (the premature birth of his son). OCF\u2019s argument that the numerous unfortunate events which occurred during trial were unfairly prejudicial lacks merit entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Nor are we remotely persuaded that the jury verdicts in favor of the cross-defendants are proof of unfair prejudice. As we discuss in the next section, from the facts presented during trial, a reasonable jury could easily have believed that the direct defendants were liable and the cross-defendants were not. Moreover, as we said earlier, this argument implicitly denigrates the jury by assuming that the few inflammatory remarks made about direct defendants would so cloud its judgment that jurors would render verdicts against the weight of the facts presented. We have no such suspicion that the jury would be so easily swayed by emotion that it would forsake its sworn duty, especially after four months\u2019 investment of time and energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">B. <em>Cross-Defendants\u2019Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">OCF and PH ask us to find that the jury verdicts in the Garrett, Scruggs, and Hohman cases in favor of all cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>defendants were \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence.\u201d They contend that during closing arguments plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made \u201cbinding admissions\u201d that sufficient evidence of liability against cross-defendants had been introduced. In addition, PH makes an extensive argument, adopted by OCF, that the verdict sheets were unfairly written so as to favor the cross-defendants and prejudice the direct defendants, and asks us to find that the trial judge abused his discretion by not granting PH\u2019s motion for a new trial on the cross-claims. Their arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Our first order of business is to reiterate longstanding Maryland law that it is not the province of an appellate court to express an opinion regarding the weight of the evidence when reviewing judgment on a jury verdict. <em>See Fowler v. Benton, </em>245 Md. 540, 545, 226 A.2d 556, 560 (1967) (judging weight of evidence is the province of the jury alone); <em>Gray v. Director of Patuxent Inst., </em>245 Md. 80, 84, 224 A.2d 879, 881 (1966); <em>Benkoe v. Plastic Assembled Prod., </em>231 Md. 419, 420, 190 A.2d 638, 639 (1963) (\u201cWhen properly reserved, we pass upon the sufficiency of evidence to take a case to the jury, but we do not review the weight of the evidence after it has been passed upon by the jury\u201d); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. State, </em>162 Md. 49, 56, 158 A. 45, 48 (1932); <em>Stouffer v. Alford, </em>114 Md. 110, 116, 78 A. 387, 389 (1910); <em>Fraidin v. Weitzman, </em>93 Md.App. 168, 193-94, 611 A.2d 1046, 1059 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 Md. 109, 617 A.2d 1055 (1993). Even if a jury verdict is \u201cinconsistent\u201d in the sense that certain findings of fact cannot logically be reconciled with each other, we will normally not reverse a jury\u2019s verdict either in a civil or a criminal case. <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 594, 479 A.2d 1344, 1349 (1984); <em>Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc. v. Balbos, </em>84 Md.App. 10, 35-36, 578 A.2d 228, 240 (1990); <em>Steffey v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 647, 662, 573 A.2d 70, 77 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Thus, almost as a matter of hornbook law, we reject defendants\u2019 argument regarding the weight of the evidence. We refuse to re-evaluate the evidence and invade the territory of the jury. The evidence against cross-defendants was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>cient to be submitted to the jury, and in any case obviously defendants/appellants would not wish to make an argument of insufficiency. Beyond that, the jury and the jury only has the power to assess the weight of the evidence, a power which passes to the trial judge\u2019s discretion upon motion for a new trial. <em>Weissman v. Hokamp, </em>171 Md. 197, 201, 188 A. 923, 925 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Lest we are suspected of merely misinterpreting defendants/appellants\u2019 apparent argument that we ought to reweigh the evidence presented to the jury, we note that we thoroughly combed both sets of briefs (each defendant/appellant adopted the other\u2019s argument) and our transcript of oral argument to ensure that our reading was correct. Perhaps, for example, the phrase \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence\u201d was being used as a less than precise way of saying the trial judge abused his discretion in not granting a motion for a new trial on the cross-claims (as PH actually argues) rather than simply as a legal term of art. We quote the subheading from the OCF brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cTHE JURY\u2019S FAILURE TO FIND EVEN ONE CROSS-DEFENDANT LIABLE FOR CONTRIBUTION WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">OCF went on to summarize (but in some detail) the evidence against the cross-defendants in each case, and argued in conclusion that the jury\u2019s failure to find even one cross-defendant liable \u201cplainly was against the weight of the evidence, and requires entry of judgment in favor of Owens-Corning against these cross claim defendants, or alternatively, a remand for a new trial.\u201d OCF and PH \u201cplainly\u201d misunderstand basic appellate review of judgments on jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">We also note that we are mystified by OCF\u2019s insistence that plaintiffs made \u201cbinding\u201d admissions as to the liability of cross-defendants during argument. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsels could not \u201cbind\u201d the jury, nor parties whom they did not represent, to liability simply because they argued to the jury that they had introduced sufficient evidence to hold certain cross-defendants liable. OCF\u2019s position is illogical; the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>was clearly capable of disagreeing with the plaintiffs\u2019 assessment of the weight of the evidence in the case, and apparently did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">OCF and PH allege two defects in the verdict sheets. First, liability of direct and cross-defendants was treated separately on the verdict sheets for each plaintiffs case; defendants argued that all defendants, regardless of party status, should be included in a single set of questions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>wise, according to defendants\u2019 theory, \u201cthe presentation may have confused the jury.\u201d As evidence that the party status distinctions on the verdict sheets <em>did </em>confuse the jury and result in \u201cillogical\u201d verdicts, PH points out that as a cross-claim defendant in the Hannon case (see footnote 1) OCF was not found liable, but was liable as a <em>direct </em>defendant in the Garrett, Scruggs, and Hohman cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Second, both defendants/appellants argue that the trial court also improperly combined the issues of \u201csubstantial factor causation\u201d and \u201cnegligence\u201d into one cross-defendant question, while asking the same two issues separately in two direct defendant questions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> PH contends the combination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>causation and negligence in one cross-defendant question \u201ceffectively eliminated the possibility of the jury answering with any specificity ... [and] created the impression that direct and cross-defendants may be treated differently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The law governing \u201cspecial verdicts\u201d is found in Maryland Rule 2-522(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cSpecial Verdict. \u2014 The court may require a jury to return a special verdict in the form of written findings upon specific issues. For that purpose, the court may use any method of submitting the issues and requiring written findings as it deems appropriate, including the submission of written questions susceptible of brief answers or of written forms of the several special findings that might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence. The court shall instruct the jury as may be necessary to enable it to make its findings upon each issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Rule 2-522 gives the trial court the authority to design submissions to the jury as well as format the jury\u2019s findings. Maryland appellate courts have observed before that special verdicts are often useful in cases with multiple parties or issues. <em>See, e.g., Kruszewski v. Holz, </em>265 Md. 434, 446, 290 A.2d 534, 541 (1972); <em>Sun Cab Co. v. Walston, </em>15 Md.App. 113, 161, 289 A.2d 804, 829-830 (1972), <em>aff'd, </em>267 Md. 559, 298 A.2d 391 (1973); <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Lascola, </em>31 Md. App. 153, 161-65, 355 A.2d 757, 762-64 (1976). The defendants have presented nothing beyond conclusory allegations that the verdict sheets were prejudicial, which is certainly not sufficient for us to find that the trial judge in this case overstepped his authority in their design. We cannot accept the circular argument that the verdicts against direct defendants and for cross-defendants were \u201cproof\u2019 of prejudice. We do not find it illogical that certain defendants were found to be directly liable in one plaintiffs case and not liable as cross-defendants in another plaintiffs case. The scenario is utterly plausible. Moreover, we simply do not grasp how combining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the issues of substantial factor causation and an ultimate finding of negligence was \u201cconfusing\u201d to the jury or prevented them from answering with \u201cspecificity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">It appears quite plain from the jury verdicts that the plaintiffs carried their burden of persuasion as to direct defendants, but the defendants as cross-plaintiffs did not carry their burden of persuasion as to cross-defendants. Defendants may not like the outcome of the jury deliberations, but they have not demonstrated prejudice. The trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial on the cross-claims was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">C. <em>Legal Sufficiency of Evidence of OI\u2019s Liability in the Hohman Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We now turn to the question of the legal sufficiency of the evidence that OI Kaylo was a substantial contributing factor in Mr. Hohman\u2019s mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">A brief review of the facts will be helpful. In the late 1940\u2019s, OI began manufacture of Kaylo. Sometime in 1953, OI turned over the distribution responsibilities for the Kaylo line to its subsidiary OCF. In April of 1958, OI stopped manufacturing asbestos products altogether and sold its Kaylo product line to OCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">William Hohman, who worked at the Conoco facility in Baltimore City from April of 1952 until his retirement in 1986, was what we have termed a \u201cbystander,\u201d in that he did not work directly with the asbestos products but was in the vicinity of where such products were used. In order for Hohman to have a legally sufficient cause of action against 01, he must prove that 01 products were a substantial causative factor in his illness and ultimate death. We stated what has come to be known as the \u201cfrequency, regularity, proximity\u201d test for substantial factor causation in <em>Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc. v. Balbos:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">\u201cWhether the exposure of any given bystander to any particular supplier\u2019s product will be legally sufficient to permit a finding of substantial-factor causation is fact specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ic to each case. The finding involves the interrelationship between the use of a defendant\u2019s product at the workplace and the activities of the plaintiff at the workplace. This requires an understanding of the physical characteristics of the workplace and of the relationship between the activities of the direct users of the product and the bystander plaintiff. Within that context, the factors to be evaluated include the nature of the product, the frequency of its use, the proximity, in distance and in time, of a plaintiff to the use of a product, and the regularity of the exposure of that plaintiff to the use of that product. Tn addition, trial courts must consider the evidence presented as to medical causation of the plaintiffs particular disease.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><em>Balbos, </em>326 Md. at 210-11, 604 A.2d at 460 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">OI contends that plaintiffs put on no competent evidence that, during the relevant period from April, 1952, when Hohman began work at Conoco, until April, 1958, when OI sold the Kaylo line, Mr. Hohman was exposed to Kaylo to an extent that would meet our substantial factor test of causation. Thus, OI argues that the trial court erred by allowing the issue to go to the jury and not granting judgment for OI.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">OI, in alleging error based on the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment, must meet a high standard. Upon a motion for judgment, \u201cthe court shall consider all evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.\u201d Md. Rule 2 \u2014 519(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Because Mr. Hohman died in 1986 of his mesothelioma, he was unable to testify. Instead, his evidence that Kaylo produced by OI was a substantial factor in his developing mesothelioma rests on the testimony of several of his co-workers at the Conoco plant; on documentary evidence that Kaylo was used at the Conoco facility during the relevant time period; and on the medical testimony of Dr. Victor Roggli.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Lloyd Urps was a union plasterer. He testified that during numerous summers during the fifties and sixties, he worked as a pipecoverer, and that \u201cpractically every summer\u201d between 1952 and 1958 he did so at the Conoco facility where Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Hohman worked. Urps further testified that he used a variety of asbestos products at the Conoco facility, including a round pipecovering asbestos product. He identified this product as manufactured by Johns-Manville, but also stated that Kaylo pipecovering was used. Finally, Urps testified that he used Kaylo asbestos block at the Conoco facility. Urps was not acquainted with Hohman and could not testify to Hohman\u2019s exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">William E. Whitley was an asbestos worker beginning in the 1940\u2019s and continuing until his retirement in 1982. During his career, Mr. Whitley began as an apprentice, and became a mechanic, foreman, superintendent, and manager. Mr. Whitley testified that he worked at the Conoco facility sporadically during the relevant time period (1952-1958). He identified the asbestos products in use at that time as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajpp\">\u201c[pjipecovering products were Johns-Manville, 85 percent mag. Pipecovering and block. We used some Owens-Corning, Kaylo, pipecovering and block.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Whitley, like Urps, did not know Mr. Hohman during the relevant time period, and therefore could not testify regarding Hohman\u2019s exposure to OI Kaylo.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Hohman\u2019s best evidence was provided by Otto Biden. In a twist of irony, Biden was subpoenaed to testify by OI. In Biden\u2019s own asbestos-related suit he had testified that the only asbestos product that he remembered being used at the Conoco facility was produced by Armstrong. At this trial, however, Biden also was able to recall another asbestos product, but could only remember a large \u201cK\u201d on the box. More importantly, Biden also placed Hohman in close proximity to asbestos dust during the relevant period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cQ: And you were in and out of Continental Oil 20 times or more over the years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>A: I probably was, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">Q: Now, in the 1950s, did you work in the boiler house at all at Continental?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">Q: In the 1950s, when you worked in the boiler house at Continental, Bill Hohman was around, wasn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">Q: And in the 1960s, when you worked outside on the unit where all of the pipes were, Mr. Hohman was around, wasn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">A: Bill Hohman, William Hohman was there on every job that was even done at Continental Oil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">Q: Because that was part of his job to be there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">A: He had to give you a piece of paper to go to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">Q: Now, when you worked in the boiler room in the \u201950s, was Bill Hohman around when the dust was generated from the pipecovering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">A: He had to be on every job in that boiler room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">In this way, Biden places Hohman in close proximity to the asbestos work. The testimony of Urps and Whitley, in conjunction with invoices indicating the purchase of Kaylo for the Conoco facility,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are further evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that OI Kaylo was frequently and regularly used at Conoco during the relevant time period. Finally, Dr. Roggli, an expert on asbestos-related disease, testified that, in his opinion, exposure to asbestos caused Mr. Hohman to develop the mesothelioma that killed him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Hohman\u2019s proof of substantial factor causation is similar to that offered by Ira Russell and approved in <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 353-55, 667 A.2d at 125-26. We hold that, under the <em>Balbos </em>\u201cfrequency, regularity and proximity\u201d test, a legally sufficient case against 01 was made out in the Hohman case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">D. <em>Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">OI urges that this Court reject its long-standing interpretation of the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Act [\u201cUCATA\u201d], Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 50, \u00a7\u00a7 16-24, and adopt a new definition of joint tort-feasor. We decline to do so for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The original complaint filed in the Hohman case named twenty-four (24) defendants.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Prior to trial, settlements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>reached with seven of the defendants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The precise terms of the settlements were sealed by the trial judge and not made a part of the record on this appeal. We have, however, exercised our discretion under Md. Rule 8-414(a) and reviewed the release agreements, in which certain sums of money were paid to Hohman\u2019s widow and to her estate in exchange for releasing these defendants from the suit. Additionally, the settlement agreements contained no admission of liability on the part of the settling defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Not all of the defendants were willing to settle, however, and the case proceeded with Anchor Packing Co., Garlock, Inc., OCF, OI and PH as direct defendants.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To review, the remaining direct defendants, in turn, brought cross-complaints against certain settling defendants, but none of the cross-claims was successful; and neither Anchor Packing nor Gar-lock was found liable by the jury, leaving only OCF, 01 and PH as liable defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">OI, as one of the three liable defendants, would have us offset the previously negotiated settlements against the compensatory damages awarded in the Hohman case. The theory underlying this proposal is deceptively simple. The jury valued the Hohman family\u2019s injuries at $1.5 million. If the estates of the Hohmans were allowed to keep both the $1.5 million from the jointly and severally liable defendants (OCF, OI, and PH), and the settlement payments obtained from the cross-defendants, the recovery would exceed the jury\u2019s valuation of the injuries. In OI\u2019s opinion, such a scenario is unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to the liable defendants, and the perceived unfairness could be easily rectified if only we would broaden our definition of a \u201cjoint tort-feasor\u201d to include those sued or threatened with suit. OI could then offset the settlement amounts as contribution by the settling cross-defendants, and the Hohmans\u2019 estates would recover only the amount of money awarded by the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">To accept OI\u2019s argument would require us to ignore the plain meaning of our UCATA statute and our longstanding interpretation of it, which we refuse to do. The relevant term \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d is defined in Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 50, \u00a7 16: \u201cFor the purposes of this subtitle ... \u2018[\u00a1joint tort-feasors\u2019 means two or more persons jointly or severally <em>liable in tort for </em>the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d (Emphasis added). Moreover, \u201c[t]he right of contribution exists among joint tortfeasors,\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 50, \u00a7 17, and only among joint tortfeasors. <em>See Montgomery v. Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 191, 562 A.2d 1246, 1249 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In the instant case, the cross-defendants were ultimately determined by the trier of fact <em>not </em>to be \u201cliable in tort.\u201d Defendants judicially determined not to be liable are not joint tort-feasors. By statutory definition, then, the cross-defendants were expressly not joint tort-feasors and thus OI has no right of contribution against them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">We have often recognized that a judicial determination of liability or non-liability settles the question of contribution. <em>See, e.g., Keene Corp. v.

When Mr. Hohman\u2019s widow, Jeanette Hohman, instituted her suit in 1987, she did so both as the personal representative of Hohman\u2019s estate, and in her individual capacity as his widow. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>course of the trial, Jeanette Hohman died.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Ms. Victoria Croghan was substituted as personal representative of the estate of William Hohman, her stepfather, and as personal representative of the estate of her mother, Jeanette Hohman. While there was no objection to the former substitution, the latter has sparked the present issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">PH has asserted that Jeanette Hohman\u2019s wrongful death action' cannot survive her death unless the substitute plaintiff is also capable of instituting a wrongful death action individually. Md.Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-904(a) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article limits primary wrongful death actions to those brought \u201cfor the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child of the deceased person.\u201d Section 3-904(b) limits secondary beneficiaries to actions \u201cfor the benefit of any person related to the deceased person by blood or marriage who was wholly dependant upon the deceased.\u201d Because William Hohman was Victoria Croghan\u2019s step-father, not her natural father, and she was not \u201cwholly dependant\u201d upon him, PH argues that Croghan cannot serve as the substitute plaintiff and that, therefore, the suit must abate.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">At least partially, PH\u2019s argument is based upon language from our case of <em>Harvey v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., </em>70 Md. 319, 17 A. 88 (1888). This interesting antique is a relic of a different era and absolutely inapplicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Mrs. Harvey was killed crossing a railroad track. Mr. Harvey sued for damages, but died before the suit\u2019s resolution. Our predecessors determined that in the absence of a statutory provision, Mr. Harvey\u2019s suit abated on his death. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 17 A. at 89. It is critical to our purposes to note, however, the <em>Harvey </em>Court\u2019s prefatory comment: \u201c[t]he plaintiff [Mr. Harvey] died before the Act of 1888, ch. 262 was passed, and the question is not therefore affected by the provisions of that Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 17 A. at 89. The Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>not say, but a review of that Act makes clear, that had the new law been in effect at the time of Mr. Harvey\u2019s suit, the opposite result would have obtained. The new law provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cNo action, hereafter brought to recover damages for injuries to the person by negligence or default, shall abate by reason of the death of the plaintiff, but the personal representatives of the deceased may be substituted as plaintiff and prosecute the suit [to] final judgment and satisfaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Chapter 262 of the acts of 1888. This new survival statute supplemented the previously existing law, which permitted a variety of actions to survive the death of the plaintiff. Md. Code (1860), Art. 2, \u00a7 1 (\u201cejectment, waste, partition, dower, replevin, or any personal action, including appeals from judgments rendered by justices of the peace ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The subsequent history of ch. 262 is easy to trace. It was originally codified at Art. 75, \u00a7 33A, but immediately recodified at Md.Code (1888), Art. 75, \u00a7 25. It continued as Md. Code (1904), Art. 75, \u00a7 26, Md.Code (1911), Art. 75, \u00a7 26, Md.Code (1924), Art. 75, \u00a7 30, Md.Code (1939), Art. 75, \u00a7 30, and Md.Code (1951), Art. 75, \u00a7 30. The comprehensive code revision of 1957 apparently failed to continue the provision and it was \u201clost\u201d until six years later. In 1963, a corrective bill returned the provision to the statute books as Md.Code (1957, 1963 Cum.Supp.), Art. 75, \u00a7 15B.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In 1973, as part of the overall code revision process, this section was recodified as Md.Code (1974), \u00a7 6-401 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cSec. 6-401. Survival of Actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\"><em>(A) At law. </em>\u2014 A cause of action at law, whether real, personal, or mixed, except slander, survives the death of either party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>(B) In equity. </em>\u2014 A right of action in equity survives the death of either party if the court can grant effective relief in spite of the death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The revisor\u2019s note makes clear that \u00a7 6-401(a) is intended merely to combine two previous code sections but not to change the types of actions permitted to survive the death of a party. <em>See </em>chapter 2, \u00a7 2 of the acts of 1973, 1st Sp. Sess. Por the purposes of this case, the statute remains unchanged.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The plain language of \u00a7 6-401 indicates that a wrongful death action, as a personal action at law, may survive the death of either party. A similar result would obtain under chapter 242 of the acts of 1888 as applicable immediately after the <em>Harvey </em>decision, because a wrongful death action is one \u201cto recover damages to the person by negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Although the plain language of the statute is controlling, it is useful to confirm that understanding with a look at the statutory scheme and the public policy that animates it. PH argues that permitting survival of a cause of action instituted by a primary beneficiary would displace the secondary beneficiaries. This analysis is incorrect. Instead, in applying the wrongful death statute, we must ask if a statutorily defined primary beneficiary survived the decedent and could file suit. If that primary beneficiary survives to file suit, then that beneficiary, or the beneficiary\u2019s successor, can recover. If there are no living primary beneficiaries to file suit, then a secondary beneficiary may file suit. The secondary beneficiary, or in the event of the secondary beneficiary\u2019s death after institution, but prior to conclusion, of the suit, the successor to the secondary beneficiary, may continue the suit to judgment. If there are neither primary nor secondary beneficiaries living to file suit, no one may recover for the decedent\u2019s wrongful death. Victoria Croghan was the primary beneficiary\u2019s suc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>cessor and as such can recover on behalf of Mrs. Hohman\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The result we must reach is also consistent with the purpose underlying the wrongful death statute. PH\u2019s acts deprived Mrs. Hohman of her husband\u2019s economic and emotional support for the last eight years of her life.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This deprivation was not abated by her death. Her estate may be smaller now than it would have been had her husband survived. Therefore it was perfectly appropriate for the trial judge to substitute Victoria Croghan as the personal representative of the estate of her mother, Jeanette Hohman, in her wrongful death suit against PH.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">F. <em>Punitive Damages Award Against OCF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Only one of the defendants, OCF, was found liable by the jury for punitive damages, in the case of Mr. Scruggs and his exposure to OCF Kaylo during the years 1968-1972. OCF argues strenuously that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof for punitive damages of actual malice, as required by <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633, a strict products liability action involving asbestos exposure. We agree. We review the applicable law and apply it to the evidence presented to the jury in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The purpose of punitive damages is not only to punish the defendant for egregiously bad conduct toward the plaintiff, but also to deter the defendant and others contemplating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>similar behavior. Our most recent reiteration of these twin purposes in an asbestos products liability case was in <em>ACandS, Inc. v. Godwin, supra, </em>340 Md. 334 at 361-62, 667 A.2d at 129 (citing <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 454, 601 A.2d at 649-50; <em>Schaefer v. Miller, </em>322 Md. 297, 321, 587 A.2d 491, 503 (1991), <em>Embrey v. Holly, </em>293 Md. 128, 142, 442 A.2d 966, 973 (1982); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>283 Md. 228, 232, 389 A.2d 359, 361 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">As we discussed in both <em>Zenobia </em>and <em>Godwin, </em>however, the imposition of serious monetary liability for egregious conduct can only work as a deterrent to future conduct if the standard by which conduct will be judged is clear, predictable and consistent and persons can thus conform their behavior to avoid punitive liability. <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 362, 667 A.2d at 129 (citing <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 455, 601 A.2d at 650). Therefore, we established a test for awarding punitive damages in <em>Zenobia, </em>reiterated in <em>Godwin, </em>in which we made clear that a plaintiff must prove actual malice, not simply implied malice, to recover punitive damages in a non-intentional tort action. <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 460, 601 A.2d at 652; <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 358, 667 A.2d at 127. We defined the term \u201cactual malice\u201d as \u201cconduct characterized by evil motive intent to injure, ill will, or fraud.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 359, 667 A.2d at 127-28; <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 460 n. 20, 601 A.2d at 652 n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In products liability cases, however, we have recognized that such evil motive or ill will directed at the injured consumer by the manufacturer is unlikely. Therefore, we constructed a two-part test for actual malice in <em>Zenobia, </em>applied in <em>Godwin </em>as well, which still considers the intentions and state of mind of the defendant manufacturer but which can be readily applied in products liability cases where the actual contact between plaintiff and defendant is attenuated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\"><em>\u201cZenobia </em>recognized the inherent difficulty in translating the aforementioned definition of \u2018actual malice\u2019 to products liability cases. We noted that \u2018it is not likely that a manufacturer or supplier of a defective product would specifically intend to harm a particular consumer.\u2019 Consequently, <em>\u2018in products liability cases the equivalent of the \u201cevil motive, </em>\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>\u201cintent to defraud, \u201d or \u201cintent to injure, \u201d which generally characterizes \u201cactual malice,\u201d is [1] actual knowledge of the defect and [2] deliberate disregard of the consequences.\u2019 </em>This two-part standard looks to the state of mind of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 359, 667 A.2d at 128 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">To meet the knowledge requirement of the <em>Zenobia </em>test for actual malice, a plaintiff must show more than constructive knowledge: \u201c[t]he plaintiff must show that the defendant <em>actually </em>knew of the defect and of the danger of the product at the time the product left the defendant\u2019s possession or control.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 462, 601 A.2d at 653-54 (emphasis in original). Demonstrating a \u201cwillful refusal to know\u201d will also be sufficient to pass the first step of the test for actual malice, if the plaintiff can show that the defendant \u201c \u2018believes that it is probable that something is a fact, but deliberately shuts his or her eyes or avoids making reasonable inquiry with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 360, 667 A.2d at 128 (quoting <em>State v. McCallum, </em>321 Md. 451, 458, 583 A.2d 250, 253 (1991) (Chasanow, J. concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Under <em>Zenobia </em>and <em>Godwin, </em>the plaintiff who successfully shows actual knowledge of the defendant, thereby passing part one of the <em>Zenobia </em>test, must then demonstrate the defendant\u2019s bad faith in order to meet the second requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cAdditionally, a products liability plaintiff must show that the defendant, having such actual knowledge, exhibited a conscious or deliberate disregard of the potential harm to consumers. <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 463, 601 A.2d at 654. Under <em>Zenobia </em>it is clear that \u2018negligence alone, no matter how gross, wanton, or outrageous, will not satisfy this standard. Instead <em>the test requires a bad faith decision by the defendant to market a product, knowing of the defect </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>and danger, in conscious or deliberate disregard of the threat to the safety of the consumer.\u2019 Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 360-61, 667 A.2d at 128 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, under <em>Zenobia </em>plaintiffs in any tort case seeking punitive damages must prove knowledge and bad faith by a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d rather than the preponderance standard used to prove liability for compensatory damages. <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 469, 601 A.2d at 657. We reasoned in <em>Zenobia </em>that the heightened standard of proof was appropriate because not only money but stigmatization was at stake in an award of punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cUse of a clear and convincing standard of proof will help to insure that punitive damages are properly awarded. We hold that this heightened standard is appropriate in the assessment of punitive damages because of their penal nature and potential for debilitating harm. Consequently, in <em>any </em>tort case a plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence the basis for an award of punitive damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\"><em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 469, 601 A.2d at 657 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">We now turn to the instant case and apply the <em>Zenobia </em>test to OCF\u2019s actions in manufacturing and marketing Kaylo during the time Mr. Scruggs was exposed. In determining whether the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof on punitive damages, we are <em>not </em>considering the weight of the evidence presented by the plaintiffs, as that is solely a jury question; rather, we pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to take a case to the jury at all. <em>See Benkoe v. Plastic Assembled Prod., Inc., </em>231 Md. 419, 420, 190 A.2d 638, 639 (1963); <em>May v. Warnick, </em>227 Md. 77, 88, 175 A.2d 413, 419 (1961); <em>Boob v. Fisher, </em>225 Md. 278, 281, 170 A.2d 298, 299 (1961). Therefore, in this case we shall have to find that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law for a reasonable jury to have found <em>by a clear and convincing standard </em>that OCF had actual knowledge of the dangers of Kaylo, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>OCF made a bad faith decision to market Kaylo despite its knowledge of the threat to the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">As we discussed at length in <em>Godwin </em>the general state of the art knowledge up to 1972 concerning asbestos and its effects, 340 Md. at 363-67, 667 A.2d at 129-32, we shall not repeat it here, except where relevant to OCF\u2019s particular arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">1. <em>Conflicting Interpretations of OCF\u2019s Knowledge of Asbestos Hazards and Kaylo Hazards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">OCF argues, in effect, two separate theories as to why it did not have the requisite actual knowledge of Kaylo\u2019s hazards. First, OCF contends that at the time Mr. Scruggs was exposed, OCF did <em>not </em>believe Kaylo was a dangerous or defective product because it \u201cbelieved or hoped\u201d that Kaylo\u2019s unique manufacturing process eliminated the health risk of the asbestos component of Kaylo. Internal OCF documents from the mid-1960\u2019s, contained in the voluminous record in this case and presented to the jury, add support to OCF\u2019s contentions. While the company officials were aware of the potential dangers of asbestos if mishandled, they were not convinced that Kaylo, which contained only 15% asbestos and which was produced through a heat-intensive chemical alteration process, carried the same risks. One writer of a 1964 OCF memorandum commented on Dr. Selikoffs study, <em>supra, </em>n. 2, noting that asbestos was altered chemically and physically \u201cduring the autoclaving process in the presence of lime\u201d and then stating \u201c[w]hether or not this altered asbestos possesses the same cancer inducing tendencies as the original asbestos remains to be demonstrated.\u201d Almost three years later, the very same individual repeated his questions in an internal memorandum reviewing the latest studies confirming asbestos carcinogenicity, asking, \u2018\u2018[D]oes any, or could any, of the organic carcinogenic oils<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> remain in the asbestos fraction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Kaylo after having been subjected to the severe conditions of the autoclave? Would there be chemical alteration in the presence of lime?\u201d The writer also questioned again the applicability of the Selikoff study done three years earlier to Kaylo and other calcium silicate insulations, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHi\">\u201cThus Kaylo insulation is indicted only by inference and association, and not by direct evidence. The only common denominator is that asbestos is a component of thermal insulation in general. The possibility that the carcinogenic property or contaminant of asbestos may be eliminated during calcium silicate processing should not be ignored or dismissed from consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">OCF\u2019s second line of attack is based on the widely prevailing view during the relevant time period of 1968 to 1972 that asbestos dust was not hazardous to a worker\u2019s health until it reached a certain concentration, called a \u201cthreshold limit value,\u201d in the work environment air. The \u201cthreshold limit value\u201d was a term used to describe the average concentration of dust particles (of all kinds, not merely asbestos) per cubic foot of air to which an individual in a work environment where asbestos dust was created could, at least in the consideration of the health experts of the day, be \u201csafely\u201d exposed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> OCF argues that at the time of Mr.. Scruggs\u2019 exposure, company officials believed that even if asbestos\u2019 dangerous properties were not diminished or eliminated in the Kaylo manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>process, the small amount of asbestos in Kaylo would not create a concentration of dust particles exceeding the threshold limit value for asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The same writer commenting on the Selikoff studies noted rather tentatively in another memorandum in 1964 that the dust content in areas where workers used Kaylo could \u201cbe expected normally to be below the threshold limit value,\u201d because \u201cgood housekeeping and efficient working conditions dictate the use of dust collectors over saws and sanding machines in any case.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">OCF also cites to studies it had done in the early 1960\u2019s on the dangers of fabricating Kaylo and other thermal insulations, in which the industrial hygienist who conducted the studies, Robert Peele, found that \u201cthe fabrication of Kaylo insulation with band saws does not constitute a hazard to health.\u201d In a follow-up study several months later, Mr. Peele and his investigators performed three separate intervals of dust sampling, analysis, and evaluation in the Construction Insulation Shop at a Union Carbide plant to resolve \u201cunanswered health problems.\u201d Mr. Peele did not include Kaylo in the third of the three intervals of sampling because the first investigation, without any supplementary ventilation, disclosed only one exposure exceeding the threshold limit value and \u201ctherefore, it could be assumed that any ventilation that might be added could be more than adequate in controlling the hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">OCF\u2019s belief, during the time period of concern in this case, in a \u201csafe\u201d level of asbestos dust was entirely consistent with the prevailing view among industrial hygienists that \u201casbestos-caused diseases, principally asbestosis, could be generally avoided if dust in the work environment could be kept below a certain limit.... \u201d <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 365, 667 A.2d at 130. As we described in <em>Godwin, </em>the U.S. Secretary of Labor publicly acknowledged the controversy over the toxicity of asbestos and \u201cthe determination of a specific level below which exposure is safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 667 A.2d at 131. Further evidence that experts in the 1960\u2019s widely accepted the theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of a safe level of asbestos dust comes from the record in this case. In 1968, the New York Academy of Sciences sponsored a meeting of industrial hygienists chaired by Dr. Irving Selikoff, author of the famous 1964 study linking asbestos and cancer, <em>supra, </em>n. 2. Dr. Selikoff himself, possibly the leading medical authority on the hazards of exposure to asbestos, expressed his view at this meeting that improved working conditions and reduced dust could reduce the health hazards of asbestos. According to the staff person at OCF who attended the meeting, J.L. Konsen, M.D., Dr. Selikoff \u201cproposed an ambitious program of research to develop practical engineering methods to lower the atmospheric dust level on construction jobs with primary emphasis on the insulation workers.\u201d Several months earlier, in a speech to the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers at its annual convention, Dr. Selikoff discussed at length the methods by which asbestos workers and insulators could protect themselves from asbestosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cWell, this is a hazard you people face, and a hazard I hope we are going to be able to clear up. There is no reason under the sun that this can\u2019t be cleared up, none, because it depends upon how much dust, in large part, \u2014 there are individual reactions, not everybody reacts to the dust the same way; there are individual idiosyncrasies, but, basically, it is due to how much dust you fellows breathe in. And if we can\u2019t make the trade safer, we are crazy. If we can\u2019t keep dust out of the air, we don\u2019t deserve to call ourselves the proud United States of America.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The plaintiffs/appellees in the instant case contend that the very same documents in the record relied upon by OCF to show lack of knowledge clearly indicate OCF\u2019s full knowledge of the available state of the art research concerning asbestos and asbestos products and their potentially harmful effects. Dr. Selikoffs study was published and OCF was aware of it three years before Mr. Scruggs began work with Kaylo. The record also reflects that OCF officials were aware of and intensely interested in other research on the carcinogenicity of asbestos being conducted at Fairleigh Dickinson University in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>New Jersey, in Africa, and around the world, before Mr. Scruggs\u2019 employ. In addition, for at least two decades before 1968, senior officials at OCF knew of the voluminous medical evidence concerning asbestosis, a severe and deadly lung disease caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers. It seems incontrovertible that key executive and medical personnel at OCF had read or been apprised of numerous studies showing that asbestos trade workers had an elevated risk of mesothelioma, among other diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">2. <em>Conflicting Interpretations of OCF\u2019s Cautionary Labels on Kaylo and OCF\u2019s Search for An Asbestos-Free Kaylo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We are also presented with reasonable but conflicting interpretations of other OCF actions preceding and during Mr. Scruggs\u2019 exposure. For example, OCF\u2019s knowledge of some level of hazard could be inferred from its decision to label all Kaylo packages advising users of potential hazards and advising safe handling precautions. The record, consisting of internal memoranda, orders to and invoices from packaging companies, and photographs of the Kaylo boxes, reflects that after December 1966 boxes of Kaylo were marked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cTHIS PRODUCT CONTAINS ASBESTOS FIBER \u2014 If Dust Is Created When This Product Is Handled, Avoid Breathing The Dust \u2014 If Adequate Ventilation Control Is Not Possible, Wear Respirator Approved By U.S. Bureau Of Mines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The label was changed in 1970 to be more specific regarding the harm possibly caused by breathing Kaylo dust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">\u201cCAUTION \u2014 PRODUCT CONTAINS ASBESTOS FIBER \u2014 Inhalation Of Dust In Excessive Quantities Over Long Periods Of Time May Be Harmful. Avoid Breathing Dust. If Adequate Ventilation Is Not Possible, Wear Respirators Approved By The U.S. Bureau Of Mines For Pneumoconiosis Producing Dust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On the other hand, the labels on the Kaylo packages recommended safe handling practices, an indication that OCF be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>lieved Kaylo <em>could </em>be safely handled. Such a belief would have been consistent at the time with the state of the art knowledge, as <em>discussed,-supra, </em>and in <em>Godwin, </em>that asbestos was only dangerous when its threshold limit value was exceeded due to poor handling practices and inadequate ventilation. In fact, at the time OCF began to label its Kaylo packages in December of 1966, the federal government had neither adopted safety standards nor promulgated any labeling regulations for asbestos products. It was not until 1972, six years later, that an Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) regulation required a cautionary label on asbestos products<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>; by that time, OCF was six months away from producing asbestos-free Kaylo. OCF also argues that its actions in labeling its cartons years before the government required such labels demonstrated its commitment to protecting the workers who used Kaylo, and therefore negates as a matter of law any charge of bad faith in marketing Kaylo.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The testimony and exhibits in the case showed that OCF embarked on an extensive research project in the mid-1960\u2019s to discover a replacement for asbestos in Kaylo which would serve the same reinforcement and bonding purposes, a project which plaintiffs claim may have indicated OCF\u2019s awareness that any asbestos at all was soon to be no longer an acceptable health risk to workers. The evidence of a search for a replacement bonding agent could appear inconsistent with OCF\u2019s claim that it \u201cbelieved or hoped\u201d asbestos Kaylo was not dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The search for a replacement bonding agent for asbestos, however, while conceivably inconsistent with a claim that asbestos in Kaylo was not dangerous, is also inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that OCF was proceeding to manufacture and market Kaylo in deliberate disregard of safety concerns. The minutes, memoranda, and reports contained in the record which detail the search for an effective asbestos-free Kaylo design refer repeatedly to the \u201cpotential\u201d health hazard presented by asbestos in Kaylo and the \u201curgency motive\u201d to find a replacement. This evidence clearly demonstrates, according to OCF, that the company was concerned about its consumers and actively invested money and sought solutions to the possible health hazards of Kaylo.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">3. <em>Other Evidence of Bad Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Plaintiffs/appellees seek to strengthen their argument that OCF acted in bad faith by introducing at trial documents and testimony detailing OCF\u2019s fiscal, marketing and public relations concerns over asbestos Kaylo. For example, plaintiffs cite the trial testimony of Jerry Helser, the quality control supervisor at the Kaylo plant, concerning the excessive costs of spraying asbestos with a sealant which would significantly reduce dust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cQ. Mr. Helser, let me show you a statement by Mr. Gould, the attorney that you met with ... and ask you to read along with me. I\u2019m going to ask you if this refreshes your recollection. It says Jerry does recall that there were experiments run to reduce surface dust on Kaylo. He recalls that they were very successful when Kaylo was sprayed with sodium silicate. However, it is also Jerry\u2019s recollection that this type of Kaylo product was not marketed because of the cost involved in spraying the product. Do you see that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">Q. Is that your recollection, that the sodium silicate was not used because of the cost involved in spraying the product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">A. Cost because we couldn\u2019t spray it properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">Q. You couldn\u2019t spray it properly onto the product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>A. That\u2019s right. We had a terrible time trying to spray that type of material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Apparently this and other such evidence was supposed to demonstrate to the jury OCF\u2019s misplaced priorities and bad faith at a time when it had actual knowledge of the dangerous properties of Kaylo.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Similar claims were made in <em>Godwin </em>against more than one defendant; we state here as we implied then that evidence that a company is considering cost and negative publicity implications of a problem product does not alone constitute evidence of bad faith in marketing the product. Normally, such corporate activities would hardly be evidence of \u201cevil motive\u201d or \u201cintent to defraud\u201d as required to show \u201cactual malice.\u201d In fact, one would expect the OCF marketing department to have practical concerns about public relations concerning Kaylo, and its accountants and quality control supervisors to run cost-benefit analyses on potential solutions. Yet, plaintiffs/appellees argue here that the company\u2019s focus on costs and public relations was not normal, but rather demonstrated the company\u2019s affirmative attempts to deceive Kaylo consumers and the public and was evidence of \u201ca bunker mentality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The only rational way to interpret plaintiffs/appellees\u2019 argument is to recognize its fundamental premise: that OCF acted in bad faith because it did not remove Kaylo from the market instantly and completely in the mid-1960\u2019s. Absolutely nothing in the record or in the state of the art medical or industrial knowledge of the time supports such an premise. No one in 1968, not even the medical experts who were researching and discovering the links between asbestos and cancer, believed, or at least voiced any belief, that asbestos needed to be immediately eliminated entirely. While in hindsight taking Kaylo off the market in the mid-1960\u2019s may have been prudent, in no way does OCF\u2019s failure to take Kaylo immediately off the market at that time connote bad faith sufficient to support a punitive damages verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The plaintiffs/appellees also point out that the very fact that the jury awarded punitive damages only in the case of Mr. Scruggs and not in either Mr. Hohman\u2019s or Mr. Garrett\u2019s case is telling evidence that the jury understood and applied the stringent proof of bad faith required for punitive damages. They argue that the jury must have determined that OCF\u2019s decision to market Kaylo in the late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s, long after the dangers of asbestos were well-known, was more egregious and worthy of punishment than OCF\u2019s marketing of the product in the 1950\u2019s, when both Mr. Garrett and Mr. Hohman were exposed. While the argument is clever and has some merit, the question before us is not whether the jury understood the task at hand, but whether the evidence was legally sufficient for a reasonable jury to find, by a clear and convincing standard, that OCF acted with actual malice in marketing Kaylo.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">4. <em>Conclusion: Evidence of Actual Knowledge and Bad Faith Not Legally Sufficient to Meet Clear and Convincing Evidentiary Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"AvC\">As we noted in <em>Godwin </em>when discussing the evidence against defendant Pittsburgh Corning Corporation, the proof before us \u201ccuts both ways.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 378, 667 A.2d at 137. Evidence of OCF\u2019s awareness of state of the art medical knowledge about asbestos includes evidence of OCF\u2019s general agreement with the state of the art knowledge that controlled and limited asbestos exposure could be safe. Evidence that OCF was concerned enough about asbestos hazards to label its Kaylo packages also demonstrates that OCF believed safe handling of asbestos would eliminate health hazards, and that OCF intended to make workers aware of the risks of Kaylo when improperly handled.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>OCF was actively working to preserve its market share of thermal insulation by designing an asbestos-free Kaylo provides evidence that OCF was worried about the health hazards asbestos presented and affirmatively sought to protect its users.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Clear and convincing evidence of bad faith to support a punitive damages award \u201cgoes far beyond that required to support a compensatory damages award based on the underlying strict liability claim ... [and] in a products liability action based on negligence requires the plaintiff to prove much more than negligence.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 465, 601 A.2d at 655. If we substitute the words \u201cOCF\u201d and \u201cKaylo\u201d for \u201cPCC\u201d and \u201cUnibestos,\u201d the following quotation from <em>Godwin </em>exactly describes the state of the evidence in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cAt all relevant times the widespread belief was that the extent of the health risk depended, in large part, on the length and intensity of exposure.... It may be that a jury would believe that the corporate decision to adopt health warnings came too late and, even then, that it was motivated only by the desire to minimize tort liability. It may also be that a jury would believe that PCC [OCF] was not only negligent in these\u2019 respects, but that it was grossly negligent. <em>These possible inferences or conclusions, however, do not demonstrate that PCC [OCF] made a bad faith decision to market Unibestos [Kaylo] in conscious or deliberate disregard of the threat to the safety of the consumer. Plaintiffs have not shown by clear and convincing evidence that ... PCC [OCF] did not in good faith believe that its recommendations for exhaust ventilation, ... housekeep</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>ing, and use of respirators were reasonable protections for users.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 378-79, 667 A.2d at 137 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Mr. Scruggs was an insulator for two months, and a bystander who regularly inhaled asbestos fibers for four years, the last four years OCF produced asbestos Kaylo. His exposure to asbestos killed him, and the jury found that OCF and PH were both negligent and strictly liable for his death. Certainly the jury had sufficient evidence to find both that the companies knew that Kaylo and other asbestos products posed a potential danger, and that the warnings given to Mr. Scruggs were negligently inadequate. On the record before us, however, we cannot say that the evidence of actual malice was legally sufficient under a clear and convincing evidentiary standard to submit the question of punitive damages to the jury. We reverse the award of punitive damages against OCF in the case of Mr. Scruggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">G. <em>Remaining Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">OCF makes three other arguments concerning the punitive damages award against it in the case of Mr. Scruggs. First, OCF claims that the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions on punitive damages were improper because they were not consistent with <em>Zenobia. </em>OCF also argues that the trial judge violated OCF\u2019s due process rights when it failed to conduct a post-verdict review of OCF\u2019s liability for punitive damages. Finally, OCF contends that the evidence that the twin goals of punishment and deterrence were furthered by a punitive damages award against OCF was legally insufficient. We shall not consider any of these arguments, as their resolution is not necessary to our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\"><em>JUDGMENT FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST APPELLANT OWENS-CORNING FIBERGLAS CORPORATION REVERSED; ALL OTHER JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

Certain internal OCF memoranda advance a theory prevalent during the 1960's that it was not the asbestos fibers themselves but certain organic oils found in asbestos and the other materials which made up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Kaylo which were carcinogenic to asbestos trade workers; the theory was of course welcome to OCF officials, who hypothesized in these documents that the pressurized heat of the autoclave would destroy anything organic in Kaylo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">. The \u201cvalue\u201d for asbestos was determined at that time to be five million particles of dust per cubic foot of air by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), a loose network of governmental health officials from around the country; in any case, after 1972, the federal government promulgated mandatory safety standards based on an average number of airborne asbestos fibers rather than on the threshold limit value. By that time, OCF was producing asbestos-free Kaylo. A more complete discussion of the historical development of safety standards for asbestos is found in <em>Godwin, supra, </em>at 365-67, 130-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\">. 37 Fed.Reg. 11318, 11321 (1972). <em>See Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 365-66, 667 A.2d at 131 for an in-depth history of the labeling regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">. We emphatically do not agree with OCF's premise that any warning label at all negates bad faith \"as a matter of law.\u201d A warning label could be affirmatively misleading or so grossly inaccurate or inadequate to cross the line from gross negligence to \"intent to defraud.\u201d The question is not whether a warning label of any content existed, but what the content of the label was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\">. We note that plaintiffs produced testimony at trial and in oral argument to us that Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Garrett never saw such warnings, and further that the evidence that such warnings existed at all was underwhelming. While it is not our task to weigh evidence, we do point out from our review of the record that, to the contrary, OCF produced voluminous and persuasive evidence of labeling.

Although small (2 in. by 3 and 1/2 in.), it was bordered and printed in red and used capital letters. Invoices from the boxing companies demonstrated that all packaging for Kaylo contained the labels; other photographs of workers showed discarded marked Kaylo boxes right next to the workers. A co-worker of Mr. Scruggs testified that he knew Kaylo had asbestos in it because of the word \"asbestos\u201d on the box, yet from our review of the photographs and packaging invoices the word \"asbestos\u201d only appeared on the box within the cautionary label.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b594-6\">BELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AXM\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">I have no quarrel with any of the substantive conclusions of the majority opinion except the one reached in Part III.F., pertaining to the punitive damages award against Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation (\u201cOCF\u201d).4 With respect to Part III. F., I am firmly of the view that there was ample evidence presented to the jury to justify its verdict awarding punitive damages against OCF and in favor of appellee Scruggs. Accordingly, I dissent from that part of the opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In a products liability case, an award of punitive damages may be sustained only if the evidence adduced by the plaintiff establishes \u201cthe equivalent of the \u2018evil motive,\u2019 \u2018intent to defraud,\u2019 or \u2018intent to injure,\u2019 which generally characterizes \u2018actual malice,\u2019 [i.e.] actual knowledge of the defect and deliberate disregard of the consequences.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 462, 601 A.2d 633, 653 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The actual knowledge component of the test is satisfied where there is, on the part of the defendant, a \u201cwillful failure to know,\u201d that is, where the defendant \u201cbelieves that it is probable that something is a fact, but deliberately shuts his or her eyes or avoids making reasonable inquiry with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.\u201d <em>State v. McCallum, </em>321 Md. 451, 458, 583 A.2d 250, 253 (1991) (Chasanow, J. concurring). Thus, in order for the plaintiff to prevail on the issue of punitive damages, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant, having the requisite knowledge, nevertheless, acted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>bad faith in distributing its product. <em>ACandS v. Godwin, </em>340 Md. 334, 358-9, 667 A.2d 116, 128 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Whether the defendant had the requisite knowledge and acted in bad faith are questions of fact to be determined by the trier of fact, in this case, the jury. Such matters are not matters of law reserved for the trial court and, thus, most assuredly, are not matters to be resolved by an appellate court. Moreover, those facts need not be established by direct evidence. Because a party\u2019s state of mind is peculiarly within the power of that party to disclose, or not, as he or she chooses, the other party cannot prove that party\u2019s knowledge or bad faith except by circumstantial evidence. Certainly, the party whose actions are under scrutiny cannot, and should not, be permitted, by requiring that the proof be by direct evidence, to determine the outcome of the inquiry. The issue for our determination then is whether the evidence the appellee Scruggs adduced as to OCF\u2019s state of mind and knowledge was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages. As to that issue, the jury had before it the following evidence in addition to that set out in the majority opinion. <em>See </em>343 Md. 500, 541-549, 682 A.2d 1143, 1163-1167 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The appellee Scruggs, an insulator for a time, as to whom the hazard from exposure was greatest, and a by-stander thereafter, first was exposed to asbestos in 1968. By that time, OCF was well aware of the dangers associated with asbestos. It had known, by that time for more than two decades, that dust containing asbestos should not be breathed and that if it were, it represented a real danger because it was a carcinogen.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">OCF had knowledge, through its parent companies, that asbestos was dangerous as early as 1938. In that year, one of its parent companies, Owens-Illinois, was informed, by letter from a Doctor from the Saranac Laboratory that asbestos \u201cis known to produce fibrosis of the lungs [and] also cause[s] fibrosis in other tissues when injected in sufficient quantities.\u201d The year before, the other parent, Corning Glass Works, quoted the same Doctor\u2019s work to the same effect. That OCF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>had direct knowledge of the hazardous nature of asbestos was evident in 1941, when one of the lawyers in its Legal and Patent Department, having received a letter from a Saranac. Doctor, expressed his gratification at the Doctor\u2019s belief, referring to OCF\u2019s main product at the time, fiberglas, that \u201cwe are not going to encounter any evidence of an asbestos-like reaction because none of the fiber reaches the lungs.\u201d Moreover, OCF has admitted that, in that same year, it was aware of a case of asbestosis or cancer in a user of an insulation product which contained asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Thereafter, OCF developed a \u201cgerm of a major strategy.\u201d It was to put together an asbestos file to be held as a \u201cweapon in reserve.\u201d The file would be \u201can impressive file of photostats of medical literature on asbestos,\u201d to comprise some 500-600 pages, including \u201ctwo bibliographies covering medical literature to 1938, citing references to scores of publications in which the lung and skin hazards of asbestos are discussed.\u201d The file was to be used should the unions balk at working with fiberglas or should they require OCF to pay a premium for doing so. It compiled the file, although it never had to resort to its use. Thus, it is clear that, by 1942, more than 10 years before it began to market a product containing asbestos, OCF had a wealth of knowledge concerning the hazards of asbestos and that the knowledge it had was actual and not constructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Despite having this knowledge and being concerned with avoiding having its fiberglas product \u201csmear[ed] with the hazards of asbestos,\u201d OCF began mixing fiberglas and asbestos, which it sold as Kaylo, in 1953. When OCF was reminded, in 1956, by a Doctor from whom an opinion was solicited concerning favorable past experiments with fiberglas, that \u201casbestos is fairly incriminated as a carcinogen and the asbestos causes damage by virtue of the length of its fibers,\u201d the concern it expressed was about the \u201cgeneral tenor\u201d of the letter containing the reminder and the fact that \u201c[i]t is certainly nothing that we could show customers or a union.\u201d A similar concern was expressed in response to Dr. Selikoffis 1964 study of insulation workers. In a confidential memorandum, OCF\u2019s Director of Industrial &amp; Personnel Relations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>wrote: \u201cour present concern is to find some way of preventing Dr. Selikoff from creating problems and affecting sales.\u201d Indeed, it appears that the purpose for which OCF monitored the medical experiments and studies was to keep tabs on how the public perceived its product and to gauge the effect of the experiments and studies on the profitability of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">OCF was aware that asbestos was more dangerous to the insulation worker because that worker handled it directly and, therefore, was exposed to a greater extent than a by-stander. And it knew that it was the dust generated during the insulation process that posed the danger. The September 17, 1963 memorandum by William Lotz of OCF\u2019s Product Development Laboratory is illustrative. He wrote: \u201cAsbestos (as found in Kaylo) when breathed into the lungs causes asbestosis which often leads to lung cancer.... All insulations are dusty and insulators seldom complain except when the dust is particularly irritating to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">There was a view between 1968 and 1972 that asbestos dust was hazardous only above a certain level of concentration. The indicator of the average concentration of dust particles per cubic foot of air to which a worker could be exposed safely was characterized by a threshold limit value. The evidence before the jury was that OCF did not accept as gospel the accuracy of that value. In a 1966 memorandum, the Director of Industrial and Personnel Relations wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">Asbestos is recognized as a health hazard causing asbestosis. Asbestosis requires 12 years or more of exposure to cause objective symptoms. The threshold limit value set by the A.C.G.I.H. is 5 million particles per cubic foot. However, Dr. Selikoff has stated that only one fiber in the body can cause cancer ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Asbestos bodies sometimes develop into mesotheliomas, a tumor with considerable carcinogenic potential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">Because of asbestosis (if for no other reason), asbestos fibers should be removed from the atmosphere by adequate ventilation. If ventilation is impossible, suitable respirators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>should be worn by workmen. At this point, I believe there is reason to question the A.C.G.I.H. threshold limit.... It is impossible to guess the amount of dust created by the cutting, sawing, etc. of Kaylo----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">This same evidence is relevant to and tends to prove OCF\u2019s bad faith in marketing Kaylo. Having assembled extensive evidence concerning the dangers of asbestos for the purpose of acquiring, and maintaining, a competitive edge and, thus, being acutely aware of its defects, OCF nevertheless marketed a product containing asbestos, touting it as safe. This marketing continued even in the face of evidence that even small amounts of asbestos were dangerous, <em>i.e., </em>Dr. Selikoffs conclusion that only one fiber in the body could cause cancer, OCF\u2019s questioning of the accuracy of the threshold limit value relative to asbestos dust, and despite its knowledge of the \u201cimpossibility of] guess[ing] the amount of dust created by the cutting, sawing, etc. of Kaylo.\u201d Notwithstanding that it now contained asbestos, after 1956, OCF marketed its product as having \u201cpleasant handling characteristics\u201d and being \u201cnontoxic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The evidence before the jury also disclosed that OCF, having developed a non-asbestos containing material for use in Kaylo, declined to use it upon determining that the profit margin it produced was insufficient. Similarly, the jury was informed of OCF\u2019s profit-motivated decision not to treat Kay-lo with a spray that reduced the amount of dust its handling generated. Furthermore, appellee Scruggs presented evidence concerning OCF\u2019s attitude toward replacing the asbestos content of Kaylo. That attitude is exemplified in an internal memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">D.W. Ladd pointed out we have a ten million dollar Kaylo operation. He wants \u201cus\u201d as a team to be in the position to tell management what fibers we can use to reinforce Kaylo if and when the day arrives when the whole industry is \u201cforced\u201d to remove asbestos from their products. He doesn\u2019t want OCF to wait until \u201cD\u201d day to start looking for substitute fibers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>I told Dale we are conducting a \u201clow gear\u201d program in finding substitutes for asbestos. Most of our efforts are being directed toward stress corrosion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">It was also pointed out by Mr. Ladd that if and when \u201cD\u201d day for the removal of asbestos arrives, we won\u2019t be alone. The whole industry would be in the same boat with us. The industry may be forced, at that point, to accept a [sic] and softer product as a price they must pay for the removal of asbestos.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">It is clear to me that, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the foregoing evidence, and that detailed in the majority opinion as supportive of appellee Scruggs\u2019s entitlement to compensatory damages, could have, as it did, convinced the jury by clear and convincing evidence that the appellee Scruggs was entitled to punitive damages. As such, it was more than enough to permit the jury to return the verdict that it did. To be sure, there was evidence, which had the jury believed it, would have supported a defendant\u2019s verdict; however, that evidence, as the majority recognized when evaluating its sufficiency with regard to the compensatory aspect of the case, was not such as to require a judgment in favor of OCF as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">After conceding that the evidence in this case \u201c \u2018cuts both ways,\u2019 \u201d 343 Md. 500, 549, 682 A.2d 1143, 1167 (1996) (quoting <em>Godwin, supra, </em>340 Md. at 378, 667 A.2d at 137), the majority observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">Evidence of OCF\u2019s awareness of state of the art medical knowledge about asbestos includes evidence of OCF\u2019s general agreement with the state of the art knowledge that controlled and limited asbestos exposure could be safe. Evidence that OCF was concerned enough about asbestos hazards to label its Kaylo packages also demonstrates that OCF believed safe handling of asbestos would eliminate health hazards, and that OCF intended to make workers aware of the risks of Kaylo when improperly handled. Evidence that OCF was actively working to preserve its market share of thermal insulation by designing an asbes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>tos-free Kaylo provides evidence that OCF was worried about the health hazards asbestos presented and affirmatively sought to protect its users.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><em>Id. </em>Then noting that the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence, which \u201crequires the plaintiff to prove much more than negligence,\u201d <em>Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 465, 601 A.2d at 655, the majority offers its view of the state of the evidence in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201cAt all relevant times the widespread belief was that the extent of the health risk depended, in large part, on the length and intensity of exposure---- It may be that a jury would believe that the corporate decision to adopt health warnings came too late and, even then, that it was motivated only by the desire to minimize tort liability. It may also be that a jury would believe that PCC [OCF] was not only negligent in these respects, but that it was grossly negligent. <em>These possible inferences or conclusions, however, do not demonstrate that PCC [OCF] made a bad faith decision to market Uniberstos [Kaylo] in conscious or deliberate disregard of the threat to the safety of the consumer. Plaintiffs have not shown by clear and convincing evidence that ... PCC [OCF] did not in good faith believe that its recommendations for exhaust ventilation, ... housekeeping,and use of respirators were reasonable protections for users. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 550, 682 A.2d at 1167 (quoting <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 378-79, 667 A.2d at 137).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The majority focuses only on the evidence and the permissible inferences from that evidence favorable to OCF. It totally fails to consider the evidence which it acknowledges is favorable to appellee Scruggs or the inferences that evidence produces. Thus, the majority does not acknowledge that it was possible for the jury to draw an inference unfavorable to OCF from the evidence that it had before it indicating that OCF began the distribution of a product containing asbestos after it had amassed tremendous evidence of the dangers associated with asbestos and that, prior to the exposure of the appellee to asbestos, OCF had reason to question both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>accuracy of the applicable threshold limit value, and whether the dust generated by cutting or sawing its product was sufficient to expose users to those dangers. Certainly, a jury with that evidence could find that OCF acted in bad faith in continuing to distribute Kaylo without further study; it could have concluded that OCF, remaining willfully blind to the suspected consequences of continued use of asbestos, distributed it in conscious disregard of those consequences. Nor was the jury bound to draw the conclusions that the majority does. In any event, it is clear that the majority simply fails to explain its conclusion that the evidence is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Moreover, the majority mischaracterizes the record in this case. Unlike the situation in <em>Godwin, </em>this case is far from a \u201clabeling\u201d or negligence case. Instead, in my view, the evidence in this case is such that it is the level of the knowledge possessed by OCF that is dispositive. That is so because what OCF did, it did in the name of maximizing profits and with very little, if any, regard for anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Judges CHASANOW and RAKER have authorized me to say that they join in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\">.
