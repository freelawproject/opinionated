On motion for summary judgment, the Maryland Tax Court concluded that the charges at issue were not \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity, and, therefore, the City ordinance did not provide for their taxation. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Director of Finance v. Charles Towers, </em>104 Md.App. 710, 657 A.2d 808 (1995). At the petitioners\u2019 request, we granted the writ of certiorari. We shall affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The facts in this case are largely undisputed; indeed, most were stipulated by the parties. Ordinance 745 of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, approved December 23, 1946, was enacted for the purpose of taxing, during 1947, <em>inter alia, </em>all sales for consumption for nonresidential uses of artificial or natural gas and electricity delivered in Baltimore City. Subsequently, Ordinance 108 continued the tax for the succeeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>years 1948-51. It was codified in the Baltimore City Code at Article 37, \u00a7 76. Thereafter, Ordinance 88, permanently prescribing the utilities tax, was approved November 20, 1951. Although that provision has been amended frequently since 1951, including its scope, the portion relevant to this appeal has remained essentially unchanged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Now codified in Article 28, \u00a7 55 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">(a)(1) Artificial or natural gas, electricity, and steam rates. There is hereby levied and imposed on all sales for consumption of artificial or natural gas, electricity and steam delivered in Baltimore City through pipes, wires or conduits within the limits of Baltimore City, hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>referred to as \u201cenergy sales,\u201d and billed after the effective date hereof, a tax at the rate of 8% upon the gross sales price thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The monthly electricity bills the taxpayers received from BGE contained separately stated charges for each component of the gross sales price of electricity as required by the Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the total bill for electricity sold to the taxpayers included the following charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">(1) <em>Customer Charge </em>\u2014 is designed to recover metering, billing, and other administrative costs of BGE associated with the production, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. It is billed based on a fixed monthly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">(2) <em>Demand Charge </em>\u2014 is designed to recover the costs associated with the equipment and facilities needed to produce, transmit, and distribute electricity. It is billed by first identifying the half-hour during the month in which a consumer\u2019s use of electricity was greatest, as measured in kilowatts, and then multiplying the number of kilowatts consumed by a fixed dollar amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">(3) <em>Energy Charge </em>\u2014 is based on total energy consumption during the month in kilowatt hours.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">(4) <em>Fuel Rate Charge </em>\u2014 is designed to recover BGE\u2019s fuel costs related to the electricity sold by it. It is calculated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>multiplying total kilowatt hour usage for the billing period by the dollar amount of the current fuel rate.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The City sales tax, pursuant to Art. 28, \u00a7 55(a)(1), was collected on the aggregate of the monthly customer charge, demand charge, energy charge and fuel rate charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In 1991, each of the petitioners in this case, C &amp; P Telephone Co., Santoni\u2019s Inc., Charles Towers Partnership, Apartment Services, Inc., and United Holdings Co. Inc. (\u201cthe taxpayers\u201d) filed separate claims with the respondent, the Director of Finance for the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\u201cthe Director\u201d) for refund of the 8% utility tax paid on the customer and demand charges for which Baltimore Gas <em>&amp; </em>Electric (\u201cBGE\u201d) billed them over the preceding three years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u25a0 customer and demand charges, unlike the energy and fuel rate charges, were not calculated based on the actual amount of electricity consumed. Therefore, the taxpayers contended that these charges were not \u201csales for consumption\u201d and should not be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">After six months elapsed with no determination from the director as to the validity of their claims, the taxpayers, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.) Article 24, \u00a7 9-712(d)(2) and Maryland Code (1988, 1996 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 13-510(b), of the Tax-General Article<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> treated the claims as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>denied and appealed to the Maryland Tax Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that court, all parties filed motions for summary judgment, along with supporting affidavits. Because each of the taxpayers\u2019 motions addressed the same issue, the Tax Court consolidated them for hearing. Finding no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and persuaded by its reasoning in <em>Baltimore County v. Blue Circle Atlantic, </em>Misc. Nos. 684-688 (Aug. 15, 1990), the Tax Court granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers. It determined, as a matter of law, \u201c[t]hat Article 28, \u00a7 55(a)(1) of the Baltimore City Code (the \u2018City Ordinance\u2019) does not authorize the assessment and collection of the public utilities tax on \u2018demand charges\u2019 and \u2018customer charges\u2019 as those charges are not sales of electricity actually consumed.\u201d Therefore, on December 14, 1993, the Tax Court ordered the Director to refund with interest to the taxpayers the taxes they paid on such charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Director sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a hearing on the merits, that court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">[T]he findings of the Tax Court are correct. It is the language of the statute that convinces me. [I]t just doesn\u2019t make common sense to apply any other language to this other than sales of electricity which is actually consumed .... So ... I\u2019m mak[ing] a finding that the order of the ... Tax Court is hereby affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Thereafter, the Director appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plain and unambiguous meaning of the City Ordinance required inclusion of the customer and demand charges in the \u201cgross sales price\u201d on which the ordinance imposes the tax, and that the Tax Court and the circuit court failed to accord due deference to the administrative construction of the statute by the Director as authorized by Baltimore City Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 55(d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Director of Finance, supra, </em>104 Md.App. at 730, 657 A.2d at 818. Although it did not find the ordinance to be \u201cplain and free from ambiguity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 715, 657 A.2d at 811, the intermediate appellate court nevertheless held that the phrase \u201csales for consumption\u201d meant \u201cretail sales\u201d of electricity, specifically, those purchases made by the ultimate consumers of the electricity, as opposed to those purchases made \u201cfor the purpose of reselling electricity to other consumers.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>at 718, 657 A.2d at 812. The correctness of its interpretation of the phrase was confirmed, the court stated, by the Director\u2019s administrative interpretation of the ordinance, which was \u201centitled to significant weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722-23, 657 A.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The taxpayers petitioned for certiorari and the Director filed a conditional cross petition. Although we granted both the taxpayers\u2019 petition and the Director\u2019s conditional cross petition,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> our resolution of the issue the taxpayers raise, makes consideration of the conditional cross appeal unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In their brief, the taxpayers<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> contend that the Tax Court correctly interpreted the ordinance as imposing the electricity tax only on charges based on the amount of electricity actually consumed, namely, the energy and fuel rate charges. They maintain that the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the ordinance comports with the rules of statutory construction. In this regard, they submit that the Tax Court first concluded that the language of the ordinance was clear and unambiguous and then \u201csimply applied the ordinary meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>of those words.\u201d Thus, the taxpayers conclude that the Tax Court\u2019s decision was legally correct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The taxpayers further maintain that the Court of Special Appeals \u201creweigh[ed] and reinterpret[ed]\u201d the facts in this case and then applied its own construction of the law to those facts. As evidence of such behavior, the taxpayers point to, <em>inter alia, </em>the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision to give significant weight to the City\u2019s long-standing administrative practice of treating the ordinance as a tax on retail sales of electricity. <em>Id. </em>at 721-22 &amp; n. 5, 657 A.2d at 814 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The taxpayers contend, however, that despite this administrative practice, the only evidence in the record demonstrating such an application of the tax is the affidavit of Ottavio Grande, the City Collector. In that affidavit, Mr. Grande stated that the City does not, nor has it ever, collected electricity taxes from a waste processing facility known as Baltimore Refuse Energy Systems Co. (\u201cBRESCO\u201d), because BRESCO is not the ultimate consumer of electricity, but rather a reseller. Nevertheless, the taxpayers argue that this affidavit is wholly insufficient to demonstrate that the City made its taxability determinations based on whether the transaction was retail or wholesale in nature.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Finally, the taxpayers contend that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Controller v. Pleasure Cove, </em>334 Md. 450, 639 A.2d 685 (1994), in which we interpreted Anne Arundel County\u2019s so-called \u201cboat slip tax,\u201d is \u201cequally applicable to this tax on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>consumption of electricity.\u201d Accordingly, the taxpayers argue that, just as in <em>Pleasure Cove, </em>where the boat slip rental charge was separately stated on the bill from the charges for other marina services, and in which we held that the County was not authorized to impose the boat slip tax on the charges for those other services, 334 Md. at 461, 639 A.2d at 691, the customer and demand charges in the instant case are for something other than the subject of the tax. In addition, the taxpayers note that, as in <em>Pleasure Cove, </em>the tax at issue is not a general retail sales tax, but rather a tax on a specific item, namely, sales for consumption of electricity. On this basis, the taxpayers conclude that, inasmuch as customer and demand charges are not sales for consumption, the imposition of the electricity tax on them \u201cexceeds the scope of the taxing statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On the City\u2019s behalf, the Director contends that the taxpayers have muddied the distinction between the subject of the tax and the method by which the amount of tax is calculated. The subject of the tax, according to the Director, is \u201csales for consumption of ... electricity.\u201d He thus points out that it is undisputed that the taxpayers consumed all of the electricity BGE sold them. As to the calculation of the tax, the Director, also citing <em>Pleasure Cove, supra, </em>334 Md. at 461-63, 639 A.2d at 691-92, maintains that customer and demand charges are an integral part of the \u201cgross sales price\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of electricity because \u201cthey cover [a] part of the cost of producing, transmitting and selling electricity that is covered by no other component of the price charged by BGE for the electricity purchased and consumed by [the taxpayers].\u201d He concludes, therefore, that the manner in which the components of the gross sales price are calculated has no bearing on whether there is a sale for consumption of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Consequently, the Director submits that the Tax Court\u2019s decision was premised on an erroneous conclusion of law, there being no support in the text of the ordinance for the taxpayers\u2019 contention that, to be taxable, every component of the gross sales price must vary directly with the amount of electricity sold. As the Director sees it, the City Council\u2019s purpose in emphasizing that the <em>gross </em>sales price was to be taxed at a stated rate \u201cwas to make clear that <em>every </em>component of the price of electricity sold for consumption was to be included in that amount.\u201d The Respondent\u2019s Brief at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The Director also notes, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that for residential customers and non-residential customers with a demand of less than 60 kilowatts, all costs of providing electricity are included in the energy rate. <em>Director of Finance, supra, </em>104 Md.App. at 720, 657 A.2d at 813. Accordingly, he asserts, the term \u201cgross sales price\u201d should not encompass fewer costs of providing the taxpayers in this case with electricity than it does for providing electricity for consumption by residential customers or non-residential customers with a demand of less than 60 kilowatts.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">As is customary in statutory construction cases, we begin our analysis by reviewing the pertinent rules. Of course, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448, 451 (1994); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 755 (1993). To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also. <em>Oaks, supra, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429; <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d at 451; <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755; <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145-46, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u201d <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755, nor may it construe the statute with \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). Moreover, whenever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory. <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d at 452; <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Applying these principles to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are of the opinion that the Tax Court, in interpreting Art. 28, \u00a7 55(a)(1), reached its result based on an erroneous conclusion of law. Consequently, we are \u201cunder no statutory constraints in reversing [it].\u201d <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985); <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Carroll, </em>298 Md. 311, 318, 469 A.2d 858, 861 (1984); <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-election Committee, </em>280 Md. 575, 578, 374 A.2d 1130, 1131-32 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">As we have seen, the Tax Court, in its summary judgment orders issued in favor of the taxpayers, found, as a matter of law, that \u00a7 55(a)(1) \u201cdoes not authorize the assessment and collection of the public utilities tax on \u2018demand charges\u2019 and \u2018customer charges\u2019 as those charges are not sales of electricity <em>actually </em>consumed.\u201d (Emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, however, the Tax Court imported language into the ordinance that impermissibly altered its meaning. <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755. Nowhere in \u00a7 55(a)(1) does it state that the tax is to be levied on sales of electricity for \u201cactual\u201d consumption. Rather, it clearly states that the tax is to be imposed on \u201call sales for consumption.\u201d In our view, the operative word in that phrase is \u201csales,\u201d as that is the unit of consideration on which the City Council imposed the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Having thus established that \u201csales\u201d of electricity for consumption are the taxable event under \u00a7 55(a)(1), to be taxable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>a sale needs only to be <em>\u201cfor </em>consumption,\u201d (emphasis added), not actually consumed. In the instant case, it is undisputed that the sales of electricity were for consumption. Clearly then, as the Director quite correctly notes, the manner in which the components of the gross sales price are calculated has no bearing on whether a sale is for consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Section 55(a)(1) plainly states that the 8% tax is levied on the \u201cgross sales price\u201d of \u201call sales for consumption.\u201d That being so, we agree with the Director and the Court of Special Appeals that by using the adjective \u201cgross\u201d to modify the phrase \u201csales price,\u201d the City Council evidenced an intent to tax the entire sales price.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Director of Finance, supra, </em>104 Md.App. at 723, 657 A.2d at 815. To be sure, construing the ordinance in the manner the taxpayers suggest, namely, so as to tax some, but not all, of the components of the sales price would effectively render the word \u201cgross\u201d unnecessary, a result which is not consonant with the rules of statutory construction. <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d at 452, <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Because we have concluded that the ordinance clearly requires the taxation of the entire sales price, and because even the taxpayers themselves concede that customer and demand charges are \u201cpart of the total price charged for the provision of electricity,\u201d it follows that the customer and demand charges are part of the gross sales price to which the 8% tax rate is to be applied. The fact that BGE bills separately identify and specify the various components of the utility\u2019s costs in providing electricity to the class of customers to which the taxpayers belong, including its fixed costs, does not change the fact that the sales, as a whole, are for consumption. In addition, as the Director also points out, the only reason that all components are not combined into a single commodity price, as they are for residential customers and non-residential customers with monthly demands of less than 60 kilowatts, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>because the PSC has required a multi-part rate so as to allocate fairly costs among BGE\u2019s various customer classes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">In sum, we believe our decision in this case is compelled by the plain, unambiguous language of the statute. Although we arrive at the same ultimate result, in this respect, our analysis differs from that of the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Director of Finance, supra, </em>104 Md.App. at 718, 657 A.2d at 812. Like that court, however, we too are persuaded that this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Baltimore Country Club v. Comptroller, </em>272 Md. 65, 321 A.2d 308 (1974), and <em>Pleasure Cove, </em>likewise dictate this result. The analysis applied in those cases confirms the result dictated by the words of the statute. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v. Vieira, </em>340 Md. 651, 658, 667 A.2d 898, 901 (1995); <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 98, 656 A.2d 757, 762 (1995); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731, 732 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><em>Baltimore Country Club </em>dealt with the Maryland Retail Sales Tax.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That statute defined a retail sale as, <em>inter alia </em>\u201cthe sale of any meals, food or drink for human consumption on the premises where sold.\u201d 272 Md. at 66, 321 A.2d at 309. Baltimore Country Club, the petitioner in the case, for many years had added to its stated price for the food and beverages served to its members, and collected on behalf of its employees, a 15% mandatory gratuity or \u201cservice charge.\u201d The Comptroller of the Treasury considered these service charges to be part of the \u201cprice\u201d of the Club\u2019s retail sales. Therefore, the Comptroller levied a sales tax against the Club for the amount of all the service charges. On appeal, agreeing with the Comptroller, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>[I]n making sales of food and beverages to its members, service is always provided by the Club as an integral part of the transaction. The mandatory service charge imposed by the Club as part of the sale is a legally binding contractual obligation upon the purchaser, one \u201cautomatically and invariably\u201d levied and required to be paid as a constituent part of the \u201cprice\u201d of the sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 73, 321 A.2d at 312. In the instant case, as in <em>Baltimore Country </em>Club, the customer and demand charges are \u201can integral part of the transaction\u201d of selling electricity to the taxpayers for consumption. These charges constitute part of the \u201clegally binding contractual obligation\u201d the taxpayers entered into upon purchasing electricity from BGE.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We contrast the result in <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>with our more recent decision in <em>Pleasure Cove. </em>That case, as we have seen, concerned the scope of Maryland Code (1957, 1990 Repl.Vol.) Article 24, \u00a7 9-602, which authorized Anne Arundel County to collect a tax on \u201cspace rentals\u201d for the storage or docking of boats (\u201cboat slip tax\u201d). In addition to membership dues, Pleasure Cove Yacht Club charged its members a fee for boat slip rentals, outside storage space or boatel rentals.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Prior to 1989, the fee included the cost of certain marina services, such as electricity, trash removal, ice removal, security, etc. The entire rental fee was subject to the boat slip tax. In 1989, Pleasure Cove concluded that marina services were not taxable. Therefore, Pleasure Cove began charging separately for the marina services, applying the tax only to the remaining rental fee. The County Controller\u2019s Office subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>quently decided that the marina services should have been subject to the boat slip tax. Siding with the taxpayers, we pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">With regard to the <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>case, restaurant service is inherently necessary to the sale of restaurant meals and is usually not optional. Thus, the price of a meal typically reflects the cost to the restaurant of serving the meal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">The marina services involved here, on the other hand, are not inherently necessary to the wet slip, outside rack, or boatel rental. Boat slip renters are capable of performing the marina services on their own and quite often do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">334 Md. at 462-63, 639 A.2d at 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Thus, in contrast to <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>and the instant case, the marina services were not \u201cinherently necessary\u201d to the provision of boat slip rentals. In this case, however, it is undisputed that the charges at issue are not for something other than electricity; rather, they are separately stated components of the price of electricity, the sale of which is the taxable event.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Being mindful of the principles we enunciated in <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>and most recently in <em>Pleasure Cove, </em>we conclude that Art. 28, \u00a7 55(a)(1) contemplates the inclusion of customer and demand charges within the \u201cgross sales price\u201d of \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity to which the 8% tax rate is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\">.
