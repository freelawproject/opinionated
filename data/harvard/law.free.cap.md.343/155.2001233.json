McCullagh (\u201cOfficer McCullagh\u201d) and the Montgomery County Lodge No. 35, Fraternal Order of Police, Officer McCullagh\u2019s recognized labor organization, collectively the appellants, challenges the power of the Chief of Police of Montgomery County<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the appellee, to prohibit, under the applicable regulations, Officer McCullagh\u2019s engaging in secondary employment, even as punishment for a violation of those regulations. Concluding that the Chief of Police has that power, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County entered judgment affirming the appellee\u2019s decision prohibiting Officer McCullagh from engaging in such employment for a period of three months. We granted the writ of certiorari on our own motion to review that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Officer McCullagh presently is, and at all times pertinent to this appeal was, a police officer with the Montgomery County Police Department. From February 1992 through June 1993, he was also employed as a security officer at the Northwest Apartment Complex. During this time period, a Police De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>partment rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibited its employees from engaging in employment outside the Department without written permission of the Chief of Police and the approval of the County Ethics Commission. In addition, \u00a7 5.0 of Ethics Commission regulations, \u201cEmployment Outside of the County Service,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which, by the adoption of Resolution No. 10-1274, were approved by the Montgomery County Council, prescribed the procedure for obtaining approval to engage in secondary employment. Officer McCullagh did not obtain authorization of the Chief of Police and the County Ethics Commission before engaging in \u201csecondary employment\u201d, however. Consequently when this fact became known, the Department initiated proceedings against him in accordance with the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (\u201cLEOBR\u201d), Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727 to 734D.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Following an investigation, charges<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were brought against Officer McCullagh and a hearing board, <em>see </em>LEOBR \u00a7 727(d)(1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, was convened, <em>see </em>LEOBR \u00a7 730(a) and (d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>conduct a hearing on those charges. After the hearing, at which it unanimously found that Officer McCullagh was guilty of violating the departmental rule pertaining to secondary employment and, in compliance with LEOBR \u00a7 731,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the hearing board issued a decision stating its findings of fact. It also recommended that the Chief of Police issue a letter of reprimand to Officer McCullagh, to be placed in his personnel file, and suspend him from engaging in secondary employment for three months. Pursuant to \u00a7 731(c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, the Chief sustained the board\u2019s findings and adopted the disciplinary sanctions it recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The appellants did not then, and do not now, contest the validity <em>of </em>the letter of reprimand as a disciplinary sanction. Their only complaint then, as now, is the suspension from working secondary employment. Thus, in response to the Chiefs decision, the appellants, through counsel, wrote the Chief requesting only that he reconsider and rescind the suspension of Officer McCullagh from secondary employment. They maintained that, in light of the express terms of \u00a7 729A,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he total prohibition of secondary employment for a three month period is not a \u2018punitive\u2019 measure sanctioned by the LEOBR.\u201d That request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Subsequently, pursuant to LEOBR \u00a7 732,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the appellants appealed to the circuit court. In that court, the appellants continued to challenge the prohibition of secondary employment on the same ground, that it was an unauthorized disciplinary sanction, although they expanded and refined their arguments. They argued, specifically, that, because the Police Department failed to promulgate regulations under which secondary employment is prohibited for enumerated reasons, the total prohibition of secondary employment is not a sanction contemplated or authorized by the LEOBR. Consequently, they continued, when such a sanction is imposed by the Chief, it constitutes an unauthorized prohibition of secondary employment, in contravention of \u00a7 729A.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The circuit court rejected this argument. Reasoning that \u00a7 729A simply is a general prohibition against law enforcement agencies forbidding law enforcement officers from engaging in secondary employment that is inoperative when, for example, the prohibition is imposed as punishment against an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>employee who has violated secondary employment directives, it concluded that the appellant\u2019s reliance on LEOBR \u00a7 729A is misplaced, \u201cas Section 729A deals with procedure, not with substantive disciplinary action.\u201d The court emphasized that the LEOBR provides the exclusive remedy for police officers in departmental disciplinary matters. It pointed out, in that regard, that LEOBR \u00a7 731(b) authorizes the hearing board to \u201crecommend punishment as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, including but not limited to demotion, dismissal, transfer, loss of pay, reassignment, or other similar action which would be considered a punitive measure\u201d and subsection (c) requires the Chief to \u201creview the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the hearing board and then ... issue his final order.\u201d The court concluded that the disputed suspension of Officer MeCullagh from engaging in secondary employment for three months falls within the scope of the Chiefs authority to impose disciplinary sanctions, as defined by \u00a7 731, and that the Chief properly exercised that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The appellants next appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court could consider the matter, this Court issued the writ of certiorari, on its own motion, to determine the meaning of \u00a7 729A and its effect on the power of a law enforcement agency to punish law enforcement officers who violate applicable secondary employment regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The Montgomery County procedure for the adoption and compilation of regulations and for their public notification, as well as the history of the County\u2019s regulation of secondary employment provide an appropriate context for consideration of the various arguments proffered by the parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">How regulations are adopted and compiled and the public provided with notice is the subject of Article II of the Mont. Cty.Code (1994), a part of the County\u2019s Administrative Procedures Act. \u201cIt is the purpose of [that Article is] to prescribe a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>single and consistent procedure for the adoption, review and repeal of regulations, and to provide a uniform procedure for their public notification and compilation.\u201d \u00a7 2A-12(a). A regulation is defined as \u201cany rule or standard that an issuer<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by law is authorized to issue,\u201d including \u201cany amendment to an existing regulation.\u201d \u00a7 2A-13(h). To be effective, it \u201cmust be adopted under one of the 3 methods\u201d set out in \u00a7 2A-15(f)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>, in addition to meeting the other requirements imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Article II and by law, \u00a7 2A-15(a), <em>i.e, </em>contain no more than one subject, \u00a7 2A-15(b), and, pursuant to \u00a7 2A-15(c), the issuer shall have published in the Montgomery County Register, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2A-13(g) and \u00a7 2A-19, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">(1) A summary of the proposed regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">(2) The place where a copy of the proposed regulation may be obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">(3) The date, time, and place of any public hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">(4) The name and address of a person to whom comments may be directed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">(5) The deadline for submitting comments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">(6) A citation of the Section of the County Code that authorizes the adoption of the regulation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">(7) A reference to the procedural method used to adopt the regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Finally, the issuer must publish the final action taken on the regulation, summarizing any substantive changes made during the process, within 45 days of that action. \u00a7 12-15(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Temporary regulations are also contemplated. \u00a7 2A-15(j).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When an issuer determines that \u201c[a] public or fiscal emergency requires its adoption\u201d or that \u201c[t]he public interest will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>materially harmed if the regulation does not take effect immediately,\u201d \u00a7 2A-15(j)(1), a regulation temporary in duration\u2014 no more than 90 days \u2014 subject, upon request, and for a compelling reason, to being extended for an additional 90 days by the County Council, \u00a7 2A-15(j)(3)(B) and (4), may be adopted and issued. \u00a7 2A-15(j)(2). If notice of its adoption is published in the next available issue of the Register, the regulation need not meet the requirements of \u00a7 2A-15(e) and (f). It is effective when the County Council receives a copy from the issuer, along with \u201can explanation why its immediate adoption without public comment or Council review is necessary.\u201d \u00a7 2A-15(j)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Section 2A-18 addresses the compilation of the regulations. It provides that, among other matters, \u201c[e]ach regulation issued by the Executive or any person or agency that issues regulations under this Article\u201d be included in a Code of Montgomery County Regulations (\u201cCOMCOR\u201d), <em>see </em>\u00a7 2A-13(d), which the Chief Administrative Officer of the County is required to publish. \u00a7 2A~18(a). Moreover, each regulation adopted during the year, along with a revised COMCOR index, must be published in a supplement to COMCOR at least once a year. \u00a7 2A-18(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">... Three county agencies or officials authorized to, issue regulations are relevant to the inquiry <em>sub judice: </em>the County Executive; the Police Department; and the Ethics Commission. Pursuant to \u00a7 33-7(b), the County Executive is charged with adopting \u201cpersonnel regulations under method (1) of section 2A-15.... \u201d The Police Department is the subject of Chapter 35 of the Mont.Co.Code. Section 35-3 prescribes the powers and duties of the Chief. Authority for the adoption of regulations pertinent to the proper functioning of the Police Department is set forth in \u00a7 35-3(c). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">(c) <em>Adoption of regulations, orders, etc., generally. </em>The director of police shall adopt, under method (2) of section 2A-15 of this Code, all regulations for the county which pertain to the work of the department of police. The director shall issue such additional instructions and adopt such orders and administrative procedures, not inconsistent with law, as deemed proper in the exercise of the functions of chief executive officer of the department of police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Subsection (a) makes clear that the chief executive officer of the Police Department is an employee of the County, being \u201csubject to such orders, rules and regulations as may be issued by the county executive from time to time,\u201d as well as for \u201cthe proper and efficient conduct, control and discipline of the department of police.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Finally, the Ethics Commission\u2019s power to issue regulations pertinent to this case is derived from \u00a7 19A-5G) of the Code. Under that section, the Commission is required to act in accordance with method (2) of \u00a7 2A-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">By 1983 L.M.C., ch. 1 \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Montgomery County enacted legislation, presently codified at Mont.Cty.Code \u00a7 19A-12,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>restricting \u201cother\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> employment by county employees; The ordinance prohibited public employees from \u201cengaging] in any other employment unless the employment is approved by [the Montgomery County Ethics] Commission,\u201d which was also authorized to \u201cimpose conditions on its approval of other employment.\u201d \u00a7 19A-12(a)(1). It provided, in addition, that \u201c[t]he Commission may adopt appropriate procedures to receive and decide other employment requests,\u201d thus, enabling it to establish procedures in accordance with which county employees would be permitted to engage in secondary employment. \u00a7 19A-12(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In 1985, pursuant to the grant of authority given it by \u00a7 19A-12(a)(2), the Ethics Commission promulgated regulations embodying the administrative policies and procedures governing the approval of the employment of County employees outside of government service. These regulations were approved by the Montgomery County Council, in accordance with the requirements of method (2) of Code \u00a7 2A-15, when it adopted Resolution No. 10-1274.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 5.0.1 of the regulations, county employees who wish to engage in secondary employment are required to submit a written form request to the administrative head of the affected county department, for forwarding, with recommendation, to the Ethics Commission and the Office of Personnel. The Ethics Commission is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>charged with reviewing the request and making the final decision. \u00a7 5.0.4. It is then required to communicate its decision, in writing, to the employee, the department head and the Office of Personnel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The regulations also address the situation in which county employees engage in secondary employment in violation of their requirements. Section 5.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">County employees may begin outside employment at their own risk as soon as such employment is approved by the department/agency head with the understanding that continuance of the outside employment is contingent upon final approval by the Ethics Commission. County employees engaged in outside employment without the approval of the department must immediately submit requests in accordance with Ethics Commission procedures. <em>Failure to obtain Ethics Commission approval is a violation of Section H.2 of the County Regulations and may result in disciplinary action and other penalties as provided by law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUe\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Secondary employment by a police officer is addressed, as we have seen, by Function Code 355, issued by the Montgomery County Police Department in 1991.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Defining secondary employment as \u201cany employment not required by the Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>gomery County Department of Police,\u201d \u00a7 II.B., it states the Department\u2019s policy with respect to such employment, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">All employees of the department will comply with requirements of Chapter 19A of the Montgomery County Code. These sections establish that all requests (for Waivers) for Merit System employees to engage in outside employment must be in writing and shall be filed with the Chief of Police. The Ethics Commission has the authority to reject, modify, or approve the request in accordance with standards established by the commission. Therefore, all employees who want to work secondary jobs will comply with the procedures established in this directive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00a7 I. Section III. clearly states the rule applicable to secondary employment, \u201c[e]mployees of the Department of Police shall not engage in any employment outside the department without the written permission of the Chief of Police and approval from the County Ethics Commission,\u201d while \u00a7 V.B. sets out the consequence of failing to comply: \u201c[e]mployees who engage in secondary employment without approval are subject to disciplinary action.\u201d The policy does not address directly what that action will be; however, \u00a7 VIII.B. purports to give the Chief authority to cancel secondary employment or the permission to engage in such employment. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">The Chief of Police has the authority to cancel, temporarily or permanently, permission of any employee engaged in secondary employment. The employee concerned will be notified, by memorandum, of the reasons for any termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Police Department regulations are contained in Division 08 of COMCOR. Perusal of that Division reveals that Function Code 355 is not included. Neither does the appellee argue that the Police Department adopted it pursuant to Method (3), which does not require Council approval, under method (2), as \u00a7 35-3 requires, or as a temporary regulation as permitted by \u00a7 2A-15(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Section 33-7(b) of the Montgomery County Code requires \u201c[t]he County Executive [to] adopt personnel regulations under method (1) of section 2A-15 of the Code.\u201d Pursuant to that authority, the County Executive has promulgated Montgomery County Personnel Regulations. <em>See </em>Montgomery County Code, Article 33, Appendix F.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Originally adopted by the County Personnel Board and approved by the County Council in 1949, <em>see </em>Resolution No. 527, they were extensively amended in 1980 and 1986, which amendments were approved by the County Council when it adopted, in the manner required, Resolutions Nos. 9-1072 and 10-2060, respectively. Among them, Regulation \u00a7 27 addresses \u201cDisciplinary actions.\u201d Section 27-2 delineates the \u201ccauses for disciplinary action,\u201d which include \u201c(h) [violation of an established policy or procedure\u201d and <em>\u201c(o) </em>[violation of any provision of the county charter, county laws, ordinances, <em>regulations, </em>state or federal laws, or conviction for a criminal offense, if such violation is related to county employment.\u201d (Emphasis added). The types of disciplinary action a county agency head is permitted to impose, <em>see </em>\u00a7 27-5, are treated in \u00a7 27-3. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">27-3. <em>Types of disciplinary actions</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">(a) <em>Oral Admonishment....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">(b) <em>Written Reprimand....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">(c) <em>Withim-Grade Reduction....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">(d) <em>Suspension. </em>The placing of an employee in leave without pay status for a specified period, not to exceed five (5) work days, for a specific act, infraction or violation of a policy or procedure. The chief administrative Officer may approve a suspension for more than five (5) days, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>under no circumstances may a suspension exceed one (1) calendar month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">(e) <em>Suspension Pending Investigation of Charges or Trial. </em>____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">(f) <em>Demotion....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">(g) Dismissal.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Nowhere in this compilation is the prohibition, or the suspension, of the right to engage in secondary employment mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Noting that \u00a7 729A authorizes law enforcement agencies to promulgate reasonable regulations as to secondary employment, the appellants argue that, unless those regulations specifically prescribe them, penalties that prohibit such employment, <em>e.g., </em>suspension of the right of those who violate those regulations to engage in that employment, are violative of its mandate. They further argue that, never having been promulgated and adopted as required by Montgomery Cty. Code \u00a7 2A-15, Function Code 355 is not a promulgated reasonable regulation as contemplated by \u00a7 729A.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They maintain, therefore, that, whatever the reason or the period of time, the Chief exceeded his authority when he prohibited Officer McCullagh from engaging in secondary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The appellants further assert that the Chief derives his substantive authority to discipline officers under his command from the Montgomery County Personnel Regulations \u00a7 27 and, in particular, \u00a7 27-3. Since \u00a7 27-3 does not authorize the Chief either to prohibit or to suspend secondary employment and no other regulations have been promulgated authorizing him to do so, his imposition of such sanction was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The appellee contends that \u00a7 729A does not require Police Department regulations governing secondary employment specifically to delineate prohibition or suspension of that right as a disciplinary sanction prior to its actually being imposed for violation of the secondary employment regulations. In the alternative, she asserts that the Police Department has promulgated reasonable regulations as to secondary employment, <em>via </em>the Ethics Commission regulations, approved by County Council Resolution No. 10-1274, and Function Code 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The Chiefs authority to discipline law enforcement officers is not derived, the appellee submits, from the Montgomery County Personnel Regulations. Rather, she asserts, \u00a7 731 authorizes the Chief to impose any punitive measure which he or she deems \u201cappropriate.\u201d The appellee thus maintains that the source of the Chiefs substantive authority to discipline law enforcement officers is LEOBR \u00a7 731, not the Montgomery County Personnel Regulation \u00a7 27-3. Moreover, the appellee argues that \u00a7 731 preempts \u00a7 27-3 to the extent that they conflict as to the scope of the Chiefs substantive authority in the disciplinary context.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The interpretation of \u00a7 729A forms the crux of the dispute at bar. Our task is to determine the effect of \u00a7 729A on a Chiefs power to discipline law enforcement officers. May he or she, in the absence of a regulation specifically so providing, suspend, or otherwise prohibit, a law enforcement officer from engaging in secondary employment? In making this determination, as with any statutory construction issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>we must discern and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 93, 656 A.2d 757, 760 (1995); <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 260, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206 (1994). To this end, we first look to the language of the statute, <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995), with which the search for legislative intent begins, and ordinarily ends. <em>In re Douglas P., </em>333 Md. 387, 392, 635 A.2d 427, 429 (1994) . \u201cWhere a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of that enactment.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986). <em>See also Schuman v. Aluisi, </em>341 Md. 115, 119, 668 A.2d 929, 931-32 (1995) ; <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-16, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987). \u201cMoreover, the language of the statute must be interpreted in context, (citations omitted), avoiding an interpretation that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995)(citing <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1990); <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985); <em>Erwin &amp; Shafer, Inc. v. Pabst Brewing Co., </em>304 Md. 302, 315, 498 A.2d 1188, 1194 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Section 729A is unambiguous; its language could not be clearer: it denies law enforcement agencies the power to prohibit law enforcement officers from engaging in secondary employment and, at the same time, permits those agencies to regulate that employment by promulgating reasonable rules for that purpose. The legislative history of the section confirms its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Section 729A was enacted by the General Assembly in 1984. See ch. 452, Laws of 1984. Introduced as House Bill 915, as originally drafted, it provided for the promulgation of regulations as to secondary employment, \u201cas necessary to prohibit a conflict of interest in the performance of the officer\u2019s official duties.\u201d Committee Report System Bill Analysis, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, House Bill 915, p.l (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>This language was stricken at the urgings of the Maryland Lodge, Inc. of the Fraternal Order of Police and replaced with the present language. The letter from the Fraternal Order to Delegate Owens, then Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, urging the amendment read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">It is our position that there should be a right at law to secondary employment, however, that right should be subject to reasonable regulation by the law enforcement agency employing the police officer. <em>We wish to give the agency as much latitude as possible in regulating that employment, believing the word \u201creasonable\u201d to be sufficient for our purposes. </em>We would strongly urge you to adopt the amendments proposed by the Chiefs and continue the concept of reasonable regulations to the police employer through our bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">(Emphasis supplied). The purpose of \u00a7 729A was stated in the Summary of Committee Report by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">The intent of House Bill 915 is to provide that a law enforcement agency may not prohibit secondary employment but may regulate the secondary employment of a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">The purpose of the bill is to allow each local agency to regulate secondary employment in accordance with local circumstances and local interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Summary of Committee Report, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, p.l (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The trial court concluded that \u00a7 729A deals with \u201cprocedure, not with substantive disciplinary action\u201d and thus has no effect on the Chiefs authority to impose disciplinary sanctions. The plain language of \u00a7 729A belies that conclusion. By its express terms, that section limits the Chiefs power to prohibit secondary employment, for any period of time or for any reason, absent regulations permitting such action. To construe \u00a7 729A simply as a general prohibition, in regards to secondary employment, which has no effect on the Chiefs disciplinary authority is to read into \u00a7 729A an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>which neither exists, nor is supported by the stated legislative purpose. \u201cCourts may not[,] \u2018under the guise of construction ... insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dodds v. Shamer, </em>339 Md. 540, 554, 663 A.2d 1318, 1325 (1995)(quoting <em>Amalgamated Casualty Ins. Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 535-36, 212 A.2d 311, 316 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Clearly, the General Assembly intended that law enforcement officers have the right to engage in secondary employment, subject, however, to its reasonable regulation by the law enforcement agency. Consequently, it is equally as clear that, by enacting \u00a7 729A, it meant to limit the agency\u2019s ability to prohibit secondary employment except to the extent necessary for its reasonable regulation. Thus, unless the agency chooses to regulate secondary employment and promulgates regulations for that purpose, including one that authorizes the Chief to suspend or prohibit secondary employment as a disciplinary tool, a law enforcement officer, even one who has failed to obtain the required approval, may not be barred from engaging in secondary employment. Absent regulations permitting it, in other words, a prohibition of secondary employment for any reason contravenes \u00a7 729A.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>Baltimore City Police Department v. Andrew, </em>318 Md. 3, 566 A.2d 755 (1989), this Court addressed the effect to be given to a section of the LEOBR which, like \u00a7 729A, limits the agency\u2019s power. LEOBR \u00a7 728(b)(4), which lay at the heart of <em>Andrew, </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9M\">A complaint against a law enforcement officer, alleging brutality in the execution of his duties, may not be investigated unless the complaint be duly sworn to by the aggrieved person, a member of the aggrieved person\u2019s immediate family, or by any person with firsthand knowledge obtained as a result of the presence at and observation of the alleged incident, or by the parent or guardian in the case of a minor child.... <em>An investigation which could lead to disciplinary action under this subtitle for brutality may not be initiated and an action may not be taken unless </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>the complaint is filed within 90 days of the alleged brutality.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">(Emphasis supplied). Captain Andrew was charged with police brutality; however, the victim did not file the complaint within 90 days of the alleged incident, as required. Therefore, he sought to enjoin the Baltimore City Police Department from prosecuting or otherwise taking disciplinary action against him. The circuit court issued the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">On appeal, the Police Department argued that \u00a7 728 was not applicable because two sets of local provisions authorized it to initiate the disputed action. This Court disagreed, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">If \u00a7 728(b)(4) absolutely bars any investigation of a brutality complaint that might lead to disciplinary action against an officer, provided the sworn complaint is filed more than 90 days after the alleged incident, then no regulation of a police commissioner or police chief can change that outcome ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Id. </em>318 Md. at 13, 566 A.2d at 760. Thus, this Court enforced the limitation placed on the initiation of the brutality complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">When the agency\u2019s regulations do not authorize it, \u00a7 729A, in the same way that \u00a7 728(b)(4) was a limitation on the initiation of an investigation, is a limitation on the agency\u2019s authority to prohibit secondary employment. It too must be given full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Moreover, in lieu of permitting the prohibition of secondary employment, \u00a7 729A permits law enforcement agencies to control it by \u201cpromuIgat[ing] reasonable regulations\u201d for that purpose. Thus, that is a prerequisite to regulating secondary employment. Where a statute establishes a condition precedent for action authorized to be taken by an agency, the agency action may not validly be taken until that condition has been met. <em>Pyle v. Brooks, </em>31 Or.App. 479, 570 P.2d 990 (1977). <em>See Schinzel v. Department of Corrections, </em>124 Mich. App. 217, 333 N.W.2d 519 (1983). <em>See also Mayor and City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Council of Ocean City v. Johnson, </em>57 Md.App. 502, 470 A.2d 1308 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In <em>Pyle, </em>the court construed a statute which provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\"><em>Pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the Mental Health Division, </em>the superintendent of any state hospital for the treatment and care of the mentally ill may admit and hospitalize therein as a patient, any person who may be suffering from nervous disorder or mental illness, and who voluntarily has made written application for such admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">570 P.2d at 992. Agreeing with the appellant, it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">[The statute] authorizes voluntary commitment ... only \u201cpursuant to rules and regulations by the Mental Health Division.\u201d No such rules have been promulgated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">Where the legislature authorizes an agency to take action ... and establishes certain prerequisites for such action, we may infer that the requirement that the agency act pursuant to rule is more than a formality. Rather, rules are a prerequisite to such action ... The statutory requirement that the Mental Health Division act pursuant to rules will be given effect. Action taken purportedly under the statute was therefore unauthorized by it and is voidable upon challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><em>Id. </em>570 P.2d at 992-93 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The court, in <em>Schinzel, </em>held that, under that State\u2019s Administrative Procedures Act, an inmates\u2019 receipt of postage stamps sent through the mail could only be prohibited by rule. That Act defined \u201crule\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">an agency regulation,statement, standard, policy, ruling or instruction of general applicability, which implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or which prescribes the organization, procedure or practice of the agency, including the amendment, suspension or rescission thereof, but does not include the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(g) An intergovernmental, interagency or intra-agency memorandum, directive or communication which does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">333 N.W.2d at 520. The court rejected the department\u2019s contention that the policy directive was enforceable as an intra-agency memorandum, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A26h\">a policy directive may not be considered an intra-agency memorandum ... when it affects the rights and practices available to the public; it must be promulgated as a rule under the proper procedures set out by the APA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The result and rationale employed in <em>Johnson </em>is consistent. In that case, the Court of Special Appeals held that charges based on regulations which had not been approved by the Ocean City Mayor and City Council, as required by a provision of the Ocean City Code were invalid. In construing that code provision, the court noted that the subject matter of the regulations \u201cha[s] an obvious and significant impact upon the public at large and thus upon the public\u2019s perception of the City government.\u201d 57 Md.App. at 514, 470 A.2d at 1314. It concluded that the code provision had to be interpreted in that light, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">The Mayor and City Council who, under the City Charter, are ultimately responsible to the people for the operation of the police department, had good reason to insist that regulations of this type not be put in effect by the Chief of Police alone, without their prior approval. Section 15-1 was the expression of that limitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The Ethics Commission regulations were properly adopted by the Commission and approved by the County Council in accordance -with \u00a7 2A-15. Those regulations, however, do not purport to authorize the Chief to prohibit or suspend an officer\u2019s engaging in secondary employment as a sanction for their violation. They simply provide that violation \u201cmay result in disciplinary action and other penalties as provided by law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>And the County Personnel Regulations contain no such authorization; while permitting suspension, they refer to the officer\u2019s primary employment and then for a maximum period of 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Function Code 355, on the other hand, expressly authorizes the Chief \u201cto cancel, temporarily or permanently, permission of any employee engaged in secondary employment.\u201d \u00a7 VII.(B); But it was neither properly adopted nor approved as required by \u00a7 2A-15. Consequently, in light of \u00a7 729A, the authority it gives the Chief is, itself, unauthorized. There simply is no basis for the suspension of Officer McCullagh\u2019s right to engage in secondary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The appellee\u2019s argument that, \u00a7 729A notwithstanding, \u00a7 731 empowers the Chief to take any disciplinary action, including the suspension or prohibition of secondary employment, which he or she deems appropriate is no more persuasive. Adopting it undermines significantly the purpose and effect of the LEOBR, in general, and the prohibition of \u00a7 729A, in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Statutes are to be interpreted in light of the goal, aim, or purpose for which they were enacted. <em>MVA v. Gaddy, </em>335 Md. 342, 346, 643 A.2d 442, 444 (1994). Moreover, when a part of a statutory scheme, the meaning of a particular statute must be sought within the context of that entire scheme; it should not be construed in isolation. <em>Bd. of Trustees of the Md. State Retirement &amp; Pension Systems v. Harry Hughes, </em>340 Md. 1, 7, 664 A.2d 1250, 1253 (1995) (citing <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137-38, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994)) (\u201cWe do not read statutory language in isolation or out of context [but construe it] in light of the legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole.\u201d); <em>Cassidy, </em>338 Md. at 97, 656 A.2d at 761-62 (1995). Nor should we interpret a statutory scheme so as to render any part of it meaningless or nugatory. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v. Vieira, </em>340 Md. 651, 658, 667 A.2d 898, 901 (1995) (quoting <em>GEICO v.

The circuit court characterized \u00a7 731 as both \u201cprocedural and substantive as it authorizes the Chief of Police to impose punitive sanctions after a hearing and a finding of guilt.\u201d That the statute enumerated some of the punishment options thus was interpreted as conferring substantive powers on the Chief. It is also this aspect of the statute that makes its meaning unclear. Without the enumeration, the statute would clearly be procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The LEOBR was enacted in 1974, <em>see </em>1974 Laws, ch. 722, not for the purpose of defining the scope of the Chiefs substantive authority, but in order to guarantee that police officers are afforded certain procedural safeguards during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could result in disciplinary action. <em>See Moats v. City of Hagerstown, </em>324 Md. 519, 526, 597 A.2d 972, 975 (1991) (\u201cThe language and history of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights demonstrates an intent to establish an exclusive procedural remedy for a police officer in departmental disciplinary matters\u201d); <em>Andrew, </em>318 Md. at 12, 566 A.2d at 759 (citing <em>Montgomery County Dept. of Police v.

It is with this purpose in mind that we must determine the meaning and scope of \u00a7 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Where a statutory provision is ambiguous and the general purpose for which the statute was enacted militates in favor of one among the several possible interpretations, the statute must be given that interpretation which accords with its general purpose. <em>Cassidy, </em>338 Md. at 97, 656 A.2d at 761-62 (\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u2018should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. Any ambiguity in the law should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Victor v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>318 Md. 624, 629, 569 A.2d 697, 700 (1990)); <em>Rose v. Fox Pool, </em>335 Md. 351, 359, 643 A.2d 906, 909 (1994) (a statute \u201cmust be construed in accordance with its general purposes and policies.\u201d); <em>Walker v. Montgomery County Council, </em>244 Md. 98, 102, 223 A.2d 181, 183 (1966); (the court is guided by the rule that statutes are to be construed reasonably and -with reference to the purpose to be accomplished); <em>Maguire v. State, </em>192 Md. 615, 624, 65 A.2d 299, 303 (1949) (a statute should be construed so as to harmonize all its parts with each.other and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>render them consistent with its general object and scope). It would be illogical to interpret \u00a7 731(b) and (c) as conferring upon the Chief unfettered plenary power to impose disciplinary sanctions when the purpose for which the LEOBR was enacted was to ensure that the Chiefs exercise of that authority does not violate police officers\u2019 right to procedural due process. <em>Calhoun, </em>103 Md.App. at 672, 654 A.2d at 911. This is especially true in light of \u00a7 729A, which we have already interpreted, consistently with the purpose of the LEOBR, as limiting the Chiefs authority to deny law enforcement officers the right to engage in secondary employment. Moreover, the Chiefs authority to discipline police officers is impacted not only by \u00a7 731, but also, as this case demonstrates, by the \u00a7 729A prohibition. The appellee\u2019s construction of \u00a7 731 renders that prohibition meaningless and nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Its primary function being to provide a procedural framework for the protection of law enforcement officers subject to disciplinary action, the LEOBR is not an effective vehicle for defining the types of disciplinary sanctions available to the Chief. Indeed, not only would the appellee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 731 tend to negate the LEOBR, and especially \u00a7 729A, as a protective instrument for law enforcement officers, it would render meaningless Personnel Regulation \u00a7 27, as well as Mont.Cty.Code \u00a7 35-3(a) and (c) and 2A-15. The former Code section<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>, included in the 1965 Code, <em>see </em>Mont.Cty.Code (1965), \u00a7 96-5, predates the 1974 enactment of the LEOBR. <em>See </em>1974 Laws, ch. 722. There is nothing in the legislative history of the LEOBR to suggest, much less indicate, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Legislature intended, by enacting it, to so impact local legislation and regulations pertaining to law enforcement agencies.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We conclude that \u00a7 731 prescribes the procedure for the conduct of department disciplinary proceedings. While it describes the authority of the hearing board to recommend, and confirms the power of the chief to impose, certain disciplinary sanctions, it does not define the scope of the Chiefs authority to discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

Although it references <em>(albeit </em>not by specific Code reference) both \u00a7 19A-12 of the Montgomery County Code and the regulations the Ethics Commission adopted pursuant thereto, Function Code 355 does not directly mirror either. While recognizing the ultimate responsibility of the Ethics Commission to approve or deny secondary employment requests, <em>see </em>\u00a7 V.D., it gives the Chief, <em>id., </em>and, in some instances, district or unit commanders, <em>see </em>\u00a7 V.C., authority to give initial approval. While the county ordinance and the regulations adopted pursuant to it contain broad categories of restrictions, Function Code 355 contains more specific ones, eight in all. Moreover, there is a critical substantive difference between the Function Code and the regulations, the former expressly giving the Chief the power to prohibit secondary employment, while the latter expressly does not, confining the Chief's authority to imposing sanctions \"as provided by law.\u201d <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">. These regulations, including amendments to them adopted subsequent to 1984, when Article II of the Administrative Procedures act was adopted, <em>see </em>1984 L.M.C., ch. 24, \u00a7 1, ar\u00e9 not compiled in COMCOR, notwithstanding \u00a7 2A-18. We have found no explanation for the omission. Neither party has raised this as an issue. Consequently, we do not address its effect, if any; we simply note the omission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">. Section 729A requires action by the law enforcement agency in the form of promulgating regulations. Clearly recognizing that regulations covering the same subject had already been adopted by the Ethics Commission, another County Agency, the Chief issued Function Code 355 apparently not as a regulation \u2014 it was not issued with the required formality or Council approval \u2014 but, as Code \u00a7 35-3(c) permits, as a departmental rule, <em>i.e., </em>an order or administrative procedure, largely to approve, if not adopt, those regulations. Ordinarily, this would raise the question of the effect of the Ethics Commission Regulations. We need not, and do not, decide that issue. We have previously indicated that, notwithstanding their contention that the Police Department has never properly issued regulations, reasonable or otherwise, with respect to secondary employment, the appellants do not challenge the validity of the reprimand sanction, presumably because the Ethics Commission regulations were properly adopted and the fact that \"reprimand\u201d is one of the disciplinary actions prescribed in \u00a7 27-3 of the Personnel Regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b225-5\">. Section 35-3 also provides, as relevant to the issue <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">(f) <em>Operation of department generally. </em>The director of police shall extract from all members of the police unquestioned loyalty, unfailing energy and strict obedience and shall take prompt action in prosecuting any member guilty of interfering with, or in any manner impeding, the orderly and efficient operation and conduct of the department of police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">(g) <em>Charges against members. </em>The director shall refer all charges properly filed with the director or the department against any member of the police to the office of internal affairs.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">. The appellee recognizes that the Chief is bound by Personnel Regulation \u00a7 27, pursuant to Mont.Cty.Code \u00a7 35-3(a). It also is aware that \u00a7 27-3, which delineates the types of disciplinary action the Chief is authorized to take, does not address secondary employment and certainly does not permit the imposition of a three month suspension of an officer\u2019s right to engage in secondary employment. Consistent with its argument that \u00a7 731 defines the disciplinary sanctions the Chief is authorized to impose, the appellee asserts, relying on LEOBR \u00a7 734B, that \u00a7 731 supersedes Personnel Regulation \u00a7 27, to the extent of any conflict. Section 734B provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">[Tlhe provisions of this subtitle shall supersede any State, county or municipal law, ordinance, or regulations that conflicts with the provisions of this subtitle, and any local legislation shall be preempted by the subject and material of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The validity of this argument is dependent upon the interpretation given \u00a7 731. Since we do not interpret that section as the appellee does, we need not address the preemption argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
