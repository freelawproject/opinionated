O\u2019Donnell as the duly elected member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 29-C is affirmed, with costs. Mandate to issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b469-11\">ELDRIDGE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The dispute in this case is over the validity of absentee ballots cast in the 1994 general election for House of Delegates seat 29-C. This Court issued an order on January 10, 1995, affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment which had upheld the decision of local election officials to count the challenged ballots. We now set forth the reasons for our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Appellant Pelagatti and appellee O\u2019Donnell were candidates for the 1994 general election for the House of Delegates seat for District 29-C which includes parts of Calvert and St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Mary\u2019s Counties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The election was held on November 8, 1994, and the next day the Boards of Supervisors of Elections for both counties canvassed the votes. Prior to the counting of any absentee ballots, Pelagatti had received a total of 5,565 votes and O\u2019Donnell had received 5,539 votes, a difference of 26 votes in Pelagatti\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">On November 10, 1994, the Calvert County Board of Supervisors of Elections<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> met to count the 494 absentee ballots which it had received.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After an initial count of 175 absentee ballots, a representative of one of the candidates for Governor raised the question of whether each absentee ballot previously counted had been accompanied by an \u201cApplication for Absentee Ballot.\u201d These applications were supplied by the State Administrative Board of Election Laws, and, according to the representative of the gubernatorial candidate, an application was required by Maryland Code (1957), Art. 33, \u00a7 27-4, to be returned by a voter to the Board of Supervisors of Elections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>prior to the issuance of an absentee ballot. Section 27-4 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cExcept as provided in \u00a7 27-2 of this article, a qualified voter desiring to vote at any election as an absentee voter shall make application in writing to the board for an absentee ballot, which application must be received not later than the Tuesday preceding the election. The application shall contain an affidavit, which need not be under oath but which shall set forth such information, under penalty of perjury, as may be required by the State Administrative Board of Election Laws. Upon receipt of the application the board shall issue, to the voter or a duly authorized agent, an absentee ballot.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Specifically, the representative of the gubernatorial candidate maintained that the application for an absentee ballot contains statutorily prescribed language, in the form of an affidavit, by which the registered voter, by signing the application, affirms under penalty of perjury that he or she is eligible to vote as an absentee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the representative\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>argument continued, if an absentee ballot was received that did not have a corresponding signed application containing an affidavit, the ballot should not have been counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In light of the question raised by the representative of the candidate for Governor, the Board reexamined the ballot envelopes from which the first 175 absentee ballots had been removed and counted. The Board determined that 25 of these ballots did not have corresponding applications for an absentee ballot. When this irregularity was discovered, however, the 175 ballots had been separated from their envelopes, and the ballots lacked identifying characteristics once removed from their envelopes. Thus, although it could be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>from the envelopes that 25 ballots did not have corresponding applications for absentee ballots, it was impossible to ascertain from the documents which 25 of the 175 ballots fell into this category. Therefore, the Board could not determine how many of the 25 ballots were for Pelagatti and how many of the 25 ballots were for O\u2019Donnell because of the commingling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">After this concern was raised, measures were taken to segregate the remaining ballots to be counted that did not have the accompanying application for an absentee ballot. It was discovered that 19 additional ballots also lacked applications. Despite this alleged irregularity, however, the Board included these 19 ballots in its final count and also included all 175 absentee ballots counted previously.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The final election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tally, including all absentee ballots from both counties, certified by the Boards of Supervisors of Elections for Calvert and St. Mary\u2019s Counties on November 18, 1994, was 5,807 for Pelagatti and 5,839 for O\u2019Donnell, a difference of 32 votes in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">On November 23, 1994, Pelagatti filed in the Circuit Court for Calvert County a \u201cPetition to Appeal and Contest Election,\u201d requesting that the court order the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Calvert County not to count certain absentee ballots or, alternatively, to order a new election. Pelagatti\u2019s petition, as amended, named as defendants the Board of Supervisors of Elections for Calvert County, the State Administrative Board of Elections Laws, and O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">At the circuit court hearing, Pelagatti argued that Art. 33, \u00a7 27-4, required that a registered voter, wishing to cast an absentee ballot, complete an application that sets forth in affidavit form that the person is eligible to vote as an absentee. Specifically, Pelagatti focused on the language in \u00a7 27-4 that states that the \u201capplication shall contain an affidavit, which need not be under oath but which shall set forth such information, under penalty of perjury, as may be required by the State Administrative Board of Election Laws.\u201d He maintained that this language requires an absentee voter to warrant by affidavit that he or she is entitled to vote absentee, and the language and voter\u2019s signature on the application for an absentee ballot satisfies this requirement. Moreover, Pelagatti contended that because 44 absentee ballots cast in the election for the seat in the House of Delegates from District 29-C lacked the accompanying applications for absentee ballots, these ballots should not have been counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Pelagatti acknowledged, however, that 25 of the 44 ballots had been commingled with proper ballots before anyone had raised the issue, that, therefore, it was impossible to determine whether the 25 ballots were for O\u2019Donnell or himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and that rejection of the remaining 19 identifiable ballots would not alter the outcome of the election. Consequently, in addressing the issue of whether the election outcome would have been different if the improper ballots had not been counted, Pelagatti argued that all Calvert County absentee ballots cast in the election were \u201ctainted\u201d and should be rejected. Alternatively, he maintained that, because 25 of the invalid ballots were commingled with 150 proper ballots, all 175 ballots should be discarded, along with the additional 19 ballots later found to be lacking applications.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, he suggested that the 44 improper ballots alone \u201cmight\u201d alter the outcome of the election, with Pelagatti winning by 1 to 4 votes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In response, O\u2019Donnell contended that the ballots were not invalid for lack of corresponding applications for absentee ballots. Rather, according to O\u2019Donnell, the written request for an absentee ballot application and the absentee ballot envelope, signed by the voter, substantially complied with the requirement set forth in Art. 33, \u00a7 27-4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, O\u2019Don<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>nell asserted that if 44 ballots were in fact invalid, 25 of these 44 ballots were commingled with 150 concededly valid ballots, and that the 25 invalid ballots should not result in the disenfranchisement of 150 voters casting valid ballots. O\u2019Donnell maintained that Pelagatti had failed to meet his burden of proof that the outcome of the election would have been different without the invalid ballots. Finally, O\u2019Donnell asserted that Pelagatti should be barred from challenging the validity of the 25 commingled ballots when neither he nor his representative raised the issue prior to the counting and commingling of the absentee ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Following the hearing, the circuit judge denied Pelagatti\u2019s request for relief, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cThe Court does not find that there\u2019s any law or requirement that under these circumstances ... any ballot should be thrown out.... [T]he court does not believe their ballots would be thrown out anyway because they had done all they needed to [do in order to be] eligible voters. The only thing [the voters] didn\u2019t do, and it wasn\u2019t their fault, they didn\u2019t get around the law or not comply intentionally with the statute, they were never told the other things they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>had to do to vote absentee.... So, the Court feels it would be a substantial injustice to disenfranchise the 150 people who went through the process and did so because 25 others and 19 others voted in good faith----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Pelagatti immediately noted an appeal, and on January 9, 1995, this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals. As previously mentioned, on January 10, 1995, after hearing oral argument, this Court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment in favor of O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Both in the circuit court and in this Court, Pelagatti argued that the basis for his action was Code (1957, 1993 Repl. Vol.), Art. 33, subtitle 19, consisting of \u00a7\u00a7 19-1 through 19-5. Subtitle 19 of the Election Code provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201c\u00a7 19-2. Judicial challenges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">If no other timely and adequate remedy is provided by this article, and by filing a petition in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 19-3 of this subtitle, any registered voter may seek judicial relief from any act or omission relating to an election, whether or not the election has been held, on the grounds that the act or omission:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">(1) Is inconsistent with this article or other law applicable to the elections process; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">(2) May change or have changed the outcome of the election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">}{* sj* if: H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">\u201c\u00a7 19-5. Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">Upon a finding, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that the act or omission involved materially affected the rights of interested parties or the purity of the elections process and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">(1) Might have changed the outcome of an election already held, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>(i) Declare null and void the election for the office, offices, question, or questions involved and order that the election be held again on a date set by the court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">(ii) Order any other relief that will provide an adequate remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">According to Pelagatti, the Board\u2019s counting 44 absentee ballots which had no corresponding applications constituted an \u201cact\u201d which was \u201cinconsistent with\u201d \u00a7 27-4 of Article 33, and this act \u201c[m]ight have changed the outcome of\u2019 the election, within the meaning of Art. 33, \u00a7\u00a7 19-2(1) and 19-5(1). In this Court, Pelagatti requested \u201cthe Court to disqualify the [19] separated improper votes as well as the 175 votes which were commingled with the 25 improper votes. Alternatively, we ask[ ] the Court to disqualify all of the absentee ballots.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Although we do not suggest that the result in this case would have been any different if subtitle 19 of the Election Code were the appropriate statutory basis for Pelagatti\u2019s action, we point out that this action was not authorized by subtitle 19. Section 19-2 authorizes a judicial action by a registered voter only \u201c[i]f no other timely and adequate remedy is provided by this article....\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Art. 33, \u00a7 27-10, does provide a timely and adequate judicial review remedy for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[cjontests concerning ... the validity of any ballot under this subtitle....\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Pelagatti\u2019s complaint was that 44 absentee ballots were invalid under \u00a7 27-4, which is in the same subtitle as \u00a7 27-10. Pelagatti was a candidate who was aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision concerning the ballots; consequently, he was entitled to judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision under \u00a7 27-10(c). Because of the availability of the judicial review action under \u00a7 27-10, no action could be brought by Pelagatti under subtitle 19. Moreover, Pelagatti\u2019s judicial action was timely under the requirements of \u00a7 27 \u2014 10(d), (e) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">This Court has, \u201con a number of occasions, expressed the view that \u2018unimportant mistakes made by election officials should not be allowed to thwart the will of the people freely expressed at the ballot box\u2019 or that \u2018mere irregularities ... should not be allowed to set aside what the voters have decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lamb v. Hammond, </em>308 Md. 286, 310-311, 518 A.2d 1057, 1069 (1987), quoting <em>Wilkinson v. McGill, </em>192 Md. 387, 393, 395, 64 A.2d 266, 269-270 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">As stated by the Court in <em>McNulty v. Board of Elections, 245 </em>Md. 1, 8-9, 224 A.2d 844, 848 (1966), \u201c[i]t is ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>axiomatic that unnecessary disenfranchisement of voters due to minor errors or irregularities in casting their ballots, in the absence of fraud, should be avoided.\u201d The Court went on to point out that where an election board\u2019s error \u201cdoes not interfere with the fair expression of the will of the voters, the result of the election need not be disturbed.\u201d 245 Md. at 9, 224 A.2d at 849. <em>See also, e.g., Mahoney v. Sup. of Elections, </em>205 Md. 380, 390, 109 A.2d 110, 115 (1954) (\u201cavoidance of the unnecessary disenfranchisement of voters due to minor errors or irregularities in marking their ballots\u201d is important); <em>Mahoney v. Sup. of Elections, </em>205 Md. 325, 336, 108 A.2d 143, 147-148 (1954); <em>Town of Landover Hills v. Brandt, </em>199 Md. 105, 109, 85 A.2d 449, 451 (1952); <em>White v. Laird, </em>127 Md. 120, 126, 96 A. 318, 320 (1915) (stating, with regard to the contention that primary election ballots were not marked with precisely the type of pencil prescribed by the law, that \u201cit might have a tendency to cause the average voter to believe that the primary election law of Maryland is a snare and delusion, rather than a method of obtaining honest nominations, if Courts must hold ballots to be invalid for such reasons\u201d); <em>Coulehan v. White, </em>95 Md. 703, 53 A. 786 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In addition, as pointed out by Judge Wilner for this Court in <em>Lamb v. Hammond, supra, </em>308 Md. at 311, 518 A.2d at 1069, the Court has \u201cendeavored to sustain votes that were in substantial compliance with the requirements of law.\u201d <em>See also Hammond v. Love, </em>187 Md. 138, 145-146, 49 A.2d 75, 78 (1946) (\u201cpartial compliance [with a legal requirement], notwithstanding non-compliance in some details, may constitute such substantial compliance that the election or the vote in question will not be invalidated\u201d); <em>Roe v. Wier, </em>181 Md. 26, 30, 28 A.2d 471, 473 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">On the other hand, \u201cwe have never sanctioned the counting of ballots that were plainly in violation of a law particularly designed to protect the integrity of the elective process.\u201d <em>Lamb v. Hammond, supra, </em>308 Md. at 311, 518 A.2d at 1069. Or, as Chief Judge Marbury explained for the Court in <em>Wilkinson v. McGill, supra, </em>192 Md. at 395, 64 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>at 270, the general principle that irregularities will not invalidate ballots or elections does not apply when election officials violate \u201ca preemptory requirement designed to safeguard the integrity of elections, the neglect of which presents an apparent opportunity for fraud.\u201d <em>See also Hammond v. Love, supra, </em>187 Md. at 146-149, 49 A.2d at 78-80. Nevertheless, \u201cthe burden of showing that the action of the Supervisors [of Elections] has been clearly illegal is not a light one.\u201d <em>Mahoney v. Sup. of Elections, supra, </em>205 Md. at 390, 109 A.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In light of these principles, there may well be merit in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s argument that the 44 absentee ballots were not invalid and that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of Art. 33, \u00a7 27-4. The written and signed request for an application for an absentee ballot, coupled with the signed absentee ballot envelope, appeared to contain all of the information which would have been contained in the application for an absentee ballot. The circuit court in this case found that the voter, by signing the absentee ballot envelope, attested to the same facts that the voter would have attested to if he or she had signed an application for an absentee ballot. Furthermore, there was not a shred of evidence that any of the Calvert County absentee ballots counted by the Board were cast by ineligible persons. In addition, there is no evidence that any voter was able to vote twice, once by absentee ballot and once personally.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Under all of these circumstances, and considering the principles set forth in the Maryland cases, it would not seem that Pelagatti met his burden of showing that the 44 absentee ballots, not accompanied by applications on the form specified by the State Administrative Board of Election Laws, were clearly illegal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Nevertheless, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the absentee ballots not accompanied by applications were clearly illegal, Pelagatti would not have prevailed. In order to invalidate or change the results of the election in a case such as this, the challenger must demonstrate that the illegality altered the outcome of the election. <em>See, e.g., McNulty v. Board of Elections, supra, </em>245 Md. at 11-13, 224 A.2d at 849-851; <em>Mahoney v. Sup. of Elections, supra, </em>205 Md. at 395, 109 A.2d at 118 (\u201cIf there were any such [illegal ballots], they were too few in number to alter the result of the election\u201d); <em>Mahoney v. Sup. of Elections, supra, </em>205 Md. at 335, 108 A.2d at 147 (an election challenger is not entitled \u201cto demand an abstract right which would be unaccompanied by any substantial benefit.... In the instant cases it was beyond dispute that if the challenged ballots were rejected ..., the petitioner would obtain the majority\u201d); <em>Town of handover Hills v. Brandt, supra, </em>199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Md. at 109, 85 A.2d at 451; <em>Wilkinson v. McGill, supra, </em>192 Md. at 395, 64 A.2d at 271 (stating, with regard to several alleged election illegalities, that \u201cnone of them are shown to have affected the ultimate result, and ... they should not be allowed to set aside what the voters have decided\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Moreover, in determining whether invalid ballots affected the outcome of an election, the courts will not guess or speculate or \u201cresort to probability\u201d as to which candidate or which side of an issue the invalid ballots favored. <em>McNulty v. Board of Elections, supra, </em>245 Md. at 11, 224 A.2d at 850; <em>Wilkinson v. McGill, supra, </em>192 Md. at 402-403, 64 A.2d at 274. Instead, the party challenging the election results has the burden of proving that the illegality changed the outcome of the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">For example, in <em>Wilkinson v. McGill, supra, </em>192 Md. 387, 64 A.2d 266, this Court considered whether the casting of illegal votes should invalidate a referendum election with respect to an Act creating a sanitary district in Allegany County. According to the Court (192 Md. at 392, 64 A.2d at 269),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cthere was an illegal registration of 26 people of whom 23 voted; and that as the majority in favor of the Act was only 16, these illegal votes, if cast in favor of the Act, carried the election, whereas, if they had not voted, it is probable that the election would have been decided the other way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In rejecting the plaintiffs argument that the election should be set aside because the 23 illegal ballots probably affected the outcome of the election, Chief Judge Marbury, after reviewing numerous cases throughout the country, explained for the Court <em>(Wilkinson v. McGill, supra, </em>192 Md. at 402, 64 A.2d at 274):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201cThe question is by no means free from difficulty, but we think the weight of authority and the better reasoning uphold the view that complainants, desiring to avoid an election because illegal votes are cast, have upon them the burden of proving for whom these votes are cast. They cannot thrust that burden upon the Court by arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>there is a probability that such votes were cast for the side having the majority. They must prove, or at least attempt to prove, how the illegal voters voted. If direct proof cannot be obtained from the illegal voters themselves, other evidence of a circumstantial nature may be offered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Similarly, in <em>McNulty v. Board of Elections, supra, </em>245 Md. 1, 224 A.2d 844, this Court considered whether a candidate for the Democratic nomination for State Senator could be awarded 136 ballots that had been cast in error, with the result that none of the 136 ballots were credited to any of the candidates in the election. The error occurred when election officials failed, in violation of the law, to lock lever 7E on the voting machine and to cover line E in column 7. There were four candidates for the nomination, and McNulty was listed fourth in column 7. His corresponding lever was 7D.

According to the evidence in this case, voters who would be absent from their precinct on the day of election would contact the Board of Supervisors of Elections and request in writing an absentee ballot. The request form used by the Calvert County Board stated that \u201cI would like to receive an application to vote by Absentee Ballot because\" and then listed the permissible reasons, requiring the applicant to check one of them. The form contained a place for the voter\u2019s address, and required the voter\u2019s signature. In response to this request, the Board, before sending the ballot, would ordinarily send an \u201cApplication For Absentee Ballot\" to be completed and returned by the voter, and then upon the receipt of this application, the Board would issue the ballot. Some requests for absentee ballots, however, were made so close to the election that the Boaid thought that it would be impossible to have the voter fill out and return the application for an absentee ballot and then be sent the actual ballot within the statutorily prescribed time. Thus, in order not to disenfranchise these voters, the Board sent the ballot to them without first requiring the receipt of an application for an absentee ballot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">.

Thus, Pelagatti argued that taking 14 ballots from O'Donnell and 3 from himself would reduce the gap between the candidates to 21 votes. In addition, Pelagatti assumed that O'Donnell received at least 22 votes from the remaining 25 allegedly improper ballots, and he would also have removed these ballots from O'Donnell's total, leaving as a possible result a victory for Pelagatti by as much as 4 votes or as little as 1 vote.
