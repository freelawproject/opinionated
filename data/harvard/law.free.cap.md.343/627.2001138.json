State, </em>273 Md. 131, 328 A.2d 293 (1974), in which the difference between unauthorized use, Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Replacement Volume) Article 27, \u00a7 349 and larceny, former Article 27, \u00a7 342, was explored, the Court of Special Appeals inappropriately revisited and adopted arguments that this Court rejected in that case. Nevertheless, the result it reached would appear to be warranted. The crime of larceny has now been subsumed by \u00a7 340 of the Consolidated Theft Statute, Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 340-344. The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that statute, specifically \u00a7 340(c). Application of \u00a7 340(c) supports the same result the juvenile court ultimately reached even though it is clear that the intermediate appellate court neither relied on, nor applied, that section to arrive at its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Therefore, the petition for writ of certiorari in the above entitled case having been granted and heard, it is this first day of November, 1996</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">ORDERED, by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, that the writ of certiorari be, and it is hereby, dismissed with costs, the petition having been improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Judge Raker concurs in the result only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
