City of Greenbelt, </em>293 Md. 69, 71, 441 A.2d 1064 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMp\">The term condominium may be defined generally as a system for providing separate ownership of individual units in multiple-unit developments. In addition to the interest acquired in a particular apartment, each unit owner also is a tenant in common in the underlying fee and in the spaces and building parts used in common by all the unit owners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALu\">4B Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00b6 632.1[4] (1996). A condominium owner, therefore, holds a hybrid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>property interest consisting of an exclusive ownership of a particular unit or apartment and a tenancy in common with the other co-owners in the common elements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Andrews, supra, </em>293 Md. at 73-74, 441 A.2d 1064; <em>see also Starfish Condo, v.

Upholding a rule prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in a condominium\u2019s clubhouse, a Florida court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">It appears to us that inherent in the condominium concept is the principle that to promote the health, happiness, and peace of mind of the majority of the unit owners since they are living in such close proximity and using facilities in common, each unit owner must give up a certain degree of freedom of choice which he might otherwise enjoy in separate, privately ovmed property. Condominium unit owners comprise a little democratic sub society of necessity more restrictive as it pertains to use of condominium property than may be existent outside the condominium organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnA\"><em>Hidden Harbour Estates, Inc. v. Norman, </em>309 So.2d 180, 181-82 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1975); <em>see also Nahrstedt v.

The Act was originally enacted by Ch. 387 of the Acts of 1963, as the Horizontal Property Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in response to \u00a7 104 of the Federal Housing Act of 1961, Pub.L. No. 87-70, 75 Stat. 149, which made federal mortgage insurance available to condominiums in states where title and ownership were established for such units. The Act was based on the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s Model Horizontal Property Act of 1961. 66 Op.Atty.Gen. 50, 52 (1981). The legislature amended and recodified the Act by Ch. 641 of the Acts of 1974.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Under the Act, property becomes a condominium upon the recording of a declaration, bylaws, and a condominium plat. \u00a7 11-102. The declaration must include the name of the condominium; a description of the entire project, the units, and the common elements; and the percentage interests in the common elements and votes appurtenant to each unit. \u00a7 11\u2014 103(a). The declaration may be amended with the written consent of at least 80% of the unit owners, except that unanimous consent of the owners is required for some amendments, such as altering percentage interests in common ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ments, changing the use of units from residential to nonresidential and vice versa, and redesignating general common elements as limited common elements. \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b); 11-107(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The bylaws govern the administration of the condominium and must include the form of the condominium administration and its powers, meeting procedures, and fee collection procedures. \u00a7 11-104(a), (b). The former \u00a7 11 \u2014 111(f) also required the bylaws to include restrictions on the use of units and common elements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1974 amendments made inclusion of such use restrictions in the bylaws optional. Section 11-104(c) now provides: \u201cThe bylaws may also contain any other provision regarding the management and operation of the condominium including any restriction on or requirement respecting the use and maintenance of the units and the common elements.\u201d The bylaws may be amended by at least a 2/3 vote of the unit owners. \u00a7 ll-104(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Council of Unit Owners, which may delegate its powers to a Board of Directors, governs the affairs of the condominium and may adopt rules for the condominium. \u00a7\u00a7 11-109(a),(b), 111(a). If there is any conflict between the provisions of the various documents governing the condominium, the statute controls, then the declaration, plat, bylaws, and rules in that order. \u00a7 11-124(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The Ridgely, located at 205 East Joppa Road in Towson, Maryland, was established in June, 1975. According to Article XV, \u00a7 1 of the Association\u2019s bylaws, all of the 239 units in the building are residential, except for the seven units on the first floor which \u201cmay be used as professional offices.\u201d Each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>seven commercial units is accessible both through the lobby and directly through a door located outside of the building. There are no porches or canopies protecting the exterior entrances to the commercial units.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The accounting firm of Smyrnioudis &amp; Wilhelm occupies unit 102. Nicholas Smyrnioudis, Jr. and his father, Nicholas Smyrnioudis, Sr., have owned the unit since 1977. Clients entered the office through both the lobby and outside exterior doors until the office was remodeled in 1987 at a cost of approximately $40,000. The exterior door now opens into a conference room. Nicholas Smyrnioudis, Jr. testified that switching the reception area and conference room would involve removing an eleven foot reception counter, non-bearing walls, and carpeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Mary Granger operated a mail list brokerage and management company in unit 104, which she purchased in 1985. The three or four clients who visited each month used both the lobby and exterior doors. During the pendency of this litigation, Granger sold her unit to Philip R. Grillo, who also operates a business in the unit. Visitors to all of the other commercial units use the exterior doors exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In 1990, the Association remodeled the lobby of the Ridgely at a cost of approximately $125,000. The lobby, which is among the condominium\u2019s common elements, is elaborately decorated with marble floors, dark wood-paneled walls and decorative furniture. The cost of the remodeling was paid out of condominium fees to which both the commercial and residential tenants contribute. Nicholas Smyrnioudis, Jr. testified that use of the lobby is important for his business because of its appearance and because it allows clients to avoid wet grass, ice, rain, and snow. Mary Granger also testified that the lobby \u201clends to our credibility as a professional business\u201d and \u201cmakes a nice impression.\u201d In addition, she testified that using the exterior door in the winter makes it difficult to keep the office warm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The president of the Association, Calvin Coblentz, testified that members of the Association had become concerned about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>security around the time the lobby was renovated. A card system was installed for the garage doors and elevators in the garage, fire exits were made inaccessible from outside the building, and lighting was added in the parking areas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">In May of 1990, the Board of Directors, in response to members\u2019 security concerns, sought to have the commercial unit owners voluntarily agree to have visitors use the exterior entrances to their units exclusively. When this effort failed to achieve full compliance, the Board of Directors, in the spring of 1991, adopted a resolution which provided that: \u201cEffective September 1, 1991, clients of commercial units owners and tenants shall not utilize the Condominium\u2019s lobbies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">On August 27, 1991, (1) Nicholas Smyrnioudis, Jr., Sr. and George Wilhelm; (2) Merrill I. Berman and Joseph B. Francus; and (3) Mary E. Granger (appellees) filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against the Association seeking to enjoin the enactment or enforcement of rules restricting the use of the lobby by the appellees\u2019 clients.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On or about October 1, 1991, the members of the Association voted to amend the bylaws. Originally, Article XV, \u00a7 1 of the bylaws provided: \u201cAll units shall be used as a single family residence, except that up to a maximum of seven (7) units on the first floor may be used as professional offices.\u201d The amendment added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">provided however, that all clients of, or visitors to, professional office owners or their tenants shall be required to use the exterior entrances of each such professional office for ingress and egress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>No visitor or clients of any owner of a professional office or tenant thereof, shall be permitted in any other area of the building, unless accompanied by the owner of the office unit or the tenant of such office unit. For the purpose of this section, the terms \u201cclients\u201d or \u201cvisitor\u201d of professional office owner or tenant, shall include the clients or visitor and all person(s) who may accompany such client or visitor to such professional office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The appellees do not challenge the procedures used to adopt the resolution or amend the bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The appellees filed an amended complaint on September 27, 1991. Pending trial, the parties reached an agreement which allowed commercial visitors to use the lobby, but required them to sign in and wait at the front desk for an escort.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">After a trial, Judge John F. Fader, II, on April 18, 1994, enjoined the Association from enforcing the bylaw. In his opinion, Judge Fader determined that \u201cthe proper standard of review is whether the Condominium\u2019s rule is reasonable.\u201d The restriction, he said, \u201cis unenforceable for failure to reasonably relate to the health, happiness and enjoyment of unit owners.\u201d Safety concerns, he noted, had prompted the adoption of the restriction, but there was no evidence that any commercial visitors had threatened the building\u2019s security. Judge Fader added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">There was no indication that the prohibition of all access by commercial tenants and their clients/patients was the only method, the least intrusive method, or the best means available to lessen the possibility of unauthorized persons entering the building, or of authorized individuals causing trouble. In prohibiting commercial access via the main lobby, the Board reacted to a situation, which objectively was not dire, and which did not require the stringent regulation initiated by the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Judge Fader also held that the restriction \u201cfails the reasonableness test since it has a discriminatory impact on commercial unit owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Ridgely Condo. v. Smymioudis, </em>105 Md.App. 404, 660 A.2d 942 (1995). At the outset, it said that \u201cour review of the record convinces us that this case actually concerns an access restriction that has diluted appellees\u2019 respective percentage interests in the Condominium lobby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 660 A.2d 942. In a footnote, the court said that, \u201cTo deny the use of the lobby to clients of the commercial unit owners constitutes an <em>ultra vires </em>taking of a portion of their percentage interest in the common areas in derogation of the Ridgely Condominium declaration as well as certain provisions of the Maryland Condominium Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409 n. 2, 660 A.2d 942. Nonetheless, the court declined to base its decision on that issue since it was not argued by the parties in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 660 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The court held that the reasonableness test is the proper standard of review for evaluating restrictions contained in a bylaw amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 660 A.2d 942. Courts apply a more deferential standard of review to recorded use restrictions, the court said, because unit owners have notice of the restrictions when they purchase their units. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 660 A.2d 942. In contrast, the court concluded that the more restrictive reasonableness standard is appropriate in this case, because owners did not have notice of the restriction when they purchased their units. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 660 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The court emphasized the disparate impact of the restriction on the commercial unit owners, <em>id. </em>at 421, 660 A.2d 942, and indicated that \u00a7 11-108 may require any use restriction that does not apply equally to all unit owners to be stated in the declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 660 A.2d 942. Thus, the court held that application of a deferential standard of review is particularly inappropriate where the use restriction has a discriminatory impact. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 422, 660 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The Association filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, and which presented this question: \u201cDid the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>appropriate standard of review for evaluating the propriety of a condominium by-law amendment?\u201d In their brief and before the lower courts, the appellees argued that courts should apply a reasonableness test in reviewing the validity of condominium bylaw amendments. At oral argument before us, however, they argued in addition that the bylaw amendment at issue violated both the declaration and the Act by \u201ctaking\u201d a property right. Such changes in property interests, they maintained, may only be accomplished by amending the declaration with the unanimous consent of the unit owners. Although this point was not briefed by the parties and was only briefly alluded to in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, the appellees urge this Court to reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Under Rule 8 \u2014 131(b), we \u201cordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals.\u201d Appellees\u2019 argument is directly responsive to the question in the petition for certiorari. They assert that the test for evaluating the propriety of the by-law amendment is whether it deprives a unit owner of a property right. Consequently, in our view, the argument is encompassed within the question presented in the certiorari petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In reviewing the validity of a rule, a court must determine whether the Board of Directors or Council of Unit Owners had the authority to promulgate the rule at issue under the Act, declaration, and bylaws. <em>Dulaney Towers, supra, </em>46 Md.App. at 466, 418 A.2d 1233; <em>Johnson v. Hobson, </em>505 A.2d 1313, 1317 (D.C.App.1986); <em>Juno by the Sea North Condominium v. Manfredonia, </em>397 So.2d 297 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1981); 68 Op.Atty.Gen. 112, 119 (1983). Since we find that the Association did not have the authority to enact the rule at issue here by amending the bylaws, we do not reach the question briefed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The Association contends that the rule is merely a use restriction which the Council of Unit Owners may enact by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>amending the bylaws with a 2/3 vote of the unit owners.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cases addressing the propriety of use restrictions fall generally into two categories. In the first class of cases, which we will refer to as \u201cexclusive use\u201d cases, some courts rule that granting <em>exclusive </em>use of common elements to one or few unit owners changes the percentage interest of the excluded unit owners in the common elements. <em>E.g., Kaplan v. Boudreaux, </em>410 Mass. 435, 573 N.E.2d 495 (1991). In the second class of cases, which we will refer to as \u201cequality\u201d cases, some courts rule that if a restriction applies equally to all the unit owners, it does not change their respective percentage interests in the common elements. <em>E.g., Jarvis v. Stage Neck Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>464 A.2d 952 (Me.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in <em>Kaplan, supra, </em>573 N.E.2d at 497, reviewed a bylaw amendment granting exclusive use of a path, which was part of the condominium\u2019s common elements, to one unit. The statute required consent of all the unit owners to alter the percentage interests in the common elements. <em>Id. </em>The court found that it was not necessary to \u201ctransfer ... the sum total of a unit owner\u2019s interests in a portion of the common area\u201d in order to \u201caffect [the] percentage interest in the common area.\u201d Rather, \u201c[t]ransfer of an interest that is smaller than an \u2018ownership\u2019 interest would suffice to alter the percentage interest held by each [owner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>573 N.E.2d at 498-99. The court held that the amendment affected an interest in land because it resembled an easement and concluded that the amendment changed the relative percentage interests of the unit owners in the common elements. Therefore, consent of all the unit owners was required to enact the amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 500; <em>see also Makeever v. Lyle, </em>125 Ariz. 384, 609 P.2d 1084, 1089 (Ariz.Ct.App.1980) (converting general common elements to exclusive use of one owner constitutes taking of other owners\u2019 property without authority); <em>Preston v.

Reid, </em>628 A.2d 155, 157 (Me.1993) (cottage encroaching on limited common area violated other owners\u2019 property rights despite prior exclusivity of use).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In contrast, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, in <em>Jarvis, supra, </em>464 A.2d at 954, reviewed an agreement approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>80% of the unit owners which granted an adjacent resort hotel use of the condominium\u2019s pool, tennis courts, and parking area. The court discussed <em>Stuewe, supra, </em>93 Ill.App.3d 1029, 49 Ill.Dec. 494, 418 N.E.2d 138, and <em>Makeever, supra, </em>125 Ariz. 384, 609 P.2d 1084, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">There is a distinct difference between these cases, in which exclusive use, control and/or ownership of the common areas is taken from some or all of the unit owners and cases in which some reasonable restrictions or regulation of the common areas is imposed on all owners. In the first instance, each owner\u2019s percentage interest in the common area is altered. In the second instance, the percentage ownership interest is unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Jarvis, supra, </em>464 A.2d at 956. Since the agreement did not increase or decrease the common elements and did not grant any owner exclusive use, it did not alter the percentage interests of the unit owners. <em>Id. </em>at 957; <em>see also Schaumburg State Bank v. Bank of Wheaton, </em>197 Ill.App.3d 713, 144 Ill.Dec. 151, 555 N.E.2d 48, 52-53, <em>cert. denied, </em>133 Ill.2d 573, 149 Ill.Dec. 337, 561 N.E.2d 707 (1990) (declaration amendment granting nonexclusive easement over driveway to neighbor did not change unit owners\u2019 percentage interests in common element); <em>Bd. of Dir. of By the Sea Council v. Sondock, </em>644 S.W.2d 774, 781 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1982) (declaration amendment allowing removal of carports did not change unit owners\u2019 percentage interests in common element because applied equally to all unit owners); <em>cf.

Halpem, </em>181 N.J.Super. 93, 436 A.2d 580, 582 (1981) (bylaw amendment requiring security deposit from rented units only created \u201ca special class of owners\u201d and was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unnecessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Here, the rule at issue affected an \u201cinterest\u201d in property. The bylaw amendment revoked the commercial unit owners\u2019 right to have their clients use the lobby. That right resembles an easement, which is an interest in property. In <em>Condry v. Laurie, </em>184 Md. 317, 320, 41 A.2d 66 (1945), we discussed the difference between a license and an easement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>While an easement implies an interest in land, a license is merely a personal privilege to do some particular act or series of acts on land without possessing any estate or interest therein. In <em>De Haro v. United States, </em>5 Wall. 599, 627, 18 L.Ed. 681, 688, Justice Davis spoke of the incidents of a license as follows: \u201cIt is an authority to do a lawful act, which, without it, would be unlawful, and while it remains unrevoked is a justification for the acts which it authorizes to be done. It ceases with the death of either party, and cannot be transferred or alienated by the licensee, because it is a personal matter, and is limited to the original parties to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The right which the bylaw amendment revoked was not \u201ca mere personal privilege,\u201d <em>Griffith v. Montgomery County, </em>57 Md.App. 472, 485, 470 A.2d 840 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1191, 105 S.Ct. 965, 83 L.Ed.2d 970 (1985), but was appurtenant to the condominium unit and would be conveyed with the unit. Since the right resembles an easement, we hold that the bylaw amendment affected an interest in the appellees\u2019 property. <em>See Kaplan, supra, </em>573 N.E.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Here, however, and unlike the exclusive use cases, such as <em>Kaplan, supra, </em>410 Mass. 435, 573 N.E.2d 495, the bylaw amendment did not grant one or few unit owners exclusive use of a common area. Nonetheless, unlike the equality cases, such as <em>Jarvis, supra, </em>464 A.2d 952, the bylaw amendment disparately affected a portion of the unit owners by revoking a property interest they acquired when they purchased their units, without affecting the rights of the other unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In terms of the Maryland Condominium Act the lobby was a general common element, the use of which all of the tenants enjoyed equally. This was consistent with \u00a7 ll-108(a) requiring that, \u201cexcept as provided in the declaration, the common elements shall be subject to mutual rights of ... access, use, and enjoyment by all unit owners.\u201d By by-law amendment, the Association has attempted to deny that mutuality of use of a general common element. Further, under \u00a7 ll-106(a), \u201c[e]ach unit in a condominium has all of the incidents of real property.\u201d By by-law amendment, the Association has at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tempted to reduce the \u201ceasement\u201d that the professional office units enjoyed in the lobby, and that \u201ceasement\u201d is one of the incidents of the ownership of a professional office unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">For these reasons, we hold that it was beyond the power of the Association by by-law amendment to purport to deprive the owners of the professional office units of their rights under the declaration and under the Maryland Condominium Act to the enjoyment of the lobby for the ingress and egress of their business invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">. The Maryland Condominium Act defines \"common elements\u201d as all of the condominium except for the units. \u201cLimited common elements\u201d are those which are \"reserved for the exclusive use of one or more but less than all of the unit owners.\u201d \"General common elements\u201d are those which are not limited.
