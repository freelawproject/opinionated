Lussier, is a Vermont resident who purchased three thoroughbred racehorses in the spring of 1991. Later in 1991, the three horses were shipped to Maryland where they raced at the Laurel Race Course in three races on November 26, 1991, December 29, 1991, and December 31, 1991. Lussier was licensed by the Maryland Racing Commission as an owner of racehorses, and his license expired at the end of 1991. Lussier did not renew his Maryland license for 1992 or thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>In February 1992, the Maryland Racing Commission and the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau commenced an investigation with regard to the races on November 26, December 29, and December 31, to determine whether the true owner or trainer of the three horses had been concealed and whether falsified workout reports for the three horses had been published. Upon the completion of the investigation, and after a hearing before the Commission on July 1, 1992, the Commission found that Lussier had participated in \u201cimproper acts in relation to racing in violation of COMAR 09.10.01.11(A)(3);\u201d that Lussier transferred two of his horses \u201cfrom himself to the name of another person for a purpose other than the legitimate sale of the horses in violation of COMAR 09.10.01.11(A)(14);\u201d and that Lussier perpetrated \u201cdishonest acts in connection with his activities, responsibilities and duties on the race track, and has engaged in conduct detrimental to racing in violation of COMAR 09.10.01.25(B)(8).\u201d In an order issued on July 24, 1992, the Commission imposed a $5,000 fine upon Lussier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Lussier filed an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision, challenging the administrative decision on several grounds. After a hearing, the circuit court upheld the Commission\u2019s order imposing a $5,000 fine upon Lussier. Lussier appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, again raising numerous issues. The intermediate appellate court rejected each of Lussier\u2019s contentions and affirmed. <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>100 Md.App. 190, 640 A.2d 259 (1994). Lussier then filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting all of the issues which he had raised in both courts below. This Court granted the petition limited to a single question, namely whether the Commission could, in accordance with its regulation, impose a fine as a sanction for misconduct absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>statutory provision expressly authorizing the imposition of a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Lussier argues that it is an \u201celementary\u201d principle of Maryland law that administrative agencies lack the authority to fix \u201cpenalties in the absence of specific statutory authorization from the Legislature,\u201d and that \u201cit has always been the Legislature\u2019s exclusive province to fix penalties ... for transgressions of the law, either directly or via <em>specific </em>delegation.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 10, 17). Lussier cites three cases which he claims support this alleged principle of Maryland administrative law. They are <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, </em>283 Md. 677, 393 A.2d 181 (1978); <em>Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., </em>272 Md. 563, 325 A.2d 740 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 991, 95 S.Ct. 1427, 43 L.Ed.2d 673 (1975); and <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, </em>270 Md. 403, 312 A.2d 225 (1973). According to Lussier, since the General Assembly did not explicitly authorize the Commission to impose a fine upon a racehorse owner, the Commission\u2019s order in this case \u201cis a nullity\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 10). Lussier asserts that the Commission\u2019s regulation authorizing the imposition of a fine, COMAR 09.10.04.03D, is invalid except as applied to those licensed racetrack operators who have been awarded racing dates. (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 16-18). <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1992, 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 11-308(d) of the Business Regulation Article (expressly authorizing the Commission to impose a monetary penalty not exceeding $5,000 upon racetrack operators who, <em>inter alia, </em>violate the statute or the Commission\u2019s regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">As pointed out by the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>100 Md.App. at 203-204, 640 A.2d at 266, this Court\u2019s prior cases relied upon by Lussier neither recognize nor support the assertion that, under Maryland law, an administrative agency lacks authority to impose a particular penalty unless it has explicit authorization from the Legislature to do so. <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, supra, </em>was not concerned with the imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of penalties; instead, the question in that case was whether, as a matter of statutory construction, an administrative agency\u2019s statutory authority to regulate hospital rates extended to fees charged by physicians to hospital patients. In <em>Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., supra, </em>272 Md. at 576, 325 A.2d at 747, the issue /was whether, .under the pertinent statutory provisions and \u201c[i]n view of the [Human Relations] Commission\u2019s legislative background,\u201d the Human Relations Commission was authorized to make an award of compensatory damages to a victim of employment discrimination. Neither a penalty nor a regulation adopted by the agency was involved in the <em>Gutwein </em>case. The portion of <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, supra, </em>270 Md. at 441-143, 312 A.2d at 246-247, relating to monetary penalties, had nothing to do with an administrative agency\u2019s imposition of a particular type of penalty without express statutory authorization. In fact, in <em>Investors Funding </em>there was express statutory authorization for the agency to impose monetary penalties. The issue in that case concerned the validity of the <em>statute </em>in light of constitutional delegation of powers and due process principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Neither the Maryland cases relied on by Lussier, nor any other decisions of this Court which have been called to our attention, set forth or support a general principle that a state administrative agency lacks authority, by regulation, to fix a civil penalty for misconduct subject to its jurisdiction unless the General Assembly has expressly authorized the agency to fix that type of penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Instead, the cases invoked by Lussier, as well as numerous other decisions by this Court, indicate that, in determining whether a state administrative agency is authorized to act in a particular manner, the statutes, legislative background and policies pertinent to that agency are controlling. <em>See, e.g., Comptroller v. Washington Restaurant, </em>339 Md. 667, 670-673, 664 A.2d 899, 900-902 (1995); <em>Luskin\u2019s v. Consumer Protection, </em>338 Md. 188, 196-198, 657 A.2d 788, 792-793 (1995); <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 654 A.2d 449 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>335 Md. 427, 437, 440, 644 A.2d 34, 38, 40 (1994); <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 610-612, 552 A.2d 881, 885-886 (1989); <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 756-759, 501 A.2d 48, 61-63 (1985); <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, supra, </em>283 Md. at 683-689, 393 A.2d at 184-187; <em>Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., supra, </em>272 Md. at 575-576, 325 A.2d at 746-747. Moreover, with regard to the validity of a regulation promulgated by an administrative agency, the governing standard is whether the regulation is \u201c \u2018consistent with the letter and spirit of the law under which the agency acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, supra, </em>335 Md. at 437, 644 A.2d at 38, quoting <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>311 Md. 64, 74, 532 A.2d 1056, 1061 (1987). <em>See also Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, supra, </em>337 Md. at 453, 654 A.2d at 455, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Turning to the statutes applicable to the Maryland Racing Commission, title 11, subtitle 2, of the Business Regulation Article of the Maryland Code establishes the Commission, provides for its membership and staff, and sets forth generally the authority of the Commission. Instead of particularizing various powers of the Commission with regard to racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, and others involved in Maryland racing, the statutory provisions, in \u00a7 11-210, broadly authorize the Commission to \u201cadopt regulations ... to govern racing and betting on racing in the State,\u201d and then specify four types of regulations which the Commission may not adopt. Thus, \u00a7 11-210 of the Business Regulation Article states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201c\u00a7 11-210. Regulatory power of Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(1) adopt regulations and conditions to govern racing and betting on racing in the State ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">(b) <em>Prohibited regulations. </em>\u2014 The Commission may not adopt regulations that allow:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>(1) racing a breed of horse not now authorized by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">(2) holding currently unauthorized:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">(i) intertrack betting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">(ii) off-track betting; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">(iii) telephone betting other than telephone account betting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">This Court has consistently held that, where the Legislature has delegated such broad authority to a state administrative agency to promulgate regulations in an area, the agency\u2019s regulations are valid under the statute if they do not contradict the statutory language or purpose. We have repeatedly rejected the argument, similar to that made by Lussier here, that the Legislature was required expressly or explicitly to authorize the particular regulatory action. Recently in <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, supra, </em>335 Md. at 437-439, 644 A.2d at 38-39, in upholding a Department of Natural Resources regulation prohibiting persons under the age of 14 from operating certain types of watercraft, we explained (335 Md. at 437-438, 644 A.2d at 39):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201cIn the State Boat Act, ... the General Assembly broadly granted to the Department the authority to adopt regulations governing the \u2018operations of any vessels\u2019 which are subject to the Act. In numerous situations where the General Assembly has delegated similar broad power to an administrative agency to adopt legislative rules or regulations in a particular area, this Court has upheld the agency\u2019s rules or regulations as long as they did not contradict the language or purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201cFor example, in <em>Jacobson v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>261 Md. 180, 186, 274 A.2d 102, 104-105 (1971), where the pertinent statute gave the Racing Commission the \u2018full power to prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all horse races shall be conducted,\u2019 the contention that the legislative delegation of power did not reach a rule regulating the transfer of race horses was characterized by this Court as an argument which \u2018approaches the frivolous.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>After reviewing numerous other cases in this Court upholding various types of regulations under broad delegations of authority to administrative agencies, we went on in <em>Christ </em>to reject an argument like that advanced by Lussier in the present case (335 Md. at 439, 644 A.2d at 39):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">\u201cThe crux of the plaintiffs argument concerning absence of statutory authority is that \u2018there is no specific delegation of authority by the General Assembly to the Department permitting the Department to promulgate regulations which <em>prohibit </em>the use of vessels by an entire class of citizens of the State.\u2019 (Plaintiffs brief at 10). As the above-cited cases demonstrate, however, such specificity is not required. The broad authority to promulgate \u2018regulations governing the ... operations of any vessels\u2019 plainly encompasses a regulation prohibiting the operation of certain motor vessels by persons under 14.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>See Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, supra, </em>337 Md. at 455, 654 A.2d at 456 (in upholding an administrative regulation prohibiting smoking in most workplaces, even though the statute did not expressly address the matter, this Court pointed out \u201cthat courts should generally defer to agencies\u2019 decisions in promulgating new regulations because they presumably make rules based upon their expertise in a particular field\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Similarly, the broad authority granted by the Legislature to the Maryland Racing Commission to promulgate regulations \u201cto govern racing and betting on racing\u201d plainly encompasses a regulation authorizing the imposition of a monetary penalty, not exceeding $5,000, upon a racehorse owner who engaged in Lussier\u2019s deceptive misconduct in connection with three races at the Laurel Race Course. The regulation in no manner contradicts the language of the statutes relating to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Moreover, the regulation authorizing the imposition of a fine is entirely in accord with <em>the </em>statutory purpose. We have often stated that \u201c[t]he Legislature\u2019s purpose in granting to the Racing Commission the authority to promulgate rules was to assure that horse races in Maryland are \u2018conducted fairly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>decently and clean[ly],\u2019 \u201d <em>Heft v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>323 Md. 257, 263-264, 592 A.2d 1110, 1113 (1991), quoting <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 84, 48 A.2d 600, 602 (1946). The \u201cCommission performs an active role of policy formation in order to ensure the integrity of horse racing in this State.\u201d <em>Maryland Racing Com\u2019n v. Castrenze, </em>335 Md. 284, 294, 643 A.2d 412, 416-417 (1994). <em>See Greenfeld v. Maryland Jockey Club, </em>190 Md. 96, 105, 57 A.2d 335, 338 (1948) (one of purposes of the statute and regulations was to insure that \u201c[t]he law protects bettors against fraud\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">If we were to accept Lussier\u2019s argument that the Maryland Racing Commission is powerless to impose any penalty or sanction without express statutory authority relating to that type of penalty, then racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys and others could commit numerous deceptions and frauds upon bettors and the public, and the Commission could do little about it. The statutory purpose requires that the Commission be able to sanction misconduct in connection with racing. The challenged regulation is, therefore, clearly consistent with the statutory purpose of insuring the integrity of racing and protecting the public from fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">As the General Assembly has delegated broad power to the Maryland Racing Commission to adopt regulations \u201cto govern racing and betting on racing in the State,\u201d and as the regulation providing for the imposition of a monetary penalty does not contradict the statutory language or purpose, the regulation is statutorily authorized under a consistent line of this Court\u2019s decisions dealing with the regulatory authority of state administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Furthermore, the history, nature and rationale of the regulatory scheme governing horse racing in this State, as well as actions by the General Assembly and opinions by this Court, confirm the validity of the regulation authorizing the imposition of a fine upon racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, etc., engaging in misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Prior to 1920, the licensing and regulation of horse racing and betting on horse races in Maryland was accomplished on a county-by-county basis. In a few jurisdictions, local racing commissions were created to license and regulate horse racing. In most counties, the circuit courts issued licenses. Much of the regulation was accomplished by statutes with criminal sanctions enforced by the state\u2019s attorney for each county. For a review of the pre-1920 licensing and regulation of horse racing, <em>see, e.g., Nolan v. State, </em>157 Md. 332, 146 A. 268 (1929); <em>Close v. Southern Md. Agr. Asso., </em>134 Md. 629, 108 A. 209 (1919); <em>Agri. Soc. of Montgomery County v. State, </em>130 Md. 474, 101 A. 139 (1917); <em>Clark v. Harford Agri. &amp; Breeders\u2019 Asso., </em>118 Md. 608, 85 A. 503 (1912), overruled on other grounds, <em>Howard County Metropolitan Comm. v. Westphal, </em>232 Md. 334, 342, 193 A.2d 56, 61 (1963); <em>State v. Dycer, </em>85 Md. 246, 36 A. 763 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">In 1919, this Court held that the statutes providing for the licensing of horse racing by the circuit courts were unconstitutional because they imposed nonjudicial functions and duties upon the circuit courts in violation of the separation of powers requirement in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Close v. Southern Md. Agr. Asso., supra, </em>134 Md. 629, 108 A. 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In response to the <em>Close </em>case, the General Assembly in 1920 adopted an entirely new statewide scheme of licensing and regulating horse racing which has continued, largely intact, until the present time. By Ch. 273 of the Acts of 1920, the Legislature created the Maryland Racing Commission as a state agency, whose members were appointed by the Governor, and whose jurisdiction encompassed \u201cany meeting within the State of Maryland whereat horse racing shall be permitted for any stake, purse or reward.\u201d Ch. 273 of the Acts of 1920, \u00a7 1, subsection 1. The 1920 statute contained somewhat detailed provisions with regard to the licensing and regulation of \u201c[a]ny person or persons, association or corporation desiring to conduct racing within the State of Maryland,\u201d <em>id., </em>subsection 7. Apart from the provisions concerning racetrack owners or operators who conducted racing, however, the 1920 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>statute broadly stated that the \u201cRacing Commission shall have full power to prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all horse-races shall be conducted within the State of Maryland. Said Commission may make rules governing, restricting or regulating betting on such races,\u201d <em>id., </em>subsection 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">As the 1920 statute did not expressly authorize the Maryland Racing Commission to license and regulate racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, etc., in 1921 the Attorney General was specifically asked whether the Commission was authorized to license trainers and jockeys. Judge Motz for the Court of Special Appeals in the present case summarized the Attorney General\u2019s response as follows <em>(Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>100 Md.App. at 205-206, 640 A.2d at 267):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR9\">\u201cIn 1921, the Attorney General was asked whether the above quoted general powers permitted the Commission to require that jockeys and trainers be licensed. 6 Opp. Att\u2019y Gen. at 480. In concluding that licensing of jockeys and trainers was within the scope of authority granted the Commission, the Attorney General specifically recognized that \u2018no control over them [was] given the Commission by any express provision in the [Act],\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 481, and that very few of the Commission\u2019s express statutory powers dealt with \u2018the regulation of racing itself.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 480. The Attorney General noted that the reason for this was that the legislature \u2018realized that the formulation of adequate, practical and satisfactory regulations [governing those involved in racing itself] involved a knowledge of racing conditions which the General Assembly did not possess, and which could only be acquired by a careful study of racing, and of the many problems connected therewith.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The Court of Special Appeals went on to point out that the 1921 Attorney General\u2019s opinion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJq\">\u201cconcluded that even though the Commission was given no express statutory control over, let alone power to license, jockeys and trainers, the General Assembly intended that it have this power. He reasoned:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u2018There can be no full and complete control of racing on the part of the Commission, unless it controls those upon whose skill and honesty the outcome of the race so largely depends. All other regulations, rules and conditions prescribed by the Commission for the purpose of securing clean racing and elevating the standards by which racing is to be conducted in Maryland could be nullified by dishonest and purchasable jockeys and trainers.... I do not believe, ... that the Legislature intended that jockeys and trainers, whose probity is so essential a feature of clean racing, should be entirely beyond the control of the Commission____ [The Act was] clearly designed to give the Commission <em>broad and sweeping powers of control and regulation of racing, </em>and I am of the opinion that, in spite of the [limited] authorization expressly conferred therein, the Commission possess <em>practically unlimited power to pass, promulgate and enforce </em>such rules and regulations actually dealing with the control of racing as in the judgment of the Commission appear to be desirable and necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 481-82 (emphasis added). Thus, since the General Assembly had given the Commission \u2018full power\u2019 to regulate horseracing, the Attorney General found that the Commission could not do so without the ability to \u2018full[y] and completely]\u2019 control \u2018those upon whose honesty and skill the outcome of races depended.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>480-81.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">With regard to the 1921 opinion of the Attorney General taking the position that the Racing Commission\u2019s authority extended to racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, and others not expressly covered by the statutory language, this Court in <em>Mahoney v. Byers, supra, </em>187 Md. at 84-85, 48 A.2d at 602, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">\u201cAt the outset it may be stated that under the Act of 1920, Chapter 273, Article 78B, Code 1939, which created the Maryland Racing Commission, it has power and authority to promulgate reasonable rules to govern the racing of horses. It may make such rules regulating the conduct of trainers, jockeys, owners, and generally regulate all matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>pertaining to horse racing, in order that they may be conducted fairly, decently and clean[ly] but may not revoke a license except for cause. 6 <em>Opinions of Attorney General </em>480; 11, 273; 24, 662.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cThese decisions of the Attorneys General have governed the Commission for a long time, and Attorney General Armstrong\u2019s decision was rendered shortly after the passage of the Act. We see no reason to alter or disturb these decisions, long applied. <em>Popham v. Conservation Commission, </em>186 Md. 62, 46 A.2d 184; <em>Baltimore City v. Machen, </em>132 Md. 618, 104 A. 175.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As previously mentioned, the basic scheme of the 1920 statute has continued until the present time. Under Maryland Code (1992, 1995 Supp.), title 11 of the Business Regulation Article, the General Assembly has legislated in detail with respect to those licensees who hold race meetings in Maryland, <em>i.e., </em>the owners or operators of race courses. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11-301 through 11-320, 11-501 through 11-526, 11-601 through 11-620, 11-701 through 11-704, 11-801 through 11-812, and 11-1001 of the Business Regulation Article. Thus, the Maryland Racing Commission is expressly authorized by statute to grant or deny licenses to those desiring to hold race meetings, to \u201csuspend or revoke a license\u201d to hold a race meeting, or to \u201cimpose a penalty not exceeding $5,000 for each racing day\u201d that the licensee holding a race meeting is in violation of the statute or a Commission regulation or a condition set by the Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Nevertheless, with regard to other persons involved in Maryland racing and subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, such as racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, grooms, etc., the statutory provisions largely remain silent. There are no statutory sections, comparable to those cited above, relating to racehorse owners, trainers or jockeys. Instead, the General Assembly has simply granted to the Commission the broad authority to regulate racing in Maryland, and has specified a few areas which are beyond the Commission\u2019s authority to adopt regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In accordance with this statutory scheme, and the 1921 Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the Maryland Racing Commission since 1921 has adopted regulations governing racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, and others which, to the extent that is relevant, parallel the statutory provisions concerning racetrack operators. Thus, the regulation at issue in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>case, COMAR 09.10.04.03D, providing for the suspension or revocation of licenses, or the imposition of a fine not exceeding $5,000, with respect to those engaging in specified types of misconduct, parallels \u00a7 11-308 of the Business Regulation Article which provides for suspensions or revocations of licenses, or monetary penalties up to $5,000, of racetrack operators who engage in specified types of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Moreover, the authority to impose a fine upon racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, etc., has been set forth in the Commission\u2019s regulations consistently since the first regulations in 1921. Thus, the 1921 regulations permitted stewards to suspend the licenses of or impose a fine not exceeding $200 upon \u201c[ojwners, trainers, jockeys, grooms, and other persons attendant on horses.... \u201d 1921 Rules of Racing, Rules 24 and 27. Furthermore, if the maximum of $200 was deemed insufficient, the stewards could so advise the Commission which could impose a higher penalty. <em>Id., </em>Rule 27. Consequently, the Commission\u2019s authority under the statute, to impose a monetary penalty upon racehorse owners and others guilty of misconduct, is supported by the long and consistent administrative construction of the statute. The General Assembly has not, over the past 75 years, changed that administrative construction of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Md. Classified Employees Asso., Inc. v.

In <em>Jacobson v. Md. Racing Commission, supra, </em>261 Md. 180, 274 A.2d 102, Jacobson was both a racehorse owner and trainer who violated a Commission regulation which prohibited an owner or trainer who had claimed a horse in a Maryland claiming race from selling it within 60 days of the claim. The Commission fined Jacobson $2,500 for claiming a horse in a Maryland race and selling the horse in New York before the expiration of the 60-day period. Jacobson principally contended that the Commission\u2019s regulation prohibiting the sale of the claimed horse for 60 days was invalid; he argued, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>alia, </em>that the Legislature had not delegated to the Commission the authority to apply its regulations to events occurring outside of Maryland. In response, Chief Judge Hammond for the Court explained the necessity for conferring broad regulatory authority upon the Commission (261 Md. at 188, 274 A.2d at 103):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">\u201cHorse racing is an endeavor and undertaking that necessarily must be the subject of intensive, extensive and minute regulation. <em>Greenfeld v. Md. Jockey Club, </em>190 Md. 96, 104-105, 57 A.2d 335. It exists only because it is financed by the receipts from controlled legalized gambling which must be kept as far above suspicion as possible, not only to sustain and profit the racing fraternity but to feed substantial ... millions to the State\u2019s revenues. Not surprisingly the legislature has given the- Commission full power to control racing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Addressing the argument that the Commission\u2019s regulation prohibiting the sale of the horse within 60 days was not authorized by the language of the statute, Chief Judge Hammond succinctly stated (261 Md. at 186, 274 A.2d at 105):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cJacobson\u2019s argument that the legislature\u2019s delegations to the Commission of the power to regulate racing does not extend to the regulation imposed by Rule 80 approaches the frivolous, and we turn to his constitutional arguments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Although Jacobson had not specifically challenged the Commission\u2019s authority to impose a $2,500 fine if the regulation concerning the sale of claimed horses was valid, nevertheless this Court concluded its opinion as follows (261 Md. at 190, 274 A.2d at 107, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u201cWe think that Jacobson had become a racing citizen of Maryland as far as the purposes and effects of the Rules are concerned and that this State acquired sufficient personal jurisdiction over him in matters of licensed racing to permit it to enjoin him by Rule 80 from selling a horse claimed in a licensed Maryland race for sixty days, <em>and to punish him if he disobeyed that rule.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>For other cases recognizing the broad authority of the Maryland Racing Commission to promulgate and enforce regulations appropriate to insure the integrity of Maryland racing, <em>see, e.g., Maryland Racing Com\u2019n v. Castrenze, supra, </em>335 Md. at 294-295, 643 A.2d at 417 (in affirming the Commission\u2019s application of a regulation providing for reciprocal suspensions, we commented that \u201c[t]he Racing Commission is given broad statutory authority to adopt regulations governing horse racing and betting on racing in Maryland\u201d); <em>Heft v. Md.

Ramsey, </em>301 Md. 96, 105, 482 A.2d 147, 152 (1984)); <em>Southern Md. Agri. Ass\u2019n of Prince George\u2019s County v. Magruder, </em>198 Md. 274, 280, 81 A.2d 592, 594 (1951) (\u201cThe Maryland Racing Commission is given exceedingly wide and comprehensive regulatory powers. * * * It is apparent that the Legislature deliberately imposed grave responsibility upon the Racing Commission in order that this [betting on horse races] exception to the anti-gambling laws of the State be kept within proper limits\u201d); <em>Brann v. Mahoney, </em>187 Md. 89, 103, 48 A.2d 605, 611 (1946) (the Racing Commission \u201cmay make rules regulating the conduct of trainers, jockeys, and owners in order that horse racing may be conducted fairly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">As discussed earlier, acceptance of Lussier\u2019s argument, that a Maryland Racing Commission regulation authorizing the Commission to impose a particular type of penalty must be expressly authorized by the statutory language, would leave the Commission in a position whereby it could promulgate regulations governing the conduct of racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys and others, but could not enforce those regulations. The statutory provisions do not expressly authorize the imposition of any particular type of sanction upon racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, etc. The Commission\u2019s authority to suspend or revoke the licenses of racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys and others, like the authority to impose monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>penalties upon them, is based entirely upon the Commission\u2019s regulations. It is inconceivable that the General Assembly intended to grant broad authority to the Commission to regulate the conduct of these individuals, but did not intend that the Commission be able to enforce its regulations by sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Finally, even if there were some statutory basis to distinguish between the revocation or suspension of a license on the one hand, and the imposition of a monetary penalty on the other,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the inability to impose a fine would still leave the Racing Commission powerless to enforce its regulations under circumstances like those in the instant case. After the race on December 31, 1991, which was the last day before expiration of Lussier\u2019s license, Lussier left Maryland and did not thereafter seek to renew his license as a racehorse owner. When his misconduct was discovered, Lussier neither possessed nor desired a Maryland license. There was nothing to revoke or suspend. Under the circumstances, the imposition of a monetary penalty was the only sanction that could be imposed upon Lussier to enforce the regulations of the Commission. We very much doubt that the Legislature intended that a racehorse owner could come into Maryland, enter his horses in Maryland races \"with the true names of the owner and trainer disguised, publish false workout reports, make a large sum of money by betting on his horses at the track,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and then escape any sanction for his misconduct because he did not desire to renew his Maryland license.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We conclude, in agreement with both courts below, that the Maryland Racing Commission\u2019s regulation authorizing the imposition of a reasonable fine is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

If, after his schooling, he wishes to become a doctor, lawyer, dentist, architect or plumber, he must satisfy the appropriate State board of his qualifications before he can begin to earn his living. His very movements to and from work bring him into close contact with the processes of administrative law. The carfare or taxicab fare which he pays are determined by the Public Service Commission; if he drives an automobile, his license may be revoked for any cause which the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles deems sufficient; he cannot even take to the air without a license from the State Aviation Commission .... if he places a bet at a race track, he does so under the rules and regulations prescribed by the Maryland Racing Commission....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Reuben Oppenheimer, <em>Administrative Law in Maryland, </em>2 Md.

Furthermore, the imposition of a penalty, such as a fine, is an adjudicatory matter. But the power to make laws is a legislative function and the power to adjudicate ordinarily is reserved to the judiciary. The Legislature, without, at the least, providing safeguards and standards to direct its exercise, may not delegate the former power to an administrative agency, an arm of the executive branch of government. <em>Department of Transportation v.

I am convinced that it is unwise to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Notwithstanding that, as a creature of statute, an administrative agency has only that authority that is delegated to it, <em>Sullivan supra, </em>293 Md. at 124, 442 A.2d at 564; <em>Stillman, </em>291 Md. at 413, 435 A.2d at 759; <em>William E. Koons, Inc., </em>270 Md. at 236-37, 310 A.2d at 816-17, broad delegations of authority have been upheld. In fact, such delegations are particularly appropriate in some areas, <em>e.g. </em>\u201cwhere the discretion to be exercised relates to police regulations for the protection of public morals, health, safety, or general welfare.\u201d <em>Pressman v.

This means that the delegations to the administrative agency should be reasonably specific and provide some guidelines for the agency to follow. <em>Stillman, supra, </em>291 Md. at 413, 435 A.2d at 759. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>words, the Legislature must \u201clay down ... an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\u201d <em>J.W.

This principle, said to be its corollary, <em>see Armacost, </em>311 Md. at 77, 532 A.2d at 1062, is thus consistent with, and conformable to, the separation of powers doctrine<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. That doctrine is constitutional in scope and premised on the belief \u201cthat separating the functions of government and assigning the execution of those functions to different branches [is] fundamental to good government and the preservation of civil liberties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77-78, 532 A.2d at 1062, <em>citing </em>M.

Our cases recognize that there is a certain amount of acceptable overlap between the branches of government. They also recognize, however, that \u201cthis constitutional \u2018elasticity\u2019 cannot be stretched to a point where, in effect there no longer exists a separation of governmental power, as the Maryland Constitution does not permit a merger of the three branches of our State government....\u201d <em>Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. at 220, 334 A.2d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Consistent with the foregoing, although Maryland\u2019s statement of the separation of powers is \u201ca more concrete barrier than any which the Supreme Court has had to hurdle under the Federal Constitution,\u201d R. Oppenheimer, <em>Administrative Law in Maryland, </em>2 Md.

Legislation may not be enacted by an administrative agency under the guise of its exercise of the power to make rules and regulations by issuing a rule or regulation which is inconsistent or out of harmony with, or which alters, adds to, extends or enlarges, subverts, impairs, limits, or restricts the act being administered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AagM\">326 Md. at 624, 606 A.2d at 1075. <em>See also Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. William E. Koons, Inc. </em>270 Md. 231, 236-37, 310 A.2d 813, 816-17 (1973) <em>(quoting 1 </em>Am.Jur.2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 132 (1962)). Stated differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">[EJssential legislative functions may not be delegated to administrative agencies, and in this sense it is said that administrative agencies have no legislative power and are precluded from legislating in the strict sense. The most pervasive legislative power conferred upon administrative agencies is the power to make rules and regulations and the necessity for vesting administrative agencies with this power because of the impracticability of the lawmakers providing general regulations for various and varying details has been recognized by the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">I do not quarrel with the Racing Commission\u2019s power to regulate racing in this State. There simply can be no doubt that it has that authority. In fact, the enabling legislation applicable to it is explicit in empowering the Racing Commission to \u201cadopt regulations and conditions,\u201d consistent with its legislatively prescribed mandate. To enforce those regulations and rules, the Racing Commission is free to revoke, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>restrict, or suspend any licenses required for participation in racing in Maryland. Such power may well be incidental to the power to regulate and, thus, fairly implied from it. I do not believe, however, that a provision broadly authorizing \u201cpowers necessary or proper to carry out fully all the purposes of this title\u201d permits the Racing Commission to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing that fines and penalties may be assessed and, in the case of specified conduct, their amount. As to that issue the delegation is too broad; it provides absolutely no standard or guidance to focus and direct the power assumed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Maryland General Assembly is well aware of how to empower administrative agencies to impose fines. Examples of its having done so can be found throughout the Maryland Code. The agencies to which such power has been given include one with duties and responsibilities similar to and reminiscent of the Racing Commission, the State Athletic Commission, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1992, 1996 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 4-</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>310(a)(2)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Business Regulation Article (hereinafter \u201cBR\u201d); the Maryland Home Improvement Commission, <em>see </em>BR \u00a7 8-620<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1974, 1985 Replacement Volume), \u00a7 2-310.1<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Agriculture Article; the Maryland Commission on Real Estate Brokers, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1989, 1995 Replacement Volume, 1996 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 17-322<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the Business Occupations and Professions Article; the State Board of Dental Examiners, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1981, 1994 Replacement Volume) \u00a7 4-317(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Health Occupations Article (\u201cHO\u201d); the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1991) \u00a7 9-664(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the Labor and Employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ment Article; the Insurance Commissioner, <em>see </em>Article 48A, \u00a7 55A<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, see, <em>e.g. </em>BR \u00a7\u00a7 9-310(b)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 9 \u2014 408(d)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>. In some cases, the General Assembly has provided, in addition to the power to fine, guidelines and standards to focus that power. <em>E.G., </em>BR \u00a7 8-620(b)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and Business Occup. \u00a7 17-322(c)(2)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>. The preceding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>catalogue is by no means exhaustive. Suffice it to say, however, that the list of omitted agencies, those not mentioned here, does not include the Racing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">That the Legislature, in so many instances, has expressly prescribed the power of administrative agencies to fine speaks volumes with regard to its intention in this case. When it has wanted to authorize an agency to fine or impose a monetary penalty, it has clearly and explicitly said so. A broad delegation of authority simply does not suffice. The Attorney General has expressed just this view in a different, but related context. <em>See </em>66 <em>Op. Att\u2019y. Gen. </em>197 (1981). Recognizing that the power to impose fines could be implied from the broad language of a statute of a local jurisdiction, the Attorney General nevertheless concluded that the statute was invalid. He opined that the power to impose a fine, penalty or forfeiture \u2014 either civil or criminal \u2014 \u201ccannot ... be implied but, rather, depends on an express grant from the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. As I have demonstrated, this is consistent with the practice of the General Assembly. It is also consistent with our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">This Court has held previously that, under some circumstances, the Legislature must grant express authority in order for agencies legitimately to act. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>329 Md. 494, 620 A.2d 886 (1993). In <em>Mossburg, </em>this Court, speaking through the author of the majority opinion, noted the instances in which supermajority requirements had been upheld, concluding that \u201cwhere the General Assembly has intended to authorize a supermajority requirement, it has done so expressly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, <em>620 </em>A.2d at 892. We also made clear that such a requirement \u201cshould not be implied from a general authorization to adopt rules and regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 620 A.2d at 893. <em>See </em>also <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 2 v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>295 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Md. 88, 97, 453 A.2d 1191, 1195 (1982) (stating that \u201cabsent express legislative authority,\u201d a governmental agency cannot enter into binding arbitration or binding collective bargaining agreements establishing wages, hours, pension rights, or working conditions for public employees).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The majority has not cited even one case in which it was held, under circumstances similar to those <em>sub judice, </em>where there is no legislative direction on the subject, that an administrative agency may promulgate a rule or regulation imposing a fine or penalty. It .relies, instead, on the broad delegation of authority given the Racing Commission, the Commission\u2019s power to promulgate rules and regulations, and the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe regulation authorizing the imposition of a fine is entirely in accord with the statutory purpose.\u201d 343 Md. 681, 689, 684 A.2d 804, 808 (1996). The majority cites <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 644 A.2d 34 (1994), in support of the first two propositions. The power of the Department of Natural Resources to impose fines for violations of its regulations was not at issue in that case, only whether the regulation that was the subject of appeal was authorized by the enabling legislation pursuant to which it was adopted. That this is so is demonstrated by the very passage from <em>Christ </em>quoted by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">In the State Boat Act, ... the General Assembly broadly granted to the Department the authority to adopt <em>regulations </em>governing the \u201coperations of any vessels\u201d which are subject to the Act. In numerous situations where the General Assembly has delegated similar broad power to an administrative agency to <em>adopt legislative rules or regulations </em>in a particular area, this Court has upheld the agency\u2019s rules or regulations as long as they did not contradict the language or purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">343 Md. at 688, 684 A.2d at 807 (quoting <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. at 437, 644 A.2d at 39) <em>(.Emphasis </em>added).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">I agree with the result reached in <em>Christ. A </em>statute permitting the Department of Natural Resources to \u201cadopt regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tions necessary to carry out the provisions of this subtitle,\u201d specifically \u201cregulations governing ... operations of any vessels subject to this subtitle so that each vessel complying with the regulations may be operated with equal freedom or under similar requirements on all waters of the State,\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1993 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 8-704(b-1)(1) of the Natural Resources Article, does authorize a regulation prohibiting a 14 year old from operating certain types of watercraft. I would have viewed the matter quite differently had the regulation been one fining the 14 year old for operating the prohibited watercraft. Such a regulation would have been unauthorized in the absence of a statutory provision permitting the imposition of a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The other cases cited by the majority also stand for the proposition, and only that proposition, that the Racing Commission has broad authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing racing in Maryland; as the majority opinion itself makes clear, <em>see </em>343 Md. at 698-699, 684 A.2d at 812-813, none was concerned with the Commission\u2019s power to impose fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">With respect to the latter proposition, that the imposition of a fine may be in accord with the legislative purpose does not answer the pertinent question. Consistency with the legislative purpose is not synonymous with being authorized by the Legislature. Nor is the power to regulate identical to the power to fine. In other words, an unauthorized act may be nevertheless consistent with the purpose for which a statute was enacted. In effect, therefore, the majority merely assumes the issue in controversy; it simply never directly addresses the principles, proffered by the petitioner, applicable to the resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The majority takes comfort in \u201cthe history, nature and rationale of the regulatory scheme governing horse racing in this State, as well as actions by the General Assembly and opinions by this Court,\u201d which it maintains \u201cconfirm the validity of the [subject] regulation.\u201d 343 Md. at 690, 684 A.2d at 808. The comfort is not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Of critical importance to the majority\u2019s argument is an Attorney General\u2019s opinion issued in 1921, 6 Op. <em>Att\u2019y Gen. </em>480. Issued against the backdrop of the enactment in 1920 of Ch. 273 of the Acts of 1920, which directly addressed, in some detail, the licensure and regulation of \u201c[a]ny person or persons, association or corporation desiring to conduct racing within the State of Maryland,\u201d but was silent as to its applicability to racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, etc., the Attorney General concluded that the statute nevertheless applied to the latter persons. I do not share the majority\u2019s view that this opinion makes clear that the Legislature intended the Racing Commission\u2019s regulatory power to be all-encompassing. All this opinion does and, therefore, the most the Legislature can be said to have acquiesced in, is to indicate that the Commission\u2019s regulatory powers extend to persons critical to the racing industry; it simply does not address whether it has the authority to fine. Indeed, so broad an interpretation of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion is to accord to the Racing Commission unlimited power, <em>ie. </em>whatever it takes, including legislating, to accomplish the purpose for which it was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Premised on the 1921 Attorney General\u2019s opinion and the statutory provisions applicable to racetrack owners, the Commission, since 1921, has promulgated regulations, including the power to fine, paralleling those provisions, but applicable to racehorse owners, trainers, jockeys, etc. The majority relies on this \u201clong and consistent administrative construction of the statute,\u201d which has not been disturbed by the General Assembly, as support for its position. As previously indicated, I do not quarrel with the regulations insofar as they apply to licensure. Thus, administrative construction and Legislative acquiescence to that extent may be appropriate, even if not properly before this Court. With regard to the ability of the Commission to impose fines, however, an entirely different situation is presented.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There is nothing ambiguous about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the statute; as to owners, trainers, jockeys, etc., it does not authorize the Commission to impose fines. That power is given the Commission only in the case of track owners. \u201cWhen statutory language is unambiguous, administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u201d <em>Falik v. Prince George\u2019s Hospital, </em>322 Md. 409, 416, 588 A.2d 324, 327 (1991). <em>Macke Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 18, 22-23, 485 A.2d 254, 256 (1984). Nor, for the same reason, is Legislative acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The majority maintains that the cases relied upon by the petitioner do not stand for the proposition for which they were cited. I do not agree. On the contrary, they very specifically and persuasively demonstrate that administrative agencies require authorization from the Legislature to impose a fine or a penalty and that a mere general authorization will not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In <em>Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., </em>272 Md. 563, 325 A.2d 740, the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, having found employment discrimination, awarded compensatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>damages to the complainant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although the Commission was statutorily charged by the Legislature \u201cto promote in <em>every way possible </em>the betterment of human relations,\u201d and was specifically empowered \u201cto take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of the particular subtitle,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 564, 325 A.2d at 741 (emphasis added), this Court held that the Commission acted \u201cplainly beyond its power and jurisdiction,\u201d there being no express authorization to make monetary awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In the same vein, this Court held that a statutory grant of \u201cfull power to review and approve the reasonableness of hospital rates\u201d did not empower the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission to review and set certain physician charges billed to hospital patients. <em>Holy Cross Hospital, </em>283 Md. 677, 679, 682-83, 687, 690, 393 A.2d 181, 182, 183-85, 186, 187. And in <em>Investors Funding Corp., </em>270 Md. at 442, 312 A.2d at 246, where a county agency was properly cloaked -with specific authority to impose a monetary penalty up to a specified amount, this Court held that delegation of power, otherwise permissible, unconstitutional due to the \u201ccomplete lack of any legislative safeguards or standards.\u201d Without safeguards and standards governing its exercise, the agency\u2019s discretion to fix the penalties up to the specified ceiling, we noted, would be unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Cases from other jurisdictions are to like effect. <em>See, e.g., Groves v.

It is equally interesting to note that there was no issue in that case concerning the City's authority to delegate to its traffic director the power to impose penalties.

At issue in <em>Pressman </em>was the authority of the City of Baltimore to empower its traffic director to set speed limits in the City and to promulgate administrative regulations related thereto.

It is obvious that there is a practical necessity for expert and prompt judgment in the application of the concept of public safety to concrete situations, and that the standards for administrative officials in the domain of public safety should be at least as flexible as in the domain of public health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 553, 121 A.2d at 821.

Indeed, in this case, the Commission has assumed the power to fine. Moreover, it has also determined whether to fine, whom to fine, under what circumstances, and the amount of the fine, all without any Legislative authority whatsoever.

Consequently, the fact that the Court commented, in concluding its opinion, \"that this State acquired sufficient personal jurisdiction over [Jacobson] in matters of licensed racing to permit it to enjoin him by Rule 80 from selling a horse claimed in a licensed Maryland race for sixty days, and to punish him if he disobeyed that rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 190, 274 A.2d at 103, is neither dispositive nor persuasive.
