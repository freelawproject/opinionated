We shall hold that the trial court interpreted the exception too broadly, erroneously admitting collateral portions of the hearsay declaration that did not directly incriminate the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">In May, 1993, Respondent Michael Stewart Matusky was indicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on two counts of first-degree murder in connection with the stabbing deaths of Gertrude and Pamela Poffel. When the police initially investigated the crime in January, 1993, they questioned Matusky, as well as Pamela Poffel\u2019s estranged husband, Richard Dean White, and White\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Rebecca Marchew<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ka. In these interviews, White told the police that he knew nothing about the crimes. He also told the police that he spent the entire day of the crime shopping with Marchewka. Marchewka corroborated White\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">According to Marchewka\u2019s subsequent testimony at trial, three months after the initial police interviews, White told Marchewka in confidence that he knew who committed the crimes. White\u2019s declaration to Marchewka implicated Matusky as the murderer. Two days after White related his account to Marchewka, she contacted the police. Marchewka retracted her prior statements, which corroborated White\u2019s alibi, explaining that she lied at White\u2019s request because he feared revocation of his parole if the police knew he had actually been drinking at a bar. Marchewka then recounted White\u2019s statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">White and Matusky were both indicted on two counts of first-degree murder in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1996 Cum.Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 410. They were tried separately, and Matusky\u2019s trial was scheduled to take place before White\u2019s. Prior to the commencement of Matusky\u2019s trial, both the State and defense counsel sought a ruling on the admissibility of White\u2019s declaration to Marchewka. At the initial pre-trial hearing, the court denied the defense motion to exclude the declaration without hearing Marchewka\u2019s testimony, but informed the State that the declaration might later be excluded, depending on Marchewka\u2019s live testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Immediately before trial, the court again considered the admissibility of the declaration. At this hearing, the court heard testimony from Marchewka, outside the presence of the jury. After hearing Marchewka\u2019s testimony as well as oral argument from counsel, the court again concluded that the declaration was admissible, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">[Defense counsel\u2019s] argument with respect to the penal interests would be the thing that I really have to make the call on, talking here about admissibility not the weight; the jury will decide that. I find, from a reasonable person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>standard, as [the State\u2019s Attorney] articulated, would know that there is something against your pecuniary, proprietary or penal interests by discussing a homicide or violent act and then driving someone to the place where that act was to be carried out and driving them away, then giving a statement to the police which was a truthful statement; so, assuming the declarant is unavailable, in accordance with the other standard, I am prepared to rule that the statements are admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Matusky was tried before a jury in January, 1994. White did not testify at Matusky\u2019s trial because he asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege. The court therefore found that White was unavailable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marchewka, the State\u2019s key witness at trial, gave the following testimony regarding White\u2019s statements to her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Did [White] say anything to you on the ride home [from the bar]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">[MARCHEWKA]: He said that he was very upset and unhappy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Hs \u2756 H* <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Did he appear upset to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAz\">[MARCHEWKA]: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Could you tell if he had been drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">[MARCHEWKA]: Yes, he had been drinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">Hi H&lt; \u2756 \u2756 sfc #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What happened next ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aez\">[MARCHEWKA]: He laid down in the bed and told me that he had something that he wanted to tell me but he couldn\u2019t and I asked him why and he said because it would hurt me.

A police expert testified that the shoeprint was consistent with the size and style of a pair of shoes belonging to Matusky, although the expert could not declare a conclusive match between Matusky\u2019s shoe and the shoeprint. No other physical evidence connected Matusky to the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Matusky testified in his own behalf and denied any involvement in the crimes. Contrary to Marchewka\u2019s account, he testified that he did not drive to the Poffels\u2019 home with White on the night of the murders. He also denied harboring any animosity toward the Poffels for the death of Ted Poffel, instead attributing Ted Poffel\u2019s suicide to his cocaine addiction. Matusky also suggested that White had a much stronger motive to kill the Poffels. Matusky testified that White, who was Pamela Poffel\u2019s estranged husband and Gertrude Poffel\u2019s son-in-law, was angry with the Poffels for depriving him of money and investments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The jury convicted Matusky on both counts of first-degree murder. The court sentenced him to two terms of life imprisonment without possibility of parole, to be served consecutively-</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Matusky noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s admission of White\u2019s hearsay declaration to Marchewka. The Court of Special Appeals reversed Matusky\u2019s convictions, concluding that the trial court should not have admitted White\u2019s declaration <em>in toto. Matusky v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 389, 660 A.2d 935 (1995). Writing for the court, Judge Joseph Murphy, Jr., reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Applying <em>Simmons, Wilson, </em>and <em>Williamson </em>to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial judge should have excluded the statements in White\u2019s declaration that identified appellant as the killer and supplied appellant\u2019s motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>for the murders. Those statements were simply not self-inculpatory as to White.... With respect to those portions of the declaration in which White described his role, cross-examination of White would have been of marginal utility to appellant. The same cannot be said, however, about other statements in the declaration. It is obvious that appellant had an important interest in cross-examining White with respect to those portions of the declaration in which White (1) identified appellant as the killer and (2) discussed appellant\u2019s motive for the murders. Those statements should have been redacted from White\u2019s declaration against interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 403, 660 A.2d at 941. We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR3\">Under the hearsay exception for a declaration against penal interest, is the admissible statement the extended declaration or only those remarks that are individually self-inculpatory?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The State contends that the outcome of this case is governed by our decision in <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 526 A.2d 955 (1987). Under our holding in <em>Standifur, </em>the State argues, the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest applies to both individually self-inculpatory statements and collateral statements. In addition, the State maintains that the Supreme Court decision in <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994), does not control our decision, because <em>Williamson </em>interprets Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), while the present case was decided under Maryland common law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>argues that even if the test articulated in <em>Williamson </em>applies, the circumstances in this case indicate that White was not merely attempting to shift blame to Matusky or to minimize his own culpability. Therefore, the State maintains, White\u2019s extended declaration to Marchewka should be admitted in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Respondent argues that <em>Williamson </em>should govern the decision to admit a declaration against penal interest. Under both <em>Williamson </em>and prior Maryland cases, Respondent contends, at least those portions of the declaration shifting blame from White to Matusky should have been excluded. Respondent maintains that only those portions of White\u2019s declaration that individually implicated White should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The declaration against penal interest exception to the rule precluding the admission of hearsay evidence is predicated on the assumption that the declarant would not make a statement adverse to his or her penal interest unless that declarant believed it to be true. <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 11, 526 A.2d 955, 959 (1987). While this rationale supports admitting individual statements that are contrary to the declarant\u2019s penal interest, courts and commentators differ on whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>rationale applies to other portions of a hearsay declaration that do not directly implicate the declarant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Wigmore, for example, proposed that if part of a hearsay declaration was self-inculpatory, then the entire declaration should be admissible, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Since the principle is that the statement is made under circumstances fairly indicating the declarant\u2019s sincerity and accuracy ... it is obvious that the situation indicates the correctness of whatever he may say while under that influence. In other words, the statement may be accepted, not merely as to the specific fact against interest, but also as to <em>every fact contained in the same statement. </em>... All parts of the speech or entry may be admitted which appear to have been made while the declarant was in the trustworthy condition of mind which permitted him to state what was against his interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">5 J. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 1465, at 339-41 (Chadbourn rev. 1974 <em>&amp; </em>1996 Supp.). Other commentators took the opposite position, <em>i.e., </em>that none of the collateral portions of declarations against interest should be admitted. <em>See </em>B. Jefferson, <em>Declarations Against Interest: An Exception to the Hearsay Rule, </em>58 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 60-61 (1944).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Professor McCormick, among others, advocated an intermediate approach, permitting the admission of some but not all collateral portions of declarations against penal interest. He suggested that courts separate the self-serving from the dis-serving portions of the declaration against interest, excluding only the self-serving portions. C. McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence \u00a7 279(d), at 677 (E. Cleary ed., 2d ed. 1972). Thus, \u201ccollateral neutral\u201d statements, <em>ie., </em>those that neither incriminate the declarant nor shift blame to a third party, could be admitted under Professor McCormick\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 5, 526 A.2d 955, 956 (1987), we considered the question <em>of </em>whether a declaration against the penal interest of an unavailable declarant, offered by the State against the accused in a criminal trial, was sufficiently reliable to qualify under the common law exception to the hearsay rule. We analyzed the alternative views of the scope of the declaration against penal interest exception discussed above, and adopted the intermediate position advocated by Professor McCormick. We articulated a test for trial judges to apply in deciding whether or not to admit a statement against interest. First, the proponent of the declaration must demonstrate that the declarant is unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 526 A.2d at 959. Once the proponent establishes unavailability, the court must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">carefully consider the content of the statement in the light of all known and relevant circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and all relevant information concerning the declarant, and determine whether the statement was in fact against the declarant\u2019s penal interest and wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>er a reasonable person in the situation of the declarant would have perceived that it was against his penal interest at the time it was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, 526 A.2d at 962.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the hearsay statement passes this part of the test, the trial judge must next consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">whether there are present any other facts or circumstances, including those indicating a motive to falsify on the part of the declarant, that so cut against the presumption of reliability normally attending a declaration against interest that the statements should not be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Id., </em>526 A.2d at 962.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Even if a statement passes these threshold requirements for admissibility, however, <em>Standifur </em>also requires the trial judge to conduct a final inquiry. <em>Standifur </em>provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>A statement against interest that survives this analysis, <em>and those related statements so closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy, </em>are admissible as declarations against interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d at 962 (emphasis added). Thus, even after determining that the proffered evidence passes the first three requirements for admissibility, <em>Standifur </em>requires that the. trial judge parse the entire declaration to determine which portions of it are directly contrary to the declarant\u2019s penal interest, and which collateral portions are so closely related as to be equally trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Applying this test to the declaration at issue in <em>Standifur, </em>we concluded in that case that the entire declaration was inadmissible because it was not a declaration against penal interest. First, we determined that the State had not established that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would have believed the declaration to be self-incriminating, because \u201c[r]ather than confessing criminal misconduct, these statements appear to represent an attempt to satisfy the police while avoiding criminal involvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 526 A.2d at 963. Even if the declaration had passed this prong of the test for admissibility, however, we observed that it would have failed the reliability prong of the test. The declarant made the declaration to the police, during custodial interrogation, fearing revocation of his parole. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 526 A.2d at 963. He \u201capparently wished to curry favor with the authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 526 A.2d at 963. Under these circumstances, we concluded that \u201cthe statement [was not] ... sufficiently reliable to be admitted for the purpose of inculpating an accused in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>526 A.2d at 963. Because we concluded that the statement was not admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, we did not consider \u201cseparate issues that are possibly generated by the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 526 A.2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Similarly, in <em>Brown v. State, </em>317 Md. 417, 564 A.2d 772 (1989), we applied the <em>Standifur </em>test to determine the admissibility of two declarations against penal interest. In <em>Brown, </em>the hearsay declarant, Bruce, and a co-defendant, Williams, were both charged with unlawful possession of handguns. When Bruce pled guilty to the charge, he told the court under oath that the guns belonged to a third participant, Brown. <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 564 A.2d at 773. Bruce also testified at Williams\u2019 trial, stating that Brown had asked him to hold the guns until Brown could sell them. <em>Id., </em>564 A.2d at 773. At Brown\u2019s revocation of probation hearing, however, Bruce refused to testify to the source of the guns; therefore, the court permits ted the state to introduce the transcripts of Bruce\u2019s prior testimony in evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21, 564 A.2d at 773. Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>objected, contending that these statements were inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Applying <em>Standifur, </em>we concluded that both of Bruce\u2019s prior statements were inadmissible collateral statements outside the scope of the declaration against penal interest exception. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 564 A.2d at 775-76. We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">The first statement offered by the State \u2014 that given by Bruce at the time of the entry of his guilty plea \u2014 was collateral to his admission of guilt and carries with it precious little intrinsic or extrinsic indicia of reliability ... This is not a situation where the admission of guilt by Bruce, in and of itself, furnishes any evidence against Brown. Rather, this is a case of a criminal, who has already admitted his guilt, being pressed by the judge who will soon sentence him, and by the prosecutor who may make a recommendation concerning his sentence, to disclose information that may lead to a subsequent criminal prosecution. Under these circumstances, Bruce may well have been motivated by the desire to curry favor with the authorities, and by the desire to reduce his own culpability \u2014 motives that we have identified as frequently present in these situations, and which combine to make \u2018inevitably suspect\u2019 statements of this type.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 423-24, 564 A.2d at 775. Similarly, we concluded that Bruce\u2019s second statement, given at Williams\u2019 trial, was also \u201cwholly collateral,\u201d as well as unreliable because of Bruce\u2019s apparent motive to exculpate Williams. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 564 A.2d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Applying the <em>Standifur </em>analysis to the facts of the instant case, we conclude that the trial court should not have admitted Marchewka\u2019s testimony in its entirety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the trial court correctly determined that White\u2019s declaration was in fact adverse to his penal interest,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that a reasonable person in White\u2019s circumstances would have realized that his declaration was contrary to his penal interest. <em>Standifur </em>also required, however, that the trial court parse the hearsay declaration to admit only those individual statements that were contrary to White\u2019s penal interest, along with the additional portions that were \u201cso closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy[.]\u201d <em>Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d at 962. This the trial court failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Based on our review of the record, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the trial court erroneously admitted Marchewka\u2019s testimony <em>in toto </em>rather than analyzing the declaration statement by statement to determine whether collateral portions of White\u2019s account should be redacted. As the intermediate appellate court concluded, the trial court should have redacted those portions of White\u2019s declaration identifying Matusky as the murderer and suggesting Matusky\u2019s motive for the crime. 105 Md.App. at 403, 660 A.2d at 941. These portions of the declaration did not directly incriminate White. Moreover, these non-incriminating statements are not as trustworthy as self-incriminating statements, because they serve to shift blame from White to Matusky.

In <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994), the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of an extended hearsay declaration under Federal Rule 804(b)(3), which closely corresponds to Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(3). The police arrested the hearsay declarant, Harris, after discovering nineteen kilos of cocaine in Harris\u2019s car during a traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>Following his arrest, Harris gave a statement to the police that implicated Williamson as the head of a drug distribution scheme. Harris\u2019s statement was also self-incriminatory, albeit implicating him in a more minor role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>as a drug courier.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Despite an offer of immunity, Harris refused to testify at Williamson\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2434. The State introduced Harris\u2019s hearsay declaration through testimony of the investigating police officer. Williamson objected to the admission of Harris\u2019s hearsay declaration, but the trial court overruled the objection, concluding that Harris\u2019s statement was admissible as a declaration against penal interest. <em>Id. </em>Williamson was convicted of several drug trafficking offenses. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the convictions without opinion. 981 F.2d 1262 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Supreme Court reversed the convictions and remanded the case for a new trial, concluding that the trial court failed to properly analyze the admissibility of Harris\u2019s hearsay declaration. <em>Id. </em>at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2437-38. Justice O\u2019Connor delivered the opinion of the Court, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">[T]he most faithful reading of Rule 804(b)(3) is that it does not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory.

But when a self-serving statement is made along with a disserving one, it may well be doubted that the declarant is in a trustworthy frame of mind when he makes the self-serving statement. It would appear that a self-serving statement lacks trustworthiness whether it accompanies a disserving statement or not. The basis of this exception is not that a declarant is in a general trustworthy frame of mind. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>probability of trustworthiness comes from the facts asserted being disserving in character. Once those facts are left behind the probability of trustworthiness for other statements seems highly speculative and conjectural.

First, a court might ignore the declarant's subjective understanding and ask only whether an ordinary person would recognize the dis-serving effect of his statement. Second, the court might explore what the declarant actually thought, but ignore his understanding if it is unreasonable. Finally, the court may admit the statement if the declarant thought the statement was against his interest, regardless of whether either the statement was in fact disserving or a normal person would have so thought. Under the third approach, a court would exclude the statement if the declarant had not actually recognized its disserving effect, even if a normal person would have recognized it.

One of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature---- Self-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones which people are most likely to make even when they are false; and mere proximity to other, self-inculpatoiy, statements does not increase the plausibility of the self-exculpatoiy statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">512 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2435.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The Supreme Court previously described this problem as one of \u201cselective reliability\u201d within an extended hearsay declaration. <em>See Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 824, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3151, 111 L.E.2d 638 (1990). <em>See also United States v. Matthews, </em>20 F.3d 538, 545 (2d Cir.1994) (\"The difficulty is that if the statement against penal interest is multi-faceted, its facets may not be uniformly trustworthy.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\">. Six Justices adopted the test'articulated by Justice O\u2019Connor. Although all of the Justices agreed that some portions of Harris\u2019s declaration should have been redacted, however, the Court was divided on the appropriate standard to apply in defining the scope of the declaration against penal interest exception. Justice Scalia, in a concurring opinion, agreed with the approach articulated by Justice O'Connor, but further explicated the standard. He noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">A statement obviously can be self-inculpatoiy ... without consisting of the confession T committed X element of Y crime.' ... Moreover, a declarant\u2019s statement is not magically transformed from a statement against penal interest into one that is inadmissible merely because the declarant names another person or implicates a possible codefendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">512 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2438 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Justice Ginsburg, in a concurring opinion joined by three other Justices, also adopted the test articulated by Justice O\u2019Connor, but disagreed with Justice O'Connor\u2019s application of the test to the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2438-39 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). In Justice Ginsburg\u2019s view, the facts of the case were so suggestive of blame-shifting that the declaration was presumptively unreliable, and thus Harris\u2019s entire declaration should have been excluded. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2439. Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the result, determined that the State should be permitted an opportunity to argue on remand that the erroneous admission of Harris\u2019s statement was harmless error. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2440.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Finally, Justice Kennedy, in a concurring opinion joined by two other Justices, adopted an interpretation of Federal Rule 804(b)(3) analogous to our earlier interpretation in <em>Standifur. Id. </em>at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2440-41 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Kennedy interpreted Rule 804(b)(3) to permit admission of some collateral statements, consistent with Professor McCormick\u2019s approach. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2441. Thus, self-serving collateral statements would be inadmissible, but collateral neutral statements would be admissible. <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>S.Ct. at 2444. Justice Kennedy also acknowledged that declarations against penal interest made to the authorities should not be admitted if the declarant was \u201cmotivated by a desire to curry favor with the authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b531-14\">. Although the Supreme Court did not actually proceed to redact the extended hearsay declaration in <em>Williamson, </em>the Court provided a number of hypotheticals to illustrate what types of statements could be admitted as declarations against penal interest. For example, Justice O'Connor noted that the statement \" 'I hid the gun in Joe\u2019s apartment\u2019 may not be a confession of a crime; but if it is likely to help the police find the murder weapon, then it is certainly self-inculpatory.\u201d 512 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2437. In addition, Justice O'Connor observed that the statement \u201cSam and I went to Joe\u2019s house\u201d could also be admitted if a \"reasonable person ... would realize that being linked to Joe and Sam would implicate the declarant in Joe and Sam's conspiracy.\" <em>Id. </em>In his concurring opinion, Justice Scalia also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-17\">[I]f a lieutenant in an organized crime operation described the inner workings of an extortion and protection racket, naming some of the other actors and thereby inculpating himself on racketeering and/or conspiracy charges, I have no doubt that some of those remarks could be admitted as statements against penal interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2438 (Scalia, J., concurring). Thus, the Court intended that, under some circumstances, statements incriminating both the declarant and a third party could be admitted as declarations against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In the case before us, we note that the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule was the sole basis the State offered to support admission of White\u2019s statement to Marchewka that he drove Matusky to the Poffels\u2019 house. The State did not offer the statement under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See State v. Rivenbark, </em>311 Md. 147, 149, 533 A.2d 271, 272 (1987); <em>see also </em>Md.Rule 5-803(a)(5). Indeed, even if they had, the statement does not appear to qualify under that exception because it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>Rivenbark, </em>311 Md. at 149, 533 A.2d at 272.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\">. Justice O\u2019Connor expressly stated in Part II.C of her opinion that \"we need not address Williamson's claim that ... the statements were \u2022also made inadmissible by the Confrontation Clause[.]\u201d 512 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2437. Because in the case before us we conclude that the trial court failed to properly analyze the declaration under the hearsay rules, we also need not reach the Confrontation Clause issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\">. The dissent relies on <em>Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 455 S.E.2d 219, <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 233, 133 L.Ed.2d 162 (1995). In <em>Chandler, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia completely rejected the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Federal Rule of Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>804(b)(3) in <em>Williamson </em>and admitted the declarant\u2019s entire statement as a declaration against penal interest. <em>Id. </em>455 S.E.2d at 225. As we noted, <em>supra, </em>while the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal rule is not binding on us, we find it persuasive. Moreover, even if we did not elect to follow <em>Williamson, Chandler </em>would be inconsistent with our approach in <em>Standifur, </em>which also required the trial court to evaluate the reliability of each statement within a declaration rather than admitting the declaration <em>in toto. Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d at 962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">. Other state and federal courts have adopted similar interpretations of the <em>Williamson </em>decision. In <em>United. States v. Sims, </em>879 F.Supp. 828 (N.D.Ill.1995), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">The fact that an inculpatory portion is closely related to the portion against interest may be an input into finding that the 'closely related\u2019 portion turns out to be against interest itself. After <em>Williamson, </em>the key is that a finding that an inculpatory portion is \u2018closely related\u2019 to an against-interest portion will not <em>itself </em>warrant 804(b)(3) admissibility. Each admitted statement or portion of statement must be found to be against the penal interests of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 832 n. 3. <em>See also Ciccarelli v.

Furthermore, if the trial court finds that any portion of the declaration is admissible as a declaration against penal interest, it must then proceed to decide whether that portion satisfies the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Simmons, </em>333 Md. at 555, 636 A.2d at 467; <em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 453-54, 628 A.2d at 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>RODOWSKY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APv\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">I respectfully dissent from the holding of the Court set forth in Part IV.A of the majority opinion. That holding is that \u201cthe trial court should have redacted those portions of White\u2019s declaration identifying Matusky as the murderer and suggesting Matusky\u2019s motive for the crime.\u201d 343 Md. at 485, 682 A.2d at 703.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The hearsay problem under consideration is plagued with semantic difficulties. In any given case the universe of the data is the whole of what the declarant had to say that is relevant to the charges pending against the accused. The task is to determine whether the universe is admissible against the accused in its entirety, partially, or not at all, as declarations against the penal interest of the declarant. Within this universe of data there can be gradations ranging from hard core, clear cut declarations against penal interest, through varying degrees of inculpatory matter, to the clearly exculpatory or, at least, self-serving statement. In my view a conceptual rule, phrased in terms such as \u201cextended narrative,\u201d \u201cstatement,\u201d \u201cconfession,\u201d and \u201cdeclaration,\u201d can only be understood when legal holdings are made on specific facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Preliminarily, I do not believe that the majority has given appropriate precedential weight to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 526 A.2d 955 (1987). Nor does <em>Standifur </em>differ substantially from the analysis presented in Parts I, II.A, and II.B of the opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by five other justices, in <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994). Both <em>Williamson </em>and <em>Standifur </em>require consideration of all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>known facts and circumstances surrounding the obtaining of the universe of data in order to determine reliability, and the entire universe may be excluded as unreliable at that' level of analysis. 512 U.S. at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2436-37; 310 Md. at 11-13, 526 A.2d at 959-60. Looking at portions of the universe, both opinions exclude matter that is self-serving or exculpatory of the declarant. 512 U.S. at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2434-35; 310 Md. at 12-15, 526 A.2d at 959-61. Both opinions would test the inculpatory nature of the portion of the universe under consideration by a reasonable person test. 512 U.S. at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2435, 2436-37; 310 Md. at 12-13, 526 A.2d at 959-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">' With respect to portions of the universe that are \u201ccollateral\u201d or \u201crelated\u201d to the core declaration against penal interest, both opinions seem to take substantially the same approach. <em>Williamson </em>directs a \u201cstatement\u201d by \u201cstatement\u201d analysis of the portions under the reasonable person test. 512 U.S. at ---, 114 S.Ct. at 2436-37. Under <em>Standifur, </em>the hard core declaration against penal interest \u201cand those related statements so closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy, are admissible as declarations against interest.\u201d 310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d at 962. Of course, what makes the \u201cclosely connected\u201d statements \u201cequally trustworthy\u201d is that a reasonable person would have perceived them as contrary to penal interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">Consequently, the majority inaccurately presents <em>Standifur </em>when it states that \u201c[t]he central distinction between the <em>Williamson </em>approach and our approach in <em>Standifur </em>is that \u2018proximity\u2019 between the self-inculpatory and \u2018collateral\u2019 portions no longer guarantees admissibility.\u201d 343 Md. at 491, 682 A.2d at 705-06. \u201c[Pjroximity,\u201d denotes spacial nearness, presumably in the written presentation of the universe under consideration. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1828 (1976). Nowhere in <em>Standifur </em>does the word, \u201cproximi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ty,\u201d appear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proximity is not the test for admissibility under <em>Standifur, </em>as shown above.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Even if there are differences between Maryland common law, as enunciated in <em>Standifur, </em>and the application of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), and even if those differences justify adopting <em>Williamson </em>as expressing Maryland common law, there is nothing in <em>Williamson </em>that compels the exclusion of the identity and motive portions of White\u2019s conversation with Marchewka. <em>Williamson </em>involved a declarant who was arrested while possessing nineteen kilograms of cocaine in two suitcases in the trunk of a rental car driven by the declarant. 512 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2433. He admitted knowing that the drugs were there. <em>Id. </em>In his post-arrest statements to Drug Enforcement Administration agents, he said that he was transporting the cocaine for the accused, Williamson, who, in another vehicle, had been preceding the declarant and who had seen the traffic stop and the search of the vehicle driven by the declarant. <em>Id. </em>The quantity possessed by the declarant would support finding the declarant\u2019s intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2439. In <em>Williamson, </em>four justices, joining in a concurrence by Justice Ginsburg, found the blame-shifting to Williamson so self-serving as to render the universe wholly inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at---, 114 S.Ct. at 2439-40. Five justices in <em>Williamson, </em>however, in three separate opinions, remanded for a \u201cstatement\u201d by \u201cstatement\u201d parsing of the universe.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\"><em>Williamson </em>does not say that the identity of a criminal confederate of the declarant must be excised from a declaration against penal interest. If that were the law, even the remainder of the hard core declaration against penal interest ordinarily would not be connected to the accused and likely would be inadmissible for lack of relevancy. Five justices in <em>Williamson </em>remanded for parsing the universe in order possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>bly to reach an admissible declaration against penal interest. That exercise would be pointless if an ultimate, expurgated version could not even mention the name of the accused in the very case in which the declaration was to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In any event, even a statement by statement parsing of White\u2019s conversation with Marchewka results in the admissibility of the identification of Matusky and of his communication of his motive to White. They are important, integrated parts of White\u2019s declaration against penal interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his conversation with Marchewka, White incriminates himself as an accomplice, or principal in the second degree, to the murders of Trudy Poffell and her daughter, Pam Poffell, and as an accessory after the fact to those murders. Knowledge that a murder was to be committed, or had been committed, is an element of either theory of criminal responsibility. 1 C. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 31 and 33 (15th ed. 1993). The knowledge element of the crimes admitted in White\u2019s declaration against penal interest is greatly reinforced by the inclusion of the parts of White\u2019s conversation with Marchewka in which Matusky is named as the person declaring an intent to kill and expressing the reason for having formulated that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">A little background is needed to place White\u2019s- conversation in perspective. At the time of trial Marchewka had been employed for twenty-five years by AT &amp; T. She was raising her teenage son and preteen daughter. White had been living with her in her home since March of 1989. The two had become engaged in 1991, although White was not divorced from his estranged wife, one of the victims, Pam Poffell. Through White, Marchewka had met Matusky. White and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Matusky were \u201cvery close friends\u201d who would see one another or go out \u201c[a] couple times a week.\u201d The murders occurred on January 24, 1993. When the police interviewed White because he was the estranged husband of one of the victims, Marchewka falsely informed the police that White was shopping with her at the time of the murders. She did this because White was on parole, and he had told Marchewka that, at the time of the murders, he was drinking in a bar in violation of his parole. White\u2019s declaration against penal interest to Marchewka was made on Easter Sunday, April 11, 1993, after White had been drinking. The majority points to nothing indicating that the murder investigation had focused on White at that time, much less that he was suspected of being the actual killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The legal test as to what constitutes a declaration against penal interest is whether a reasonable person would perceive the statement to be incriminating. One way to test whether White\u2019s references to Matusky and to his motive are integral parts of the declaration against penal interest would be to look at a similar declaration that did not contain those references. In that analytical framework a prosecutor would be seeking to convict White of being a principal in the second degree to murder based on White\u2019s admission as a party opponent that White met someone in a bar whom White did not know, that that person said that he wanted to murder Trudy and Pam Poffell for reasons that were not expressed, and that White drove the stranger to the Poffell home in the stranger\u2019s car. Although our hypothetical illustration contains some evidence of knowledge, the knowledge element is greatly diminished from the standpoint of any weight that would be attributed to it. To a reasonable person, the expurgated version sounds more like the statement of a mentally disturbed individual than a declaration against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Much the same argument that the majority of this Court today accepts was rejected by the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 455 S.E.2d 219, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 233, 133 L.Ed.2d 162 (1995). In <em>Chandler </em>the Virginia court unanimously affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>a death sentence imposed for a murder committed in the course of the armed robbery of a convenience store. The unavailable declarant, Bernice Murphy, was the girlfriend of the accused, Chandler. The witness was a special agent of the Virginia State Police who had taken a statement from Murphy as part of the murder investigation. 455 S.E.2d at 224. \u201cIn her statement, Murphy described riding in the car with Chandler [and others] to obtain the gun, and Chandler\u2019s discussion about \u2018going in, robbing the store and leaving.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Murphy remained in the car during the robbery and murder. Murphy described Chandler\u2019s statements made when he returned to the car, including, \u201c \u2018[W]hy didn\u2019t the man open the register?\u2019 and \u2018[H]e got shot over money that wasn\u2019t even his.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Chandler argued to the Virginia court that under <em>Williamson </em>\u201conly those portions of the statement which directly implicate Murphy are admissible\u201d and that \u201cMurphy\u2019s statements regarding [Chandler\u2019s] accounts of' the robbery would be inadmissible.\u201d 455 S.E.2d at 225. The Virginia court first observed that <em>Williamson </em>\u201cconcerned the interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence\u201d which were \u201cnot applicable here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cFurthermore, in the present case, Murphy\u2019s recitations of statements made by Chandler showed her knowledge of and complicity in the criminal act and exposed her to liability as an accessory to the crimes. Accordingly, Murphy\u2019s entire statement is admissible as a declaration against penal interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Similarly, in the instant matter, White\u2019s statements that it was Matusky who communicated the intent to murder and the reason why \u201cshowed [White\u2019s] knowledge of and complicity in the criminal act and exposed [him] to liability as an accessory to the crimes.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">. In explaining my views, I too \"shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the trial court correctly determined . . . that a reasonable person in White's circumstances would have realized that his declaration was contrary to his penal interest.\u201d 343 Md. at 484-85, 682 A.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">It should also be noted that there was no cross-petition filed. Consequently, any issue involving the Confrontation Clause that may be lurking beneath the surface in this matter is not an issue that is before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-13\">. The term, \u201cproximity,\u201d is found in Part II.A of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in <em>Williamson. </em>There it is stated that the \u201cmere proximity to other, self-inculpatory, statements [of self-exculpatory statements] does not increase the plausibility of the self-exculpatory statements.\u201d 512 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2435.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">. I understand the majority of this Court to hold that any reference to Matusky is inadmissible, and not simply the conclusory statement that .Matusky was the murderer that appears at the beginning of White\u2019s conversation with Marchewka. Of course, if White\u2019s conversation with Marchewka had stopped at that point, the conclusory statement would not be admissible because White had not yet made any declarations against penal interest. Later incriminating portions of the conversation support the conclusion expressed earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
