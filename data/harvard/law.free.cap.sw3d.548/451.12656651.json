He claims that he had a protected liberty interest in parole once he served the mandatory minimum sentence. He further contends that he was denied meaningful parole consideration when the Board did not disclose to him, and based its decision on, inaccurate adverse information in his parole file. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
