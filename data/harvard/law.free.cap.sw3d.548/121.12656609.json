Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant Ricky D. Elliot appeals his conviction for possession of a controlled substance-methamphetamine-in the amount of more than 4 grams but less than 200 grams. In one issue, Elliot argues that the trial court erred by not suppressing the methamphetamine. Specifically, he argues that the arresting officer in this case did not have proper justification to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk and, in the alternative, that the officer exceeded the permissible scope of the frisk. We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Bengal, a patrol officer with the City of Fort Worth, testified at the suppression hearing. According to Bengal, on March 4, 2016, he received a call to issue a criminal-trespass warning at a nearby gas station. Bengal described the area around the gas station as \"a high foot traffic, high transient area.\" He also said that the area is rife with \"prostitution, narcotics, disturbances, and violence of every nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After arriving at the gas station and learning from the manager that the person he wished to have a criminal-trespass warning issued to had left, the manager pointed toward Elliot and asked Bengal to issue a criminal-trespass warning to him. Bengal averred that as he approached Elliot, he explained to him that he was going to issue him a criminal-trespass warning and that he was not under arrest but that if he came back after the issuance, he would be arrested. Bengal said that Elliot was \"nervous, kind of agitated,\" and \"wanted to leave as soon as he was pointed out by the manager.\" Bengal further described Elliot as being \"physically jittery\" and speaking rapidly. Bengal also noticed that Elliot had several bulges in his pockets and vest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bengal said that Elliot's behavior and the bulges concerned him because the area where he was had a particularly high transient population and that transients in that area were known to carry weapons. Bengal\n   was also alone because his backup had not arrived on the scene yet. So Bengal decided to conduct a frisk to ensure that Elliot was not armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As he was conducting the frisk, Bengal said that he felt \"a card deck-sized object\" in Elliot's left pocket that had \"sharp angles\" and \"hard edges\"; that it was \"something angular\"; and that it had a \"little density to it.\" Wanting to ensure that it was not a weapon or something containing a weapon, Bengal removed the object from Elliot's pocket. Bengal said that he discovered that it was a \"cigarette container with the top flipped back.\" Bengal averred that he then noticed that along with cigarettes, the container had \"a clear plastic baggie [containing] a white crystalline substance\" which, from his training and experience, he knew to be methamphetamine. The State admitted and published for the trial judge a video from Bengal's body camera. In the video, Bengal can be seen holding the open cigarette container up to his camera lens immediately after he had removed it from Elliot's pocket. In the video, Elliot also tells Bengal that he is homeless, having recently been released from incarceration, and did not wish to be involved in anything that might be relayed to his probation officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied Elliot's suppression motion. Later, Elliot entered a plea agreement whereby the trial court sentenced him to ten years' incarceration. The trial court also certified Elliot's right to appeal the suppression ruling, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his sole issue, Elliot argues that Bengal was not justified in frisking him and that even if Bengal had justification, he exceeded the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence under a bifurcated standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Amador v.

Such an action by Bengal would reasonably necessitate a physically close encounter with Elliot lasting at least several minutes.\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v.

App.-Dallas Aug. 7, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication). As Bengal approached him, Elliot acted as though he \"wanted to leave,\" and he was agitated and nervous. It is common knowledge that fear can be a strong motivator of rash action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201801597\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Elliot also spoke rapidly and was \"physically jittery.\" And as Bengal approached Elliot, he noticed several bulges in Elliot's pockets and vest. From Bengal's experience in the gas station's location, he knew that transient individuals often carried weapons given the area's reputation for violence. Out of concern for his own safety, Bengal then conducted a pat-down search of Elliot's outer clothing and felt \"a card deck-sized object\" in Elliot's left pocket that had \"sharp angles\" and \"hard edges.\" Bengal also described the object as \"something angular\" that had a \"little density to it.\" Wanting to ensure that it was not a weapon or something containing a weapon, Bengal removed the object from Elliot's pocket. It was then that Bengal discovered that the object was a \"cigarette container with the top flipped back.\" And there, in plain view, Bengal observed that the cigarette container contained what Bengal's training and experience had taught him was methamphetamine. All of these facts are objective, specific, articulable, and supportive of the trial court's ruling. Thus, we hold that Bengal was justified in conducting the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk of Elliot.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201801597\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that officers who were attempting to issue a criminal-trespass warning to an individual who acted \"fidgety and apprehensive,\" and where officers observed a bulge in the individual's pants, were justified in conducting a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Elliot argues that even if the frisk was justified at its inception, Bengal exceeded the permissible scope of the frisk. Specifically, and relying on\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris v. State\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"[w]ithdrawing small containers from a suspect's pocket is impermissible,\" Elliot argues that Bengal was only allowed to frisk for weapons and that Bengal's belief that what he had felt could have been or could have contained a weapon was objectively unreasonable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971690\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/829/218/#p221\">\n    829 S.W.2d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (Tex.

But Elliot's reliance on these cases is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   dealt with a matchbox and small gum container, respectively, where officers in both cases testified that they feared a razorblade could have been secreted away.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971690\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/829/218/#p221\">\n    829 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   221-22 ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9963091\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/827/49/#p51\">\n    827 S.W.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both of those\n   courts held that this belief was objectively unreasonable because there were multiple officers present and the officers opened the containers once they had removed them from the individuals' pockets.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971690\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/829/218/#p221\">\n    829 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   221 ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9963091\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/827/49/#p51\">\n    827 S.W.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike in either\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , however, here, Bengal testified that the size of the container that he felt could have contained a more sinister and dangerous weapon-Bengal testified that he knew of a small-caliber handgun that was capable of firing two rounds that was smaller than the size of the cigarette container he felt upon his frisk. Bengal was also alone. And Bengal did not open the container once he removed it from Elliot's pocket-it was already open. We also note that there is no evidence in the record to support Elliot's contention that Bengal manipulated the cigarette container, causing it to open. Indeed, the trial court had before it both Bengal's testimony to the contrary and a video from Bengal's body camera showing that immediately upon the removing of the cigarette package, it was open. We conclude that the trial court did not err by denying Elliot's suppression motion, and we overrule both parts of Elliot's sole issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
