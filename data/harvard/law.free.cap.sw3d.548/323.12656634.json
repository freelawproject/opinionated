Movant was convicted of three counts of second-degree assault, unlawful possession of a firearm, attempted first-degree robbery, five counts of armed criminal action, and one count of second-degree murder. Movant was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for each count of second-degree assault, seven years' imprisonment for one count of armed criminal action and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm, 15 years' imprisonment for attempted first-degree robbery, 25 years' imprisonment for each of the four remaining counts of armed criminal action, and life imprisonment for second-degree murder, for a total sentence of life plus 25 years. This Court affirmed Movant's convictions and sentences in\n   <em>\n    State v.

No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion.
