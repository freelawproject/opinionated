Williams appealed, and the court of appeals transferred the case to this Court on the ground that the appeal raised an issue within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court as set forth in article V, section 3, of the Missouri Constitution. That issue is whether article I, section 18(c), added to the Missouri Constitution in 2014, violates due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Article I, section 18(c) is an amalgam of Federal Rules of Evidence 414 and 403. Every federal circuit that has considered a similar due process challenge has rejected it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 1996, Williams, then 26 years old, pleaded guilty to first-degree statutory sodomy for inserting his thumb in a minor child's vagina. He was sentenced to five years in prison but, after completing a 120-day program in a sex offender assessment unit, execution of his sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for five years. In 1999, Williams violated his probation and his\n   sentence was executed. Williams was released from prison in 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after Williams was released from prison, he began dating T.W. (\"Mother\"), the biological mother of M.E.E. (\"Victim\"). Early in their relationship, Williams informed Mother he had a prior conviction for sexually molesting a young girl. Mother continued to maintain a relationship with Williams and later introduced Williams to M.E. (\"Father\"), Victim's biological father. At the time, Mother and Father were still living together. When Father discovered Williams was a registered sex offender, he repeatedly told Mother he did not want Williams around the children. In February 2004, Mother left Father and took Victim and Victim's two older siblings with her. Shortly thereafter, Mother allowed Williams to move in with her and her children. In 2005, Mother married Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The first instance of abuse to which Victim testified occurred in 2008, when she was roughly eight years old. Victim recalled she stayed home from school to recover from an illness. Williams was the only other person in the home at the time. Victim and Williams were eating candy and, when Victim said she wanted the last piece, Williams told her she could not have it unless she took \"off all [her] clothes and let him play with [her] butt.\" Williams eventually coerced Victim into taking off all her clothes in his bedroom and touched her bottom while playing with himself. Williams continued to abuse Victim until the latter part of 2013 by touching Victim's genitals and bottom and by forcing her to perform manual and oral sex acts upon him, usually when no one else was home. The frequency of Williams's abuse declined after Williams and Mother separated in 2012, though Williams continued to abuse Victim on some occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2013, Victim reported Williams's abuse to the police. Shortly thereafter, the state charged Williams with three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state subsequently filed an information in lieu of indictment alleging Williams should be sentenced as a predatory sexual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to article I, section 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution, the state filed a pretrial motion to admit evidence of Williams's 1996 conviction on the ground it demonstrated his propensity to commit the offenses with which he was charged. Over Williams's objection, the circuit court granted the state's motion but specified that, unless the parties later disagreed, the state would be limited to proving Williams's prior plea by way of a stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The case was tried to a jury in February 2015. Over Williams's objection,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the stipulation was read to the jury. At the end of the three-day trial, the jury convicted Williams of all three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy. After the jury rendered its verdicts, Williams moved for a new trial on several grounds. The circuit court overruled Williams's motion, concluded he was a predatory sexual offender in light of his prior conviction, and sentenced him to three concurrent sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole for 50 years. Williams appeals, and this Court has jurisdiction under article V, section 3, of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Williams challenges the constitutionality, proper construction, and application of article I, section 18(c), which Missouri voters added to the Missouri Constitution in 2014. In its entirety, this section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17 and 18(a) of this article to the contrary, in prosecutions for crimes of a sexual nature involving a victim under eighteen years of age, relevant evidence of prior criminal acts, whether charged or uncharged, is admissible for the purpose of corroborating the victim's testimony or demonstrating the defendant's propensity to commit the crime with which he or she is presently charged. The court may exclude relevant evidence of prior criminal acts if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mo. Const. art. I, \u00a7 18(c). This amendment was adopted with the evident purpose of abrogating\n   <em>\n    State v. Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363826\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/239/603/#p607\">\n    239 S.W.3d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607-08 (Mo. banc 2007), and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Williams raises three main points. First, he contends article I, section 18(c), on its face, violates due process. Second, Williams contends the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of his 1996 guilty plea and conviction for first-degree statutory sodomy without first making an express finding that the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice. Finally, Williams contends the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of his prior criminal act because the danger of unfair prejudice from that evidence substantially outweighed its probative value. The Court rejects each of these contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Williams argues article I, section 18(c), on its face, violates due process\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it allows admission of evidence of prior criminal acts in the prosecution's case-in-chief to prove a defendant has the propensity to commit the charged crime. Williams must bear a heavy burden to prevail on this claim because there is \"a strong presumption in favor of [the amendment's] validity.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Washington Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=247%20S.W.%20185\">\n    247 S.W. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (Mo. 1922). Williams can overcome this presumption only by demonstrating the admission of propensity evidence pursuant to the amendment-in any case and under any circumstances-violates due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Not that the law invests the defendant with a presumption of good character, but it simply closes the whole matter of character, disposition and reputation on the prosecution's case-in-chief. The State may not show defendant's prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpetrator of the crime. The inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge. The overriding policy of excluding such evidence, despite its admitted probative value, is the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Michelson v.

Because he claims the circuit court made no such express finding in this case, Williams contends the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of his 1996 conviction. The Court rejects this argument and holds the circuit court is not required to make an express finding of legal relevance before admitting evidence under article I, section 18(c), provided the record reflects a sound basis for the balancing the amendment requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Williams's argument appears to be based on the risk that, without an express\n   finding of legal relevance, there is no assurance the circuit court actually conducted the balancing required by the second sentence of article I, section 18(c). Though the Court shares Williams's concern, the record in this case shows the circuit court admitted the evidence of Williams's prior criminal act only after carefully considering the probative value of-and the risk of unfair prejudice from-that evidence and concluded (albeit implicitly) the latter did not substantially outweigh the former. Nothing in the text of article I, section 18(c) requires more and, as explained in the following section, the record in this case is adequate to permit appellate review of the circuit court's decision to admit this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Williams makes his argument without reference to the text of article I, section 18(c). This is understandable because nothing in the amendment imposes the requirement for an express finding of legal relevance that he seeks. This Court is not free to impose requirements not included in the amendment, either in its express language or by necessary implication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Even though the circuit court is not required to make this finding in so many words, it nevertheless is essential that the evidence meet the balancing test for legal relevance set forth in the second sentence of the amendment. Evidence in the record that the circuit court analyzed relevant factors and engaged in the balancing required under article I, section 18(c) makes it possible for appellate courts to review the circuit court's evidentiary ruling with the level of deference that the \"abuse of discretion\" standard requires. Here, the record shows the circuit court-though it made no express finding of legal relevance before admitting Williams's 1996 guilty plea-carefully considered relevant factors and admitted the evidence only after being convinced its probative value was not substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeMay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498970\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1018/#p1024\">\n    260 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"although the district judge did not discuss the specific factors ..., the record reveals that he exercised his discretion to admit the evidence in a careful and judicious manner\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The state gave Williams notice nearly three weeks before trial that it intended to offer evidence of his 1996 conviction for first-degree statutory sodomy. Williams moved to exclude that evidence, and the circuit court heard argument from the parties. These arguments addressed both the probative value of the evidence (including similarities between and the amount of time between the prior act and the charged) and the danger of unfair prejudice from this evidence. The circuit court considered whether any unfair prejudice could be mitigated by limiting either the extent of the evidence or the manner in which the evidence would be presented. The circuit court ultimately concluded it would permit the state to use the evidence, stating, \"I believe ... that it is a relevant piece of evidence for the jury to hear because it is close enough in time and the charge that he was charged with matches the factual allegations that are contained in the current case.\" The circuit court stated it would \"limit\" the evidence \"to a stipulation of the facts that he has already pled guilty to so that we would not require the victim to come in,\" because \"that would help with not creating a prejudice for Mr. Williams.\" Finally, the circuit court stated it would \"increase the jury pool in this matter so that there will be enough panel members available to be questioned with regards to this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The determination of how much and what kind of probative value particular propensity evidence may have, the nature and extent of the danger of unfair prejudice presented by that evidence, and whether the former is substantially outweighed by the latter, are intensely case-specific questions. The relevant factors to be considered in deciding these questions will vary from case to case, as will the weight to be afforded any one factor in particular. As a result, the factors set forth in this opinion, and the weight given to those factors, are merely illustrative of the legal relevance analysis article I, section 18(c) requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Before propensity evidence can be said to have any probative value, it must be sufficient for the jury to conclude the defendant actually committed the prior criminal act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huddleston v.

In response, the defense argued that Victim was mistaken, that Victim's family misled Victim to believe Williams was abusing her, and that some of Williams's conduct-for example, lying in bed with Victim, touching her, kissing her, and buying her gifts-was innocent and had been misinterpreted by Victim and others. The unique evidentiary challenges presented by this type of case and the defense's attack upon the credibility of the state's witnesses, including Victim, enhanced the probative value of Williams's prior crime evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Probative value, however, is only one side of the scale. The other side is the risk of unfair prejudice. One factor bearing on the prejudicial effect of propensity evidence is whether the jury knows or can fairly infer the defendant was punished for his past criminal acts.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Beechum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"858084\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/582/898/#p914\">\n    582 F.2d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914 (5th Cir. 1978). If the jury is allowed to infer (or, worse, speculate) the defendant escaped punishment in the past, it may be inclined to convict merely to punish the defendant for past criminal acts rather than for the crime charged. But where-as here-the jury knows the defendant was convicted for the past criminal acts, this risk is minimized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The danger of unfair prejudice from propensity evidence also can be a function of the manner in which the state proves the prior criminal act at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p180\">\n    519 U.S. at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p180\">\n    117 S.Ct. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (faced with alternative means of proving prior crimes, one more prejudicial than the other, the \"judge would have to make these [admissibility] calculations with an appreciation of the offering party's need for evidentiary richness and narrative integrity in presenting a case, and the mere fact that two pieces of evidence might go to the same point would not, of course, necessarily mean that only one of them might come in\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Graham, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5259. In the present case, the circuit court might have allowed the state to prove Williams's prior crime by calling his former victim, who then could have described the abuse she suffered at his hands as a young girl. Such testimony, of course, would have increased the danger of unfair prejudice. That danger was minimized, however, because the defense and the state agreed to prove Williams's prior criminal act by way of a short, dispassionate stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Another factor that bears on the danger of unfair prejudice from propensity evidence is whether the evidence of the defendant's prior criminal act eclipses-or is overshadowed by-the evidence of the charged crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Graham, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 5222, 5259 (describing this factor as \"comparative enormity\"). Evidence the defendant previously sexually abused a young child is highly prejudicial in the abstract, but there is far less danger of unfair prejudice from such evidence in a prosecution for sexually molesting a young child than there would be in a prosecution for a less heinous crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lemay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498970\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1018/#p1024\">\n    260 F.3d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]vidence of a defendant's prior acts of molestation will always be emotionally charged and inflammatory, as is the evidence that he committed the charged crimes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, the evidence of Williams's prior criminal act was far less alarming than the evidence of the charged crimes. The jurors knew from the outset it would be their duty to decide whether Williams had committed several highly disturbing crimes against a young child. Over a three-day period, the jurors were confronted with a large amount of graphic evidence, including\n   the Victim's testimony about how Williams forced her to perform a variety of sex acts upon him. Moreover, the jurors were confronted with other evidence that put Williams in a bad light. For example, Victim opined she thought she might have been Williams's favorite stepchild because he did not physically strike her as he struck her other siblings-one of whom, the jury knew, had special needs. Victim also testified Williams threatened to harm her, her siblings, and her dogs if she ever told anyone about the abuse. And Victim also testified Williams said he thought he would have married her, instead of Mother, in another life. In the context of all the evidence, the evidence of Williams's prior criminal act-introduced largely by way of a short, dispassionate stipulation-was not so jarring as to create an unacceptable danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Yet another factor bearing on the prejudicial effect of propensity evidence is the manner in which the state uses the evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Graham, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5259. If the prosecution spends an undue amount of time emphasizing the prior criminal act or flagrantly invites the jury to convict the defendant because he is a \"bad\" or \"wicked\" man rather than because he committed the crime charged, the danger of unfair prejudice from that evidence quickly becomes untenable. On the other hand, if the prosecution spends relatively little time on the issue of a defendant's prior crimes and merely uses the evidence for its proper purpose (namely, to suggest the defendant has a propensity to commit the charged crime), the danger decreases and may-on balance-not be unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Williams argues the danger of unfair prejudice was unacceptably high because the state made his guilty plea the \"touchstone\" of its case. A review of the record, however, shows this was not so. The state devoted comparatively little time to the subject over the three-day trial. In its opening statement, for example, the state merely informed the jury they would encounter a variety of evidence, including Williams's guilty plea. This limited reference was a mere sliver of the state's opening statement. In its case-in-chief, the state read the stipulation to the jury but, as its short text makes clear, the stipulation could not have taken more than a minute to read.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   On direct examination, the state also elicited testimony concerning Williams's prior criminal act from Mother and one of Victim's siblings. These witnesses, however, spent no more than a minute or two on the matter, and their testimony concerning Williams's criminal past was a small part of their entire testimony at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state also published\n   two videotaped interviews in which Victim briefly said she knew Williams was a sex offender. But nothing suggests Victim's references to Williams's criminal past were anything but fleeting. Finally, the state only mentioned Williams's prior conviction twice during its closing argument. The state first argued that, by pleading guilty to a similar criminal act in 1996, Williams essentially admitted to having a propensity to sexually abusing young girls. And the state then argued Williams's propensity for sexually abusing young girls (as shown by his guilty plea) showed he was acting for the purpose of sexual gratification when he committed these same acts against Victim. Again, these short references were only a small part of the state's closing argument. On the record before this Court, it simply cannot be said the state increased the danger of unfair prejudice in this case by unduly emphasizing Williams's prior criminal acts, and at no time did the state implicitly or explicitly invite the jury to engage in improper reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, the evidence concerning Williams's 1996 crime had considerable probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice from that evidence was not great. This Court holds the latter did not substantially outweigh the former and, therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by admitting that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the circuit court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   All concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    All statutory citations refer to RSMo Cum.
