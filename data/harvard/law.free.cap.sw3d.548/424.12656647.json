We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   KCP&amp;L's parent company, Great Plains Energy Services, Inc. (\"GPES\"), contracted with Projectile Tube Cleaning, Inc. (\"Projectile\"), a Pennsylvania company, to clean condenser tubes. The parties signed a Master Servant Agreement (\"Agreement\") which took effect on March 27, 2009. The Agreement set forth the terms and conditions of all service requests by KCP&amp;L and that each service request would be defined by a specific purchase order. The Agreement further stated that Projectile \"agrees and represents that it is an independent contractor and its personnel are not employees or agents of GPES for federal tax purposes or any other purpose whatsoever, and are not entitled to any GPES employee benefits.\" The Agreement stated that Projectile was solely responsible for payment of worker's compensation insurance and claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   KCP&amp;L is in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electricity in western Missouri and eastern Kansas. KCP&amp;L owns and operates a coal fired power plant in La Cygne, Kansas (\"La Cygne Plant\"). The La Cygne Plant produces electrical energy to KCP&amp;L customers by introducing water into condenser boilers. The condensers then heat the water in tubes located on the exterior of the condensers. The water is heated into steam and then transferred to turbines. These turbines power a generator, which creates electricity. Cleaning the condenser tubes involves using high-pressure pumps to shoot a \"scraper,\" a bullet-like object, through the thousands of condenser tubes. Each cleaning of the condenser tubes at the plant takes approximately four days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to contracting with Projectile, KCP&amp;L used its own employees and equipment to clean the condenser tubes at the La Cygne Plant. At some point, KCP&amp;L made the business decision to contract with companies like Projectile to perform condenser tube cleanings at all of their power plants. The condenser tubes at the La Cygne Plant were cleaned one to four times per year over the five years between 2010 and 2014. Barger, an employee of Projectile, had cleaned the condenser tubes at the La Cygne Plant on approximately five prior occasions over several years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 21, 2013, Barger was cleaning the condenser tubes at the La Cygne Plant when a grating on the catwalk on which he was standing fell from under him and he grabbed the grate in front of him to keep from falling, injuring his right wrist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 20, 2013, Barger filed a Workers' Compensation claim with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Workers' Compensation, against Projectile, his employer. On March 12, 2015, Barger filed a petition for damages in the Circuit Court of Jackson County against KCP&amp;L, claiming negligence and\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   in regard to his injury. KCP&amp;L filed an answer, which included the affirmative defense that Barger\n   was a statutory employee of KCP&amp;L under the Missouri Workers' Compensation Law. Chapter 287, RSMo. KCP&amp;L later moved for summary judgment on the basis that Barger was a statutory employee of KCP&amp;L, pursuant to section 287.040.1. After full briefing by both parties, the circuit court granted KCP&amp;L's motion for summary judgment. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court makes its decision to grant summary judgment based on the pleadings, record submitted, and the law; therefore this Court need not defer to the trial court's determination and reviews the grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ITT Commercial Fin.

In his second point on appeal, Barger argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of KCP&amp;L because KCP&amp;L is not a statutory employer since it owned the premises upon which improvements were being made pursuant to section 287.040.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The determination of whether a case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers' Compensation Law is a question of fact that is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.MW Builders, Inc. v.Midkiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8309087\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/222/267/#p269\">\n    222 S.W.3d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (Mo. banc 2007).

In KCP&amp;L's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, KCP&amp;L states that \"[i]t is necessary and essential to the usual operations of KCP&amp;L's business for the condenser tubes to be cleaned regularly.\" Barger controverts this statement in his response to KCP&amp;L, stating that \"[c]ondensers do not need to be cleaned regularly,\" citing to portions of the deposition of a KCP&amp;L Shift Foreman. The condenser tubes were cleaned between one and four times per year and each cleaning took approximately four days. Further in KCP&amp;L's Statement\n   of Uncontroverted Facts, KCP&amp;L states that \"[i]n order for the condensers located at the La Cygne power plant to operate properly, they must be regularly serviced and maintained.\" Barger controverts this statement in his response to KCP&amp;L, stating that \"[c]ondensers do not need to be cleaned regularly.... The tubes are cleaned on an 'as-needed basis,' \" citing to the deposition of a KCP&amp;L Shift Foreman. KCP&amp;L also states in its Statement of Uncontroverted Facts that \"[i]f KCP&amp;L did not contract with a third party, such as Projectile, to provide these services, KCP&amp;L would be required to hire its own employees to service and maintain the condenser tubes.\" Barger controverted this statement in his response to KCP&amp;L, stating \"Projectile's work at KCPL was infrequent and would not require KCP[&amp;]L to hire permanent employees. Projectile's work at La Cygne was scheduled to last only four days when Barger was injured ... Projectile might go to KCP[&amp;]L once or twice a year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It was disputed between the parties if KCP&amp;L still owned the tools necessary to complete the work. KCP&amp;L even acknowledges that it did not own all of the necessary tools. It was disputed between the parties just how specialized this work actually was and the extent to which KCP&amp;L would have to hire permanent employees absent this contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Whether the work done by Barger was performed on a regular basis is material to the determination of whether the work was on a \"regular and frequent schedule.\" Whether KCP&amp;L would have had to hire permanent employees if not for contracting with Projectile is material to the determination of whether \"performance of [the work] without the contract would require the statutory employer to hire permanent employees.\" These controverted facts are material to determining whether the work performed by Barger was in the usual business of KCP&amp;L.
