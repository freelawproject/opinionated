Hess, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   James Scott was found guilty by a City of St. Louis jury of three counts of first-degree robbery and armed criminal action, and one count of second-degree attempted robbery arising out of three separate criminal incidents involving five victims committed within a three-week time period. Scott appeals, asserting the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motion to sever because the offenses charged were not of the same or similar character and were not based on the same act or transaction; (2) overruling his request to impeach one of the victim's credibility with an alleged prior inconsistent statement contained in a police report; and (3) overruling his motions to suppress and objections to his identifications as the robber because the lineups were unduly suggestive. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 28, 2013, A.F. (\"Victim #1\") and his girlfriend, E.M. (\"Victim #2\"), were walking home in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis (the \"CWE\") around 11:00 or 11:30 p.m. when they passed two men on the opposite side of the street. Victims #1 and #2 continued to walk about a half a block when a man behind them told them to stop. Victim #1 turned around and a man approached him with a gun and told Victims #1 and #2 he wanted their money and whatever else they had. The man went through Victim #1's pockets and took $40 from him. Meanwhile, another broad, African-American man wearing a flannel coat and stocking cap with braided hair came up behind Victim #2 and told her not to turn around. He asked her if she had anything in her\n   pockets. She told him she had nothing and offered him her cigarettes and debit card. The man declined, went through her pockets, and found nothing. The men told Victim #1 and #2 to start walking and to not look back. The men then ran away, and Victim #1 heard a car start but neither he nor Victim #2 saw the vehicle. Victims #1 and 2 reported the crimes to the police (\"Incident #1\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two days later, on December 30, 2013, just before midnight, T.S. (\"Victim #3\") and his wife, D.W. (\"Victim #4\"), pulled into a hotel parking lot at the intersection of Grand Avenue and Broadway in St. Louis to get a room for the night. They parked next to a blue SUV and Victim #3 went inside to pay for the room. While inside he saw a large African-American man with braided hair, wearing a flannel coat, exit the hotel. That man then got into the blue SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After paying for a room, Victim #3 returned to the passenger seat of his car and the man from inside the hotel ran up to the front driver's seat with a gun, opened the door, and pulled Victim #4 out of the car. The man told Victim #4 to give him everything, to shut up, and that he would kill her. Meanwhile, another man with a gun ran up to the front passenger seat and told Victim #3 to get out and face the car. The man held a gun to Victim #3's head, repeatedly poked him in the head with it, and told him multiple times he would kill him. Victim #3 told him he did not have to kill him and he could have whatever he wanted. Victim #4 spoke and the man holding her at gunpoint told her to shut up or he would blow her away. The men went through Victim #3 and Victim #4's pockets and took Victim #3's jewelry, phone, and a CD case, and Victim #4's credit cards and a $500 money order. After the men took their belongings they put Victims #3 and #4 in the backseat of the car, told them to keep their hands up, closed the doors, and then got into the blue SUV and drove away. Victims #3 and #4 reported the crimes to the police and the police found and chased the SUV that night but the men got away (\"Incident #2\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nineteen days later, on January 18, 2014, K.T. (\"Victim #5\") was going to a friend's apartment for a party in the CWE. Victim #5 arrived shortly before 7 p.m. and parked her car up the street from her friend's apartment. She noticed people on the sidewalk by her car. All but one man walked away from the direction she planned to walk. That man came back in the same direction she was walking, crossed the street, and followed her. As she approached her friend's apartment the man asked her what time it was. Victim #5 continued to walk but turned her head slightly and said it's about 7:00 p.m. The man then asked her if she had a light and without turning around she said no. The man then put his hand on her left shoulder and held a gun to the right side of her body. The man told her to be quiet and he walked her over to her friend's apartment building. The man faced her against the building and asked her for her money. Victim #5 gave him her cash but the man indicated he was not happy with the amount. The man then turned her around and walked her back the way they came with his hand on her shoulder and the gun at her side. As they walked, Victim #5 repeatedly asked the man to let her go and he told her to be quiet. As they approached the next cross street the man turned Victim #5 towards a blue SUV and opened the passenger door. Victim #5 thought the man would put her in the SUV so she pulled back. When she did, the man stepped back from her and told her that if she gave him her purse she could leave. Victim #5 did not have a purse but she offered him her tote bag filled with food\n   and craft supplies she had for the party. The man refused and told her to run. Victim #5 ran to her friend's apartment and reported the crime to the police (\"Incident #3\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Within two days, the police identified a vehicle captured on video surveillance in the CWE matching the description of the vehicle given by Victims #3, #4, and #5. Further investigation revealed the vehicle's license plate number was registered to an address in O'Fallon, Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 20, 2014, the police went to the address in O'Fallon, Missouri and learned that the vehicle belonged to Michele Scott, Scott's wife. Scott's wife told the police that her husband had been driving her vehicle the past few weeks and told the police where the vehicle might be located. The vehicle-a blue 1994 Chevy Suburban with a tan interior (the \"Suburban\")-was found and taken into police custody. Scott's wife gave the police consent to search the Suburban. Inside the police found a CD case. A warrant was placed for Scott's arrest and it was determined Scott was at his mother's home. The police went to Scott's mother's home and he was arrested. Scott's mother gave the police permission to search her home and inside the police found a flannel coat on the living room floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police contacted Victims #3, #4, and #5 and asked them to come to the police station to see if they could identify the Suburban as the vehicle used in the crimes perpetrated against them. Victims #3, #4, and #5 all identified the Suburban. Victim #3 also identified the CD case found in the Suburban as the CD case stolen from him on December 30, 2013. The police then asked Victims #3 and #4 to view a photographic lineup containing six men. Victims #3 and #4 both identified Scott as the man who robbed them on December 30, 2013. The police then showed Victims #3 and #4 a live lineup containing four men. Victims #3 and #4 again identified Scott as the man who robbed them on December 30, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Victim #5 was also asked to view the live lineup. Upon her first viewing, Victim #5 identified no one but she was unsure about one person so she asked to view the lineup again. During the second viewing, she identified Scott as the man who robbed her on January 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The police called Victims #1 and #2 to see if they could come to the station and view the lineup, but they were at work and unable to leave so the police emailed them a photograph lineup containing the four men from the live lineup and asked them if they recognized anyone. Victims #1 and #2 both identified Scott as the man who robbed them on December 28, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 17, 2014, a grand jury indicted Scott on eighteen counts related to five criminal incidents occurring between December 17, 2013, and January 18, 2014. On September 26, 2014, an information in lieu of an indictment was filed charging Scott with the same eighteen counts filed in the indictment. On August 17, 2016, Scott filed a motion to suppress identification arguing that any out-of-court identification of him was inherently suggestive and conducive to mistaken identification, and a motion for severance of offenses, arguing that the offenses were improperly joined and that Scott would suffer prejudice if the offenses were not severed. On September 26, 2016, the State filed a memorandum of nolle prosequi as to six counts unrelated to Incidents #1, #2, and #3. That same day a seconded amended information in lieu of an indictment was filed charging Scott with twelve counts. Specifically, the State charged Scott with one count of first-degree robbery, one count of attempted first-degree robbery, and two counts of armed criminal action for the crimes that occurred\n   against Victims #1 and #2 on December 28, 2013; two counts of first-degree robbery and two counts of armed criminal action for the crimes against Victims #3 and #4 on December 30, 2014; and one count of first-degree robbery, one count of kidnapping, and two counts of armed criminal action for the crimes against Victim #5 on January 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, the jury heard testimony from six police officers and the executive director of the CWE Neighborhood Security Initiative detailing the investigation that lead to Scott's arrest and the relevant charges. Scott's wife also testified Scott had driven the Suburban from December 28, 2013, to January 18, 2014, and that she gave the police permission to search the Suburban. Victims #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 (collectively the \"Victims\") testified regarding their participation in the investigation. Victim #1 and #2 identified Scott as the man who robbed them on December 28, 2014. Victim #1 identified the flannel coat found at Scott's mom's house as the coat Scott was wearing when he robbed him. Victim #3 and #4 identified Scott as the man who robbed them on December 30, 2014. Victim #3 and #4 identified the Suburban as the vehicle used during the robbery. Victim #3 and #4 identified the flannel coat as the coat Scott was wearing during the robbery. Victim #3 and #4 identified the CD case as the one taken from them. Victim #5 identified the Suburban as the vehicle used in the crimes against her on January 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The jury found Scott not guilty of first-degree robbery, attempted first-degree robbery, and two counts of armed criminal action for the crimes charged related to Incident #1, but found Scott guilty of the lesser-included offense of one count of an attempt to commit second-degree robbery. For the crimes charged associated with Incident #2, the jury found Scott guilty of two counts of first-degree robbery and two counts of armed criminal action. For the crimes charged corresponding to Incident #3, the jury found Scott guilty of one count of first-degree robbery and one count of armed criminal action, but not guilty of one count of kidnapping and armed criminal action. Scott filed a motion for acquittal notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative, a motion for a new trial. That motion was denied. The court sentenced Scott, a prior offender, to seven years' imprisonment for attempt to commit second-degree robbery and to life imprisonment on all other counts, resulting in three consecutive life sentences.

Joinder and Severance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In point I, Scott contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the counts for the crimes charged on December 28th, December 30th, and January 18th because the offenses were not of the same or similar character and were not a part of a common scheme or plan. In support, Scott points out these differences between the crimes: 1) the crimes on December 28th and 30th involved two robbers and two victims while the crimes on January 18th involved only one robber and one victim; 2) the robbery on January 18th\n   involved an alleged kidnapping while the other robberies did not; 3) the December 28th and January 18th crimes occurred in the CWE but the December 30th crime occurred at Broadway and Grand Avenue outside of the CWE; and 4) the crime on January 18th was nearly three weeks apart from the crimes on December 28th and December 30th.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State contends there was no trial court error because the three robberies were of the same or similar character and Scott failed to show he was substantially prejudiced as a result of the charges being tried together. In support, the State relies on these similarities: 1) all three charged incidents involved a robbery at night in which the Victims were in transit in public areas, were threatened with a gun, and ordered to hand over their valuables; 2) the first two robberies were two days apart and Scott was wearing the same flannel coat; 3) Scott used the same vehicle in the second and third incidents; 4) the first and third incidents occurred in the CWE; and 5) all three robberies occurred within three weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Claims of improper joinder and failure to sever charges involve a two-step analysis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with three counts of first-degree robbery, one count of first-degree attempted robbery, one count of first-degree assault, and one count of armed criminal action arising out of three separate incidents occurring in the City of St. Louis. The first incident occurred around 10:30 p.m. when victim #1 was parked in front of Steak &amp; Shake.

Joinder in this case was permissible as the offenses were \"of the same or similar character,\" and while unnecessary to our decision, we find this especially true given the \"connection\" between the evidence establishing Scott's guilt obtained after Scott committed the crimes on January 18th. Because of the surveillance video in the CWE the police were able to identify the Suburban Scott used in that crime. This was identified by Victims #3, #4, and #5 as the vehicle used in the crimes on December 30th and January 18th, and it could have been the vehicle Scott and his accomplice drove off in on December 28th. The identification of this vehicle was the breakthrough evidence in all three incidents as it led to the police locating Scott and arresting him, which resulted in his pretrial identification as the robber by all Victims. The vehicle also led to the discovery of the flannel coat Victims #1, #3, and #4 testified was the coat worn by Scott during the robberies on December 28th and December 30th, and to the CD case identified by Victims #3 and #4 as the CD case stolen from them on December 30th.

Specifically, Scott contends he should have been able to cross-examine Victim #4, who identified Scott as her robber at trial, regarding her alleged statement that \"[s]he did not get a good look at him\" that was contained in the police report. The State argues there was no abuse of discretion because Scott failed to establish a sufficient foundation for its admission and failed to show how he was prejudiced.

Scott failed to lay an adequate foundation to impeach Victim #4. In his offer of proof, Scott asked Victim #4 if she remembered speaking to the police the night of the robbery and to read the statement that \"[s]he did not get a good look at him,\" but Scott never asked Victim #4 if she made the statement and did not establish the precise circumstances under which it was made.

While Scott did ask if the police officer was lying after Victim #4 read the statement, the court informed Scott this was not a proper question and Scott's only remaining question to Victim #4 was whether she accurately read the statement. When Victim #4 responded that she had, Scott indicated he had nothing further. Without a question before her, Victim #4 said, \"I didn't say it,\" but this did not cure Scott's failure to lay an adequate foundation and Scott did not question Victim #4 further or give her a chance to present a complete picture of her credibility by explaining any inconsistency. Rather, Scott again told the court he had nothing further of this witness. Thus, Scott did not lay an adequate foundation to impeach Victim #4.

Identifications of Scott as the Robber\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In point III, Scott avers the trial court clearly erred in overruling his motions to suppress evidence of the Victims' pretrial identifications of him as the robber and abused its discretion in overruling his objections to identification of him at trial because the photographic and physical lineups were impermissibly suggestive. Specifically, Scott argues the lineups were impermissibly suggestive because he was the heaviest person in the lineups, wore different clothing from the other participants, and his photograph had a lighter background than the others. The State contends that this issue has not been properly preserved for appellate review because Scott did not object at trial to the pretrial or in-trial identifications of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When a motion to suppress is denied and the evidence is subsequently offered at trial, an objection must be made at trial to the admission of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.
