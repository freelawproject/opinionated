PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 37.09 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, with the sentence suspended and community supervision imposed for ten years. Stahmann raises seventeen issues on appeal, arguing that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; (2) the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash part of the indictment; (3) the trial court erred in denying certain jury charge instructions; (4) his conviction was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel; and (5) the prosecutor made improper arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We find insufficient evidence to support the tampering conviction, but sufficient evidence to support a conviction for attempted tampering with physical evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises from a two-vehicle collision on State Highway 46 outside of New Braunfels. Norberto Gonzalez testified that he was driving his SUV with his wife and son as passengers, on July 1, 2012 at around 4:30 p.m., when he saw a van approaching from the opposite direction. Gonzalez testified that he saw the van \"starting to turn toward us, and I'm thinking maybe he sees me; he'll stop. But he kept going, and we hit each other.\" Gonzalez stated the van did not have its turn signal activated. He testified he was driving around fifty miles per hour at the time, that it had been raining earlier in the day, and that the van was slowing down as it started to turn. After the collision, Gonzalez remembered the SUV spinning around and the air bag deploying. He saw blood on the windshield of the van and on the face of its driver. On cross-examination, Gonzalez stated that there was a housing subdivision off to the side of the road, into which it appeared the van was turning. He conceded that he had not told police that\n   the van did not have its turn signal activated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two bystanders, Ronnie Ballard and Michael Freeman, arrived at the scene and called 911. Ballard testified that he saw two people inside the van. When Ballard approached the van, the driver-whom Ballard identified as Stahmann-exited. Stahmann was bleeding from his forehead, was \"very upset\" and \"agitated,\" and \"was complaining he couldn't see out of one eye.\" Ballard testified that he was about ten or fifteen feet away from Stahmann when he observed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The driver walked towards the fence that was-there was a gated fence right near the accident scene. At that time, I saw him throw something over the-over the fence into-near a tree into some small, you know, kind of shrubbery at the bottom of that tree. It looked like-looked to be, like, a prescription medicine bottle.... [A]s I walked over towards to see-you know, kind of get a better look to see, you know, where the bottle had went, he started asking me what I was doing over there, what was I looking for, why am I over there. You know, he was angry.... [H]e wanted us to call his dad. He kept asking to leave and go-he said, I just live right up-my dad lives right up the street. I need to go see him. I need to leave here. And we just kept asking [sic] him, No. You need to stay until somebody arrives on the scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ballard also stated that, when he and Freeman came upon the scene, he saw opened beer cans inside the van, and he noticed that a couple of the cans had fallen out of the van. He stated that Stahmann seemed \"disheveled from the accident\" but otherwise did not appear confused or disoriented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Freeman testified that Stahmann did appear confused and disoriented and was \"bleeding real bad\" from his head. Freeman tried calling Stahmann's father, at Stahmann's request, but there was no answer. Freeman corroborated Ballard's account that Stahmann threw what appeared to be a prescription medication bottle over the wire fence next to the accident scene. Freeman stated that, as he and Ballard were walking away from where the pill bottle was, Stahmann \"got real nervous and started questioning us, why we were over there and what were we looking for.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Terry Aikman, a retired paramedic, was passing by the accident scene and stopped to give assistance. He testified that Stahmann had a large gash over his left eye and was bleeding profusely. According to Aikman, Stahmann did not appear intoxicated but seemed to be \"unaware of his situation\" due to shock. He stated that, pursuant to his training, he asked Stahmann four questions to test whether he was \"alert and oriented\"-\"the president, the day, the month, what year\"-and that Stahmann answered all of the questions correctly, indicating that \"he's aware of his surroundings\" even though he was in pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Ballard and Freeman, when police arrived, they advised officers that they saw Stahmann throw something over the fence, and they pointed out where it was. Police were able to retrieve the item that was thrown over the fence-an ordinary orange prescription medication bottle with a label and a white cap. The officer who retrieved the bottle stated that it was sitting on top of the grass on the other side of the fence. The bottle contained four intact white tablets along with several broken ones and some powder. The label on the bottle stated the name \"James Castaneda\" and listed its contents as \"promethazine tab 25 mg.\" A Department of Public Safety chemist tested the pills and determined that they contained promethazine, a prescription cough suppressant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The chemist testified that promethazine is classified as a \"dangerous drug\" and that it is illegal to possess it without a prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury charge included instructions on the offenses of tampering with physical evidence and attempted tampering with physical evidence. The jury found Stahmann guilty of the former offense and, pursuant to the charge instructions, did not answer the question regarding the latter offense. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Evidentiary Sufficiency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By his first issue on appeal, Stahmann argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for tampering with physical evidence. By his second issue, he contends that the trial court erred by denying the motion for instructed verdict he filed at the close of evidence. We address the issues together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDuff v.

App.-Dallas July 21, 2006, pet. ref'd) (not designated for publication), in arguing that it was reasonable for the jury to infer that this \"alteration\" was caused by Stahmann throwing the bottle over the fence and onto the ground. In\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , the appellant threw two plastic baggies out of his window as he was being pursued for a traffic violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Police later recovered the baggies, which were ripped but still contained a measurable amount of cocaine and marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Dallas Court of Appeals held that there was sufficient evidence to show that appellant \"altered\" the baggies because, even though there was no evidence as to the appearance of the baggies prior to the time they were thrown out of the car window, the jury could rationally infer that the rips in the bags were caused by appellant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State contends that, as in\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , the jury in this case could have reasonably inferred that Stahmann altered the pill bottle from evidence that (1) he threw the bottle over the fence, (2) it had been raining earlier in the day, and (3) some of the text printed on the label had been smudged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. There was no evidence\n   indicating what the bottle looked like prior to the time Stahmann threw it over the fence, and although the evidence established that it had been raining earlier in the day, there was nothing showing that the area where the pill bottle was recovered was wet or that Stahmann's throw could have otherwise caused the smudges. For the jury to conclude from the evidence that Stahmann altered the bottle would therefore be an unreasonable inference, amounting to no more than mere speculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

It was reasonable for the jury in\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   to have inferred that the rips in the bags were caused when the appellant threw them out of his car window, because it is reasonable to assume that the appellant would not have been carrying his drugs around in already-ripped bags. Here, there is no similar reason for the jury to have assumed that the pill bottle's label was intact-that is, that it had no tears or smudging-prior to the time it was thrown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, we consider whether there was sufficient evidence that Stahmann concealed the pill bottle.

He was initially placed on five years' deferred-adjudication community supervision, but the State moved for adjudication of guilt in 2014. The State alleged in its motion to adjudicate that Stahmann violated the terms of his community supervision in sixteen different ways-four of which correspond precisely to the four charges brought in the instant case. The 274th District Court found three of the allegations not true, and it found the remaining allegations true. The court therefore adjudicated Stahmann guilty of credit card or debit card abuse and sentenced him to two years' confinement and a fine of $1,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   One of the allegations which the 274th District Court found not true was that Stahmann committed intoxication assault against Gonzalez on July 1, 2012.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   By his seventh issue, Stahmann argues that the trial court erred by denying his request for a limiting instruction after Koepp, the deputy sheriff who responded to the scene of the accident, testified at trial that in a case like this, he would typically investigate if the driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. By his eighth issue, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for a limiting instruction \"on intoxication.\" By his ninth and tenth issues, he contends the trial court erred by denying his requests for instructions in the jury charge that the \"offense\" which he allegedly knew was committed under penal code subsection 37.09(d)(1) \"cannot be related\n   to intoxication.\" By his eleventh and twelfth issues, he contends that his convictions violated the United States and Texas Constitutions on grounds of double jeopardy, collateral estoppel, and issue preclusion. These issues each stem from Stahmann's contention that, due to the 274th District Court's ruling in the credit card or debit card abuse case, collateral estoppel bars relitigation of the issue of whether he was intoxicated at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We disagree with that contention. In the credit card or debit card abuse proceeding, the allegation determined to be \"not true\" was that Stahmann had committed intoxication assault against Gonzalez on July 1, 2012. One of the elements of this offense is that the person was intoxicated, but that is not the only element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 49.07(a)(1) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.) (\"A person commits an offense if the person, by accident or mistake ... while operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, by reason of that intoxication causes serious bodily injury to another....\"). Therefore, a \"not true\" finding on an intoxication assault allegation does not necessary imply a finding that the person was not intoxicated. And though the 274th District Court made remarks indicating that it did not believe Stahmann was intoxicated, the court explicitly refused to make formal findings of fact on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Even assuming that 274th District Court \"necessarily decided\" that Stahmann was not intoxicated, that is not an element of tampering with physical evidence, which was the only offense charged to the jury in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364876\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/239/791/#p794\">\n    239 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   794 ;\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313476\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/101/434/#p441\">\n    101 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   441 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Knowledge that an \"offense\" was committed is an element under penal code subsection 37.09(d)(1), but the jury could have found this element from the evidence without finding that Stahmann was intoxicated. For example, the evidence amply supported a finding that Stahmann knew that a traffic violation had been committed, or that the offense of possessing a dangerous drug without a prescription had been committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

As to both remarks, the prosecutor was referring back to earlier comments he had made during jury selection-which were not objected to-regarding the role of a defense attorney to zealously represent his client. The comments did not inject new or harmful facts to the case, nor were they so extreme or improper as to deprive Stahmann of a fair and impartial trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 270 S.W.3d at 573 n.3.

He told you that if a person illegally obtained pills and then flushed them down the toilet, that's not tampering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   But you've seen the law. That's not true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   You were also told about another hypothetical where, if a person committed a bank robbery and hid the money in the mattress, that's not tampering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   You've seen the law.

From our examination of the record, it is apparent that the prosecutor was attempting to rebut arguments previously raised by defense counsel that police had not tested the \"white powder\" contained in the pill bottle and had not taken photographs of the pill bottle. By claiming that such concerns were \"presented to [the jury] in a way that's not necessarily the truth,\" the prosecutor was disputing defense counsel's theory of the case; he was not impugning counsel's character. Stahmann's fifteenth and sixteenth issues are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    4. \"Rabbit Trail\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   By his seventeenth issue, Stahmann objects to the following remarks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   [Prosecutor]: So let's start off, from the beginning, what they want you to believe. They want you to believe that he was in shock and that he-this was some sort of act done because he didn't know it was going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   But you heard from a trained, 24-year veteran EMT that he was alert and oriented times four. He knew the answers to four critical questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   He might have been in shock. He might have had a head wound to his head, but he knew exactly what was going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   You heard from Mr. Ballard, who spoke with him. Mr. Ballard told you-all he knew exactly what was going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   So the inference that he had some sort of concussion, he was in shock, is just not there in the evidence. But, once again, it's going down a rabbit trail that they want you to look at instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Excuse me, Judge, just one more time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   The rabbit-I object to the rabbit trail inference. There's a specific case called Mosley vs. State that says that is improper argument. I object to that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The trial court sustained defense counsel's objection to this argument and instructed the jury to disregard it, but the court overruled counsel's motion for mistrial. On appeal, Stahmann argues that these arguments\n   impermissibly struck at him over the shoulders of counsel and that a mistrial was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Again, we disagree. A mistrial is an appropriate remedy only in \"extreme circumstances\" for a narrow class of highly prejudicial and incurable errors.\n   <em>\n    Ocon v.
