However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment is affirmed pursuant to Rule 84.16(b). Respondent's prayer for damages is granted in the amount of $5,000. Appellant's Motion for Sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
