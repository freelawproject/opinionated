WORTHEN, Chief Justice.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Wasson Interests, Ltd. (Wasson), appeals from a summary judgment granted in favor of the City of Jacksonville, based on governmental immunity. In two issues, Wasson contends that the trial court erred in granting both a traditional and a no evidence summary judgment in favor of the City. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wasson is a successor in interest to a ninety-nine year lease covering property located on Lake Jacksonville, which specifies the property is to be used for residential purposes only. James and Stacy Wasson previously lived on the property, but after relocating to Tyler, they conveyed their interest to Wasson. Wasson rented the property to others for terms of a week or less. In response, the City sent an eviction notice, notifying Wasson that its short term rentals constituted a commercial use of the property, which is a violation of the lease. The City and Wasson entered into a reinstatement agreement that specified the property's acceptable uses under the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City later sent a second eviction notice based on Wasson's continued commercial use of the property. The notice informed Wasson that its use of the property was a violation of the reinstatement agreement. Wasson filed suit, alleging that the City breached the lease by improperly terminating the lease and evicting Wasson. Wasson also sought injunctive and declaratory relief. Following extensive discovery, the City filed a combined motion for a traditional and a no evidence summary judgment. Among other things, the City claimed in the motion that it retained governmental immunity, and consequently, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the suit. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment without stating a reason. This appeal followed, with Wasson attacking the summary judgment on both traditional and no evidence grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its first issue, Wasson argues that the trial court erred when it granted the City's\n   motion for traditional summary judgment. Specifically, Wasson contends that the City's governmental immunity has been waived, thereby providing the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to a court's power to decide a case.\n   <em>\n    Bland Indep.
