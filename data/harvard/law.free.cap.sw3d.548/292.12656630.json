She observed Perry backing his truck out of his driveway and began to follow him. While following him, the officer radioed dispatch to verify Perry's driving status. Based on a previous conversation with another officer, she believed Perry was driving with a suspended driver's license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dispatch was unable to give her a definitive answer to Perry's driving status before he pulled into the driveway of his fianc\u00e9's house. The officer stopped her vehicle in the street near the end of the driveway but did not block Perry's truck. She then approached Perry, and the following exchange took place, as recounted at the suppression hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Prosecutor: What did you say first, exactly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer: [\"]Hey, Joe, can I talk to you?\" And then, \"Joe, do you have a valid driver's license?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Prosecutor: Okay, did Joe reply to you in any way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer: He said, \"Sure.\" And I asked if I could see his driver's license, and he got it out of his wallet. I do believe Joe did say that he was not suspended. 'Cause I said, \"Joe, do you have a valid driver's license? I believe you're suspended?\" And he goes, \"I'm not suspended.\" And I said, \"Well do you have your driver's license on you and can I see it?\" he said, \"Sure,\" and he reached in his back pocket and got it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Prosecutor: [W]ould someone producing a valid license end your inquiry into suspicion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer: Oh, no.

And I said, \"Hey, Joe, come here for a minute.\" And he goes, \"I got to get this bike out of the back of my truck.\" And with a clenched fist he reached up and grabbed this child's bike out of the back of the truck and then set it down.

After clearing the fence, Perry saw a sheriff's vehicle and surrendered himself. A plastic bag containing methamphetamine was found in a hollowed-out post where Perry climbed over the chain-link fence. Perry was charged with one count of possession of a controlled\n   substance with intent to distribute. Prior to trial, Perry moved to suppress the methamphetamine. The circuit court overruled his motions, and the jury found him guilty of the lesser-included offense of possession of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, when the circuit court asked for a recommended sentence, the prosecutor stated, \"The range of punishment in this case enhanced to the B range is 5 to 15 years in the Department of Corrections.\" After the prosecutor recommend an eight-year sentence, the following colloquy occurred while reviewing the sentencing assessment report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court: I did want to note one thing.... It looks like the offense says, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. That is not what he was convicted of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Prosecutor: It was not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court: He was convicted of possession of a controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Prosecutor: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court: But he has the enhanced range of penalties which are-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Prosecutor: It still is 5 to 15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court:-5 to 15, it was just wrong on t[he offense]. Does that sounds [sic] right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Defense Counsel: That's correct, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The circuit court sentenced Perry to eight years' imprisonment, the prosecutor's recommended sentence.

Without a license, he argues, a reasonable person is less likely to believe he can simply terminate a police encounter. But surrendering one's license to law enforcement does not necessarily amount to a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. Generally, \"even when officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual,\" police officers may ask questions of that individual or ask to examine the individual's identification \"as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required.\"\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p434\">\n    501 U.S. at 434-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p434\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Indeed, the manner in which the officer requested to see Perry's license did not convey a message that his compliance was required.

At the suppression hearing, the officer testified she did not activate the lights before she exited her vehicle. When she first approached Perry, she said, \"Hey Joe, can I talk to you?\" She then asked, \"Joe, do you have a valid driver's license? I believe you're suspended.\" Perry responded he was not suspended. The officer then asked, \"Well do you have your driver's license on you and can I see it?\" Perry said, \"Sure,\" reached into his back pocket, pulled out his license out of his wallet, and handed it to the officer. The record, therefore, reflects the officer did not demand Perry's license.

Only at this point did the officer issue the first of several commands (\"come here for a minute\"), but Perry \"just kept ignoring [her] and kept trying to put distance between\" the two. The officer once again commanded Perry to \"come here for a minute,\" but he \"threw the bike down and took off running.\" The officer pursued Perry on foot, ordering him to \"stop running,\" another command Perry ignored. The officer had not finished checking his license and, therefore, did not have an opportunity to return it to Perry before his suspicious behavior commenced. This is consistent with the officer's testimony that Perry was free to leave until she observed him suspiciously taking the bag out of his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Given the totality of the circumstances, Perry's initial encounter with the officer when she requested his license was consensual in nature. When the officer actually required Perry to do something, he freely ignored her commands. At no point during the entire encounter did the officer seize Perry. Therefore, the Fourth Amendment was not implicated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p554\">\n    446 U.S. at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p554\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Only when [restraint on a person's freedom of movement] is imposed is there any foundation whatever for invoking constitutional safeguards.\");\n   <em>\n    Lammers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823828\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/624/#p631\">\n    479 S.W.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in overruling Perry's motions to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Perry next argues he was sentenced \"under a materially false belief\" regarding the applicable enhanced range of punishment because the circuit court \"held the mistaken belief that the range of punishment\" for Perry, as a persistent offender, was between five and 15 years' imprisonment when he \"could have actually received a minimum sentence of up to one year in the county jail or incarceration in the Department of Corrections for a term less than five years.\" Perry is correct that the range of punishment was misstated at the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Perry was convicted of a class C felony and found to be a persistent offender. The ordinary range of punishment for a class C felony is one year in the county jail up to a maximum of seven years in the Department of Corrections, and five to 15 years in the Department of Corrections for a class B felony. Section 558.011.1(2), . 2, RSMo Supp. 2013. At the time of sentencing, only the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   sentence increased for a persistent offender, while the minimum sentence was unaffected-e.g., a persistent offender convicted of a class C felony was subject to a range consisting of the minimum sentence for a class C felony and the maximum sentence for a class B felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 558.016.7(3), RSMo Supp. 2013;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

As such, Perry was subject to a sentencing range of one year in the county jail to 15 years in the Department of Corrections, not a range of five to 15 years in the Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Perry concedes this argument is not preserved for review because he failed to object at the sentencing hearing. Nevertheless, he requests this Court review his sentence for plain error. \"Any issue that was not preserved at trial can only be reviewed for plain error, which requires a finding that manifest injustice or a miscarriage of justice has resulted from the trial court error.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While the range of punishment was misstated at the sentencing hearing, Perry, who \"bears the burden of establishing manifest injustice,\" as \"determined by the facts and circumstances of the case,\" has failed to meet his burden.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As this Court explained in the companion case of\n   <em>\n    State v. Pierce\n   </em>\n   , No. SC96095, --- S.W.3d ---- (Mo. banc 2018), also handed down this date, under plain-error review, it is not enough for Perry to show the circuit court\n   <em>\n    held\n   </em>\n   a mistaken belief with respect to the range of punishment. Rather, Perry must establish the circuit court imposed the eight-year sentence\n   <em>\n    based\n   </em>\n   on that mistaken belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Perry has failed to establish the circuit court imposed sentence based on a mistaken belief. The circuit court did not sentence Perry to the misstated minimum sentence; instead, it sentenced him to an even longer sentence. Indeed, the eight-year sentence was precisely what the prosecutor recommended:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Your Honor, this case was originally charged as possession with intent with prior and persistent. He was facing 10 to life on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The jury found him guilty of the lesser included of the Class C felony of possession. It's methamphetamine. The defendant has several felonies in the past. The range of punishment in this case enhanced to the B range is 5 to 15 years in the Department of Corrections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   I believe that Mr. Perry's actions indicate that he's not a candidate for probation. His history indicates the same. And although I'm not asking for a maximum sentence either, there should be some benefit to winning part of the trial, which is that he didn't face a range of 10 to life. And so I am going to recommend that the Court impose a period of 8 years in the Department of Corrections and order that be executed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   , Perry has failed to make a case-specific showing that he was sentenced based on the circuit court's mistaken belief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baxter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8448116\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/204/650/#p652\">\n    204 S.W.3d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I respectfully dissent, however, from the principal opinion's holding that the circuit did not err in sentencing Mr. Perry based on a mistaken belief as to the range of punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The principal opinion acknowledges the circuit court misunderstood the applicable sentencing range. Nevertheless, it faults\n   Mr. Perry for failing to establish the circuit court imposed his sentence based on a mistaken belief and points to the fact the circuit court did not sentence him to the misstated minimum punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   But as stated in my separate opinion in the case of\n   <em>\n    State v. Pierce\n   </em>\n   , No. SC96095, --- S.W.3d ---- (Mo. banc 2018), also handed down this date, Missouri courts have repeatedly held plain error results when a sentence is imposed by a circuit court that has expressly misstated the range of punishment on the record. Here, the circuit court expressly misstated, on the record, the range of punishment as five to 15 years in the department of corrections. Pursuant to section 558.011.1(1), RSMo Supp. 2013, Mr. Perry's enhanced range of punishment, as a prior and persistent offender, was one year in the county jail to 15 years in the department of corrections. The record, therefore, reflects the circuit court was under a mistaken belief as to the applicable enhanced sentencing range when it imposed Mr. Perry's eight-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   That Mr. Perry was not sentenced to the misstated minimum sentence is of no consequence. This Court reasoned in\n   <em>\n    Wraggs v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9956735\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/549/881/#p884\">\n    549 S.W.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884 (Mo. banc 1977), \"The pertinent question is whether the sentence was predicated on misinformation; whether the sentence\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     might have been different\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   if the sentencing judge had known that at least two of appellant's previous convictions had been illegally obtained.\" (Emphasis added). Knowing the correct range of punishment is necessarily a predicate to imposing any sentence, and sentencing a defendant when mistaken as to that applicable range inherently affects the sentencing process and might lead to a different sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Due process prohibits a sentencing court from imposing a sentence based on a materially false foundation such as the applicable range of punishment and entitles a defendant to \"reconsideration of the question of punishment in light of the true facts, regardless of the eventual outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9956735\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/549/881/#p884\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The principal opinion ignores these due process considerations and places on the defendant the nearly impossible burden of establishing he or she was sentenced solely on a mistaken belief as to the applicable sentencing range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Consequently, I would hold Mr. Perry's sentence was based on a materially false foundation because the circuit court was wrong as to the correct enhanced range of punishment. Imposing sentence upon a mistaken belief as to the range of punishment is manifestly unjust and results in plain error. I, therefore, would vacate Mr. Perry's sentence and remand the case for resentencing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
