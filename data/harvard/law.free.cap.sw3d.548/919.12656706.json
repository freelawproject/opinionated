He has been assigned by the Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court to participate in this decision as a senior judge.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   PER CURIAM:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Henry County, Appellant Laura Strotkamp was found guilty of endangering the welfare of a child in the first degree, in violation of \u00a7 568.045, RSMo. The charges stemmed from Strotkamp's failure to obtain medical care for her fourteen-year-old son, for injuries he suffered as a result of abuse by his stepfather. Strotkamp appeals, arguing that the State presented insufficient evidence at trial that she knowingly created a substantial risk to her son's life, body or health. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
