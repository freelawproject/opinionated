In four issues, Carreon argues that the trial court abused its discretion by revoking community supervision on the grounds that: (1) the evidence does not establish one of the alleged violations; (2) the evidence establishes that Carreon lacks the ability to pay; (3) the community supervision terms contained contrary provisions ordering Carreon to both support his family with his earnings and requiring him to spend all his earnings to pay restitution, fines, fees, and costs; and (4) the trial court was biased. We reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 17, 2006, pursuant to a guilty plea, the trial court convicted Carreon on two counts of burglary of a habitation, both second degree felonies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 30.02(c)(2) (West, Westlaw\n   through 2017 1st C.S.). On the only count that is the subject of this appeal, the trial court sentenced Carreon to ten years' confinement, suspended the sentence, and placed Carreon on community supervision for ten years. The judgment ordered Carreon to pay $23,107.36 in restitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   $347.00 in court costs, and a $750.00 fine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 24, 2016, the State moved to revoke Carreon's community supervision, alleging that Carreon violated four community supervision terms by failing to pay $3,223.00 in monthly community supervision fees, $30.00 in court costs, a $750.00 fine, and a delinquent sum of $23,709.36 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the initial hearing on the motion to revoke, Carreon's counsel asserted that he lacked the ability to pay the restitution. The State recommended that Carreon be confined for two years, to which the trial court responded, \"That's not going to happen either. That's ridiculous, okay? I wouldn't even accept that plea bargain, okay? Give the minimum because it's the minimum. That's ridiculous. Now you know where I am. Either go to trial or go to trial. That's pretty much it.\" The motion was set for an evidentiary hearing the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, the State moved to dismiss the motion to revoke because it believed that it lacked sufficient evidence. Specifically, the State asserted that it lacked evidence of the considerations outlined in article 42.037(h) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.037(h) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). Despite the State's concession regarding its lack of evidence, the trial court denied the State's motion to dismiss the motion to revoke, responding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Okay. So when-please make that record because if the victim comes back at me for the State's failure to even try the case, I will show that record to the victim and say, [t]alk to your DA because the State is failing to even try the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I'm not dismissing it. I'm going to make you go to trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   That's all I can tell you. Now, do your job. Now, I can't make you call witnesses, but I can certainly make you go to trial and I'm not dismissing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Having no choice, the State called Carreon's current and previous probation officers, Crystal Garcia and Anna Lisa Sanchez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   respectively. The State did not call any other witnesses, such as the complainant to whom restitution was owed. Carreon called himself and his wife, Erica Carreon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Garcia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Garcia recounted that during Carreon's ten-year supervisory period, he was not arrested, he tested negative for drugs, and he attended the mandatory monthly meetings or timely rescheduled them. Garcia testified that the accounting department in\n   the probation office determined how Carreon's restitution payments were credited as between the underlying burglary conviction and the other burglary conviction. As a result of the accounting department's allocations, Carreon paid all of the restitution ordered in the conviction stemming from the other count. On the other hand, Carreon paid no money towards restitution in the underlying conviction from 2007 through 2010. With the exception of 2016, Carreon's payments towards restitution in the underlying conviction in the other years were minimal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2016, with the help of family and after being jailed for failure to pay restitution, Carreon paid $2,166.00. Garcia could not explain why the accounting department in the probation office credited Carreon's restitution payments as it did. On examination by the trial court, Garcia admitted that she failed in her duties by not creating a monthly budget for Carreon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Carreon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Carreon testified he was placed on community supervision at eighteen years old, and he had not previously worked. Carreon had no car, and he, Erica, and their infant son lived with Erica's parents in a three-bedroom trailer. Carreon's first job out of jail was selling newspaper subscriptions door-to-door. It paid on commission, and it allowed Carreon to work only three hours in the evening. Carreon's earnings were approximately $150.00 every two weeks and his supervisor, who drove him to work, eventually stopped transporting him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the subscription sales job, Carreon enrolled in a government program that matched probationers with employers. He worked at a fast-food restaurant until he was laid off. Through a different government program, Carreon earned a GED. He then pursued a \"degree\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in \"computer accounting\" from a vocational school, but he incurred approximately $17,000 in student loan debt. As a result, Carreon's tax refunds are now garnished to pay his outstanding student loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even with some education in accounting, Carreon claimed it was difficult for him to obtain and maintain steady work. Some employers were reluctant to interview, further screen through a call back interview, or hire a convicted felon. When Carreon was hired, the monthly probation meetings bothered most of his supervisors. Carreon's attempt to work in out-of-state oilfields was stymied by the probation office's prohibition on such travel, and the only in-state oilfield job he obtained ended when the employer learned of Carreon's criminal record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Generally, Carreon posited that his status as a convicted felon posed an insurmountable obstacle to his employment prospects. At this point in Carreon's testimony, the trial court questioned Carreon directly, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   COURT : Okay. And you're telling me that people care about whether you have a criminal background if you're picking onions? You're telling me that you couldn't get a job picking onions or watermelon or cantaloupe or lettuce or anything? You're telling me that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   CARREON : Well, who would drive me there, Your Honor? I don't have a car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   COURT : Where did you say you lived?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   CARREON : Monte Cristo and Conway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   COURT : Monte Cristo is-would that be safe to say, there's a lot of farmland around there? Orchards too. Would that be safe to say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   CARREON : Yeah, but the places where they hire is not there. It's just the field.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   COURT : Did you ever show up to one of the fields and say, Hey, do you have work available? Did you ever do that? Just around your area, walking area where there's farmland. You didn't answer the question. Is there farmland and orchards around where you live?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   CARREON : There's one, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   COURT : Walking distance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   CARREON : It's like, two miles, yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   COURT : Walking distance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   CARREON : Oh, no, not walking distance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   COURT : You don't think two miles is walking distance? Not for you. Did you ever try to go to the-to that farmland and see if you could get a job?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   CARREON : No, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   COURT : Why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   CARREON : Because I was putting applications somewhere else, calling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   COURT : You weren't working. You weren't working for most of the time you were on probation, so why wouldn't you try that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   CARREON : I guess it didn't occur to me to go ask the farmland for a job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   COURT : Would it be safe to say because you just didn't want to do that kind of work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   CARREON : No, it just didn't occur to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   COURT : Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This exchange exposed another employment impediment-a lack of transportation. Due to a lack of transportation, Carreon pursued work near his home. Carreon mowed neighbors' yards for approximately $20.00 a yard. On the occasions when he was needed, Carreon worked for his father, a mechanic, and his uncle, a painter; these jobs paid approximately $100.00 a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Carreon also claimed to be bipolar. He recalled that his mother took him to a mental health facility when he was fifteen years old. There, Carreon spoke with a psychiatrist. According to Carreon, the psychiatrist said \"it wasn't that bad so [he] can be processed and take medication for it.\" When asked by the trial court, Carreon denied ever being diagnosed with a mental illness by the psychiatrist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Erica\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Erica testified that she managed the family's finances. Carreon and Erica cashed his paychecks together, and Carreon did not hide money from her. Erica confirmed that the couple does not own a car and that she, Carreon, and their three children live with her parents and sisters in a three-bedroom trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Trial Court's Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After hearing from Erica, the trial court recessed to allow counsel to present additional authority and prepare closing arguments. The following day, after the arguments of counsel, the trial court granted the State's motion to revoke. It noted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The thing about it is logically, you pay in installments because most people cannot pay $10,000 in one lump sum, which was evident by Mr. Carreon. Now, during the course of his probation, I did take note that he completed his conditions of probation except for the four that are on this Motion to Revoke. But that doesn't discount that they're as important as every other condition. And just because\n   he didn't-he completed all the others, you don't get a pass.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If you look at the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bearden\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   case,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   the thing about the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bearden\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   case is that in that particular case, the judge gave a person a small span of time to pay certain things and he didn't and then revoked him and sentenced him and didn't think about any alternative measures. Well, in this case, Mr. Carreon was given every single opportunity to pay. He was responsible to pay and he was-his failure to pay was also his responsibility. He willfully failed to pay. And I note that on multiple years in this case, he didn't pay anything to restitution. Zero. But think about this, no one ever filed a Motion to Revoke against him. They worked with him for ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Now, you want to say that that's the probation department, they never brought it to my attention, they brought it to his attention that he needed to pay. And he willfully on one, two, three, four, at least four years didn't pay anything to restitution, zero and he was on probation ten years. I did not have testimony for ten consecutive years that what he did, whether he actually tried.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I did note this, that he thought walking two miles was just too much to go to a farm or anything to go pick anything, but he was able to get to school when he needed to get to school. That was important to him. He didn't miss that. I didn't have any testimony he missed school. What I did note, there is no adequate form of punishment that I can-that I can do. I can't extend him anymore. It's been ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   So I'm finding that he's wilfully refused to pay restitution and has failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment or borrow money to pay. As a matter of fact, what I noted is every time-on the case that you described, the prior one, the only reason that case got dismissed is because he paid off restitution and that was the deal. That was the deal. So he was real willing to come up with restitution when his feet were to the fire. Now we're at ten years and well, there's nothing more that I can do. I can't work with him on probation anymore. It's done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   So I'm making a finding he willfully refused to pay restitution on multiple years and failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment. Going to make applications is one thing, but making every effort, every single day to go out and find something to do and work, there's no testimony of that. So I'm indicating that he has willfully made himself underemployed or unemployed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   He didn't make sufficient efforts to find employment or to borrow money. He has had ample opportunity in the last ten years to do this. He has had ten years to pay and on multiple years as I said, chose not to pay either minimum balance or nothing. He can't say that people-the probation didn't work with him. They did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   He has demonstrated a lack of regard for what was probably one of the most important things on that probationary judgment: Restitution, to make a victim whole. And that is a debt that he owes society and he had a total lack of regard for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   So I'm making a finding based on-and if you look at-if you actually look at 42.037, I have looked at his employment status and found that he is either willfully unemployed or underemployed. I've looked at his current future earnings. If you are willfully underemployed or unemployed because you choose that, without\n   really making every single effort to try to find employment, then you're not going to have any future earnings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Carreon appeals from the trial court's judgment. The State has not filed a responsive brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In his second issue, advanced in two sub-issues, Carreon argues that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking his community supervision because the evidence shows that he lacked the ability to pay. In the first sub-issue, Carreon challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the statutory elements related to the revocation of community supervision for failure to pay restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.037(h) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). In the second sub-issue, Carreon asserts that it \"is unconstitutional to jail someone for poverty.\" While Carreon's first sub-issue relates to only the restitution ground, his second sub-issue relates to all of the revocation grounds, including restitution, community supervision fees, fines, and courts costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sub-Issue One: The Legal Sufficiency Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standards of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We review the trial court's order revoking community supervision for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hacker v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095880\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/389/860/#p865\">\n    389 S.W.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). The test for abuse of discretion is not whether, in the opinion of the appellate court, the facts present a suitable case for the trial court's action, but rather, whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\n   <em>\n    State v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961471\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/428/99/#p103\">\n    428 S.W.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In Carreon's first sub-issue, he asserts that the trial court was presented with legally insufficient evidence to support revocation; and the trial court thereby abused its discretion by revoking Carreon's community supervision. When evaluating a legal sufficiency challenge, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the factfinder to determine whether it could make the findings that were returned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7326325\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/323/893/#p899\">\n    323 S.W.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (Tex. Crim.

App. 2006) (providing that a trial court may revoke community supervision if the State proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of community supervision as alleged in the motion to revoke). Preponderance of the evidence means \"that greater weight of the credible evidence which would create a reasonable belief that the defendant has violated a condition\" of his community supervision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463882\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/759/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463882\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/759/#p764\">\n    at 763-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The factfinder is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, and we may not substitute our judgment as to facts for that of the factfinder as shown through its findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

The court concluded that \"as long as a trial court\n   <em>\n    considers\n   </em>\n   the factors in its decision whether to revoke a community supervision, a court is not required to weigh the factors in any particular manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094126\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/391/86/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Implicit in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   is the notion that there must be\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   evidence of each of the six factors enumerated in article 42.037(h) for the trial court to\n   <em>\n    consider.

Our reading of article 42.037(h), as illuminated by\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   , is further supported by the use of the conjunctive \"and\" between the fifth and sixth factors, which leads us to believe that there must be at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   evidence (e.g., a \"quantity\") of each of the six factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boykin v.

It would be absurd to think that the Texas Legislature provided that trial courts \"shall consider\" factors on which they might be presented no evidence. We think that the Texas Legislature intended trial courts to consider\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   relating to each of the six factors not\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   relating to each of the six factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Applying the article 42.037(h) factors to the facts of this case, we find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    the defendant's employment status\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 Carreon testified that it was difficult for him to gain steady employment due to lack of transportation, employers' reluctance in hiring a convicted felon, and the interference of monthly probation meetings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 he mows neighbors' yards for $20 a yard, occasionally works with his father and uncle, for $100 a week, worked in an oil field until his criminal history was discovered,\n   and worked at a fast-food restaurant until laid off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    the defendant's current and future earning ability\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 Carreon testified that he earned a \"degree\" in \"computer accounting\" from a vocational school, but has been unable to find employment in that field; his criminal history has made it difficult to find employment in general and specifically utilizing his \"degree;\" he did not suffer from any physical disabilities and was capable of performing manual labor, such as mowing neighbors' yards;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    the defendant's current and future financial resources\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 Carreon's current financial resources are limited; after the motion to revoke was filed, Carreon's family pooled together $2,000; in light of the total amount of restitution, this represents less than ten percent of what was owed; Carreon also owes an approximately $17,000 student loan debt;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \u2022 there was no non-speculative evidence as to Carreon's future resources;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (4)\n   <em>\n    the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \u2022 There was no non-speculative evidence that Carreon was not diligent in pursuing employment; Carreon testified that he placed applications but did not receive many job offers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (5)\n   <em>\n    any other special circumstances that may affect the defendant's ability to pay\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \u2022 As the father of three and the main financial provider, Carreon asserts that the community-supervision order placed conflicting requirements on him-provide for his family and make restitution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (6)\n   <em>\n    the victim's financial resources or ability to pay expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \u2022 The State neither called the victim to provide live testimony nor offered any affidavit testimony from the victim regarding his or her financial resources or ability to pay expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the burglary;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On this record, the State failed to present any evidence regarding the sixth factor. Thus, the trial court had no evidence of the victim's financial resources or ability to pay expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense as required by the statute. Additionally, the trial court appears to have placed significant weight on the fourth factor, finding that Carreon was willfully unemployed \"and/or\" underemployed. The only possible evidence that may be surmised from the record are the trial court's questions to Carreon directly. As noted above, the trial court questioned Carreon on why he did not get a job within two miles of his home \"picking onions\" in order to pay restitution. The trial court's line of questions assumes that (1) the one\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"onion field\" within two miles of Carreon's home was hiring employees, (2) Carreon would be hired, (3) the \"onion field job\" would be permanent or regular, and (4) Carreon would earn sufficient wages to allow him to pay approximately $24,000 in restitution. The trial court's finding of willful unemployed \"and/or\" underemployed also seems rooted in Carreon earning a \"degree\" in \"computer accounting\" for a vocational school. It noted, \"I didn't have any testimony he missed school.\" This observation speculates that the vocational\n   school required physical attendance as opposed to offering an online curriculum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The trial court's conclusions, based on assumptions not supported by the evidence, reminds us of the \"test\" rejected by the Fourth Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Amezcua v.

App.-San Antonio 1998, no pet.). There, the State argued that the probationer should have owned a used car instead of a newer model and bought cheaper clothes in order to pay more in restitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11698459\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/975/688/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The appellate court concluded that to require a probationer to \"forgo transportation and personal grooming and yet still get a job that would enable her to make a substantial monthly payment\" is a \"test\" which the court was not prepared to require of probationers to avoid revocation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11698459\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/975/688/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The finding of willfulness was not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We conclude that the State presented legally insufficient evidence as to the sixth factor. Furthermore, the trial court's finding of willful \"unemployment and/or underemployment\" is not supported by legally sufficient evidence. Thus, a third of the factors were completely absent. The trial court abused its discretion in finding that the balance of the article 42.037(h) factors supported revocation because the record presented by the State was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Carreon's first sub-issue is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Therefore, we must address Carreon's constitutional challenge. We would also note that even if the trial court had been presented with legally sufficient evidence of the article 42.037(h) factors or a trial court's assessment of those factors is not subject to a legal sufficiency challenge, revocation under the facts of this case does not withstand Carreon's constitutional challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the State's interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   We are not unmindful of Carreon's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of his community supervision. We recognize the numerous opportunities he has been given since being placed on deferred adjudication community supervision more than ten years ago. That notwithstanding, the State's only allegation in the motion to revoke was appellant's failure to pay fees, costs, fines, and restitution. The State had the burden to prove appellant failed to do so. Here, the State conceded that it lacked evidence to proceed and filed a motion to dismiss the motion to revoke. Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's ruling, we find the State failed to meet its burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The judgment revoking Carreon's community supervision and sentencing him to confinement is reversed. Because Carreon's term of community has expired, a judgment discharging Carreon from community supervision is rendered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The record before us does not explain how the trial court calculated the $23,107.36 in restitution.
