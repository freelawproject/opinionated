These emission requirements must be met by January 4, 2019, and OG&amp;E consequently prepared an environmental compliance plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plan involved a rate base proposal to add 1.1 billion dollars for a number of construction projects at various OG&amp;E facilities and included the installation of \"dry scrubbers\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the Sooner Power Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On August 6, 2014, OG&amp;E submitted an application to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the \"Commission\") seeking pre-approval of the environmental compliance plan and a recovery rider to recoup its expenditures through rate adjustments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission denied this application because OG&amp;E failed to demonstrate that its plan would be fair, reasonable, and non-prejudicial to ratepayers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission noted that OG&amp;E failed to consider alternative energy sources such as wind and electric power. It also took issue with the fact that future environmental regulations had been ignored. Concluding that OG&amp;E failed to demonstrate the financial benefit of its plan over potential alternatives, the Commission denied authorization. OG&amp;E moved to modify the order, requesting that the projects be approved without a recovery in rates until the reasonableness of the costs could be determined in a later proceeding.

OG&amp;E sought approval of the decision to install the scrubbers, but did not seek a determination on the reasonableness of cost recovery. It explicitly stated that any cost recovery would be addressed in a later proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final order entered by the Commission, which is presently at issue, approved OG&amp;E's decision to install the scrubbers.

A similar application was submitted three years later, which the Commission granted. The railway company argued that the first final order was a former adjudication of the same matter before the Commission and, therefore, preclusive.

This Court found the proceeding to be legislative in nature because rather than reconstructing past events, the Commission was establishing a rule to guide future decision-making. While this was \"not a ratemaking proceeding per se,\" it was closely related to a ratemaking proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Approving the application allowed Southwestern Bell to determine certain rates in the future with only minimal oversight. This close relation to ratemaking was evidence of the proceeding's legislative character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Here, the Commission was exercising legislative power, and therefore res judicata is not applicable. Rather than enforcing an obligation, it was considering a change to existing conditions. The act of approving or denying OG&amp;E's applications was more akin to making a rule than imposing liability. The Commission was not investigating past events in order to resolve a private dispute between the parties, but was instead looking to the future and considering an order that would be applied prospectively. Additionally, OG&amp;E initially sought approval under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    17 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 286(B), which would allow it to make rate adjustments and recover the costs of the expenditure. The 2014 application specifically included a cost recovery rider, which would have caused rates to increase. As in\n   <em>\n    CoxOklahomaTelecom\n   </em>\n   , this was not a ratemaking proceeding per se, but its relation to a ratemaking proceeding does provide support for its legislative character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 Moreover, even if res judicata were applicable, it still would not have precluded the second application because different issues were addressed. Claim preclusion prevents parties (or their privies) from relitigating a claim that \"either w[as] or could have been litigated in a prior action which resulted in a prior judgment on the merits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Issue preclusion prevents parties (or their privies) from relitigating an issue of fact or law that was \"necessary to\" and \"determined by a valid and final judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is applicable only when the party to be precluded had a \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 The 2014 and 2016 applications addressed different issues. The 2014 application involved roughly 1.1 billion dollars for a number of construction projects at a number of different facilities. The 2016 application, on the other hand, involved roughly 490 million dollars for only the installation of the dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility. Because the 2014 application included a cost recovery rider, the Commission was considering the fairness of the project to ratepayers. The 2016 application, however, specifically disclaimed any cost recovery until a later proceeding and the Commission was considering only whether installation of the scrubbers was \"reasonable.\" Finally, the 2014 application sought approval under the specific provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    17 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 286(B), while the 2016 application sought approval under the Commission's general authority to oversee utilities found in Okla.

The Commission's power to regulate under \u00a7 152\"is not unfettered,\" but is instead limited by the Constitution and must be exercised within the confines of other statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   When interpreting \u00a7 152, this Court will find that the Commission has \"only those additional duties that would be consistent with and within the purview of its constitutional authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b623 Appellants have argued that the Commission exceeded its power when it granted OG&amp;E pre-approval to install the scrubbers based on its \"general authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Unsurprisingly, when OG&amp;E first sought pre-approval for a capital expenditure to comply the Clean Air Act, it did so pursuant to \u00a7 286(B). It was not until this application was denied that an alternative source was considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b625 As a general rule, the Commission lacks authority to grant pre-approval of an expenditure. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 286(B) in 2005, this Court held so repeatedly. It made clear that the Commission's authority \"does not include the power to approve or disapprove contracts about to be entered into nor to approve or veto the expenditures\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   It reiterated that the Commission's \"powers are not to be exercised except for the purpose of determining the fair and reasonable effect of acts\n   <em>\n    already performed\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b626 The Commission has general authority to address the fairness of a completed project, not a future one. For example, in\n   <em>\n    PublicServiceCompanyofOklahoma\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    OklahomaCorporationCommission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20OK%20124\">\n    1983 OK 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10427365\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/688/1274/\">\n    688 P.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) applied to the Commission for a rate increase. One issue on appeal was whether a power-generating facility that was under construction but not yet completed could be included in the rate base. The Commission said it would not include that facility in the rate base unless it had approved the construction plans. This Court held that \"the Commission has no power to demand prior approval of construction plans for a new plant, but once it is built, the Commission is empowered to ascertain its effect upon the public rates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case is, of course, distinguishable from the present one in that OG&amp;E is now seeking prior approval rather than the Commission demanding it. Nevertheless, just because OG&amp;E has asked does not mean that the Commission can give. Again, it cannot \"approve or veto the expenditures proposed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b627 The legislature, however, has created a limited exception to this general\n   rule. It explicitly allows utilities to seek pre-approval under \u00a7 286(B). And two principles of statutory construction support the proposition that the Commission does not have the authority to grant pre-approval outside of \u00a7 286(B). First, a statute cannot be interpreted as superfluous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Commission has the ability to grant pre-approval outside of \u00a7 286(B), then it had the ability to grant pre-approval prior to the enactment of \u00a7 286(B). If the Commission had the ability to grant pre-approval prior to the enactment of \u00a7 286(B), then \u00a7 286(B) was not needed to confer the power to pre-approve. Statutes, though, must be construed so as to not render them superfluous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Commission does not have the ability to grant pre-approval outside of \u00a7 286(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b628 The second relevant principle of statutory construction is that where two statutes address the same subject, one specific and one general, the specific statute will control over the general.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    17 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 152 broadly grants the Commission supervisory authority over public utilities and grants it the power to establish rates, rules, requirements, and regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    17 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 286(B) addresses how the Commission exercises that supervisory authority in the context of pre-approval. Section 286(B), the specific statute, thus controls how the Commission can grant pre-approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b629 Finally, the Commission's decision to grant pre-approval in a way completely untethered from the project's effect on ratepayers further calls its order into question. The powers of the Commission over utilities \"are limited to an investigation of the[ir] acts to determine whether or not they have a reasonable and fair effect upon the rights of the public,\" and it must act to avoid an \"unfair or prejudicial effect upon the public rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   In proceedings before the Commission, the interests of the public \"must be considered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b630 In the first proceeding under \u00a7 286(B), the Commission did so. In the second proceeding, however, the Commission determined only that the installation of the scrubbers would be \"reasonable.\" Any fairness to ratepayers (or lack thereof) was to be addressed at a later cost recovery proceeding. OG&amp;E consequently received pre-approval for a project costing approximately half a billion dollars without its effect on ratepayers being considered. More pointedly, when a similar project was considered in the first proceeding, the Commission found that it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be fair to ratepayers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature saw fit in \u00a7 286(B) to link pre-approval with the project's fairness to ratepayers. Neither OG&amp;E nor the Commission has provided any cogent argument demonstrating that pre-approval can be detached from fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b631 This decision does not leave OG&amp;E without recourse. To the extent that it wants to continue with installation of the scrubbers, it can initiate a standard ratemaking proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    17 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 152 after the fact. Pre-approval, however, of capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulation must occur pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    17 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 286(B). Because the Commission granted pre-approval for such an expenditure outside of \u00a7 286(B), it erred. Although res judicata did not preclude the Commission from pre-approving the expenditure, it lacked the authority to do so. Consequently, its order is vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER OF THE OKLAHOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION VACATED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   COMBS, C.J., KAUGER, EDMONDSON, COLBERT, REIF, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   GURICH, V.C.J., concurs in result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   WINCHESTER, J., dissents (by separate writing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   WYRICK, J., recused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   DARBY, J., not voting.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Okla.

presented different issues. Indeed, Appellants have alleged error\n    <em>\n     because\n    </em>\n    of these differences. They have argued that the Commission's final order from the second proceeding should be vacated because it failed to consider whether the project was fair to ratepayers and instead considered only whether the project was \"reasonable\" in the abstract. Determining whether a project is \"reasonable\" is different than determining whether later recovery would be fair to ratepayers, which is what occurred in the first proceeding. Similarly, Appellants have argued that the order should be vacated because the Commission granted approval under its general constitutional authority rather than under \u00a7 286(B), which was the applicable standard in the first proceeding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <em>\n     DataTransmissionCo.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Corp\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Comm'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1976%20OK%20148\">\n     1976 OK 148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10451815\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/561/50/\">\n     561 P.2d 50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Okla.

286 (Dec. 2, 2015).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-61\">\n   WINCHESTER, J., dissenting:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b61 As noted by the majority opinion, the Oklahoma Constitution provides the Corporation Commission with broad authority to regulate and oversee public utilities. Okla. Const. art. 9, \u00a7 18.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   17 O.S.2011, \u00a7 152 (\"The Commission shall have general supervision over all public utilities ...\"). Nevertheless, today's majority opinion dials back this authority and effectively reduces the Commission's general supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b62 The majority opinion misinterprets \u00a7 286(B) as providing the only authority for pre-approval of a capital expenditure to comply with an environmental regulation. Yet, the plain text of \u00a7 286(B) indicates that it is not mandatory for a public utility to utilize this statute when purchasing equipment to meet environmental requirements. The statute specifically gives a utility the\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   of applying for early cost recovery by providing: \"An electric utility ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   file an application seeking Commission authorization of a plan by the utility to make capital expenditures for equipment or facilities necessary to comply\" with certain environmental requirements. 17 O.S.2011, \u00a7 286(B) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b63 Here, OG&amp;E did not seek, nor did the Commission approve, any rate increase or cost recovery from rate payers. OG&amp;E formulated its own plan to install the scrubbers and voluntarily submitted the plan to the Commission for a reasonableness determination. The Commission specifically indicated that its finding of reasonableness would \"not result in an automatic right to recover costs or a determination of used and useful.\" There is no conflict between the Commission's actions under its general authority and a \u00a7 286(B) pre-approval of costs. The canon of statutory construction which requires a specific statute to control over a general statute only applies if the two statutes conflict with one another and that is not the case herein.\n   <em>\n    Humphries v.
