(father) and A.M. (mother) appeal the trial court's judgment allocating parental responsibilities of their daughter, H.K.W. (the child), to J.M. and T.K. (special respondents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case involves matters of first impression, to wit: (1) whether a trial court may conduct an in camera interview with a child who is the subject of an allocation of parental responsibilities proceeding arising from a dependency and neglect action; and, if the trial court conducts such an interview, (2) whether the court must cause a record of the interview to be created and then make that record available to the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 We conclude that the Children's Code permits a trial court to conduct an in camera interview with a child, and that due process requires that a record of the interview be created and, at least in certain circumstances, be made available upon request to the parents. Because the trial court in this case relied on the in camera interview of the child while denying the parents access to a transcript of that interview, we order that the record on appeal be supplemented with the transcript of the in camera interview. We further order that the parties be allowed to file supplemental briefs addressing whether the trial court's findings of fact from the interview are supported by the record. We will issue an opinion addressing the merits of the appeal following the completion of supplemental briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Weld County Department of Human Services (the Department) filed a dependency or neglect petition regarding the six-year-old child based on allegations of father's and mother's substance abuse; that the child had seen mother's boyfriend being kidnapped from the home; that the child had missed a lot of school; and that the family had been involved in two prior dependency and neglect cases because of substance abuse, lack of supervision, and domestic violence. The child was removed from the home and initially placed with father. Three days later, the child was placed with the special respondents. Notably, in the prior dependency and neglect cases, the child also had been placed with the special respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Based on father's and mother's admissions, the trial court adjudicated the child dependent or neglected. The court adopted treatment plans, with which father and mother complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Father, mother, and the special respondents later moved for an allocation of parental responsibilities. At a hearing, the child's guardian ad litem (GAL) moved for an in camera interview with the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the parties objected. The trial court agreed to interview the child and told the parties that it would have a record made of the in camera interview and that a transcript of the interview would be sealed unless \"the matter is appealed.\" Again, none of the parties objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Shortly thereafter, the trial court conducted an in camera interview with the child. The interview was recorded but not transcribed. None of the parties requested a transcript of the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 After a subsequent hearing, the trial court found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 the child had been the subject of three dependency and neglect cases;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 the child told the court that she wanted to stay with the special respondents;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 the child's primary attachment and bond was with the special respondents;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 the child needed stability and permanency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 even though father and mother had complied with their treatment plans, they were unfit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 father and mother had criminal histories that included domestic violence and child abuse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 father and mother had not demonstrated sobriety, stability, and ongoing parental consistency \"for a decent enough period of time\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 father and mother had exposed the child to domestic violence, drug addiction, and a criminal lifestyle, and had neglected the child's needs \"for too long.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 9 In making its findings, the trial court relied extensively on the child's statements during the in camera interview. The court then allocated parental responsibilities to the special respondents and set forth a parenting time schedule for father and mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 10 Father and mother appealed, and father requested a transcript of the trial court's in camera interview of the child. Although it had previously indicated that it would do otherwise, the trial court denied father's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    II. Interviewing the Child and Making a Record Thereof Available to the Parents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 11 Father and mother contend that the trial court erred by relying on the in camera interview with the child, which was not admitted into evidence, as the basis for its decision to allocate parental responsibilities to the special respondents. In particular, they assert that their due process rights were violated because, without access to the transcript of the interview, they were unable to contest the courts findings or the information on which the court relied in making its findings. We agree in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 12 In dependency and neglect proceedings, the trial court has jurisdiction to allocate parental responsibilities between parents and nonparents. \u00a7\u00a7 19-1-104(4), (6); 19-3-508(1)(a), C.R.S. 2016;\n   <em>\n    L.A.G. v.

There are, obviously, reasons why in camera interviews with children are held in the first place. Children might be intimidated by having to appear in court. They might also be reluctant to speak freely and honestly to the court if they knew that the contents of the interview would be made available to the parents as a matter of course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 28 Consequently, we limit our holding that the record of an in camera interview must be made available, upon request, to situations in which a parent needs (1) to determine whether the court's findings, insofar as they relied on facts from the interview, are supported by the record, or (2) an opportunity to contest information supplied by the child during the interview and relied on by the court.\n   <em>\n    In re T.N.-S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261875\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/60/\">\n    347 P.3d at 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Due process considerations may require disclosure in certain instances, particularly where the district court relies on information from the interviews in reaching its determination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 29 In this case, because the parents were unaware of the content of the child's in camera interview, they were unable to address, challenge, or rebut, either in a post-trial motion or on appeal, the child's statements or the trial court's findings as to the child's wishes regarding custodial preference. However, the parents requested access to a transcript of the in camera interview only after they had filed their notice of appeal. By not requesting access earlier (say, in a post-trial, pre-appeal motion), the parents waived their right to access the transcript for\n   the purpose of rebutting any information presented during the interview. They did not, though, waive their right to access the transcript for the purpose of contesting the bases for the court's findings related to the interview. The trial court erred, then, in not ordering the transcript to be made and made part of the record in this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989424\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/722/897/#p898\">\n    722 S.W.2d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The parties were prejudiced by lack of access to the sealed transcript to \"the extent the trial court relied on the child's statements.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    IV.
