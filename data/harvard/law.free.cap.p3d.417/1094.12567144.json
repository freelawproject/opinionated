We restate the issue on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying class certification on the basis that Ascencio failed to satisfy the M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) element of superiority.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm in part and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Defendant Orion International Corporation (\"Orion\") was a small, family-owned Montana business that performed background checks on prospective employees at the request of employers. Orion's principals were Donald and Patricia Whitney. Their son Kyle Whitney handled daily business operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In 2012, Ascencio applied for a job with St. Luke's Hospital in Polson. St. Luke's retained Orion to perform a background check of Ascencio. The background check Orion provided to St. Luke's included \"obsolete information,\" the inclusion of which was prohibited by \u00a7 31-3-112, MCA. The obsolete information consisted of Ascencio's criminal history that reflected a 1997 arrest for forgery that resulted in two misdemeanor convictions in 1998. St. Luke's hired Ascencio, and she worked there for approximately two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In 2015, Ascencio applied for a job with Missoula Bone and Joint. On May 20, 2015, Missoula Bone and Joint hired Ascencio, then retained Orion to perform a background check on her the following day. Again, the background check Orion provided to Ascencio's employer contained prohibited obsolete information, including the two 1998-misdemeanor forgery convictions as well as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing that was discharged in 2000. Ascencio called Orion to ask why it would be releasing illegal background checks to a prospective employer in violation of \u00a7 31-3-112, MCA, that prohibits the disclosure of such obsolete information by reporting agencies. Kyle Whitney, the Orion employee with whom Ascencio spoke, responded that he would contact\n   Orion's attorney. On June 9, 2015, Orion issued a corrected background check of Ascencio to Missoula Bone and Joint that included the following disclaimer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   As mandated by Montana State Law, Orion International Corporation may not report Obsolete Information in any consumer\n   report. Obsolete Information is defined as: Bankruptcy from more than 14 years of the most recent bankruptcy; judgments or suits from the longer of more than 7 years of the date of entry, or after the statute of limitations expiration; paid tax liens from more than 7 years of the date of payment; collections or accounts placed to profit and loss from more than 7 years ago; records of arrest, indictment, or conviction of a crime for more than 7 years of the disposition, release, or parole; or any adverse information from more than 7 years ago. Mont. Code. Ann. \u00a7 31-3-112.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Missoula Bone and Joint terminated Ascencio at the conclusion of her six-month probationary period, noting concerns with her background check and credit report, as well as requests for time off, not reporting when she left work early, and personality conflicts with a co-worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On September 23, 2015, Ascencio filed suit against Orion, asserting claims in her individual capacity, as well as a claim for class action. On October 29, 2015, Orion filed a Motion to Dismiss. On December 13, 2016, the District Court denied Orion's Motion to Dismiss. On January 25, 2017, Orion responded to Ascencio's first discovery requests, which included a list of individuals for whom Orion prepared background checks or other consumer reports. Ascencio identified at least 360 instances on this list in which Orion's reports contained obsolete information in violation of \u00a7 31-3-112, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 On February 1, 2017, Ascencio moved to certify the class. Ascencio attached Orion's list with 360 names circled, defining the class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   All persons in the state of Montana who had background or consumer reports generated by Orion International which contained obsolete information as defined under MCA \u00a7 31-3-112, from September 22, 2013 to present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ascencio argued the violations of Title 31, chapter 3, MCA, are common to all Plaintiffs and so similar that the illegality of all these provisions can be decided at one time in one proceeding rather than burdening the District Court with hundreds of separate cases. On March 24, 2017, the District Court denied Ascencio's motion to certify the class, determining that Ascencio met all four of the M. R. Civ. P. 23(a) prerequisites but failed to establish predominance and superiority, as required by M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). The District Court noted Ascencio\n   failed to provide evidence to support factual assertions in her briefing specifically related to the superiority issue and Orion's status as a business, which Ascencio claimed had changed and Orion had ceased operating as a Montana corporation and its principals had moved to Florida. On April 19, 2017, Ascencio moved to alter or amend the order denying class certification, asserting the District Court made a mistake of fact regarding Orion's status. Ascencio attached as an exhibit Orion's discovery responses from Orion's February 7, 2017 Defendant's Responses to Ascencio's Second Discovery Requests in which answers acknowledge Orion ceased business operations and its principals moved to Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 8, 2017, the District Court denied Ascencio's motion to alter or amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Ascencio appeals the District Court's denials of her Motion to Certify the Class and her Motion to Alter or Amend Order. Orion cross-appeals, arguing that the District Court correctly denied class certification on M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) grounds, but that it erred in its determination that Ascencio satisfied the M. R. Civ. P. 23(a) prerequisites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 We review a district court's decision on a motion for class certification for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Sangwin v.

Orion argues the facts that Orion ceased operations and its principals moved out of Montana does not alone establish or support Ascencio's argument that a class action is the superior method of adjudication here. Orion asserts Ascencio knows the principals' location, they are undisputedly subject to jurisdiction in Montana, and they are fully engaged in this litigation. Orion also highlights Ascencio's contradictory assertion that class members are limited to small recoveries and need to pool resources, when Ascencio herself seeks substantial monetary damages for defamation, invasion of privacy, emotional distress, lost wages, and loss of future earnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b620 Ascencio failed to both support her allegations with evidence and demonstrate why prosecuting this case as a class action is superior to individual actions. Assuming for the sake of argument that Orion's corporate status would provide a basis for certification, the record reflects that Ascencio filed her Motion to Certify the Class on February 1, 2017, before receiving Orion's discovery responses around February 7, 2017, indicating that Orion ceased operations and its principals moved out of Montana. Ascencio's Reply Brief on the motion to certify, filed on March 9, 2017, is the first mention of the fact-without referencing any sworn testimony or attaching any evidence-that Orion ceased doing business and its principals had moved. The District Court noted: \"It is improper to baldly assert facts in a brief without citation to evidence in the record. Briefs are for arguments based on the evidence, not creation of evidence.\" We agree. Ascencio faults the District Court for dismissing her argument regarding Orion's corporate status, yet Ascencio presented nothing in support of this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson v. Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460226\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/389/458/\">\n    2017 MT 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460226\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/389/458/\">\n    389 Mont. 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460226\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/389/458/\">\n    406 P.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We\n   will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court on issues related to the weight of evidence. ...\"). The record before the District Court at the time it ruled on Ascencio's Motion to Certify Class was devoid of any evidence to support her superiority argument.\n   <em>\n    Byorth\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sangwin\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Because certification requires\n   <em>\n    at least some\n   </em>\n   evidence to satisfy each of M. R. Civ. P. 23 's requirements, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification based on Ascencio's failure to prove superiority with at least some evidence of an assertion she deemed quintessential to her argument.\n   <em>\n    Byorth\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19 ;\n   <em>\n    Sangwin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b621 Moreover, Ascencio failed to articulate why it would be difficult for individual claimants to pursue their claims separately and why this class action is the superior method. Ascencio asserted to the District Court-without citation to legal authority or her own attachments-that, even if potential \"class members wanted to bring claims on their own, they could not,\" and that class members have \"absolutely no recourse\" alternative to this class action. Ascencio's argument rests on the implication that the putative class members' claims would result in only small recoveries that would preclude bringing individual claims unless their resources are pooled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worledge\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43. Again, however, Ascencio offers nothing but bald assertions as to the potential recoveries of other potential class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b622 Based on the record as it is currently developed, we cannot conclude that the District Court erred by finding that Ascencio failed to meet the superiority requirement of M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3). The order of the District Court is affirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DIRK M.

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b624 In its order denying the Plaintiffs' Motion to Alter or Amend, the District Court noted that the evidence of Orion's status (referring to the closure of the business and move to Florida), was \"somewhat (and belatedly) remedied\" through Plaintiffs' attachment of evidence to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b625 These facts were well known to the parties throughout the proceedings and essentially uncontested. It was specifically\n   acknowledged by Orion in its answers to discovery in early February 2017, several weeks prior to the court's denial of the motion to certify. In my view, these facts alone are sufficient to satisfy the superiority requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b626 For individual claimants to pursue the litigation and obtain service of process in Florida would be extremely difficult and cumbersome. Moreover, the District Court's rationale regarding the concentration of claims in Missoula, in the western edge of the state, fails when considering the alternative of multiple jurisdictions with separate and potentially disparate decisions. Whether the District court is in western or even central Montana has little or no rational bearing to the decision. Consolidating this litigation in one district court should be the primary goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b627 Finally, the District Court's concern over facing separate damage determinations can be resolved with modern case management tools, the imposition by the court of strict deadlines for the submission of court designated and necessary discovery materials, as well as the use of settlement masters. Issues of separate damage determinations do not necessarily preclude certification of a class.\n   <em>\n    Mattson v. Mont.

That is the predominate issue. While certain questions of law likely remain, the District Court has already made\n   rulings on the application of the Montana Consumer Protection Act and the relevant statute of limitations. As noted above, the individual questions of damages, while potentially complicated, can be managed with the tools that are currently available to the district courts and should not preclude this class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b629 While I agree that this Court should give certain deference to the District Court when deciding this question, in my view the Plaintiffs have clearly satisfied all of the legal requirements for certification of a class action.
