Stucki was also fined for this violation. Appellants challenged the citations and the Department of Commerce upheld them. Appellants appealed the Department's decision to the district court and sought declaratory judgment as to whether DOPL's rule defining the term \"manipulation\" (the Rule), as used in the MTPA, was valid. Although Appellants were not cited under the Rule-because it was not promulgated until 2012-the district court determined that Appellants had standing to challenge the Rule and concluded the Rule was \"a valid exercise of DOPL's rulemaking authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Appellants timely appealed, contending the court erred in concluding that the Rule was (1) valid and supported by substantial evidence and (2) constitutional.

Appellants requested a hearing with DOPL and challenged the citations against them. DOPL's presiding officer upheld the citations, and the Department later affirmed DOPL's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 During these administrative proceedings, DOPL enacted the Rule, which provides: \" 'Manipulation,' as used in Subsection 58-47b-102(6)(b), means contact with movement, involving touching the clothed or unclothed body.\" Utah Admin. Code R156-47b-102(10). Following the administrative proceedings, Appellants filed a complaint seeking judicial review of the Department's decision. Appellants also sought relief under the Utah Declaratory Judgment Act to declare the Rule as \"invalid and of no force or effect, and that [the Rule] is in conflict with Utah statutes on the practice of massage therapy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The district court hesitated to address the Rule because it \"was not in place when the citations were given\" and therefore addressing it \"would constitute an advisory opinion.\" Appellants \"nonetheless urge[d] the Court to address the issue because [Appellants], and those similarly situated, are harmed by the MTPA and[ ] because it is likely that this issue will recur for [Appellants].\" Although the court determined it had jurisdiction to address the issue and listed four threshold elements to be satisfied to proceed with a declaratory judgment action, it did not provide specific factual findings as to each element. The court concluded that the citations issued against Appellants were valid because they engaged in light touch massage and received a fee for those services in violation of the MTPA. The court also concluded the Rule was valid because the definition of \"manipulation\" merely clarified the MTPA rather than expand its scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Appellants timely appealed. Their appeal focuses entirely on whether the district court erred in concluding the Rule was valid. We agree with DOPL that Appellants have failed to show they have standing to challenge the Rule, because they have not shown that they were \"aggrieved\" by it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-3-602(1)(a) (LexisNexis 2016) (\"Any person aggrieved by [an administrative] rule may obtain judicial review of the rule by filing a complaint[.]\"). DOPL stated that it \"doubts whether the Rule has caused or will cause [Appellants] any distinct or palpable injury considering they were cited before the Rule was enacted and Zen Healing Arts is not currently operating.\" Appellants did not respond to this\n   challenge in their reply brief other than to state that \"[t]he Finding by the Court that these particular [Appellants] were validly cited for practicing massage [therapy] without licenses does not rob them of their standing to challenge the Rule.\" This statement, alone, does not satisfy the requirements needed to assert standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 \"Standing is a question of law that we review for correctness[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Packer v.
