The question here is how this may be accomplished in a manner that furthers this public-safety goal while preserving an accused's constitutionally guaranteed liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Article 2, section 22(A)(1), of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3961(A)(2) categorically prohibit bail for all persons charged with sexual assault if \"the proof is evident or the presumption great\" that the person committed the crime, without considering other facts that may justify bail in an individual case. We hold that these provisions, on their face, violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Unless the defendant is accused of committing sexual assault while already admitted to bail on a separate felony charge, the trial court must make an individualized bail determination before ordering pretrial detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 22 (A)(2)-(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Arizona Constitution provides that all persons charged with crimes shall be bailable unless the accused is charged with a crime that falls within an exception and the proof is evident or the presumption great that he committed that crime. Ariz. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 22 (A). Before 2002, these exceptions were limited to capital offenses, felony offenses committed while the accused is on bail for a separate felony charge, and felony offenses when the person charged poses a substantial danger to any other person or the community and no conditions of release would reasonably assure safety. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3961, historical note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2002, Arizona voters added to the listed exceptions by passing Proposition 103, which amended article 2, section 22(A)(1), to forbid bail when the proof is evident or the presumption great that an accused committed sexual assault, sexual conduct with a minor under fifteen years of age, or molestation of a child under fifteen years of age (\"Proposition 103 offenses\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3961(A)(2)-(4) (codifying Proposition 103). Proposition 103 also declared that the purposes of bail and any conditions for release include \"[a]ssuring the appearance of the accused,\" \"[p]rotecting against the intimidation of witnesses,\" and \"[p]rotecting the safety of the victim, any other person or the community.\" Ariz.

After\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   the superior court required individualized bail determinations pursuant to \u00a7 13-3961(D) for all persons charged with Proposition 103 offenses. Section 13-3961(D) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [A] person who is in custody shall not be admitted to bail if the person is charged with a felony offense and the state certifies by motion and the court finds after a hearing on the matter that there is clear and convincing evidence that the person charged poses a substantial danger to another person or the community or engaged in conduct constituting a violent offense, that no condition or combination of conditions of release may be imposed that will reasonably assure the safety of the other person or the community and that the proof is evident or the presumption great that the person committed the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2017, the State charged Guy Goodman with sexually assaulting a victim in 2010. \"A person commits sexual assault by intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with any person without consent of such person.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1406(A). The state can charge a person with sexual assault at any time as no statute of limitations applies to the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-107(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 Over the State's objection that sexual assault remains a non-bailable offense after\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   , the superior court conducted a \u00a7 13-3961(D) bail hearing. A police officer testified that the victim claimed that Goodman, a guest in the victim's home after a night of socializing, touched her vaginal area beneath her underwear while she was sleeping and without her consent. DNA tested from an external vaginal swab confirmed this contact. The officer also said that Goodman, when confronted with the DNA results, admitted digital penetration. The court ruled that although there was proof evident or a presumption great that Goodman committed the offense, the State had failed to \"meet its burden of clear and convincing evidence to show that [Goodman] poses a substantial danger to other persons or the community.\" (The State did not assert that Goodman committed a \"violent offense,\" which is defined as either a dangerous crime against children or terrorism. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3961(D).) The court reasoned that \"[t]here was no evidence of any recent felony criminal history or prior similar offenses or arrests nor any evidence of criminal offenses between the time of this alleged offense in 2010 and today,\" nor any history of contact, threats, or intimidation aimed at the victim or any witnesses. The court set bail at $70,000, required that Goodman's movements be electronically monitored\n   upon release, and imposed other conditions, including that he not possess any weapons, use non-prescription drugs, or contact the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 On special action review, the court of appeals vacated the bail order, holding that \"[s]exual assault remains a non-bailable offense\" after\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   , and so a \u00a7 13-3961(D) hearing is not required.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our statutes carefully define and circumscribe the term \"without consent,\" which can occur in four discrete circumstances: where the victim (a) \"is coerced by the immediate use or threatened use of force against a person or property\"; (b) \"is incapable of consent by reason of mental disorder, mental defect, drugs, alcohol, sleep[,] or any other similar impairment of cognition and such condition is known or should reasonably have been known to the defendant\"; (c) \"is intentionally deceived as to the nature of the act\"; or (d) \"is intentionally deceived to erroneously believe that the person is the victim's spouse.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1401(A)(7). Thus, by definition, sexual assault necessarily involves the sexual violation of a person through force, coercion, or deception. As such, it is an inherently dangerous crime, and proof evident or presumption great that a defendant has committed the crime demonstrates that the defendant is dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 42 As noted in\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   , the crime at issue there was\n   <em>\n    defined\n   </em>\n   to encompass both consensual and nonconsensual acts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n    241 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   349 \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n    387 P.3d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here the crime is defined\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to encompass nonconsensual sexual violations. The Court highlighted that distinction because the risk of future dangerousness encompasses not only the likelihood of recidivism but the inherent danger and human impact of the crime. The majority now \"explain[s]\" that the nature of the crime is irrelevant to the risk of future dangerousness.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. In that way, it removes from the constitutional equation that sexual assault is by definition a uniquely horrific act, in which a person's most intimate parts are violated through force, coercion, or deception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 43 As the United States Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Coker v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   , sexual assault\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   is highly reprehensible, both in a moral sense and in its almost total contempt for the personal integrity and autonomy of the female victim and for the latter's privilege of choosing those with whom intimate relationships are to be established.\n   <em>\n    Short of homicide, it is the \"ultimate violation of self.\"\n   </em>\n   It is also a violent crime because it normally involves force, or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. Rape is very often accompanied by physical injury to the female and can also inflict mental and psychological damage. Because it undermines the community's sense of security, there is public injury as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180580\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/584/#p597\">\n    433 U.S. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180580\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/584/#p597\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180580\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/584/#p597\">\n    53 L.Ed.2d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (emphasis added) (quoting Lisa Brodyaga et al., U.S. Dep't of Justice,\n   <em>\n    Rape and Its Victims: A Report for Citizens Health Facilities, and Criminal Justice Agencies\n   </em>\n   (1975) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 44 Unsurprisingly, then, the Supreme Court has recognized that sexual crimes justify distinctive legislative treatment in the confinement context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 45 In\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

As discussed above, the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McKune\n   </em>\n   make clear that sexual assault is a uniquely grave and dangerous crime. The statutory definition limiting sexual assault to nonconsensual acts narrowly focuses the bail exclusion to an especially serious and inherently dangerous crime. The extensive safeguards further ensure narrow focus and satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   standards. Indeed, we held recently in\n   <em>\n    Morreno\n   </em>\n   that individualized dangerousness determinations are unnecessary to categorically deny bail to felony defendants who are arrested for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   new felonies before trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=790%20Ariz.%20Adv.%20Rep.%2024\">\n    790 Ariz.

Thus, applying\n   <em>\n    Simpson II's\n   </em>\n   overbreadth standard, this Court strikes down yet another offense-based bond provision. Now, the only remaining offense-based restriction is for capital offenses. Undoubtedly, this provision cannot survive the majority's overbreadth test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=790%20Ariz.%20Adv.%20Rep.%2024\">\n    790 Ariz.

Thus, if there are instances where a defendant charged with sexual assault might remain crime-free on pretrial release, the crime cannot serve as a \"valid proxy\" for future dangerousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 56 Not only does the majority's approach create an impossible standard for \"inherently dangerous\" crimes, it essentially turns Salerno on its head. In contrast to the majority approach, Salerno provides that \"[t]he fact that the [act] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, applying\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   , the subject provision survives a facial challenge because there are instances where a defendant who commits sexual assault poses a danger to the victim or the community. Indeed, as Justice Bolick notes in his dissent, the United States Supreme Court has expressly recognized that sex offenders are a \"serious threat\" to this \"Nation,\" and that such offenders pose a risk of recidivism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b644-46 (Bolick, J., dissenting). Admittedly, this does not mean that all sex offenders will reoffend, or that even most will reoffend. But any offender charged with sexual assault, when the proof of the offense is evident or the presumption great, inherently presents a risk of danger to society, and the pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court do show that at least some sex offenders almost certainly will commit new crimes while on pretrial release. Under\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   , this is sufficient to survive a facial challenge.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b654.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 57 In abandoning\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   , the majority has effectively imposed a due process requirement that all determinations denying pretrial release must include an individualized determination of future dangerousness. There is, of course, no authority for this requirement. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   did not impose such a requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=790%20Ariz.%20Adv.%20Rep.%2024\">\n    790 Ariz.

While true,\n   <em>\n    Morreno\n   </em>\n   addressed a bond restriction involving defendants who had already been charged with a felony and, while on pretrial release, committed another felony. Of course, preventing defendants from committing new crimes while on pretrial release is the very objective the voters sought to achieve in passing the subject bond provision, particularly when a defendant has been charged with a serious crime such as sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b64, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 59 Applying the\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   standard, I would deny Goodman's facial challenge.
