We affirm, and address the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court err by granting the State's motion to join the first and second cases for trial, after a mistrial in the first case?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2.

When they got home that night, Ankeny became upset because Vonnie's dog had gone to the bathroom on the floor while they were out. Ankeny threw Vonnie on a bed and started hitting her with an open hand. Ankeny got a knife, cut Vonnie's clothes, and stabbed the bed while Vonnie was on it. Vonnie tried kicking Ankeny to get away, but Ankeny choked her until she lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness, Vonnie tried to run away, but Ankeny grabbed her hair, threw her on the bed again, and choked her until she lost consciousness two more times. Vonnie testified that she was scared for her life and stayed in the bed with Ankeny the rest of the night. She testified she did not then leave the relationship because she was afraid and did not know where to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 On May 1, 2012, Ankeny and Vonnie again spent the day fishing and drinking beer. When they returned home, Ankeny again became\n   angry because Vonnie's dog had gone to the bathroom on the floor. Ankeny yelled at Vonnie and threw drinking glasses at the wall. He took her phone out of her pocket and elbowed her in the face. Vonnie testified she believed Ankeny was going to get a knife, so she ran from the house and hid in a nearby park. Ankeny got into Vonnie's car and drove around, but was unable to find her. When Vonnie later returned home, Ankeny was gone, along with her car and dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Vonnie's friend, Barb, came to assist Vonnie. Concerned about the return of her car and dog, Vonnie contacted police. Officer Tod Wofford responded, and after learning that Ankeny had elbowed Vonnie's face, he initiated a PFMA charge against Ankeny. Vonnie told Officer Wofford that she was\n   afraid for her safety if charges were filed against Ankeny. Vonnie did not tell Officer Wofford about the April incident and stated no similar altercations had previously occurred between her and Ankeny, although she said Ankeny had been violent to others in the past. Vonnie stayed with Barb, and eventually returned home to discover her dog had been returned, but that her car was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 A week later, Ankeny was arrested near Missoula for driving under the influence and driving the wrong way on the interstate highway. He was driving Vonnie's car. A few days after Ankeny's arrest, he began writing letters to Vonnie from jail, and continued to do so for several months. Vonnie wrote back a few times, testifying that during this time period she was confused and uncertain about her relationship with Ankeny. After a few months, Vonnie decided she needed to end the relationship. Ankeny sent his last letter in December 2012. In January 2013, Vonnie disclosed the April 2012 incident to Sergeant Matt Cashell, providing the knife Ankeny had used and other physical evidence. Vonnie explained she did not initially disclose the April incident to police because she feared Ankeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 In December 2013, the State filed an information in case number DC 13-249 (hereinafter \"the first case\"), charging Ankeny with assault with a weapon, criminal endangerment, and PFMA for the April 2012 incident. At the same time, the State filed an information in case number DC 13-250 (hereinafter \"the second case\") for PFMA, failure to maintain violent offender registration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle for Ankeny's May 2012 conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 An omnibus hearing was held in both cases in January 2014. In\n   its memorandum for the first case, the State indicated no pretrial motions would be filed, including those listed in \u00a7 46-13-110, MCA, which includes joinder under \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA. In its memorandum for the second case, the State expressed an intention to file a motion to sever the failure to register charge from the other charges. The deadline for motions was February 19, 2014. On April 30, 2014, the State moved to sever the failure to register charge from the second case, which was granted by the District Court and transferred to case number DC 14-401. The State did not move for joinder of the first and second case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The first case, involving the April 2012 incident, was tried to a jury in June of 2014. Before trial, the State agreed to exclude any reference to the May 2012 incident, as well as the contents of Ankeny's letters from jail, if Ankeny would not challenge Vonnie's credibility for her nine-month delay in reporting the April 2012 assault. Although Ankeny's strategy was to attack the credibility of Vonnie's claims, he did not base his attack on Vonnie's nine-month delay in reporting the incident. Sergeant Cashell testified that he interviewed Vonnie regarding her relationship with Ankeny, and that Vonnie had provided physical evidence related to the April 2012 assault, including a knife, and letters written by Ankeny. The content of letters, and the fact that Ankeny had written them from jail, were not disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The jury was unable to reach a verdict and the court declared a mistrial. The Jury Foreman volunteered the following statement before the jury was dismissed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Your Honor, if you will permit, and I think I can speak for all the jurors, with all due respect for the officers of the court and your good intentions, we feel that if both the prosecution and defense had done a more adequate job, it would have made our ability better to render decisions on any of those charges. Unfortunately, we felt that wasn't the case, and that got us where we are here. Thank you for letting me make that statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State contacted several jurors after the trial, and learned that the jury had reached its own conclusion that Vonnie had significantly delayed reporting the April 2012 incident, which contributed to their inability to reach a verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State then moved to join the first and second case. Ankeny opposed joinder because \"stacking\" the PFMA charges would\n   have a cumulative prejudicial effect, and because he wanted to retain the option of presenting different defense strategies for each offense. However, the District Court granted the motion, reasoning that the two crimes were \"remarkably similar,\" as the charges were brought\n   under the same statute, involved the same victim, same location, same or similar\n   <em>\n    modus operandi\n   </em>\n   , and were committed a short time apart, and that joinder was in the interests of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The second trial was held in July of 2014. At the pretrial conference, the State sought leave to introduce several of the letters Ankeny wrote to Vonnie from jail, arguing they included possible admissions, were attempts to influence Vonnie not to advance the PFMA charges, explained Vonnie's delayed disclosure of the April assault, and demonstrated the domestic violence cycle of Ankeny's control over Vonnie. Ankeny objected on Rule 403 grounds, noting prejudicial references to Ankeny being jailed in Missoula for DUI, references to violent behavior, and references to a prior prison term. He asked that the letters be excluded if he did not attack Vonnie's credibility based on her delayed reporting, as in the first trial. Alternatively, he asked that the letters be redacted, or that portions of the letters be read so the jury would not know about the redactions. The State opposed redaction, arguing the references to Ankeny's prior acts were interwoven through the letters, making it difficult to redact the letters without giving the inference that something was being hidden, as in the first trial. The District Court admitted the letters, unredacted, concluding the contents were relevant and agreeing that redaction would be difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Five letters were submitted to the jury. Ankeny's apologies to Vonnie were intermixed with pleadings for her favor and assistance with the charges, as well as comments related to prior acts, as illustrated by this passage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Hello my love.... I am sorry for everything that has happened Buggy, I love you with all my heart and I miss you more than ever. I am glad that I got to hear your voice on the phone, it put me at ease. I know that my mess sounds like the worst in the world but it really isn't. I have the criminal endangerment charges but they will be dropped down, I just have to sit here and wait. I also requested that I stay here for all court stuff so I am close to you. I know that I was going to get violated, just not like this. I pray that you will still stick by me. I really do love you and I will do everything that I have to get back to you. I really want to be the man you fell in love with again. I really am asking you for that chance.... I really do need you in my life because you are my world. I fell completely in love with you. I am sorry for all the wrongs I have done. Our moving had also brought on a lot of stress for one I knew it was violating, I just didn't know when. I was on my way home when this mess I am in happened. I left\n   there because of the paperwork you left on the kitchen table, which only you can fix and I hope you do, it is a worse situation than this one by far. Right now I have to take care of this, I am in panic mode because I don't want to lose my Buggy. I miss our puppy too.... I will do everything to improve myself for us Buggy, any groups, counselling, anything. I would even get on medication for us. I just don't want to lose you Buggy. I know that our love for each other is strong. You told me several times that you would wait for me, I hope it is true, you will be the first real person that I have ever had and so far, you have been perfect. I am going to use this time to improve myself and focus on you and us, that will keep me going and not give up and the charges will get dropped, that are nonsense. I did not know I was on the wrong side of the road when this happened. I haven't even been charged with a DUI as of yet. I was also hit in the head with something, within a 5 minute time frame of this all happening. I just wanted to get home to my wife. I do love you with all my heart and I mean that 100%. I hope you are the same. I take the blame for all our problems. I am so sorry Buggy. I will be much different, the man you met and fell in love with. I will write to you every chance I get Buggy and I hope you will do the same.... I really hope that you come see me the first chance you get. This won't\n   kill us Buggy, it will only make us a stronger couple. That's for sure. I told you I wanted to grow old together and I really really meant it. I will keep out of trouble and keep you in my thoughts here 24-7.... I won't stop fighting this until I win Buggy, I won't lose you.... I know you are true Buggy, I miss you so very very much. Will you please write me all you can. I stand at mail pass every day.... I do have a lot to say, I will tell you more in the next letter. I love you Buggy, kiss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Other letters stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I hope that you took care of the mess over there. I don't need any more charges. And I couldn't get out of that without you helping for sure.... Then I will go to my violation hearing, at Deerlodge, and either have to go to a program or get put back out.... I am praying that you took care of the thing over there, I have no charges so that's a good sign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I fear another prison term.... My drinking is all over too, I can't be putting you through hell, it is not fair to do that to the person you love. They always say we hurt the ones closest to us the\n   worst.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 Sergeant Cashell testified that the letters demonstrated manipulative behavior that exists in domestic violence relationships, and explained the patterns of domestic violence. On cross-examination, Ankeny's attorney suggested that Ankeny was referencing his drunken driving, as opposed to the alleged assaults, when making the apologies. The District Court gave a cautionary instruction regarding the contents of the letters:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The State has offered letters of the Defendant that reference that he may have engaged in other crimes at another time, specifically driving while intoxicated in Missoula County. That evidence was not admitted to prove the character of the Defendant or to show he acted in conformity therewith. The only purpose of admitting that evidence was that the State asserts those letters contain admissions by the Defendant that he committed the offenses in this case. The Defendant denies this. You are the sole judge of what those letters mean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Defendant is not being tried for that other crime. He may not be convicted for any other offense than that charged in this case. For the jury to convict the Defendant of any other offense than that charged in this case would result in unjust double punishment of the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 14 Deputy Wofford testified about responding to Vonnie's call following the May 2012 incident. During the State's re-direct examination, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. When you were talking with [Vonnie], was she forthcoming about why she felt threatened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. What did you learn?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Eventually, while talking with Vonnie, she had said that she knew that [Ankeny] had been violent in the past and that that's why she feared when he went for the knives, that she thought something may happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ankeny did not object. During Ankeny's re-cross examination, Wofford stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. My knowledge of your report is that, as she had stated in there, that there had never been any incidents between herself and [Ankeny]; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Correct, [Vonnie] said there had never been any physical disturbance between her and [Ankeny], but she knew of previous engagements where he was violent towards other people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ankeny's counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground Wofford had referenced a prior bad act. The State responded that the testimony was admissible to show Vonnie's state of mind. The District Court denied the motion for a mistrial, reasoning that because the testimony was vague and lacked specifics, a cautionary jury instruction would cure the reference. The District Court provided the following cautionary instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Ladies and Gentlemen, just before the break there was some testimony regarding possible prior bad-acts that the defendant\n   may or may not have committed prior to the incidents that gave rise to these charges. I believe the purpose of that evidence was to not necessarily show what happened in the past, but to show the state of mind that the complaining witness was in, what she believed the defendant might be capable of and so forth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   But you need to bear in mind that the defendant is not on trial for anything he may have done in the past prior to these incidents that gave rise to these charges, and he is not to be convicted of any other offense other than what he is charged with. And to do that would potentially result in unjust double punishment of the defendant. So you should only consider that evidence, again, just as potential evidence of the complaining witness's state of mind and for no other purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 15 The jury found Ankeny guilty of assault with a weapon, two counts of PFMA, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. The jury found Ankeny not guilty of criminal endangerment. Ankeny appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 16 We review all three issues for abuse of discretion.

The first is whether the District Court erred by finding good cause to allow the State to move to join the first and second cases after it had initially waived that opportunity. The second is whether the District Court properly granted the State's joinder motion on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

He asserts the State's untimely request was, like\n   <em>\n    VonBergen\n   </em>\n   , merely a change in trial strategy-from trying the cases separately to \"stacking\" the offenses as part of a common scheme. He argues there were no relevant facts that the State did not know at the time it initially waived its joinder motion, as in\n   <em>\n    Greywater\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 23 However, the State's post-omnibus request here was not merely a change in trial strategy. Feedback received after the first trial revealed that juror confusion had arisen from the narrow focus of the first trial, hindering the effort to reach a verdict. Though not mentioned, the jury deduced that Vonnie had long delayed her report of the April 2012 assault, causing a concern, expressed by the Jury Foreman, about whether the case had been forthrightly presented. This concern was something the State did not know at the time of its waiver. Further, joinder certainly promoted judicial economy, as one less trial arising out of Ankeny's actions would be required, three instead of four, and the victim and other witnesses would need to testify at one less trial. We conclude the District Court was properly exercising its authority to control the progress of its cases when it granted relief from the State's waiver, and did not abuse its discretion by arbitrarily exceeding the bounds of reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Joinder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 24 Courts may try \"informations\" together, as governed by statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The court may order two or more indictments, informations, complaints, or defendants to be tried together if the interests of justice require and the charges or defendants could have been joined in a single indictment, information, or complaint as\n   provided for in 46-11-404.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Section 46-13-210, MCA.

We have rejected a general and unsupported assertion of the cumulative effect of evidence as sufficient to demonstrate prejudice, particularly if it cannot be stated that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find the defendant committed\n   each offense.\n   <em>\n    Freshment\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30 ;\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 26 Ankeny argues he was substantially prejudiced under all three types of prejudice referenced in\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   . Under the first, Ankeny argues the State used joinder to paint him as a \"bad man\" with a history of violence. Under the second, Ankeny argues joinder brought admission of the letters in the second trial, but had been excluded in the first trial. Under the third type of prejudice, Ankeny asserts he may have wanted to testify in one case but not in another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 27 Ankeny's arguments are not compelling under the facts here. The charges involved similar alleged actions involving the same parties, making them appropriate for joinder. Ankeny alleges prejudice from the \"stacking\" of the charges, but does not argue there was any lack of evidence for the charges individually. Under the second type of prejudice, while the admission of the letters may well have been prejudicial to Ankeny, as all probative evidence is, we hold below that the letters were not admitted in error. Ankeny further fails to make a compelling showing of substantial prejudice related to the letters because there was other evidence that was clearly sufficient to support his conviction of both charges, if believed by the jury. Under the third type of prejudice, Ankeny, as in\n   <em>\n    Enright\n   </em>\n   , only generally alleges he may have wanted to testify at one trial but not another, and has not made a compelling showing of prejudice. Finally, as noted above, judicial economy was a significant factor given the unexpected mistrial and resulting need for an additional trial. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion by joining the two cases for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 28\n   <em>\n    2.

Instead of considering only a single assault incident, the jury also considered a second assault incident, criminal endangerment, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, as well as Vonnie's delayed reporting of the first incident. Assessing these events led naturally to evidence about the nature of Vonnie and Ankeny's relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

However, Ankeny's description of the contents of the letters is far different than the wording of the letters themselves. Ankeny's\n   references to his prior bad actions were minimal at best, vaguely stated, and closely interwoven in the long, detailed narrative with his promises to change and his pleas for Vonnie to not abandon their relationship, such as these passages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   I know that I was going to get violated, just not like this.

They contained Ankeny's apologies and near-admissions to the charges, his requests that Vonnie attempt to get charges dropped, and indications of his abusive, controlling relationship with her. They were relevant to explain why Vonnie had delayed reporting the April 2012 assault. These are all \"other purposes\" contemplated under Rule 404(b) for proper admission of evidence under the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. Further, redaction would have been difficult and its efficacy doubtful, requiring the splicing of phrases from sentences that would interrupt complete thoughts, and possibly rendering the letters unintelligible. The District Court's concern that redaction-or a onetime reading by a witness-may have made it difficult for the jury to fully comprehend the letters, was a valid one.

Upon Ankeny's objection, the District Court gave a cautionary instruction about the Deputy Wofford's single reference to Vonnie knowing that Ankeny had been violent towards other people. The instruction carefully explained the issue and properly admonished the jury, explaining that the reference was not an attempt to prove conformity to character, but to demonstrate Vonnie's state of mind that caused her to act as she did, both during and after the assault, a permissible purpose under Rule 404(b). Further, under Rule 403, Vonnie's state of mind, particularly her fear of Ankeny, was highly relevant to why she delayed reporting the April assault and had a reasonable apprehension of fear, an element of the charge. Ultimately, Ankeny's arguments do not establish that he was denied a fair and impartial trial due to the evidence.

However, although we have here divided the good cause and joinder inquiries to properly apply the governing statutes, Ankeny did not argue before the District Court that the State waived joinder and lacked good cause for its waiver, he argued only that joinder would constitute an impermissible amendment of the information, and be prejudicial. Good cause is a response to the defense of waiver, which was Ankeny's burden to raise, but he did not. Indeed, Ankeny did not mention the State's waiver at all, and may arguably have forfeited the issue. The District Court's brief order addressed only the arguments the parties actually made.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    In his opening brief, Ankeny neither argues that the District Court failed to make an express finding of good cause, nor that the State failed to raise \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, before the District Court. Although credited by the Dissent, Ankeny argued these points for the first time in the entire proceeding in his reply brief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Ankeny's opening appellate argument that there was not good cause to grant relief from waiver certainly assumes the District Court found such good cause in granting the State's motion. The State has answered these arguments by discussing the existence of good cause on the merits, rather than arguing that Ankeny failed to preserve the issue. Consequently, we are resolving the issues upon this record and upon the arguments here made.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Section 46-11-404(1), MCA, provides in part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    Two or more offenses ... may be charged in the same charging document in a separate count, or alternatively, if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character or are based on the same transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Ankeny does not contest that the \"same or similar character\" requirement under \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA, was met here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    The State argues Ankeny did not properly preserve his Rule 404(b) objection, but we conclude it was sufficiently preserved.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-110\">\n   Justice Ingrid Gustafson, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 40 I respectfully dissent on Issue One. Although the majority acknowledges that \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, allows a district court to grant relief from waiver, and relief from waiver requires a showing of good cause, Opinion, \u00b6 20, the District Court in fact overlooked the need to apply \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, when it joined the first and second cases upon the State's motion. Because the District Court did not apply \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, and did not find good cause to grant the State relief from its waiver of joinder in this matter, its decision to join the two cases lacks statutory support, and we should reverse and remand this matter for the District Court to make such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 41 The facts and circumstances which occurred after the jury failed to return a verdict on June 3, 2014, illuminates why the District Court failed to apply \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. Immediately after the court dismissed the jury in the first trial, the State's counsel moved to join the two cases, citing \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA, and \u00a7 46-13-210, MCA, in support of its position. As Ankeny explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Having waived joinder and consolidation, the State was required\n   to show good cause for relief from its waiver.\n   \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. The State's argument to the district court ... did not mention good cause. ... Therefore, the State has not, and cannot show that it met its burden to show good cause for relief from its waiver of joinder and consolidation in both cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Since it did not request joinder at the time of the omnibus hearing, the State waived its opportunity to avail itself of these provisions. In order to relieve the State from its waiver-and thus consider whether the cases should be joined under \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA, and \u00a7 46-13-210, MCA -the District Court first needed to find good cause under \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 42 As Ankeny argues in his Opening Brief, \"Having abandoned joinder and consolidation in both 13-249 and 13-250, the State was required to show good cause for relief from its waivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA.\" However, as Ankeny further explains, the State did not show good cause, and the State did not raise \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, when it moved to join the cases. Rather, the State argued the cases could have been joined initially-a position which Ankeny correctly characterizes as \"beside the point.\" The State also did not raise \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, at the June 5, 2014 hearing on consolidation. Nor did the District Court cite \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, or refer to \"good cause\" in its Order Granting Motion to Consolidate for Trial. Thus, as Ankeny points out, \"[t]he district court did not find good cause to grant the State relief from its pretrial waivers of joinder and consolidation.\" Rather, the District Court determined the cases \"could have been joined in a single information pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046-11-404\">\n    Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-11-404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\" and \"[c]onsolidation of the two cases for trial is in the interests of justice, as contemplated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046-13-210\">\n    Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-13-210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Nothing in the record suggests the District Court was aware of the need to find good cause to relieve the State of its waiver under \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. Although the majority contends that Ankeny's argument fails because he did not raise \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, in the court below, the State had the burden of proof. Ankeny had no obligation to make the State's case for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 43 Although the State argues these two cases could have been joined in the first place, this is not the point: the mere fact the cases could have been joined at the outset does not provide good cause for relief from the waiver of joinder. Here, the majority improperly relies on\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   and similar cases, putting the burden on Ankeny to prove prejudice when the burden should be on the State to prove good cause. In\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   , we held when a defendant seeks severance, it is his burden to prove severance is necessary to prevent unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). We have held a criminal defendant moving for severance bears the burden of proving joinder is prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, where the State is moving for relief of its waiver of joinder, and the defendant is not moving to sever causes, it is not the defendant's burden to prove prejudice under the factors recited in\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   . Here, unlike\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , Ankeny has not moved for severance; the State has moved for relief from its waiver of joinder. Therefore, the burden is on the State to prove good cause-and we cannot presume good cause exists where the State did not present the argument in the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 44 Since the District Court did not apply \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, in relieving the State of its waiver, this is an error of law, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the letters did all three, portraying Ankeny as a person with a criminal past, present, and future-someone who had served time in prison, was currently on parole, was facing charges unrelated to this case, and was expecting to return to prison for parole violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 48 The State told the District Court it intended to offer the letters both as substantial proofs of admission and to prove Ankeny attempted to influence Vonnie's behavior, \"which does feed into the domestic violence cycle.\" The State suggested Ankeny's expressions of controlling behavior and of love for Vonnie would help the jury understand Vonnie's delayed disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 49 Ankeny argues he \"made numerous proposals to allow the State to introduce the probative evidence it wanted, and for its stated purpose, without introducing the unredacted letters....\" Ankeny's proposals included: redacting the letters; Vonnie reading the relevant\n   portions of the letters into the record; Ankeny stipulating the car was recovered in his possession in Missoula; and the parties removing a dated label from one piece of evidence, which is how the jurors deduced Vonnie's delay in disclosing the April 2012 assault. However, the State objected to every proposal. Instead, the State desired, and the District Court agreed, to have the letters admitted into evidence and submitted to the jury unredacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 50 The State submitted five letters into evidence, each between two and four pages in length. The letters make it clear that: Ankeny is writing from jail; he has several additional charges pending against him, including DUI and criminal endangerment; he was previously in prison for another crime or crimes; he was on parole prior to being arrested; he knowingly violated the terms of his parole; and he expects to be sent back to prison for his parole violation. While the majority characterizes Ankeny's references to prior bad actions as \"minimal\" and \"vaguely stated,\" they are specific enough to inform the jury he has a criminal history: \"[L]ast time I got convicted for doing nothing!\" \"As for my violation, there is no DUI so I could be let right back out when I am done with this.\" \"My public defender just got me down &amp; really scared because he is not a very good one and if I keep him, I fear another prison term.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 51 The details of Ankeny's encounters with the criminal justice system are intermixed with professions of love and longing and vague apologies to Vonnie, such as \"I am sorry for all the wrong I have done,\" \"I take the blame for all our problems,\" and \"Will you forgive me honey and move forward with me?\" The letters also contain statements the jury could interpret as supporting Vonnie's testimony, such as: \"I can[']t be getting all drunk and putting you thru hell, it is not fair to do that to the person you love. They always say we hurt the ones closest to us the worse.\" And, \"I am trying to make things better with us and assure you that once we make it past this, it will never happen again.\" Ankeny argued these statements could just as easily refer to the trouble he was in for the parole violation and other pending charges. This is true. However, it was within the District Court's discretion to admit these statements and let the jury decide how to interpret them. I disagree it was within the court's discretion to admit the full text of five letters in order to put these few sentences before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 52 The letters also contain statements which can be read as Ankeny encouraging Vonnie to assist him in evading the charges from the April 25 and May 2 incidents-statements such as: \"I hope that you took care of the mess over there. I don't need anymore charges and I couldn't get out of that without ... you helping for sure,\" and, \"I am\n   praying that you took care of the thing over there. I have no charges so that's a good sign.\" I agree these statements were probative as well, but maintain their admission did not require the admission of the letters in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 53 The letters also contain admissions Ankeny was driving Vonnie's car, such as, \"I am sorry about the break [sic] line in the car\n   but I assure you I didn't do that. I stopped the car and it was fine.\" However, Ankeny offered to stipulate Vonnie's car was recovered in Missoula County with Ankeny driving it, and thus the State did not need to introduce the letters to prove Ankeny had control of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 54 The majority holds the letters were relevant to explain why Vonnie delayed disclosing the April 2012 assault. However, as both parties acknowledge, the first jury only discovered Vonnie had delayed disclosing the April 2012 assault because of the date on an evidence sticker. Given the State's desire to keep the delay from the jury in the first trial, it is unclear why removal of that sticker was not the preferable solution for the second trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 55 Although some statements in the letters have some probative value, the prejudicial nature of the remaining content cannot be denied, and this prejudicial content should not have been presented to the jury. Either redacting the letters or having a witness read the probative excerpts to the jury would have satisfied the State's need to present this evidence while also protecting Ankeny's right not to have the jury decide the case on an improper basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 56 Although the District Court offered a cautionary instruction to the jury, it was insufficient to overcome the prejudicial effect of the unredacted letters. Furthermore, I would not find the admission of these letters was harmless error. Section 46-20-701, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    State v.
