Trap Free alleged that FWP allowed the Montana Trappers Association (\"MTA\") to use an FWP-owned trailer and equipment in MTA's efforts to oppose a ballot initiative in violation of state law. The Commissioner agreed that FWP was responsible for ethics violations. On judicial review, the First Judicial District Court reversed. Trap Free appeals from the District Court order granting judicial review. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 FWP acquired a trailer and furbearing animal taxidermy displays in the 1990s for educational use. The trailer, which is marked with the FWP logo, is used to transport the displays around the state to various educational and outreach events. Until 2014, MTA used the trailer and displays as part of its education and outreach efforts without issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 In February 2014, Ballot Issue I-169 was approved for signature-gathering. It proposed to prohibit trapping of certain animals by private individuals on any public lands within the State of Montana. MTA had opposed a similar ballot initiative in 2013 and began posting opposition to I-169 on its Facebook page in March 2014. As part of its efforts against these ballot initiatives, MTA created a ballot issue committee called Montanans for Effective Wildlife Management (\"MEWM\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Sometime in September 2013, FWP delivered the trailer and displays to MTA President Toby Walrath for the organization's use in its educational programs. FWP did not maintain a record of specific events and purposes for which MTA used the trailer and displays. The record shows that MTA used the trailer and displays during the time in question for education and outreach apart from any political advocacy efforts against I-169, such as at the 2014 Youth Conservation and Education Expo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 The record also shows, however, that MTA used the trailer and displays in conjunction with its political advocacy efforts against I-169 on three occasions. On May 31, 2014, MTA members used the trailer and displays at the Montana PLUS event in Missoula. The event was advertised as \"an effort to unite all the groups in Montana, who utilize public lands, consume natural resources and who oppose restrictive laws which keep Montanans from using and enjoying the outdoors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Billboards and Facebook posts advertising the event stated, \"Say No to I-169.\" No FWP employees attended the event. On June 14, 2014, MTA members used the trailer and displays in their booth at the Hamilton Farmer's Market, in which they\n   had hung a banner that read, \"Vote No on I-169.\" The next day, MTA members again used that trailer and display at Cabela's in Missoula to advocate against I-169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Two FWP employees-Brian Giddings and Ron Aasheim-received complaints from members of the public regarding MTA's use of the trailer and displays shortly after MTA used the equipment at Cabela's. Giddings reported the complaints to Aimee Hawkaluk, FWP Agency Legal Counsel. She advised that, although FWP had not authorized the use of the equipment for political advocacy, someone from the Department \"should call the Montana Trappers Association to reinforce that all [its] activities related to the ballot initiative should be kept completely separate from the use of our trailer and other FWP materials.\" Aasheim reported the complaint to Rebecca Dockter, FWP Chief Legal Counsel. Dockter also advised that, although no FWP public officers or employees were involved, MTA \"should not be allowed to continue the use of the equipment in any way connected with [its] initiative advocacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Aasheim contacted Walrath about the use of the trailer and displays. Walrath responded in an e-mail that MTA \"will certainly not use the furbearer display anywhere near a MEWM sign again.\" He admitted that \"it was a poor decision on the MTA's part to combine the two entities (MEWM and MTA) at one location near equipment bearing the FWP insignia. This will not happen again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 A few days later Hawkaluk discovered comments from a MTA member on a blog post that MTA had made magnets to cover up the FWP logo on the trailer. On the advice of Hawkaluk and Dockter, Aasheim followed up with Walrath \"to emphasize, regardless of the MTA's efforts to cover up the state logo, FWP property absolutely may not be used in connection with advocacy for or against I-169.\" Following these reports, FWP also developed a form for users of FWP equipment to sign, acknowledging that they will not use the equipment \"to solicit support for or opposition to any political committee, the nomination or election of any person to public office, or for influence of a ballot initiative.\" MTA never signed the form, but the record does not show its further improper use of FWP property. MTA returned the trailer and displays to FWP sometime in late 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Trap Free filed a confidential complaint with the Commissioner against FWP in July 2014. Trap Free alleged that MTA's use of FWP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   property violated \u00a7\u00a7 2-2-101 and -121, MCA. The Commissioner accepted the complaint in June 2016. A Hearing Examiner presided over a contested hearing in October 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both FWP and Trap Free called witnesses to testify. In her Proposal for a Decision, the Hearing Examiner found that FWP staff were responsible for three violations of \u00a7 2-2-121(3)(a), MCA, for the three occasions when MTA used the trailer and displays in conjunction with its political advocacy efforts. She recommended that the Commissioner impose an administrative penalty of $1,500 on FWP. She attributed the violations to the policy actions and omissions of FWP Director Jeff Hagener, Aasheim, and Dockter, \"to the extent legally necessary.\" The Commissioner adopted the Proposal as its final agency decision on the same day the Proposal was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 FWP filed a Petition for Judicial Review with the District Court, arguing that the Commissioner ignored the plain language of the statute, which prohibits only \"a public officer or employee\" from using public resources for political advocacy. The District Court reversed the final agency decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The Montana Administrative Procedures Act (\"MAPA\") governs judicial review of the Commissioner's final agency decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson v.

Trap Free maintains that the Commissioner correctly interpreted the statute and that the District Court's interpretation leads to an absurd result that leaves a gaping loophole in the state ethics law. Specifically, Trap Free contends that under the District Court's decision any state agency can allow private citizens to use public resources for political advocacy without violating the ethics laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 FWP responds that the District Court properly applied the plain language of the statute to conclude that no violation of the ethics code occurred because no FWP employee used the state-owned property for political advocacy.

Under the Code of Ethics, a \"public employee may not use public time, facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, or funds to solicit support for or opposition to ... the passage of a ballot issue,\" unless such use is authorized by law or properly incidental to another activity required or authorized by law. Section 2-2-121(3)(a), MCA. Section 2-2-103, MCA, explains that \"the holding of public office or employment is a public trust, created by the confidence that the electorate reposes in the integrity of public officers, legislators, and public employees.\" In light of\n   this public trust obligation, a public employee must \"carry out the individual's duties for the benefit of the people of the state.\" Section 2-2-103(1), MCA. A \"public employee whose conduct departs from the person's public duty is liable to the people of the state and is subject to the penalties provided in this part for abuse of the public's trust.\" Section 2-2-103(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 Section 2-2-121(3)(a), MCA, prohibits public employees from using public resources for political purposes. The statute is unambiguous that, unless authorized by law, a \"public employee may not use\" public resources for political purposes. There is no dispute that MTA members used public resources for a political purpose. MTA members, however, are not public employees. And there is no dispute that FWP employees were not present and did not use the trailer to promote the defeat of I-169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b617 Trap Free effectively asks this Court to ignore that \u00a7 2-2-121(3)(a), MCA, specifically prohibits a\n   <em>\n    public officer or public employee\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    using\n   </em>\n   state resources for political advocacy purposes. Our role is \"simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein [within the statute], not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\" Section 1-2-101, MCA. Trap Free's position would expand ethics laws to hold a state employee liable for failure to prevent private individuals from using public resources for political advocacy purposes when such use is without the public employee's knowledge. If, as Trap Free contends, this omission\n   in the statute leaves a gaping loophole in state ethics laws, it is a matter for the Legislature. It is not the Court's-or the Commissioner's-prerogative to rewrite a statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 Trap Free raises alarm that public employees may immunize themselves from state ethics laws by looking the other way or by allowing private citizens to use public resources for political advocacy. These concerns are not borne out by the record in this case. Nothing in the record supports-and the Hearing Examiner did not find-that any FWP employee through his or her actions or inactions authorized or colluded with MTA to allow MTA to use FWP property for political advocacy, intended to allow MTA to use FWP property for political advocacy, or even knew that MTA would use FWP property for political advocacy. In fact, MTA had used the trailer and displays for many years for educational purposes without problem. When FWP employees were notified of MTA's use of the furbearer display to advocate against the ballot initiative, they immediately communicated to MTA that such use was improper and could not occur again. Under the facts of this case, not one incident of MTA's use of the trailer for political advocacy purposes can be attributed to any state employee. No party to this case contends that a state agency or its employees could knowingly allow private parties to use state resources for political advocacy. And no such use occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b619 The broader context of the Code of Ethics and its purpose as articulated in \u00a7\u00a7 2-2-101 and -103, MCA, reinforce our interpretation of \u00a7 2-2-121(3)(a), MCA. Sections 2-2-101 and -103, MCA, focus on the actions of public employees, not those of private individuals. A public employee must \"carry out the individual's duties for the benefit of the people of the state.\" Section 2-2-103, MCA. As discussed above, the improper use of the trailer and display to advocate against the ballot initiative cannot be attributed to any FWP employee. And when FWP employees learned of the use, they \"carr[ied] out\" their \"duties for the benefit of the people of the state\" by taking actions to stop MTA's continued use of the trailer and displays for political purposes. Although MTA maintained control of the equipment, there are no additional reports in the record of improper political use of the equipment after FWP communicated to MTA that the use of the equipment in MTA's advocacy efforts must stop. Neither party is contending that MTA's use of the equipment for political advocacy was proper or that FWP could ignore and allow the improper use to continue once the agency learned of it. Rather, the record demonstrates that FWP immediately expressed dismay and communicated to MTA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   that such use was unacceptable and must stop immediately. The District Court rightly concluded that FWP employees did not violate state ethics laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b620 The District Court's Order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   DIRK M.
