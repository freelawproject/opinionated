Concrete was cracking and buckling. Decks became unsafe to walk on. Stucco began peeling off of the units and stones fell off of pillars. The Association filed this action against the developer, the builders, and their principals alleging, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duty and of the implied warranty of habitability. The property developer asserted a counterclaim for indemnification. The district court granted summary judgment against the Association, reasoning that the Association lacked contractual privity with the property developer. The district court later granted the property developer's motion for directed verdict on the Association's claim for breach of fiduciary duty. None of the Association's claims survived summary judgment or directed verdict. The property developer filed a post-trial motion for indemnification of attorney fees, which the district court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Association appealed and the property developer cross-appealed. Because we affirm that the district court did not err by granting summary judgment and directed verdict, we do not reach the merits of the property developer's cross-appeal. We conclude, however, that the developer should have tried his indemnification claim rather than raise it by post-trial motion, and we therefore vacate the district court's award of attorney fees. We award the property developer its costs on appeal under rule 34 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 3 Jeffrey A. Duke owned and operated several business entities-Castlewood-Sterling Village I, LLC, Castlewood Development, LLC (collectively, Developer), and Castlewood Builders, LLC. Through these entities, Duke developed the Gables at Sterling Village, a planned unit development comprised of seventy-eight residential units in fifteen buildings. Once construction was complete, Developer drafted and recorded the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions of the Gables (the Declaration).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 4 Under the Declaration, Developer retained control of the Association until a certain number\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of units had been sold. At that point, Developer turned control of the Association over to its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Declaration gave the Association responsibility for maintaining the common areas and certain parts of the living units:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Association shall maintain, repair, and replace all landscaping and improvements in the Common Areas.... The Association shall provide exterior maintenance of the Living Units including but not limited to painting, repair, replacement and care of roofs, gutters, downspouts, and exterior building surfaces.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6 To fulfill its obligation, the Declaration authorized the Association to levy assessments on its members. Additionally, the Declaration gave the Association the authority to\n   use assessment funds to \"establish[ ] and fund[ ] a reserve to cover major repair or replacement of improvements within the Common Areas.\" Developer also drafted and recorded the Association's Articles of Incorporation (the Articles). The Articles contained an indemnification provision that provided for indemnification of board members and officers under certain circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Corporation shall indemnify any and all of its officers or members of the Board of Trustees, or former officers or members of the Board of Trustees, or any person who may have actually and necessarily incurred by them in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding in which they or any of them are made parties, or a party, by reason of being or having been members of the Board of Trustees or officers of the Corporation, except in relation to matters as to which any member of the Board of Trustees or officer or former officer or member of the Board of Trustees or person shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 7 Developer turned over control of the Association to its members in 2008. At this point, the Association had $16,581 in its reserve account. After turnover, the Association retained an expert to conduct a reserve study to determine whether Developer had adequately funded the reserve account before handing the Association the reins. The reserve study indicated that by 2009, the reserve account's ideal balance would have been roughly $45,000. But the expert also concluded that the $16,581 starting balance \"indicate[d] a fair reserve fund position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 Shortly after the Association took control, a multitude of construction defects manifested themselves, apparently caused by water intrusion into the structural components of the living units. The Association retained a construction expert, who estimated the total cost of repair for the defects in the common areas and exterior surfaces of the units to be about $4,600,000. Over the next several years, the Association levied assessments on its members and paid for various repairs at the Gables with money from the Association's operating and reserve accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 In 2010, the Association sued Developer, alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranties, and joint-venture liability between Developer and Duke. Developer raised a counterclaim for indemnification, arguing that the Articles of Incorporation entitled it to indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 10 In 2011, Developer filed a third-party complaint against several of the subcontractors, including B.A. Critchfield Construction, LLC (Critchfield), Beus Roofing, Inc. (Beus), and R&amp;JL Siding and Management, LLC (R&amp;JL), alleging breach of contract, negligence, and indemnity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 11 This matter was heavily litigated with each party filing several pre- and post-trial motions. Three of those motions are relevant to this appeal: Critchfield's motions for summary judgment against the Association and Developer; Developer's motion for a directed verdict; and Developer's post-trial motion for indemnification of attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12 Critchfield moved for summary judgment against the Association, asserting that the Association lacked privity of contract with the Developer and that the Association could not prove a prima facie case of breach of implied warranty. R&amp;JL joined in the motion. Critchfield and Beus moved for summary judgment against Developer on the same or similar grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 In response, the Association argued that the Declaration created privity of contract. Two months after filing its opposition to Critchfield's motion for summary judgment, the Association moved for leave to file a supplemental brief. In its proposed supplemental brief, the Association asserted for the first time that the Real Estate Purchase Contracts (REPC) and warranty deeds also created privity of contract between the Association and Developer. The district court denied the Association's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 The district court granted Critchfield's motion against the Association and Developer. The district court concluded that the Declaration did not establish privity with Developer, noting that \"nothing in the Declaration ... speaks to whether [the Association] has the right to sue third parties for damages to the 'Living Units' on behalf of the homeowners.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Association filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court found was \"largely comprised of a recitation of the identical facts, exhibits and legal analysis\" that the district court addressed in its original ruling on the motion for summary judgment. The Association also argued that the district court erred in denying its motion for leave to file a supplemental argument. The district court denied the Association's motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 The district court explained that \"[t]he parties were given the appropriate opportunity to file dispositive motions and raise any issues or objections to those motions\" and the Association sought to supplement its opposition \"well after briefing in this matter was complete.\" The court concluded that \"it would be inequitable to allow [the Association] a 'second bite at the apple' to defeat summary judgment based solely on its failure to include a legal argument in support of its Opposition where the underlying facts and law were known at the time of filing the initial Opposition.\" The district court also explained that consideration of the Association's additional briefing \"would not change the Court's ruling,\" because the REPC did not \"indicate any intent by the contracting parties to ... confer third-party beneficiary status\" on the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Directed Verdict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Association presented its breach of fiduciary duty claims against Developer at trial. Duke, the Gables' property manager, the Association's president, several construction experts, an architectural expert, and a former Association board member testified. At the conclusion of the Association's case, Developer moved for directed verdict on several grounds. The district court granted Developer's motion, concluding that the Association needed expert testimony to establish the standard of care Developer owed to the Association. As the Association had failed to forward any evidence to establish the standard of care, the district court dismissed the Association's claims against Developer with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Indemnification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 Duke, as the owner and operator of the various Developer entities, filed a post-trial motion seeking indemnification from the Association of his defense costs and attorney fees. Duke asserted that the Association's Articles required the Association to indemnify him for attorney fees and costs because the court determined that he was not liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty as a member of the board of the Association. The Association argued that Duke's duties stemmed from his role as developer and not as a member of the Association's board, and was therefore not entitled to indemnification. The Association also argued that because \"the attorneys' fees and costs are themselves part of the merits of [Duke's] contractual indemnification claim,\" Duke needed to have raised his indemnification claim at trial. The district court granted Duke's motion, concluding that the indemnification's language provides for the indemnification of \"any and all of its officers or members of the Board of Trustees, or former officers or members of the Board of Trustees.\" The district court reasoned that because Duke is a former trustee of the Association, he is entitled to indemnification. The district court awarded attorney fees and costs to Duke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19 The Association appealed. Developer cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20 The Association raises three issues on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the Association argues that the district court erred when it granted Critchfield's motion for summary judgment. We review \"a summary judgment for correctness, giving no deference to the trial court's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Bahr v. Imus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987102\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/250/56/\">\n    2011 UT 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987102\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/250/56/\">\n    250 P.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21 Second, the Association contends that the district court erred when it granted Developer's motion for directed verdict. \"This [c]ourt's standard of review of a directed verdict is the same as that imposed upon a trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Merino v. Albertsons, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619912\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/975/467/\">\n    1999 UT 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619912\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/975/467/\">\n    975 P.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (citation omitted). \"A trial court is justified in granting a directed verdict only if, examining all evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no competent evidence that would support a verdict in the non-moving party's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619912\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/975/467/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"A motion for directed verdict can be granted only when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619912\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/975/467/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22 Third, the Association posits that the district court erred when it granted Duke's motion for indemnification of his defense costs and attorney fees. \"Whether a party may recover attorney fees in an action is a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Ault v. Holden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9423269\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/781/\">\n    2002 UT 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9423269\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/781/\">\n    44 P.3d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I. Motion for Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 23 The Association contends that the district court erred in two ways when it granted Critchfield's motion for summary judgment. The Association first argues that the district court erred when it concluded that the Association lacked privity of contract with Developer. The Association asserts that it \"enjoys privity of contract with [Developer] through the Declaration and as a third-party beneficiary to the Real Estate Purchase Contracts ... and deeds between [Developer] and the homeowners.\" The Association also argues that public policy demands that this Court find that it has privity of contract with Developer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 24 \"[I]n every contract for the sale of a new residence, a vendor in the business of building or selling such residences makes an implied warranty to the vendee that the residence is constructed in a workmanlike manner and fit for habitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Davencourt at Pilgrims Landing Homeowners Ass'n v. Davencourt at Pilgrims Landing, LC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994372\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/234/\">\n    2009 UT 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994372\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/234/\">\n    221 P.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To establish a breach of the implied warranty, a plaintiff must show: \"(1) the purchase of a new residence from a defendant builder-vendor/developer-vendor; (2) the residence contained a latent defect; (3) the defect manifested itself after purchase; (4) the defect was caused by improper design, material, or workmanship; and (5) the defect created a question of safety or made the house unfit for human habitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 25 In addition to the five elements of a prima facie case for breach of the implied warranty, a plaintiff must also show privity of contract with the developer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. This requirement stems from Utah code section 78B-4-513, which provides that \"an action for defective design or construction may be brought only by a person in privity of contract with the original contractor, architect, engineer, or the real estate developer.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-513(4) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994372\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/234/\">\n    2009 UT 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994372\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/234/\">\n    221 P.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, nothing in section 78B-4-513\"precludes a person from assigning a right under a contract to another person, including to a subsequent\n   owner or a homeowners association.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-513(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 The question before us asks whether the Association can establish privity of contract with Developer. The Association argues that the Declaration, the REPC, the warranty deeds, and public policy could all be used as a basis to establish privity of contract. We hold that the Association has not demonstrated privity of contract, but that holding is in part dictated by the Association's failure to timely raise its REPC/warranty deeds argument below and its failure to challenge directly the district court's decision to not address the untimely argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    A. The REPC and Warranty Deeds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 27 The Association argues the REPC and warranty deeds establish privity of contract between it and Developer. In essence, the Association claims it is an intended third-party beneficiary and that status gives rise to privity. Developer argues that the Association failed to properly preserve an argument based upon the REPC and warranty deeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously noted, the Association first raised these arguments in a proposed supplemental brief in opposition to Critchfield's motion for summary judgment. The district court denied the Association's motion to file a supplemental brief and did not consider the arguments contained in that brief. The Association later filed a motion to reconsider the district court's order granting Critchfield's motion for summary judgment and argued that the district court erred in declining to consider the Association's supplemental argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 28 The district court denied the Association's motion to reconsider and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The parties were given the appropriate opportunity to file dispositive motions and raise any issues or objections to those motions.... [The Association] filed their initial Opposition on October 11, 2013. It was not until over two months later, on December 18, 2013, that [the Association] sought to supplement its Opposition, well after briefing in this matter was complete and after the Motion was set for hearing. To allow additional briefing at that date was not, as [the Association] suggests, a routine matter with no impact on the parties. Consideration of the new legal theory expounded by [the Association], and allowing the other parties sufficient time to respond thereto would have delayed resolution of the majority of the dispositive motions.... Additionally, the court finds that it would be inequitable to allow [the Association] a \"second bite at the apple\" to defeat summary judgment based solely on its failure to include a legal argument in support of its Opposition where the underlying facts and law were known at the time of filing the initial Opposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29 The district court then briefly addressed the merits of the Association's REPC and warranty deeds argument and explained that \"consideration of [the Association's] additional briefing in support of its Opposition would not change the Court's ruling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30 On appeal, the Association argues that it is a third-party beneficiary to the REPCs and warranty deeds and that \"[i]n granting Critchfield's motion for summary judgment, the trial court failed to recognize privity in this regard and should be reversed.\" The\n   Association skips a step, however, by jumping straight to the merits of the argument. The district court declined to consider the Association's arguments on summary judgment because they were untimely. The Association must attack that decision before it can level up to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31 The district court denied the Association's motion for supplemental briefing. Although the court did not explain its reasoning at the time, in its order denying the Association's motion to reconsider, the court explained that it denied the Association's motion for supplemental briefing because the motion was untimely and \"the underlying facts and law were known at the time\" the Association filed its initial opposition. This is the type of decision we leave to the discretion of the district court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.

The Association has not even attempted to explain how the district court may have abused its discretion in concluding (1) that its supplemental argument was untimely, and (2) that the underlying facts and law were known to the Association at the time it filed its initial opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32 Nor does the Association assail the motion to reconsider. Indeed, the Association disregards the district court's order denying the motion to reconsider.

The Association failed to do either. Thus, we decline to address the merits of their REPC and warranty deeds argument. We accordingly limit our analysis to the issue that was before the district court when it granted summary judgment: that the Declaration creates privity between the Association and Developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    B.

The Association argued that section 6.1 \"grants [it] broad authority to act on behalf of owners in relation to action taken related to damage to association property, expressly the exterior maintenance of the Living Units.\" The Association does not quote section 6.1 in its opening brief, but does mention its \"right (and obligation) to maintain certain common property,\" and later quotes section 6.1 in its reply brief. Therefore, we assume that the Association's argument on appeal mirrors their argument below: that section 6.1 of the Declaration is an assignment of the homeowners' claims against Developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36 Utah law requires privity of contract to assert a claim for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike manner and habitability. Utah Code section 78B-4-513 provides that \"an action for defective design or construction may be brought only by a person in privity of contract with the original contractor, architect, engineer, or the real estate developer,\" but that \"[n]othing in this section precludes a person from assigning a right under a contract to another person, including to a subsequent owner or a homeowners association.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-513(4), (6). As noted above, the Association appears to contend that section 6.1 of the Declaration assigns the homeowners' right to sue to the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37 \"Restrictive covenants are a 'method of effectuating private residential developmental schemes' and give property owners in such developments the right to enforce those covenants against others in the development.\"\n   <em>\n    Fort Pierce Indus.

In\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson v.

The assignment provided that the developer transferred to the homeowner \"all ... right title and interest in and to any and all rights, claims, causes of action, choses in action, rights to payment, and judgments of any kind that [the developer] ha[d] asserted ... or may otherwise assert\" against the builder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (second omission in original). Although we ultimately determined that the assignment did not cover the claims that the homeowner brought against the builder, the language of that assignment is illustrative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 40 In contrast, here, the Declaration states that the Association \"shall provide exterior maintenance of the Living Units.\" The plain language of section 6.1 does not assign the homeowners' claims against Developer to the Association. The language \"shall provide exterior maintenance\" does not manifest the intent of the homeowner to transfer their right to pursue claims against Developer to the Association.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS \u00a7 324. Nor does the language \"shall provide exterior maintenance\" actually describe the subject matter of the purported assignment: the right to pursue claims against Developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 41 Tellingly, section 6.1 does not contain language such as \"assumes,\" \"assigns,\" \"transfers,\" or \"conveys\"-language traditionally indicative of assignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10405586\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/748/1102/#p1104\">\n    748 P.2d at 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not to say that an assignment must always contain precise, formulaic language. But the language must, at the very least, manifest a homeowner's intent to transfer her right to pursue claims. Accordingly, although we conclude that the statute does not require precise language of assignment, we nonetheless recognize that the statute contemplates an assignment that expresses some intent to actually assign a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    C. Public Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 42 The Association also argues that public policy favors finding privity. The Association cites\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"the scope of the implied warranty should be construed broadly to comport with ... public policy considerations,\" and argues that this language indicates that \"privity cannot be arbitrarily used to restrict the application of [the] implied warranty or other contract-based claims.\" Although we may favor a broad construction of the implied warranty, we cannot use public policy to rewrite an inconvenient statute. Section 78B-4-513 requires contractual privity between the party bringing an action for defective design or construction and \"the original contractor, architect, engineer, or the real estate developer\" or an assignment of the homeowner's right under the contract. And in\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   , we made it clear that privity of contract is required to bring a claim for breach of the implied warranty in accord with section 78B-4-513.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994372\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/234/\">\n    2009 UT 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 57 &amp; n.13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994372\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/234/\">\n    221 P.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 43 The Association raises a compelling argument that our current statutory scheme presents a challenge for homeowners associations attempting to represent their members' interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unfortunately, we cannot use public policy to rewrite an explicit statutory requirement. This is especially true where the legislature appears to have built in some protection against the result the Association fears; the statute recognizes that a homeowner can assign her claims to a homeowners association.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-513(6). At oral argument, the Association detailed a number of reasons why an assignment may not be not a practical solution to the problem-but that is an argument better made to the legislature to which our constitution has assigned the responsibility of amending and improving statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 44 Because the plain language of section 6.1 does not constitute an assignment of the homeowners' rights, the Association cannot maintain an action against Developer for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike manner and habitability. Therefore, we need not reach the Association's second argument that the district court erred in concluding that the Association's expert report was insufficient to establish a question of safety or habitability. We conclude that the district court did not err in granting Critchfield's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   II. Motion for Directed Verdict\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 45 The Association next contends that the district court erred in granting Developer's motion for directed verdict. The Association argues that \"the trial court erred in ruling that expert testimony is required to establish a standard of care for developers for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   limited fiduciary duty claims.\" The Association argues that because\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   defined a developer's limited fiduciary duty, the question of whether a developer breached its\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   duties is within a jury's common knowledge. Developer counters that expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care for a developer upholding the\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   limited fiduciary duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 46 This court has not previously examined when expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care in actions claiming breaches of the fiduciary duties\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   recognized. We have, however, examined the issue of when expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care in negligence claims. We conclude that our general framework for analyzing the necessity of expert testimony in negligence claims applies in the breach of fiduciary duty context. We begin with a discussion of the background of the\n   <em>\n    Davencourt\n   </em>\n   limited fiduciary duties, examine our framework for determining the necessity of expert testimony to establish the standard of care in negligence cases, and conclude with an application of that framework to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    A.

The district court improperly addressed his claim for indemnification in a post-trial motion for attorney fees.

We next conclude that the facts of this case present the type of duty and breach issues where the average person has little understanding of the duties owed by particular trades or professions, and expert testimony was required to establish the relevant standard of care. Accordingly, Developer was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and we hold that the district court correctly granted Developer's motion for a directed verdict. Finally, we conclude that the district court improperly\n   addressed Duke's indemnification claim in a post-trial motion for attorney fees and accordingly erred when it granted Duke's motion for attorney fees. We reverse the district court's award for indemnification of attorney fees and remand. Duke requests costs on appeal.

As Critchfield correctly points out, the Association never asserted a cause of action against Third-Party Defendants. Rather, the Association argued that their claim against Developer for breach of implied warranty \"pass[ed] through\" to Third-Party Defendants. When Critchfield filed a motion for summary judgment against the Association, it simultaneously filed a motion for summary judgment against Developer and relied on the same privity argument in both motions. The district court granted both motions in one order. Developer did not appeal the grant of summary judgment on its claims against Third-Party Defendants. Critchfield argues that because Developer did not appeal the order granting summary judgment, and Developer was the only party that asserted a direct claim against Third-Party Defendants, reversing the court's grant of summary judgment would create \"no practical effect or change in the circumstances\" with respect to Third-Party Defendants. We agree that because of this posture, no relief we could grant would result in revived claims against Third-Party Defendants.

The Association's brief may also be read to say that it was granted ownership of the common areas and that it enjoys privity of contract for that reason. To the extent the Association argues that its privity with Developer arises from ownership of the common areas, its argument is unpreserved and inadequately briefed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Generally, we will not consider an issue unless it has been preserved for appeal.\n    <em>\n     Patterson v.

The Association submitted a roughly 1,000-page exhibit to support its memorandum in opposition to Critchfield's motion for summary judgment. Perhaps somewhere in that tome, the Association's expert identified a defect in the common areas. This uncertainty highlights a major problem with the way the Association approached summary judgment. To comply with rule 56 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, a party must \"do more than attach evidence and hope the district judge [will] appreciate its significance.\"\n    <em>\n     Stichting Mayflower Mountain Fonds v.

The Association failed to do this below, and failed to do so on appeal. To the extent there is something in the expert report suggesting that there is a defect to be found in the common areas, the Association waived it before the district court by failing to comply with rule 56.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The Association argues that the statute creates the potential for a homeowners association to be left in an unjust and untenable circumstance at turnover. The Association contends that homeowners associations generally have a duty to maintain and repair common areas but cannot fulfill that duty if a developer fails to construct the development in a workmanlike manner and then fails to adequately fund the reserve account. The Association avers that because homeowners associations typically cannot assess units over a specified amount they are left with insufficient funds to carry out their duties, and no avenue to raise those funds. To add insult to injury, an association may have no avenue of recourse against the developer, because, the Association argues, the developer drafts an association's organizational documents and may structure them to prevent the association from having the privity it needs to pursue legal claims against the developer. Thus, says the Association, the party most responsible for the faulty construction can insulate itself from liability. Because the Utah Code establishes the privity requirement that underpins the Association's complaint, its arguments are better directed to the legislature.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code \u00a7 78B-4-513(4).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The Association argues that \"[i]t is a simple task for the jury to ... apply the facts to the law as instructed by the court and compare [the damages] figure with the amounts in the Association's reserve account.\" But the evidence the Association presented demonstrated that the initial reserve balance was adequate assuming no construction defects manifested themselves. The evidence also demonstrated that the reserve balance was insufficient to cover the expenses of repairing the construction defects. As noted, this evidence relates to the question of breach. However, the jury would not have been able to answer the question of breach without first understanding the appropriate standard of care by which to judge Developer's conduct. The Association did not explain to the jury why the amount of money in the reserve account at the time of turnover was insufficient compared to industry standards because the Association never demonstrated what the industry standards were.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The Association also argues that any opinion offered by an expert witness would be objectionable as a legal conclusion on the ultimate issue under rule 704 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Developer responds that \"[e]xpert testimony ... is required to establish the standard similarly situated developers must uphold.\" Developer argues that \"[t]he proffered [expert] testimony [would not be] a legal conclusion; rather, it informs the trier of fact with regard to the standard a reasonable developer is required to uphold under similar circumstances.\" Developer is correct. As we have explained above, expert testimony was required to establish the appropriate standard of care associated with the\n    <em>\n     Davencourt\n    </em>\n    duties. Although we can see that an expert could cross the line into territory that Utah Rule of Evidence 704 places out of bounds, we cannot assume that an expert necessarily would. The expert testimony contemplated by the district court pertained only to the standard of care, and accordingly would not automatically constitute a legal opinion on the ultimate issue under Utah Rule of Evidence 704. The proper objection would be to the specific opinion the expert rendered and not to all testimony on the topic of the standard of care.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The Association also argues that the indemnification clause found in the Articles does not apply in this case because [Developer's] independent fiduciary duty is distinct from a corporate fiduciary duty and that the indemnification clause should not be enforced as a matter of public policy. Because we conclude that the indemnification claim was an abandoned counterclaim, we need not address the Association's alternative arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    On these facts, Duke's claim resembles a prevailing party claim because the Association and Duke were the parties before the district court. But it is not difficult to imagine a situation where an individual homeowner brings the claim against the developer. In such a case, the developer would undoubtedly need to assert a cause of action against the homeowners association to obtain indemnification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
