She also appeals from the decree that incorporates the terms of the PSA, which the trial court approved and signed on July 5, 2017, and entered the following day. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's decisions. Contrary to Wife's position on appeal, we hold that neither Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) section 25-317(B) (2018)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Sharp v.

During the marriage, Wife had been a teacher. After she retired, Wife took on bookkeeping duties for Husband's family business, Hoenshied Family\n   Limited Partnership (HFLP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Husband is a self-employed real-estate investor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Before dissolution of the marriage, Husband and Wife participated in mediation, on May 26, 2016, wherein they addressed the division of their property, including business entities, a trust account, other financial accounts, and debts. The businesses were Blue Ink, LLC; D&amp;L Consulting, Inc.; and HFLP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Wife had consulted Kotzin Valuation Services (Kotzin) to assess the separate and marital community interest in these assets. Kotzin provided its valuation reports on May 17, 2016, prior to the mediation. A note contained in one of the Kotzin reports stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite repeated requests, Mr. Hutki never provided a clear listing of which business interests he believed to be community property and which he was claiming were sole and separate. As such, we performed our own procedures regarding the four identified business entities\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and came to the following conclusions. These conclusions could materially change if Mr. Hutki were to produce further documentation for how the interests were obtained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, a March 15, 2016 email from Kotzin informed Husband \"it looks like you have sent all of the items we have requested so far.\" During Kotzin's valuation, Husband also followed up with Kotzin to determine if additional information was needed. A valuation had also been done of \"a 1 percent limited partnership interest in [HFLP]\" in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Particularly as to HFLP, and relying on a 2015 partnership ledger of unit ownership, the Kotzin valuation concluded that 66.5 percent of the entities' shares, held by Husband and Wife, were rendered community property due to co-mingling of separate assets with community assets. The partnership had 99 limited partnership units. The Kotzin valuation noted Husband owned 62 limited partnership units, and 1 general partner unit, and Wife owned 3.5 limited partnership units. The shares were originally obtained as gifts to each party respectively. Husband, at various times, also had gifted away certain amounts of his limited partnership units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 At mediation, the parties reached full agreement regarding all but one issue-the division of three pieces of jewelry that were later awarded to Husband after a trial on the issue. The agreement specifically stated that \"[a]ny dispute the parties [had] with each other over the sole or separate or community nature of their interest in [HFLP] is compromised by the agreements herein.\" The agreement was reduced to writing pursuant to Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure (ARFLP) 69.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Husband and Wife acknowledged entering the PSA knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and with the advice of counsel. In her separate pre-trial statement relating to the jewelry, Wife also specifically acknowledged that, excepting the jewelry, the PSA \"equalized the parties' assets and liabilities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 About six months after the parties' agreement, Wife filed a \"Motion for Determination as to the Fairness of the Parties Property Division Agreement[,]\" (the Motion). In the Motion, Wife stated certain reasons she believed the PSA was unfair, and requested that the trial court \"make an independent determination of the fairness of the [PSA,]\" pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317(B), and\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   is the seminal case interpreting \u00a7 25-317(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Husband filed a \"Notice of Lodging Decree of Dissolution of Marriage\" pursuant to ARFLP 81. He requested that the court \"sign and enter the same ... or, alternatively, enter the parties' [PSA] as a final Decree in this case.\" Wife filed an objection to the lodged decree. Husband then filed a \"Notice of Lodging of Amended Decree (Amended Decree), which also reserved his right to file a response to the Motion. Husband subsequently\n   filed his response to the Motion. Wife did not file a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 In an unsigned minute entry filed January 5, 2017, the trial court denied the Motion after finding the PSA was \"fair\" and \"equitable[.]\" The court also indicated it would sign the Amended Decree given its conclusion regarding the PSA. The court signed Husband's Amended Decree. Wife timely appealed to this court from the signed decree. The trial court later issued another signed order, including the denial of the Motion and again stating it would sign Husband's Amended Decree. Wife then amended her appeal to challenge both the court's denial of the Motion and signing of the Amended Decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 The signed Amended Decree contained language \"reserv[ing] jurisdiction on the issue relating to the award of [the three pieces of jewelry.]\" After receiving Wife's appeal, this court requested the parties file memoranda addressing whether all issues had been resolved by the Amended Decree. Wife did not submit a memorandum. Husband submitted a memorandum asserting that all claims had been resolved and averred the decree erroneously indicated the jewelry issue remained outstanding. This court then stayed the appeal, and revested jurisdiction in the trial court to permit the trial court to consider a motion for an amended decree that did not include the reserving language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The parties subsequently stipulated to permit further amendment of the Amended Decree to exclude the statement reserving jurisdiction. A further amended decree, excluding the erroneous language (the Final Decree), was submitted to the trial court as an attachment to the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The trial court ultimately entered an order approving the stipulation and the Final Decree. The court signed and filed the Final Decree. Wife timely appealed from the signed Amended Decree and Final Decree (hereinafter, the Decree) and denial of the Motion. This court has jurisdiction over Wife's appeal pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 The dispositive issue before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion, in signing the Decree and denying the Motion, having found the PSA was fair and that there was no reason to set it aside. We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the trial court's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 We review the trial court's distribution of marital property for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez v.

The trial court's interpretation of a statute, such as section 25-317(B), is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Riepe v.

Whether the Trial Court Abused Its Discretion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Wife asserts the denial of the Motion and signing of the Decree fails, \"as a matter of law,\" because the trial court did not conduct a hearing to assess the PSA's fairness. On appeal, Wife argues that pursuant to section 25-317(B) and\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , the trial court was required to conduct a hearing-to allow the parties to present evidence, and consider the economic circumstances of the parties and other relevant evidence to determine the fairness of the PSA. She additionally argues that \"without stating so, the trial court's ruling improperly placed the burden of proving that the property settlement was unfair on [her.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 We find the trial court made a sufficient independent determination, as to the fairness and equitability\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the PSA, in compliance with section 25-317(B), and without\n   contravening\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, there is no basis for reversing the trial court's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 As a preliminary matter, we address Wife's burden of proof argument. Citing\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , Wife implicitly contends Husband was required to prove the validity of the PSA by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1484275\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/179/205/\">\n    179 Ariz. at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1484275\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/179/205/\">\n    877 P.2d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (stating \"[i]t is the burden of the party asserting the validity of the [separation or property] agreement to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it is fair and equitable\"). We conclude, in this case, the issue of burden is collateral, and not material, as evidence supporting the trial court's fairness determination was already in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Even if the burden issue was material to this appeal, we note\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Harber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630133\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/79/#p88\">\n    104 Ariz. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630133\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/79/#p88\">\n    449 P.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (1969), for the burden proposition Wife cites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1484275\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/179/205/\">\n    179 Ariz. at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1484275\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/179/205/\">\n    877 P.2d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However,\n   <em>\n    Harber\n   </em>\n   involved a post-nuptial agreement between married persons who were not \"contemplating separation or divorce.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630133\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/79/#p88\">\n    104 Ariz. at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630133\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/79/#p88\">\n    449 P.2d at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, as to the proposition, both\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harber\n   </em>\n   have been superseded by ARFLP 69, which directly applies to the relevant PSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Subsection B of ARFLP 69 states \"it shall be the burden of the party challenging the validity of the agreement to prove any defect in the agreement[.]\" Thus, to the extent this appeal is a challenge to the validity of the entire PSA, and the issue of burden could be deemed material, Wife bears such burden. There is nothing in the record supporting a conclusion that Wife has met such a burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Under the PSA, the parties were awarded their sole and separate property, any bank accounts existing in their own name, various vehicles,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and agreed to be responsible for and hold the other harmless for debts, except a residence awarded to Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 Wife additionally received the parties' Charles Schwab Investment Account (valued: $702,080), her retirement account (valued: $400,000), Husband's retirement account (valued: $37,000), two lots (valued: $250,000 each), a residence (valued: $1,420,000), cash value of Husband's life insurance policy (value not noted); equalization payments for vehicles (valued: $37,750); and another equalization payment of $400,000.

He received Blue Ink, LLC (valued: $32,000 fair market value); D&amp;L Consulting, Inc. (valued: $11,000 fair market value); and the HFLP assets (valued: $6,611,000 \"fair market value\" or $7,409,000 \"fair value\"). Husband was also awarded any refund from the parties' 2015 taxes, or he would have to pay taxes if any were owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 In the Motion, Wife did not challenge the entirety of the PSA, but instead proffered the following specific bases in contending the PSA was unfair:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1) Husband received more than two times the value of assets than was received by Wife in the Property Settlement; 2) Husband was in possession and control over all of the business interests, business accounts, and access to all of the financial information of the parties historically prior to the filing of the Petition for the Dissolution of Marriage, and exclusive possession and control during the divorce litigation; 3) Husband failed to disclose to Wife financial information necessary for her to make appropriate decisions as to whether the division of income tax liability or refunds for year 2015 was appropriate; 4) one of the major assets of the parties, certain real estate located on McDonald Drive, in Paradise Valley, Arizona, was not properly valued nor accounted for at the time the parties entered into a settlement agreement; 5) Husband failed to disclose that he had not property [sic] managed one of the investment accounts awarded to Wife in the Property Settlement Agreement and\n   Wife subsequently learned the value given by Husband for the asset during settlement negotiations was grossly inflated.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24 In responding to the Motion, Husband noted that Wife also had \"exclusive possession and control of over 10,000 pages of business account record and financial information of the parties,\" until she turned them over; that Wife \"had access to view accounts and other financial information;\" and that Wife was aware that Husband was making estimated tax payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 25 Husband further stated he made \"significant\" disclosures to Wife long before mediation, including, but not limited to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Charles Schwab account statements, business financial statements, personal financial statement, credit card statements, property deeds and titles, HFLP ownership ledger, HUD purchase statements, and many of the same financial and tax documents disclosed by Petitioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Husband noted that Wife, having held the Charles Schwab account for years, had been aware that the account included \"imbedded capital gains\" which resulted in a reduction in the awarded value of the account. He contended he had consistently asserted that each party had their own separate property interest in HFLP. Husband also suggested it would be inappropriate, in the trial court's determination of whether the PSA was fair, for it to consider fluctuations in the value of HFLP based on market conditions. Because Wife did not file a reply to Husband's response, she failed to contest his responsive contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 In substantively reviewing the trial court's fairness determination, we consider the language of section 25-317(B) and\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   .

Further, the trial court made an\n   independent determination regarding whether the instant PSA was fair and equitable, and we find that determination was firmly within the bounds of reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 We consider that the record before the trial court, in reviewing the PSA, contained, among other things: the agreement's notation that the parties had compromised regarding any dispute as to the nature of their interest in HFLP; the parties' pretrial statements; the Motion and Husband's response; the Kotzin valuations of the various assets-including whether these assets were separate property or community interests; Wife's counsel's communication to Husband's counsel suggesting Husband had not provided Kotzin with sufficient information for valuation purposes, and asserting Wife's allegations that she believed Husband had withdrawn funds from the Charles Schwab account to overpay 2015 taxes; Husband's communications with Kotzin, prior to mediation, answering Kotzin's questions, providing documents, and confirming whether additional information was needed; Husband's counsel's communication with Wife's counsel addressing Wife's valuation contentions, and reminding that during the mediation, even though Husband had disagreed with the Kotzin valuation of HFLP, Husband continued the mediation in good faith rather than seeking a second opinion, and that Wife had \"refused to accept equal responsibility for any potential 2015 tax liability and agreed that in exchange for [Husband] accepting the same he would also be entitled to any overpayment of the taxes[;]\" and the 2013 valuation pertaining to HFLP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 With this record, in determining the PSA was fair\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and declining to set it aside, \"in whole or in part[,]\" and in deciding to sign the Decree and deny the Motion, the court made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Wife either had full knowledge of or at the very least had full access to the financial information she now says supports her claim that the Agreement is unfair. Both parties negotiated off of a set of assumptions that were subject to interpretation. Wife took the risk that Kotzin valuation could be high or low, or that there would be a 2015 tax refund. Her allegation that she \"believes\" Husband withdrew money to deliberately overpay taxes is supported by no facts and no documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   This Agreement was carefully negotiated and created an equitable division of the parties' assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 32 Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , we cannot say the trial court had no basis or evidence in the record to support its decisions. Moreover, without a finding of unfairness, the PSA was \"binding on the court.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's decisions denying the Motion and signing the Decree, that included the PSA, to which both parties agreed, in writing, with the advice of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Attorneys' Fees and Costs Pursuant to A.R.S. Section 25-324\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33 Both parties request an award of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in this appeal pursuant to A.R.S. section 25-324 (2018). The statute permits a court to order one party in a dissolution of marriage action to pay the reasonable costs and fees of the other upon considering the financial resources of both parties, and the reasonableness of their positions throughout the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1484275\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/179/205/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 25-324(A). We decline to award fees to either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 34 For the foregoing reasons, and having found Wife has not shown the trial court abused its discretion, we affirm the trial court's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    We cite to the current version of a statute unless the statute was amended after the pertinent events and such amendment would affect the result of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    HFLP is engaged in buying, renovating, and reselling residential and commercial properties.
