We hold that the defendant's rights were not violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 On the night of September 11, 2014, two Cochise County Sheriff's Deputies on patrol in Willcox began following a vehicle after observing it turn at several intersections in an apparent effort to elude the officers. While following the vehicle, the officers ran a license plate check, which indicated that the vehicle's insurance had been cancelled the previous month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 The officers turned on their emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop for the insurance cancellation and, seconds later, the vehicle drove onto the shoulder of the road, ran\n   over a curb as it maneuvered onto a private driveway, and led officers along the length of the driveway and into the backyard area of a residence. The officers did not know if the vehicle's driver had a connection to the property, but one officer stated that he followed the vehicle \"because that's where the vehicle took us when we attempted to stop it.\" One of the officers testified that he did not perceive any immediate danger to himself or the public, but the other officer testified that he thought it necessary to contact the driver because his actions posed a potential danger to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The driver, Anthony Lito Hernandez, stopped the vehicle, opened the door, and began to step out. An officer told Hernandez to remain inside the vehicle. On approaching the vehicle, the officer smelled marijuana and ordered Hernandez to get out and place his hands behind his back. During a pat-down search, the officer found $2,446 in cash and an empty plastic baggie. Inside the vehicle, the officers found a burned marijuana cigarette, a metal spoon with char marks on the bottom and \"a burnt substance in it,\" and a clear plastic baggie containing suspected methamphetamine. Hernandez told the officer he did not know the property owner, but the home was later determined to be occupied by his girlfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Hernandez was indicted for possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and transporting methamphetamine for sale. After the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized from him and his vehicle, a jury found Hernandez guilty of those offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In a divided opinion, the court of appeals affirmed, stating that \"[a] police officer in continuous vehicular pursuit of a person under investigation for a violation of the law cannot be arbitrarily stopped by the person's entry onto private property,\" and that \"[a]ny contrary rule would encourage flight to avoid apprehension.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The officers' entry onto the driveway to effectuate a traffic stop that began on a public road does not change the analysis because Hernandez effectively invited them there. As one of the officers testified, he followed Hernandez onto private property because \"that's where the vehicle took us when we attempted to stop it.\" Hernandez's claim that he did not try to flee or elude the traffic stop is of no moment. By leading pursuing officers onto an ungated driveway, Hernandez impliedly consented to the officers' entry onto the curtilage to complete the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 To the extent Hernandez contends that he was unaware of the officers' efforts to stop him, the record (viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court's ruling) belies his claim and supports the trial court's implicit findings. Before the officers attempted to initiate the traffic stop, Hernandez made several suspicious turns, which caused the officers to believe he was attempting to elude them. Hernandez's seemingly erratic maneuvers, while perfectly legal and perhaps understandable, provide context for the ensuing events; they render implausible any suggestion that he was unaware that the officers were following and, ultimately, attempting to stop him. After the officers initiated the traffic stop by activating their emergency lights and following Hernandez for a few seconds, Hernandez drove over a curb and into the backyard area rather than pull his vehicle over on the wide shoulder of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Hernandez suggests that, because the officers were following him closely, he likely did not have sufficient time to safely stop on the road. But even if true, this would not absolve Hernandez of his legal obligation to comply with the traffic stop, nor would it explain why he could not have stopped in the road after passing his girlfriend's driveway. In any event, his speculation undercuts his claim because it demonstrates his likely awareness of the officers' attempt to stop him and belies his purported inability to stop on the road because he managed, instead, to execute an abrupt turn onto the driveway.

But the Court has never expressly held, based on considered analysis, that article 2, section 8 's first provision, protecting a person's \"private affairs\" against warrantless government intrusion, is coextensive with the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of Fourth Amendment protections. Given that we have recognized that the second provision provides greater protection than the Fourth Amendment, it would be odd to construe the first provision more narrowly, in lockstep with the Supreme Court's ever-evolving Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such arguments could properly encompass the constitutional text's plain meaning, its context in our Declaration of Rights, its history and purpose, and analysis of similar provisions in other state constitutions. I agree with my colleagues that it is not obviously apparent that article 2, section 8 proscribes the police conduct here. But further consideration of this provision's scope must await future cases.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
