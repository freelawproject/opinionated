The jury concluded Appellant committed sexual intrusion upon a non-consenting victim who he knew or had reason to believe was physically helpless. He now appeals, claiming his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Appellant presents the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Did trial counsel provide ineffective assistance of counsel by her failure to object to inadmissible evidence and failure to adequately advance her theory of the case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Did trial counsel provide ineffective assistance of counsel by her failure to suppress the statements made by Appellant when under investigative detention?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b63] At approximately 11:00 p.m., on July 11, 2015, Appellant travelled to the Peppermill Bar in Cheyenne to meet his girlfriend, Victoria Seeley. While there, Appellant also saw an acquaintance, Chris Jones. Mr. Jones was joined by his girlfriend, who is the victim in this matter, and his roommate. Following last call, Mr. Jones invited Appellant and the others to his home. Upon arrival, Mr. Jones provided a tour of the split-level home, finally convening in the kitchen area on the upper level where they socialized and consumed alcohol through most of the early morning hours of July 12th.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] The victim eventually retired to Mr. Jones' bedroom, which is located a few feet from the kitchen area and adjacent to a bathroom. She was absent from the group for at least twenty minutes-but as much as an hour and a half-before Appellant excused himself from the company of Mr. Jones and Ms. Seeley, stating he was going to the bathroom. Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes later, the victim emerged from Mr. Jones' bedroom into the kitchen area. According to Ms. Seeley, the victim appeared very upset and left the residence without speaking. The victim travelled on foot to a neighbor's home across the cul-de-sac where she reported Appellant sexually assaulted her as she slept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] The neighbor called law enforcement, who arrived at Mr. Jones' residence shortly thereafter. Law enforcement questioned the witnesses, including Appellant. Appellant denied the allegations, but then requested he be handcuffed and taken to the police station due to his fear for his personal safety if he remained at the residence. Law enforcement accommodated his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] At the station, Appellant cooperated with law enforcement by providing a DNA sample and consenting to the review of his cell phone. He was free from handcuffs or restraints. The detective provided\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisements to Appellant. Appellant agreed to questioning which was videotaped. Even though the questioning evolved from conversational to accusatorial, Appellant continued to vehemently deny the allegations. The questioning lasted for about an hour and a half, after which Appellant was placed under arrest. The entire process at the station took about three hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] Appellant's trial counsel proceeded to trial without seeking suppression of the statements made to police at the station. At trial, the State introduced the videotaped recording containing those statements. Appellant's trial counsel stipulated to its admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] During trial, Appellant's counsel focused on undermining essential elements of the crime including developing facts and argument to demonstrate the unlikelihood that the victim was helpless. During opening statements, Appellant's counsel noted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   There's absolutely no reason to believe or evidence to support that [the victim] was unconscious or suffering from some physical impairment that would not allow her to communicate what her desires were. And, moreover, while she may have initially\n   been sleeping, it's not plausible that she slept through having her sweatpants removed, kissing, and the initiation of sexual intercourse as she described this happening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] During cross-examination of witnesses, defense counsel focused on the degree of intoxication of the witnesses, the victim's immediate behavior after the assault, and the implausibility of the victim sleeping through the removal of her pants. With the responding officer, counsel elicited law enforcement's failure to administer sobriety tests of the witnesses. Finally, Appellant's counsel cross-examined forensic witnesses about the victim's lack of physical injury and about a DNA test result which excluded Appellant. Appellant did not testify or present any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b610] In closing, Appellant's trial counsel argued that the State's witnesses, particularly Mr. Jones and the victim, lacked credibility, and counsel offered examples of their contradictory testimony. Defense counsel used the videotaped interview to argue that, even though officers implemented aggressive interview techniques, Appellant's denial and explanation remained steadfast from \"top to bottom\" in spite of the interview techniques. Finally, defense counsel again argued the improbability that the victim slept through the removal of her clothing and the initiation of sexual intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b611] Prior to sentencing, Appellant's appellate counsel entered his appearance. The district court imposed a sentence of five to eight years in the penitentiary, which was suspended in favor of eight years of supervised probation. Appellant did not raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial court. He timely filed this appeal. Additional facts will be further detailed as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b612] Appellant asserts his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to inadmissible evidence, failing to advance the theory of the case, and failing to move to suppress Appellant's videotaped statements to police. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel involve mixed questions of law and fact that the Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

However, attacking the victim's level of intoxication may have been a slippery slope. If the victim was highly intoxicated, the jury might more easily find the State proved the victim was helpless. If the victim was only slightly intoxicated, then the victim's ability to perceive and remember may have been less impaired and potentially more reliable in the eyes of a jury. Instead, trial counsel actively sought to tarnish the credibility of the witnesses based on their consumption of alcohol. Additionally, trial counsel tried to demonstrate that the victim was not \"helpless\" at the time of the incident as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-302\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(iii), and endeavored to show that Appellant could not have known that the victim was \"helpless.\" Trial counsel's approach was consistent through her argument to the jury. Considering the flaws in Appellant's suggested approach on appeal compared with counsel's approach at trial, Appellant has failed to demonstrate trial counsel was deficient and therefore ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b624] Second, Appellant contends trial counsel failed to exploit \"the time frames about how long she [the victim] had been sleeping\" prior to the assault. Appellant's argument appears to center around whether there was enough time for the victim to be asleep after she left the kitchen. Such argument is contrary to the efforts of trial counsel. It is clear trial counsel cross-examined the victim about her sleep and whether she could have remained sleeping while having her pants removed. Trial counsel further asked the jury to consider whether it was reasonable to conclude the victim was asleep or could remain sleeping. Again, Appellant has failed to demonstrate trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Failure to Move to Suppress Custodial Statements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b625] Appellant asserts his statements were involuntarily made to police and his trial counsel should have moved to suppress the statements. However, the Court\n   has long held \"[t]he failure to file a suppression motion does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Lancaster v.

Trial counsel stipulated to the admission of the interview. A reviewing court may never fully know the purposes of counsel's trial strategy, but this Court will not second guess trial strategy unless it so undermines the proper functioning of the adversarial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mraz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774822\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/280/\">\n    378 P.3d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Luftig\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994741\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/857/\">\n    228 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   864 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b627] Given the nature of the charged offense in this case, one simple conclusion is that allowing the jury to see the taped interview created more benefit than detriment. Although Appellant offered some inconsistent statements during the interview, he repeatedly denied the allegations as argued by his trial counsel. The initial statements made by Appellant were fairly casual and did not change after more aggressive interrogation. Counsel consistently weaved Appellant's repudiation of the accusations throughout opening statements, trial, and closing argument. In closing, trial counsel argued that any inconsistent statements in the video were slight, even though the State attempted to exaggerate them. Counsel reminded the jury to review the tape, make a determination on their own, and submitted that there existed no meaningful inconsistencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b628] Appellant failed to carry his \"heavy\" burden of showing inadequate performance of his trial counsel, especially considering the \"strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mraz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774822\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/280/\">\n    378 P.3d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
