On May 5, 2014, the City of Missoula (the City) filed an amended complaint seeking condemnation of the water system. The Fourth Judicial District Court issued a Preliminary Order of Condemnation under \u00a7 70-30-206, MCA, on June 15, 2015. This Court affirmed the Preliminary Order of Condemnation in\n   <em>\n    City of Missoula v. Mt. Water Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460395\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/384/193/\">\n    2016 MT 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460395\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/384/193/\">\n    384 Mont. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460395\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/384/193/\">\n    378 P.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 On October 26, 2015, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 70-30-302(5), MCA, which provides that an award of compensation does not include improvements made to condemned property, was unconstitutional as applied to Mountain Water. Therefore, Mountain Water sought compensation for improvements made to the condemned property after May 5, 2014. A Condemnation Commissioner hearing was held in November 2015 to determine the amount of just compensation. The Commissioners determined that the fair market value of the water system, including all improvements, was $88.6 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Following the Commissioners' valuation, Mountain Water sought interest for the time period prior to the City taking possession based on the Commissioners' $88.6 million valuation. On April 6, 2016, the District Court denied an award of interest concluding the plain language of \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA, in conjunction with \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, did not entitle Mountain Water to post-summons interest because the City never took interlocutory possession of the condemned property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 On May 3, 2016, the District Court determined Mountain Water and Carlyle were prevailing parties entitled to recover necessary\n   expenses pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-305(2), MCA. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court awarded Carlyle $1,111,659.94 and Mountain Water $2,800,745.57 for litigation expenses. However, Carlyle's litigation expenses remain in escrow pending the outcome of the appeal to the Montana Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The City then moved for the Court to \"oversee and supervise the transition of ownership and possession.\" The City specifically sought access to data such as customer and human resource information prior to taking possession. On January 4, 2017, the District Court granted the City limited access to Mountain Water's data to ensure a smooth transition of the public utility. However, the District Court repeatedly stated giving limited access to the City did not grant the City a possessory right in the water system. Consequently, the District Court rejected Mountain Water's argument that allowing the City access to limited data qualified as a transfer of possession pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 On June 5, 2017, Mountain Water and the City entered into a Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement provided the City would take possession of Mountain Water's condemned property simultaneously upon the City paying Mountain Water for all assets and claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserted in the condemnation action, the FBO refunds and the Carlyle Litigation Expenses. The Settlement Agreement provided the City would pay approximately $84 million, which included payment for improvements made during the pendency of the condemnation and for attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 On June 15, 2017, the District Court entered its Final Judgment in Condemnation. The Judgment included the agreed payment method and transfer of possession between the City and Mountain Water as set forth in the Settlement Agreement. On June 22, 2017, the District Court signed the Final Order of Condemnation in open court and the City tendered its check to Mountain Water pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Final Order stated the City would take title and possession of all condemned assets upon the filing of the Order with the County Clerk. The Order was subsequently filed and recorded by the County Clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 On July 18, 2017, Mountain Water again sought post-summons interest and requested an evidentiary hearing. Subsequently, on\n   November 9, 2017, the District Court denied Mountain Water's motion for statutory interest pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA, for the same reasons set forth in its April 6, 2016 order. The District Court further refused to grant Mountain Water discretionary interest based on our decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Billings v.

Mountain Water maintains the City took possession pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA. Mountain Water also argues the District Court improperly relied on federal law to determine Montana's statutory scheme regarding condemnation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, Mountain Water argues it is entitled to discretionary interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 The City asserts the District Court correctly concluded Mountain Water was not entitled to interest pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA. The City argues \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, does not apply because the City did not make payment into court and the City did not take interlocutory possession. The City further maintains Mountain Water is not entitled to discretionary interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits governmental entities from taking private property for public use under the power of eminent domain without paying \"just\n   compensation.\" Similarly, the Montana Constitution prohibits the taking or damaging of private property for public use \"without just compensation to the full extent of the loss having been first made to or paid into court for the owner.\" Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 29. \"A taking does not occur until: (1) legal title vests in the condemnor, (2) the condemnor enters into actual possession, or (3) the condemnor takes constructive possession either by causing damage to property or by depriving the owner of full beneficial use of his land.\"\n   <em>\n    Mt.

Accordingly, we are guided by the long-held maxim that legislative intent must first be determined from the plain words used in the statute, and when that is possible no other means of interpretation are proper.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cooksey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754156\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/366/346/\">\n    2012 MT 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754156\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/366/346/\">\n    366 Mont. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754156\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/366/346/\">\n    286 P.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's role is to ascertain and declare what is in \"terms or in substance contained\" in a statute, and \"not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted.\" Section 1-2-101, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 The District Court's interpretation of the statutes is correct; \u00a7 70-30-302(2), and \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, are meant to be read together. Section 70-30-302(2), MCA, requires a condition precedent before awarding interest. This condition precedent occurs when the condemnor takes possession prior to the final condemnation order. Based on the plain language of \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA, we reject Mountain Water's argument that \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA, mandates interest regardless of the condition precedent of acquiring possession under \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 We next turn to whether the City obtained possession under \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA. Section 70-30-311(1), MCA, allows a condemnor to take possession of the condemned property before final judgment is entered.\n   <em>\n    Bozeman Parking Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2556640\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/107/#p113\">\n    190 Mont. at 113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2556640\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/107/#p113\">\n    619 P.2d at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute provides: (1) if the condemnor makes a payment into court of either condemnee's statement of claim of just compensation or the amount assessed by either the commissioners or the jury, then (2) the\n   condemnor may maintain or obtain possession of the condemned property during the pendency and until the final conclusion of the proceedings and litigation. Section 70-30-311(1)(a)(i)-(ii), MCA. For the reasons stated below, we conclude the City did not obtain possession through \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 At the outset, we determine the City did not take possession through a court order pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-311(1), MCA. The City took possession based on the agreed upon method in the Settlement Agreement. In\n   <em>\n    K&amp;R P'ship\n   </em>\n   , we determined that when\n   two parties voluntarily entered into an agreement which granted possession of the condemned property to the condemnor, the transfer of possession did not fall within the parameters of \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA.\n   <em>\n    K&amp;R P'ship\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 65. Here, the City took possession as the parties agreed to in the Settlement Agreement. The City did not take possession of the condemned property as set forth in \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 We are further unpersuaded by Mountain Water's arguments that the City obtained possession of the condemned property under \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA. First, the predicate condition of \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, required the City to make payment into court of either the condemnee's statement of claim or as decided by the commissioners or by the jury. Section 70-30-311(1)(a), MCA. As set forth in the Settlement Agreement, the City paid Mountain Water directly. The City did not make a payment into court. Furthermore, the amount paid to Mountain Water was neither the amount in its statement of claim or as decided by the commissioners. The amount paid to Mountain Water was an agreed upon amount as set forth in the Settlement Agreement. Therefore, the record is clear the City did not make a payment into court as required by \u00a7 70-30-311(1)(a), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 25 Second, an order issued under \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, would have put the City in actual possession of the condemned property during the pendency and until the final conclusion of the proceedings. Section 70-30-311(1)(a)(ii), MCA. It is clear the City took possession only after the final conclusion of the proceedings. We have previously held Mountain\n   Water retained \"continuing possession of the property pending a final order of condemnation .... Mountain Water continues to own and possess the property and to be responsible for the taxes until the transfer of title by entry of a final order.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Revenue\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. Until the entry of the Final Judgment in Condemnation, Mountain Water retained possession of the condemned property. Specifically, the Final Judgment adopted the Settlement Agreement's condition that transfer of actual possession would occur upon the City's payment directly to Mountain Water in full satisfaction of all claims. This exchange occurred on June 22, 2017, in open court. Based on the record, it is evident the City did not take possession of the condemned property prior to final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 26 Inter alia, Mountain Water maintains the Final Judgment in Condemnation order is not the \"final conclusion of the proceedings and litigation\" because several ancillary issues remain undecided since the issuance of the Final Judgment. We disagree. The Final Judgment expressly stated the order \"constitutes a final determination as to all issues raised in the City's Complaint as to the Assets and as to all matters pertaining to damages and compensation due for the taking of the Assets, except as expressly set forth herein and in the Settlement Agreement.\" The ancillary issues reserved within the Settlement Agreement do not prolong \"final conclusion\" of the proceedings because the Final Judgment of Condemnation was issued and satisfied by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 27 For the above stated reasons, we conclude the City did not take interlocutory possession of the condemned property pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, because the City did not make a payment into court and the City did not obtain actual possession until the final conclusion of the proceedings. As such, the District Court did not err in concluding Mountain Water failed to satisfy \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA, which would have entitled it to statutory interest as set forth in \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 28 Mountain Water further argues it is entitled to discretionary interest as set forth in our decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Billings\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    City of Billings\n   </em>\n   , the City of Billings sought to condemn property near the airport.

In\n   <em>\n    City of Billings\n   </em>\n   , the condemned property was vacant and unimproved land where the owners were completely deprived of all economical use upon the date of service of the summons.\n   <em>\n    City of Billings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2374083\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/257/99/\">\n    257 Mont. at 102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2374083\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/257/99/\">\n    847 P.2d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the City did not take constructive possession of the condemned property. The condemned property was a developed public utility and the property owner, Mountain Water, was entitled to all economic use including revenue derived from the property during the condemnation proceedings. Significantly, Mountain Water was compensated for any improvements made to the property during the proceedings because the District Court determined \u00a7 70-30-302(5), MCA, was unconstitutional as applied to Mountain Water. Consequently, Mountain Water was not completely deprived of all economical use of its property. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    City of Billings\n   </em>\n   is not applicable under the circumstances. We conclude the District Court did not err in denying Mountain Water's request for discretionary interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 We hold the District Court did not err in concluding Mountain Water was not entitled to statutory interest pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA, when read in conjunction with \u00a7 70-30-311, MCA. Specifically, the City did not take interlocutory possession of the condemned property prior to final conclusion of the condemnation proceedings.
