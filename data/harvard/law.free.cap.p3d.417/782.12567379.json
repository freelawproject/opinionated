The provision does not apply to \"[a]ircraft owned by a nonresident who operates aircraft for a period not in excess of ninety days in any one calendar year, provided that such aircraft are not engaged in any intrastate commercial activity.\" Ariz. Const. art. 9, \u00a7 15 (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Arizona's aircraft tax scheme prescribes various license tax rates for nonresidents who own noncommercial aircraft registered in this state.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-8335 to -8341. Relevant here is A.R.S. \u00a7 28-8336, which establishes a license tax of 0.1% of the average fair market value of the aircraft when the \"aircraft is based in this state for more than ninety days but less than two hundred ten days in a calendar year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Although the statute does not define \"day,\" both sides argue that its meaning is clear. Yet their respective definitions are as different as night and day: BSI and the tax court define \"day\" as a full 24-hour period, while ADOT and the court of appeals define it as any period of time within a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Because the legislature did not define \"day\" for \u00a7 28-8336 purposes, we look to the term's ordinary meaning. Although \"day\" is a commonly used word, it has no fixed meaning. When we speak of a term of days, e.g., the first hundred days of a presidential administration, we generally mean 24-hour days. Yet in other situations, e.g., forty days and forty nights, we differentiate between days and nights. In terms of work or play-\"I work five days a week\"-people generally understand we are talking about increments of days. Sometimes days can embrace different fractions of days-\"I went to the library every day this week\"-and could mean ten minutes or 24-hours. As demonstrated by these examples, most often the listener discerns the meaning of \"day\" based on the context in which it is used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Dictionaries reflect these divergent meanings in both the ordinary and legal use.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/day (last updated May 15, 2018) (variously defining \"day\" as \"the time of light between one night and the next,\" \"the period of rotation of a planet,\" \"a specified time or period,\" or \"the time established by usage or law for work, school, or business\");\n   <em>\n    see also Day\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"day\" as \"[a]ny 24-hour period,\" the \"period between the rising and the setting of the sun,\" or \"[a]ny specified time period\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 ADOT urges upon us the common law meaning of the term \"day,\" which it argues we should adopt pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 1-201 (stating the common law, when not repugnant to the written law, \"is adopted and shall be the rule of decision in all courts of this state\"). The common law \"deems any fraction of a day to be a 'day.' \"\n   <em>\n    Maciborski v. Chase Serv. Corp. of Ariz.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482193\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/557/#p562\">\n    161 Ariz. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482193\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/557/#p562\">\n    779 P.2d 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1301 (App. 1989). We find this argument unpersuasive because the cases ADOT cites involve terms of days, such as statutes of limitations. In such circumstances, the question presented is whether the first and last fraction of a day should be counted with the understanding that the days in between are 24-hour days. Here, by contrast, the aircraft taxation statutes do not always involve a term of consecutive days.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 28-8322 (exempting from taxation aircraft based in the state \"not more than ninety consecutive days or ninety days in any one calendar year\"). ADOT urges us to consider as a full day every fraction of a day, whether consecutive or not. But the common law definition addresses counting days in a different context and thus is not dispositive here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Other definitions and uses of \"day\" in Arizona law cut in different directions. As the court of appeals noted,\n   <em>\n    BSI Holdings\n   </em>\n   , 242 Ariz. at 625 \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310595\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/621/\">\n    399 P.3d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the legislature sometimes has clarified when a specified time period refers to the entirety of that period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 28-8324(B)(1) (\"full month\"); \u00a7\u00a7 11-1601(9), 48-3641(8) (defining \"[w]orking day\" as a 24-hour period). But several other statutes within Title 28 refer to days or parts of days, demonstrating that the legislature refers to fractions of a day when it wants to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-693(F), 28-708(E), 28-1387(C), 28-5707(B), 28-5921(D), 28-8290(A)(1)-(2). Unfortunately, the legislature did not use any of these clarifying terms here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Nor are we bound to follow ADOT's present interpretation of the statute. Whatever deference we might pay to such an interpretation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stambaugh\n   </em>\n   , 242 Ariz. at 512 \u00b6\u00b6 21-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310521\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/508/\">\n    398 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   578 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (Bolick, J., concurring), none is due here. The term is not a technical one requiring expertise to construe it. Nor has the agency's position in this litigation been reduced to written policy, much less a considered and established rule. Conversely, ADOT promulgated a rule in the vehicle registration context defining \"day\" as \"the 24-hour period from one midnight to the following midnight.\" Ariz. Admin. Code R17-4-301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 The statutes' purpose of generating fees from users does not dictate a clear outcome either. On one hand, if an aircraft begins the day in Arizona, flies to San Diego at lunchtime, then returns to Arizona, it may have imposed costs on the Arizona airport, yet its operations would not count as a day for tax purposes under BSI's formulation. Under ADOT's definition, by contrast, an aircraft could briefly touch down in Arizona on multiple days and expose itself to higher tax rates even if it barely uses Arizona facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 That brings us to the crux of the difficulty in determining the meaning of the word \"day\" in \u00a7 28-8336. We must not interpret terms in isolation, but rather in their overall context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Braden ex rel. Gabaldon v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755834\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/323/\">\n    228 Ariz. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325-26 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755834\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/323/\">\n    266 P.3d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351-52 (2011) (stating that the Court does not \"consider words in isolation when interpreting statutes\" and that \"[s]tatutory terms ... must be considered in context\"). The context in which \"day\" is used is when an aircraft is \"based in\" Arizona. \"Based in\" is also statutorily undefined and nebulous, and neither the parties, the tax court, nor the court of appeals provided significant analysis of this phrase. Determining the meaning of the word \"day\" thus cannot dispose of the issue in this case because the statute cannot be meaningfully applied without also knowing what \"based in\" means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 BSI conceded it was \"based in\" Arizona for the 24-hour periods it was on the ground during the years in question, a concession it may not now relitigate. Thus, the only issue properly before us is whether, for purposes of \u00a7 28-8336, the aircraft was \"based in\" Arizona for fewer than 210 days during the calendar years in question; and that issue could turn on whether an aircraft ceases to be \"based in\" Arizona for tax purposes on days it leaves the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21 In the tax court, ADOT said it \"makes its determination of whether an aircraft is 'based in this state' by inspecting the totality of the circumstances, including: day count, the aircraft's use, and tie-down and hangar agreements.\" But it never explained how it applies those factors. Indeed, BSI disputes that ADOT has used any other criteria other than a day count. Because the matter was decided on summary judgment, the tax court made no factual findings on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 22 \"Base\" is generally defined as \"that on which something rests for support; foundation.\"\n   <em>\n    Base\n   </em>\n   , Webster's New International Dictionary 225 (2d ed. 1944);\n   <em>\n    see also Base\n   </em>\n   , Webster's II New College Dictionary 92 (1995) (defining base as \"a fortified center of operations\"). Used as a verb in legal parlance, it means \"[t]o take up or maintain one's headquarters\" or \"to have one's main place of work in a particular place.\"\n   <em>\n    Base\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Those definitions imply more of a domiciliary analysis rather than physical presence alone.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeWitt v. McFarland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"584708\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/112/33/#p33\">\n    112 Ariz. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"584708\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/112/33/#p33\">\n    537 P.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20-21 (1975) (establishing the domicile requirements for income tax purposes and that \"one is never without a domicile somewhere\"). Indeed A.R.S. \u00a7 28-8341(C), another aircraft tax statute, defines \"maintenance aircraft\" as one \"that is not based in this state but that is present in this state solely for the purpose of maintenance, repair or servicing at a federal certified maintenance facility.\" That language suggests that \"based\" has a more technical meaning that is different than, and more than, mere physical presence. However, because \"base\" may have a technical meaning in this statutory or factual context, on the record before us we cannot determine its meaning and therefore cannot fully resolve the case without further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 The court of appeals held that \"an aircraft is based in Arizona\" for purposes of\n   \u00a7 28-8336\"for any day during which it is physically present on the ground in this state for any period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    BSI Holdings\n   </em>\n   , 242 Ariz. at 625 \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310595\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/621/\">\n    399 P.3d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But \"day\" cannot be construed to sustain the court's holding that an aircraft's momentary presence on the ground in Arizona can count as a day for purposes of accruing tax liability. The legislature's use of the different terms \"present\" and \"base,\" along with the common definition of \"base,\" demonstrate that momentary physical presence alone cannot count as a day an aircraft is based in Arizona. Likewise, the purposes of the statute would be defeated if an aircraft that is based in Arizona loses that status merely because it briefly departs, so we reject BSI's contention that \"day\" means a full 24-hour period from midnight-to-midnight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 However, we cannot fully resolve whether BSI's aircraft qualifies for the lower, nonresident tax rate for the years in question without knowing what \"based in\" means, a question that was neither fully argued by the parties nor addressed by the courts below. We therefore remand to the tax court to determine the meaning of the term \"based in\" under \u00a7 28-8336, and then to determine how many days the aircraft was based in Arizona for tax purposes for the relevant period. In making those determinations, the tax court should apply our holdings that an aircraft does not lose its Arizona base simply by leaving for part of a day, nor does it acquire an Arizona base merely by briefly touching down in the state. In other words, the court should count all days or fractions of a day when the aircraft was based in the state, even if it was not physically present there. It should not count days that the aircraft landed momentarily in Arizona when it was not based there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 If at the end of the day, having exhausted other statutory construction tools, the tax court determines the statute is still ambiguous, it should construe it in favor of the taxpayers.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856565\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/377/\">\n    233 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   384 \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856565\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/377/\">\n    312 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1150 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capitol Castings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"75262\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/207/445/\">\n    207 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   447 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"75262\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/207/445/\">\n    88 P.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tax statutes should provide clear notice of obligations so that taxpayers may comply and order their affairs accordingly. This rule of construction plays a role similar to the rule of lenity in the criminal context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.
