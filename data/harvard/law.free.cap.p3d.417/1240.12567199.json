Michael Krimbill (Krimbill), pursuant to the Oklahoma Citizens Participation Act, 12 O.S. Supp. 2014 \u00a7\u00a7 1430 through 1440 (OCPA or the Act). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The parties are involved in protracted litigation in the state of Delaware, where\n   LCT has filed claims of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent misrepresentation against Oklahoma-based, publicly traded NGL Energy Partners, LP, and its general partner, NGL Energy Holdings, LLC (collectively, NGL), resulting from a transaction known as the \"TransMontaigne acquisition.\" In October 2015, Talarico sent the following email to James Kneale, the head of NGL's audit committee:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    From:\n   </strong>\n   Lou Talarico\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Sent:\n   </strong>\n   Thursday, October 8, 2015 1:51 PM\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    To:\n   </strong>\n   jimckneale@gmail.com\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Subject:\n   </strong>\n   NGL Litigation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Attachments:\n   </strong>\n   Amended Complaint (as filed, 9-29-15).pdf\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Jim,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I am contacting you regarding a complaint that LCT Capital has filed against NGL Energy Holdings and NGL Energy Partners regarding fees due in connection with the TransMontaigne transaction.

On October 30, 2015, Defendants moved to dismiss Krimbill's petition with prejudice, pursuant to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the OCPA. On February 26, 2016, the district court denied this motion.

The OCPA also requires dismissal if a plaintiff fails to show a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, and is hence similar to a motion for directed verdict. Directed verdict challenges also are reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .

Supp. 2014 \u00a7 1430.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Purpose of \"Anti-SLAPP\" Acts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 7 The legislation is an example of \"anti-SLAPP\" (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) legislation, the purpose of which is to curb \"lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.16\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Anti-SLAPP legislation appears to be the result of an increasing tendency by parties with substantial resources to file meritless lawsuits against legitimate critics, with the intent to silence those critics by burdening them with the time, stress, and cost of a legal action. To carry out this purpose, anti-SLAPP acts typically provide an accelerated dismissal procedure, available immediately after a suit is filed in order to weed out meritless suits early in the litigation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 8 Anti-SLAPP acts may be generally characterized as \"narrow\" or \"broad.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shannon Hartzler,\n   <em>\n    Protecting Informed Public Participation: Anti-SLAPP Law and the Media Defendant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Val.%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%201235\">\n    41 Val. U.L. Rev. 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1236 (2007). A narrow act protects only certain speech made in limited circumstances, often when the speech is discussing a political or municipal issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The acts of Texas, Oklahoma and California are, by comparison, \"broad\" acts, directed at protecting a wide spectrum of First Amendment speech, with limited exceptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The OCPA Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 9 In an OCPA proceeding, the initial burden is on the defendant seeking dismissal to show that the plaintiff's claim \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to the [defendant's] exercise of the right of free speech, the right to petition, or the right of association.\" 12 O.S. Supp. 2014 \u00a7 1434(B). The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show \"by clear and specific evidence a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for each essential element of the claim in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1434(C). If \u00a7 1434(C) is satisfied, the burden shifts back to the defendant to show \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" a defense to the plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1434(D). If the plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case fails, or the defendant shows a defense by a preponderance of the evidence, the suit is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 10 The three basic issues thus presented by the text of the Act, and by this appeal, are (1) whether the defendant has shown the plaintiff's action is based on, relates to, or is in response to the defendant's exercise of\n   rights protected by the Act; (2) whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case; and (3) if so, whether the defendant shown a \"valid defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. INTERPRETING THE OCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 11 Interpreting the OCPA requires balancing the unusual judgment/dismissal provisions of \u00a7 1434 against two other OCPA provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 1430 and 1440. The tension between these sections is immediately evident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 12 Section 1434(C) appears to introduce a new evidentiary standard of \"clear and specific evidence\" that has no prior history in Oklahoma. Section 1434(D) appears to allow a court to dismiss a case with prejudice based on the judge's\n   <em>\n    weighing of the evidence\n   </em>\n   on the merits of the case. Read in isolation, \u00a7 1434 appears to provide for a summary form of bench trial on the merits before a defendant has answered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 13 However, OCPA \u00a7 1440 provides that the Act \"shall not abrogate or lessen any other defense, remedy, immunity or privilege available under other constitutional, statutory, case or common law or rule provisions,\" and \u00a7 1430 states the legislative purpose of the OCPA is to weed out meritless suits while protecting \"the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" Tension between the \u00a7 1434 procedure and the Act's statements of legislative intent is inescapable, and requires the resolution of several issues in a manner giving effect to legislative intent before we can analyze the facts in this case. The first such issue is the requirement that a plaintiff establish \"a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for each essential element of the claim in question\" by \"clear and specific evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE \"\n    <em>\n     PRIMA FACIE\n    </em>\n    CASE\" AND \"CLEAR AND SPECIFIC EVIDENCE\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 14 Once a defendant has shown that the Act applies, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show \"by clear and specific evidence\" the requirements of \u00a7 1434(C). The Act does not define \"clear and specific evidence,\" and that phrase has not previously appeared in published Oklahoma appellate case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Prima Facie\n    </em>\n    Case Under the Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 15 Oklahoma jurisprudence does define\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hill v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20OK%20CR%20161\">\n    1983 OK CR 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10422523\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/672/308/\">\n    672 P.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Rev. Ed., 1968, and defining \"prima facie case\" as, \"Such as will suffice until contradicted and overcome by other evidence. A case which has proceeded upon sufficient proof to that stage where it will support finding if evidence to contrary is disregarded.\" Because the Legislature would not have stated two contradictory standards in the same sentence, we presume that its definition of \"clear and specific evidence\" in \u00a7 1434(C) is in harmony with the established standard for\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Texas courts have recognized this issue, and reached the same conclusion regarding the TCPA. In\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/\">\n    460 S.W.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2015), the Texas Supreme Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The statute ... requires not only \"clear and specific evidence\" but also a \"\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\" In contrast to \"clear and specific evidence,\" a \"\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case\" has a traditional legal meaning. It refers to evidence sufficient as a matter of law to establish a given fact if it is not rebutted or contradicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/\">\n    at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 17 We find such reasoning consistent with Oklahoma law. We hold that, even though the Oklahoma Act initially demands more information about a plaintiff's underlying claim by requiring a showing of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, \"the Act does not impose an elevated evidentiary standard or categorically reject circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/\">\n    at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. What Evidence Should the Court Consider while Examining for a\n    <em>\n     Prima Facie\n    </em>\n    Case?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 18 Defendants argue that, in determining whether a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case has been shown, the court may not consider the pleadings. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 19 The OCPA is clear that a district court \"shall consider the pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts on which the liability or defense is based.\" 12 O.S. Supp. 2014 \u00a7 1435. In contrast, the minimal requirements of notice\n   pleading do not mandate that a petition state sufficient facts to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, but only an allegation of general facts supporting the elements of a cause of action. Hence, a petition, if pled to the\n   <em>\n    minimum standard\n   </em>\n   of notice pleading, may not provide sufficient \"clear and specific evidence\" for purposes of the OCPA. Nevertheless, the Act clearly contemplates that the pleadings may be\n   <em>\n    considered\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. \"VALID DEFENSES\" SHOWN BY A \"PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 20 One of the most unique features of the Act is the structure of \u00a7 1434(D), which allows dismissal if \"valid defenses\" are shown by a \"preponderance of the evidence\"\n   <em>\n    even if a prima face\n   </em>\n   case has been established. This section appears to provide for a pre-answer bench trial on the merits. Such a procedure would be unprecedented in Oklahoma law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 21 The Legislature stated in \u00a7 1440 of the Act that it did not intend to \"abrogate or lessen any other defense, remedy, immunity or privilege available under other constitutional, statutory, case or common law or rule provisions.\" Unless we interpret the Act as transforming any action at law that may be subject to the OCPA-and there are likely many affected actions\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   -into a case that would allow the trial judge to decide disputed questions of material fact in a dismissal procedure, \u00a7 1434(D) must be more narrowly construed. Accordingly, for the following reasons, we find that disputed questions of material fact cannot be resolved in an OCPA dismissal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Violation of \u00a7 1440 of the Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 22 As noted above, OCPA \u00a7 1440 is clear that the Legislature intended any remedy afforded by the Act to be limited in its effect on other remedies and defenses. However, if read literally, \u00a7 1434(D) provides for a pre-answer bench trial on the merits of a claim by providing that a judge may dismiss an action if a movant establishes each element of a valid defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 23 The existence of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case inherently establishes the existence of disputed questions of fact, in that it shows \"sufficient proof to that stage where it will support findings if evidence to contrary is disregarded.\" In all other actions where the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence, once a plaintiff shows a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, summary judgment is available only on\n   issues of law. If read literally, however, \u00a7 1434 would allow dismissal based on the trial court's view of the weight of the evidence. As such, the Act would make dismissal far easier to achieve than summary judgment for defendants who may be protected by the Act. Such a result is entirely incompatible with the clear directive of \u00a7 1440.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 24 The Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   noted that the Texas Act should \"not impose a higher burden of proof than that required of the plaintiff at trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find this principle sound, and adopt it here. Since disputes of fact on the required elements of a tort prevent summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    those same disputed facts cannot warrant dismissal under the OCPA.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Right to Jury Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 25 In addition to rejecting a literal interpretation of \u00a7 1434(D) that would allow a judge to decide disputed facts traditionally reserved for a jury, we note that a literal interpretation also implicates constitutional safeguards regarding the right to jury trial. Oklahoma law previously has allowed judges to act as triers of fact in equitable cases, but has reserved this function to the jury in cases at law unless a jury is waived. Read literally, \u00a7 1434(D) would require a judge to act as the finder of fact in some cases at law that are subject to jury trial. Such an interpretation would impact the right to jury trial for the benefit of certain types of defendants, which also violates the directive of \u00a7 1440.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. \"Special law\" Pursuant to Oklahoma Constitution, art. 5, \u00a7 46\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 26 A literal interpretation of \u00a7 1434(D) also could render the OCPA a special law prohibited by the Oklahoma Constitution, art. 5, \u00a7 46. That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The Legislature shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, pass any local or special law ... Regulating the practice or jurisdiction of, or changing the rules of evidence in judicial proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 27 \"The terms of art. 5, \u00a7 46 command that court procedure be symmetrical and apply equally across the board for an entire class of similarly situated persons or things.\"\n   <em>\n    Zeier v.

Const. art. 5, \u00a7 46. The reach of the OCPA is not likely confined simply to libel plaintiffs, but could reach into any tort involving speech. The number of different legal actions that might be \"based on, relate[d] to or [ ] in response to a party's exercise of the right of free speech, right to petition or right of association,\" appears to be substantial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 29 \"By mandating uniformity of procedure, the terms of art. 5, \u00a7 46 command that all citizens of the state shall have equal access to legal institutions for application of the general ordinary forensic process.\"\n   <em>\n    Zeier\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.

The Right to File a Meritorious Lawsuit for Demonstrable Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 30 We finally note the OCPA's clearly stated legislative purpose is to weed out\n   <em>\n    meritless\n   </em>\n   suits while\n   <em>\n    protecting\n   </em>\n   \"the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" 12 O.S. Supp. 2014 \u00a7 1430. The concept that a suit must be\n   <em>\n    meritless\n   </em>\n   to be dismissed is reinforced by the Act's \"sanctions for deterrence\" provision, \u00a7 1438, which allows \"[s]anctions against the party who brought the legal action as the court determines sufficient to deter the party who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions described in the [OCPA].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 31 Oklahoma jurisprudence previously has not countenanced sanctions for acts that are neither frivolous nor without reasonable basis.\n   <strong>\n    If genuine questions of material fact or law exist as to the right of recovery, and it is necessary to\n    <em>\n     weigh the evidence\n    </em>\n    in order to decide the case on the merits, it appears highly improbable that the case was meritless from the outset.\n   </strong>\n   A cognizable legal theory and a disagreement of material fact, supported by evidence on both sides, pursuant to the common law standard presupposes that the suit is not meritless, and that it should not be subjected to immediate summary dismissal or a sanction. The OCPA specifically prohibits the abrogation of these common law principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 32 If more than one interpretation is possible, this Court will not interpret an act of the Legislature so as to render it unconstitutional. In combination with the directives of \u00a7\u00a7 1430, 1440, and 1438, we are called upon to interpret \u00a7 1434(D) to fit the broader scheme and purpose of the Act of providing for the early dismissal of\n   <em>\n    meritless or frivolous suits\n   </em>\n   , and to avoid constitutional infirmity. Adhering to our constitutional mandate, we therefore hold that disputed questions of fact cannot be resolved in an OCPA dismissal proceeding. If a plaintiff has established a\n   <em>\n    prima face\n   </em>\n   case in the second-stage inquiry, the court may only properly consider\n   <em>\n    defenses that turn solely on a question of law\n   </em>\n   . It may not weigh and decide truly disputed questions of fact as \"defenses\" in this third stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 33 Having established these basic principles, we turn now to the facts of the case at hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The two clauses raise substantial questions, including such issues as the difference between speech \"related to a good, product or service\" and speech that \"arises out of the sale or lease of goods [or] services\"; and the difference between speech aimed at \"an actual or potential buyer or customer\" rather than \"the public.\" Texas cases examining the exemption have developed certain rules related to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Newspaper Holdings, Inc. v.

Interpreting the \"Commercial Speech\" Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 43 For the TCPA \"commercial speech\" exemption to apply, the Texas cases discussed above appear to require that (1) the parties are involved in the same general area of business; and (2) the statements forming the basis of the suit were made at least partially for the purpose of promoting sales of the goods or services of the person making the statement. If both of these requirements are met, the Courts held the TCPA does not apply and cannot be interposed as a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 44 In the case at hand, the speech at issue appears to be \"on the border\" of these principles, and may be \"commercial speech\" exempt from the Act. However, based on the limited evidence adduced in the trial court, it would be speculative at best for this Court to determine that Defendants and Krimbill are involved in the same business, or that Defendants made the statements at issue to promote their business aims. We therefore do not base our decision on an interpretation of the OCPA's \"commercial speech\" exemption, but instead presume that Defendants met their initial burden and that the Act applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. THE\n    <em>\n     PRIMA FACIE\n    </em>\n    CASE AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 45 The Act's requirement that a plaintiff show a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case to avoid dismissal raises a further question concerning the line of demarcation between the \"elements\" necessary to a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case and the \"defenses\" to a libel claim. This question has received little attention by the courts because its significance was limited. Since early statehood, Oklahoma has statutorily defined \"libel\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Libel is a false or malicious unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, or effigy or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person to public hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy, or which tends to deprive him of public confidence, or to injure him in his occupation, or any malicious publication as aforesaid, designed to blacken or vilify the memory of one who is dead, and tending to scandalize his surviving relatives or friends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 1441.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 46 Section 1441 can be interpreted as stating that it is the duty of a plaintiff to show\n   <em>\n    unprivileged\n   </em>\n   publication as part of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. In 1981, however, the legislature enacted \u00a7 1444.1 (Pleading-Proof-Defenses), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   In all civil actions to recover damages for libel or slander, it shall be sufficient to state generally what the defamatory matter was, and that it was published or spoken of the plaintiff, and to allege any general or special damage caused thereby.\n   <strong>\n    As a defense thereto\n   </strong>\n   the defendant may deny and offer evidence to disprove the charges made,\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   he may\n   <strong>\n    prove\n   </strong>\n   that the matter charged as defamatory\n   <strong>\n    was true\n   </strong>\n   and, in addition thereto, that it was published or spoken under such circumstances as to render it\n   <strong>\n    a privileged communication.\n   </strong>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 47 Section 1444.1 makes two statements regarding defenses: first, the \"defendant may deny and offer evidence to\n   <strong>\n    disprove\n   </strong>\n   the charges made\"-i.e., present ordinary defenses-\"or\" the defendant may\n   <strong>\n    prove\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    truth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    privilege\n   </em>\n   as defenses. This separation together with the use of the word \"prove\" makes clear that, at least since 1981, \"truth\" and \"privilege\" are affirmative defenses to a libel or slander claim, rather than the opposites of those defenses being elements that must be shown by a plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inasmuch as the OCPA states that it does not abrogate prior statutes, common law, or rules, we hold that while \u00a7 1441 defines libel, \u00a7 1444.1 defines\n   <em>\n    truth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    privilege\n   </em>\n   as affirmative defenses. Hence, the burden to show these defenses lies with the defendant in an OCPA proceeding, just as it would in any other proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Affidavit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 48 Krimbill presented the pleadings and his own affidavit to show a\n   <em>\n    prima face\n   </em>\n   case. Defendants argue, however, that Krimbill presented no evidence whatsoever. They contend the pleadings cannot be considered, and that this Court should disregard the affidavit because \"the [trial] court did not rely on it,\" and also because it was inadmissible. If neither the pleadings nor a personal affidavit may be used, then showing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under the Act presents a substantial burden for a plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 49 As discussed in Part IIIA above, the pleadings may be considered. We therefore reject Defendants' contention otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 50 Defendants' first argument concerning the affidavit is based on their observation that the district court did not refer to the affidavit in its decision. While it is true that the court did not specifically identify the evidence it considered, there is no requirement in the Act that it do so. Legal error may not be presumed from a silent record; it must be affirmatively demonstrated.\n   <em>\n    Hamid v.

The opinion did not dispute that the affidavit served as evidence of alleged losses, but found that it did not connect the losses to the plaintiff's activities. The affidavit was thereby found to be insufficient as evidence of the element the defendants sought to prove, which was that the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's activities had caused defendants losses\n   </em>\n   rather than simply that the\n   <em>\n    defendants had suffered losses.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 53\n   <em>\n    Concorde\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lipsky\n   </em>\n   are both distinguishable from the present case.

If Krimbill's affidavit had simply stated, \"I have\n   been libeled,\" without further elaboration, the result here would be the same as in\n   <em>\n    Concorde.\n   </em>\n   That situation is not present here, however. The holding in\n   <em>\n    Lipsky\n   </em>\n   is even more distinguishable, because the Court did not reject the affidavit for being\n   <em>\n    conclusory\n   </em>\n   , but for being so\n   <em>\n    insufficient\n   </em>\n   that, even if true, it failed to show a required element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 54 As noted above, OCPA \u00a7 1440 is clear that the Act \"shall not abrogate or lessen any other defense, remedy, immunity or privilege available under other constitutional, statutory, case or common law or rule provisions.\" Thus, the proper question is whether Krimbill's testimony normally would be admissible at trial or in a summary judgment proceeding.

Unless it is clear that Krimbill has no personal knowledge of whether NGL has made inaccurate public filings and public statements, his denial is admissible. The fact that the denial is self-interested goes to its weight at trial, not to its admissibility for dismissal purposes. We find that Krimbill's affidavit was generally admissible to the same extent Krimbill's same testimony would be admissible at trial.

Further, Krimbill stated by affidavit that it was his responsibility to ensure that NGL's public filings were accurate, that any filings he had certified in his position at NGL were accurate, and that Talarico's implication that NGL's public filings or statements were inaccurate was false. We find a disputed question of fact as to the \"truth\" of this statement, and pursuant to our interpretation of \u00a7 1434(D), this question cannot be resolved in a summary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Common Law Fair Comment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 73 Defendants argue that the statements in question were also covered by the \"common law fair comment\" privilege.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   The common law fair comment privilege extends to fair expressions on matters of public interest. It differs from both: (1) the common law fair report privilege-which affords a qualified or conditional privilege to the media when they republish defamatory material in an account of a public or official proceeding, i.e., judicial proceedings, legislative sessions, judicial hearings, or official news conferences; and 2) its statutory counterpart, 12 O.S.2001 \u00a7 1443.1 -which embodies a similar statutory privilege as a complete defense to libel. Although all three concepts overlap, the scope of the common law fair comment privilege, encompassing expressions of opinion on all matters of public opinion, is broader than either the common law fair report doctrine or the terms of the statute-both of which have their roots in political speech concepts and encompass public interest reports of official actions or proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    Grogan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988326\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/1021/\">\n    2011 OK CIV APP 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988326\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/1021/\">\n    256 P.3d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Magnusson v.

It may be interpreted as radically changing the mode of procedure in many cases, and establishing an unprecedented system of mandatory bench trials on the merits before an answer is even filed. However, the Act also contains clear legislative statements that it \"shall not abrogate or lessen any other defense, remedy, immunity or privilege\" and that the purpose of the OCPA is to weed out\n   <em>\n    meritless\n   </em>\n   suits while protecting \"the rights of a person to file\n   <em>\n    meritorious\n   </em>\n   lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" We have interpreted the Act in a manner consistent with these principles while at the same time avoiding an interpretation that the Act is unconstitutional. We find that the district court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss pursuant to the OCPA in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 76\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   WISEMAN, J., and RAPP, J.
