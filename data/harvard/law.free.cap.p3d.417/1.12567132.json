But no one is better off for \"judicial shortcuts, intentional or unintentional, which reach an expeditious result but fail to recognize the fundamental nature of the right of [biological] parents to the care, custody, and management of their child.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of L.D.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323585\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/155/1/#p8\">\n    155 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (Okla. 2006),\n   <em>\n    as supplemented on reh'g\n   </em>\n   , No. 250 (Mar. 6, 2007). \"In fact, the best interests of the child can be served in no legitimate manner except in obedience to the policies and procedures mandated by law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323585\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/155/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So it is vital that the courts of this state, this court included, take care to ensure that adoption proceedings are as free as possible from fatal defects. Regrettably, this case is septic: Birth Mother admitted to having perpetrated a fraud on the district court and suborning perjury from her brother-in-law, all in an effort to keep Birth Father from intervening in the proceedings, and all against the backdrop of what I believe was untimely and therefore invalid consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Procedurally, this case is before us on certification from our court of appeals, the central issue presented by the parties being whether the district court got it right when it denied Birth Father's motion to intervene. Because both Birth Father and Birth Mother are members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and B.B. is eligible for enrollment in the tribe, the Child is an Indian child. Hence, in my view, we have to consider the interplay between the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Birth Father's attempt to intervene, the application of ICWA to Birth Mother's consent, and the impact her invalid consent has on these proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I view these inquiries as raising the issues of (1) whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction over an adoption proceeding where neither biological parent has validly consented to the adoption and where the order terminating their parental rights is therefore void, (2) whether the jurisdictional issue is properly before us by virtue of Birth Father's right to challenge the validity of Birth Mother's consent and the order terminating his parental rights, and (3) whether Birth Father is a \"parent\" for purposes of ICWA and entitled to intervene in the proceedings below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The court is not of one mind on the issues. With respect to issue 1, a minority of this court would hold that where, as here, neither biological parent has validly consented to the adoption nor had their parental rights otherwise terminated, our courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to go ahead with adoption proceedings. With respect to issue 2, the minority would further hold that Birth Father has standing under our traditional approach to standing, and the right, under section 1914 of ICWA, to challenge Birth Mother's consent and the termination order and to argue the lack of subject matter jurisdiction. And with respect to issue 3, which is separate from the jurisdictional questions, a majority of this court holds that Birth Father is a \"parent\" under ICWA and, as such, is entitled to participate in the proceedings below on remand. The decision of the district court is therefore reversed and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 In December 2013, Birth Father and Birth Mother were in a committed relationship and engaged in sex leading to the conception of the Child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Birth Father and Birth Mother are members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and they resided together on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota at the time of conception and for the first six months of Birth Mother's pregnancy. Birth Father supported Birth Mother during her pregnancy, paying for her phone bill and their rent, utilities, and groceries. Six months into the pregnancy, in June or July 2014, Birth Mother moved to Utah to be closer to friends and family. Birth Father was to join her later, once she was settled into their new apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 For the first few weeks after Birth Mother's move to Utah, she and Birth Father stayed in contact over the phone, but after Birth Mother encountered a former boyfriend, she cut off all contact with Birth Father. She stopped calling Birth Father, stopped answering his calls, and even changed her phone number. At Birth Mother's request, mutual friends told Birth Father that she was fine and would soon return to South Dakota. Birth Father indicated that he \"figured ... [she] just needed some space\" and that she \"would return to South Dakota before she delivered [their] baby, or that she and the baby would return together after the delivery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 On August 29, 2014, Birth Mother gave birth to the Child in Utah. Twenty-four hours and six minutes later, she signed a form titled \"Relinquishment of Parental Rights and Consent of Natural Birth Mother to Adoption\" in the presence of a notary public and an adoption agency representative. Birth Mother also signed a Statement Concerning Birth Father, naming her brother-in-law, rather than Birth Father, as the biological father. Based on Birth Mother's misrepresentations concerning the biological father, the adoption agency and counsel for the adoptive parents had the brother-in-law sign a sworn affidavit declaring that he was the Child's biological father, relinquishing his rights to the Child, consenting to the adoption, and representing that he was neither an enrolled member of nor eligible for membership in a Native American tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 On September 8, 2014, ten days from the Child's birth, Birth Mother executed a Voluntary Relinquishment of Parental Rights, Consent to Adoption, and Consent to Entry of Order Terminating Parental Rights in open court, again naming her brother-in-law as the Child's biological father. On September 25, 2014, the district court issued an order terminating Birth Mother's parental rights and determining the biological father's rights. Birth Mother had expressly objected to any Indian tribe receiving notice of the proceedings, and the district court determined that the proceedings were voluntary and that therefore no Indian tribe was entitled to notice. The court held that \"the unwed biological father[ ], whether he be [Birth Mother's brother-in-law] or any other man,\" had \"forfeited, surrendered, or waived\" his parental rights and that his consent to the adoption was not required. The court also determined that the unmarried biological father had not acknowledged or established paternity to the Child and was therefore not a \"parent\" under ICWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). The court then transferred custody\n   of the Child to the adoption agency and authorized it to delegate custody to the prospective adoptive parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Birth Mother returned to South Dakota at the end of September 2014. On or about September 27, 2014, she saw Birth Father and told him that she had given birth to the Child and placed him for adoption. According to Birth Father, she told him that she listed no father on the birth certificate and that she later misrepresented the identity of the father. According to his affidavit, Birth Father \"was completely shocked and devastated because [he] did not know that [their] son had been born, and [he] never knew [Birth Mother] had even considered placing him for adoption.\" Birth Father also stated that he \"immediately sought assistance to establish paternity and intervene in this matter,\" although it is unclear from the record what his immediate action was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 According to Birth Father, he and Birth Mother \"contacted the Utah vital records office to add [Birth Father's] name to [their] son's birth certificate, but [were] advised by counsel not to[,] due to [Birth Mother's] rights being terminated.\" Both Birth Father and Birth Mother informed the tribe of the situation. Over a period of a couple of months, Birth Father consulted with Dakota Plains Legal Services. On or before October 30, 2014, Dakota Plains Legal Services contacted counsel for the prospective adoptive parents and left a message regarding Birth Mother, apparently communicating Birth Mother's desire to withdraw her consent and requesting that the Child be returned to her. In November 2014, Birth Mother contacted the adoption agency to correct her misrepresentation, informing the adoption agency that Birth Father was the true biological parent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late November or December 2014, according to Birth Father, Dakota Plains Legal Services referred him to Utah Legal Services, Inc., and on December 31, 2014, Birth Father filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings \"in order to establish paternity, and thereafter file a petition to have his parental rights determined.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case had been inactive from the entry of the termination order on September 25, 2014, until the filing of the motion to intervene on December 31, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Birth Father's motion to intervene was mistakenly granted on January 5, 2015, before the prospective adoptive parents' time to respond to or oppose the motion had run. Birth Father then filed a Motion for Paternity Test, and the prospective adoptive parents filed a motion requesting that the district court reconsider its decision to grant Birth Father's motion to intervene and objecting to his motion for paternity testing. A few days later, Birth Father filed a Paternity Affidavit. Subsequently, Birth Mother filed an affidavit with the court stating that Birth Father was the biological parent and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Birth Father then filed an Answer, Objection, and Verified Counterpetition to the Verified Petition for Adoption, objecting to the petition for adoption. He also filed a Notice of Commencement of Paternity Proceeding with the Utah Department of Health Office of Vital Records and Statistics. On January 27, 2015, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The district court held a hearing on the pending motions (not including the tribe's\n   motion to intervene) on February 24, 2015. On the day of the hearing, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) released new ICWA guidelines. Birth Father filed the guidelines with the district court that very day, requesting that the court review them and drawing the court's attention to the guidelines regarding notice requirements, placement preferences, consent requirements, and the relationship between ICWA and state law. The prospective adoptive parents filed a motion objecting to Birth Father's submission of that supplemental memorandum. On March 12, 2015, Birth Mother filed a Verified Withdrawal of Consent to Adoption and Motion for Return of Custody with the court. On March 26, 2015, the court made a minute entry, granting Birth Father's motion for review based on the new ICWA guidelines and denying the prospective adoptive parents' motion to strike those guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 The next day, the district court signed an order denying the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's motion to intervene on the bases (1) \"that an Indian tribe ... cannot appear in court without the assistance of a licensed attorney\" and (2) \"that, under ICWA, a tribe has a right to intervene only in\n   <em>\n    involuntary\n   </em>\n   proceedings, and not in voluntary proceedings like this one.\" On April 21, 2015, the court issued another order, denying Birth Father's motion to intervene on the basis that he was \"not a 'parent' under either ICWA or ... Utah's adoption statutes.\" Because Birth Father was not permitted to intervene, his motion for paternity testing was mooted. The April 21, 2015 order also denied Birth Mother's motion to withdraw her consent to the termination of her parental rights on the basis \"that once a birth mother's parental rights have been terminated by order of a court, that birth mother no longer has the right under ICWA to withdraw her consent, even if an adoption decree has not yet been entered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Birth Father filed a motion for a new trial, and on May 20, 2015, he filed a notice of appeal. The district court denied the motion for a new trial on June 4, 2015. The appeal was then certified for immediate transfer to us. Neither the tribe nor Birth Mother appealed the denial of their motions. Birth Father also filed a Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, which the court granted, and pursuant to which \"[t]he finalization of [the Child's] adoption will wait until the conclusion of the appeal.\" After the stay, Birth Father's parents filed a motion to intervene and a counter-petition for adoption based on ICWA's placement preferences, but their motion was also denied, and they did not appeal the denial. Thus, only Birth Father's claims are before us on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 After oral argument, we asked for supplemental briefing on three issues: (1) whether Birth Mother's consent complied with ICWA's timing requirement, and if not, what effect that had on the validity of her consent; (2) if Birth Mother's consent was invalid, whether that would affect the district court's jurisdiction to enter or finalize an adoption decree; and (3) what, if any, other effect an invalid consent would have on the proceedings below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 We have jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 Whether Birth Mother's consent was valid under ICWA is a question of statutory interpretation, which we review \"for correctness, affording no deference to the district court's legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Based on controlling Utah law and in keeping with the overwhelming majority of the courts of this country, I answer that question in the affirmative. Because the jurisdictional issue is properly before us only if Birth Father could have raised it on appeal, I then turn to a determination of whether Birth Father had the ability to challenge the validity of Birth Mother's consent and to put the jurisdictional issue before us. I conclude that Birth Father was empowered to do so under our traditional approach to standing and 25 U.S.C. section 1914. Finally, a majority of the court concludes that apart from the foregoing, Birth Father is a parent under ICWA and eligible to intervene in this matter and that to hold otherwise would subvert ICWA's core policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I.

There are often prerequisites individual litigants must meet to show that they have satisfied the requirements of subject matter jurisdiction even when we unquestionably have subject matter jurisdiction over the topic. Consider the tort and landlord-tenant case categories noted above.

The delicate and difficult nature of undoing error in an adoption proceeding is not lost on anyone.

Indeed, absent the termination order, Birth Father would be a \"parent\" under ICWA and entitled to intervene in this action even under the most grudging of standards. But as it now stands, Birth Mother's invalid consent cut off Birth Father's rights to his own child.

Second, Birth Father can establish a causal relationship between the challenged action and the adverse effect: Birth Mother's invalid consent and the subsequent order terminating her rights led directly to the district court placing the Child for adoption.

Interpreting \"Acknowledge\" and \"Establish\" Requires a Plain Meaning Approach\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 52 Because the terms \"acknowledge\" and \"establish\" are not defined in the statute, we turn first to dictionary definitions for guidance. The first definition for \"acknowledge\" in\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   is \"[t]o recognize (something) as being factual or valid.\"\n   <em>\n    Acknowledge\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). The second definition for \"acknowledge\" specifically gives \"acknowledge paternity of the child\" as an example; it reads, \"[t]o show that one accepts responsibility for.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The legal definition of \"acknowledge\" in\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   's online dictionary includes a variant with a similar example (\"will\n   <em>\n    acknowledge\n   </em>\n   the child as his\") and defines \"acknowledge\" as \"to admit paternity of.\"\n   <em>\n    Acknowledge\n   </em>\n   , MERRIAM-WEBSTER ,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://perma.cc/HMQ9-MHP8.

For example, while acknowledging paternity of a child can mean \"show[ing] that one accepts responsibility for\" the child, no specific actions are suggested by that term or its definition.\n   <em>\n    Acknowledge\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Incidentally,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines a \"formal acknowledgment\" as \"[a] father's recognition of a child as his own by a formal, written declaration that meets a state's requirements for execution, typically by signing in the presence of two witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). An \"informal acknowledgment,\" on the other hand, is \"[a] father's recognition of a child as his own not by a written declaration but by receiving the child into his family or supporting the child and otherwise treating the child as his own offspring.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The dictionary definitions thus provide for acknowledgment under both state rules and other means not tied to state standards, and ICWA does not specify whether it requires formal or informal acknowledgment of paternity. Thus, the dictionary definition alone of \"acknowledge\" does not answer the question of what ICWA requires of a parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 53 \"Establish\" likewise has a broad meaning under a plain language analysis.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   has three definitions of \"establish,\" only one of which makes sense in the context of establishing paternity: \"To prove; to convince.\"\n   <em>\n    Establish\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). And the most logical definition for this context in\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   's online dictionary is \"to put beyond doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Establish\n   </em>\n   , MERRIAM-WEBSTER ,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://perma.cc/9RB2-33WP. From these definitions, it is obvious that it requires more to \"establish\" paternity than to \"acknowledge\" paternity. But what actions are required in order to \"prove\" paternity or \"put [paternity] beyond doubt\" is not apparent from the plain meaning of the word. Furthermore, neither the plain meaning of \"acknowledge\" nor the plain meaning of \"establish\" suggests anything about the timing of the actions. Theoretically, if we were to rely on a plain meaning of the terms for the actions and timing required, a father could acknowledge or establish paternity many years after the completion of the adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because the terms are so broad and vague and because of the lack of a timing element, dictionary definitions alone are inadequate for determining who is a parent under ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 54 In light of this roadblock in the plain language analysis, the dissent argues that we should view \"acknowledge\" and \"establish\" as terms of art defined by the states.

Applying a reasonability standard here creates obvious stop-gaps and prevents the slippery-slope concerns of the dissent, as it requires more than \"any bare\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   by a putative father,\"\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198, and would not allow \"a putative Indian father [to] come forward months or even years later and assert a right to disrupt even a finalized adoption.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 201.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 72 This approach is consistent with ICWA's liberal administration.

Take, for example, a situation where a biological mother abandons a child with the unmarried biological father. If the father acted as the sole caretaker for his child, that would surely be a clear-cut case of acknowledgement\n   of paternity. But under Utah law, the father would not have acknowledged paternity if he did not have a written agreement that the mother had also signed.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. This would provide the father with fewer rights than a reasonability standard under ICWA.

Birth Father and Birth Mother resided together at the time of conception and for the first six months of Birth Mother's pregnancy. During that time, Birth Father supported Birth Mother, paying for their rent, utilities, and groceries and Birth Mother's phone bill. When Birth Mother moved to Utah six months into the pregnancy, the plan was for Birth Father to join her later, once she was settled into their new apartment. Birth Father stayed in contact with Birth Mother over the phone for the first few weeks after her move, until Birth Mother cut off communication with him. Birth Father was then told by family friends that Birth Mother was fine and would return to South Dakota soon. Birth Father indicated that he believed Birth Mother needed some space and that she would either return to South Dakota to deliver their baby or that she would return with the baby after the delivery. Instead, Birth Mother placed their child for adoption. Upon learning of the proceedings shortly after the September 25, 2014 order terminating parental rights was issued, Birth Father informed the tribe of the situation and consulted with Dakota Plains Legal Services. After being referred to Utah Legal Services, Birth Father filed a motion to intervene, a motion for paternity testing, and a paternity affidavit expressly acknowledging that he was the Child's biological father. He also filed an Answer, Objection, and Verified Counterpetition to the Verified Petition for Adoption. When new ICWA guidelines were released on the day of the hearing on his motions, Birth Father acted immediately: the very same day, he submitted those guidelines to the court with a motion requesting the court to review them and drawing the court's attention to pertinent provisions in the guidelines. In the April 21, 2015 order denying Birth Father's motion to intervene on the basis that he was not a parent under ICWA, the district court itself stated that Birth Father\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   has filed numerous documents with the Court in this case asserting paternity. In connection with this case, [Birth Father] has filed an affidavit setting forth his willingness and ability to parent the Child, his plans for care of the Child, and his willingness to pay child support and expenses related to the pregnancy and birth. He has filed a notice, with the Utah Department of Health, Office of Vital Records and Statistics, indicating that he has filed a paternity action regarding the Child (identifying this case as the paternity action). Thus, if one construes this action as a 'paternity action,' then [Birth Father] has now accomplished all of the tasks required by Utah's statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 75 These actions, we hold, were both timely and sufficient for Birth Father to acknowledge paternity under ICWA, making Birth Father a \"parent\" for purposes of section 1914.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    C. Birth Father Is a Parent Under Utah Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 76 As an alternative basis, I would hold that Birth Father also timely acknowledged and established his paternity under Utah law. As the district court indicated, Birth Father \"accomplished all of the tasks required\" by Utah Code section 78B-6-121(3), which relates to the consent of an unmarried biological father. And Birth Father accomplished these tasks within the timeframe required by Utah law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-6-121(3) (requiring the unmarried biological father to accomplish those tasks \"prior to the time the mother executes her consent for adoption or relinquishes the child for adoption\"). The district court concluded that Birth Father's actions were untimely because he \"completed these tasks no earlier than January 26, 2015,\" which the court determined was\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   \"the time the mother execute[d] her consent for adoption or relinquishe[d] the child for adoption.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773202\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/294/423/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, because Birth Mother never gave valid consent,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44, and because Birth Father has accomplished all the necessary actions, Birth Father timely established paternity even under Utah law. Thus, even if Utah law applied to define how to acknowledge or establish paternity under ICWA, Birth Father satisfies the statutory definition of a \"parent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 77 The actions Birth Father took illustrate that this case is a poster child for application of ICWA. Against the backdrop of 25 U.S.C. section 1902's declaration of policy stating that ICWA is designed \"to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families\" and guard against state courts' unnecessary removals of Indian children from their families, the majority would hold that an Indian father who took every necessary action to acknowledge paternity of his Indian child did too little, too late. I disagree. Because Birth Father acknowledged his paternity under both a federal reasonableness standard and a stricter Utah standard, he is a \"parent\" for purposes of ICWA. This status as a parent gives him standing under section 1914 to challenge the order terminating Birth Mother's parental rights due to her invalid consent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201914\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]ny parent ... may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 1911, 1912, and 1913 of this title.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    D. Birth Father's Status as a Parent, Along with His Custody of the Child, Gives Him the Right to Intervene\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 78 Because we conclude that Birth Father is a \"parent\" under ICWA, we now look to language in section 1914 that arguably requires not just that a person bringing a challenge to a termination action be a \"parent\" but also that he be a parent \"from whose custody such child was removed.\" Birth Father may bring an action under this section because, as a parent, he had legal custody of the Child, and to the extent he did not have physical custody of the Child, it was because of Birth Mother's misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 79 We first note that legal custody alone suffices for section 1914 purposes. To hold otherwise would exclude a large number of fathers who were unable to obtain physical custody through circumstances that are out of their control.

THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE ADOPTION PROCEEDINGS WERE VOLUNTARY AS TO BIRTH FATHER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 86 Under ICWA, a parent has a right to receive notice of and to intervene in any proceeding involving the involuntary termination of his or her parental rights.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the ... termination of parental rights to[ ] an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's tribe ... of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.\"). As we discussed above, Birth Father is a \"parent\" under ICWA.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-77. The district court held that the proceeding was voluntary as to Birth Father, which meant he was not entitled to notice and intervention. We reverse and hold that the proceeding was involuntary as to Birth Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 87 Originally, these proceedings appeared to be voluntary on the part of both parents because Birth Mother misrepresented her brother-in-law as the biological father and had him sign a consent form for termination of parental rights in order to make the adoption go faster. Even after Birth Father filed a motion to intervene to establish paternity and after Birth Mother filed an affidavit informing the court that Birth Father was the biological parent and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the court still believed the case to be \"undoubtedly a voluntary proceeding\" because it was \"initiated not by the State but by Petitioners after the child's mother indicated her (at the time) voluntary desire to relinquish her parental rights and place the child for adoption.\" While we recognize that the proceedings were voluntary as to Birth Mother, it is clear that Birth Father never sought to voluntarily terminate his parental rights. We disagree with the district court's characterization of \"involuntary proceedings\" as \"state-sponsored proceedings\" and \"voluntary proceedings\" as \"proceedings initiated by an Indian parent seeking to terminate her parental rights.\" Rather, we hold that proceedings to terminate a parent's parental rights against his or her will are involuntary proceedings under ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 88 ICWA does not define \"involuntary proceeding\" as used in 25 U.S.C. section 1912(a), so we look to the plain meaning of the term instead. The plain language in section 1912(a) refers to \"any involuntary proceeding in a State court.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"involuntary\" as \"[n]ot resulting from a free and unrestrained choice; not subject to control by the will.\"\n   <em>\n    Involuntary\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). When a parent's rights are terminated against his or her will, the termination does not \"result[ ] from a free and unrestrained choice\" by that parent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And if the proceedings are involuntary as to one parent, a plain language analysis leads to the conclusion that they are involuntary proceedings under ICWA, regardless of whether those proceedings are initiated by the state or by the other parent. Additionally, in light of ICWA's policy \"to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201902\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it would be inconsistent to deny a parent the right to receive notice and to intervene in proceedings for the termination of his or her parental\n   rights just because the termination of the other parent's rights was voluntary. Thus, we conclude that the proceedings in this case are involuntary as they pertain to Birth Father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Birth Father therefore was entitled to notice of the proceedings and the opportunity to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 89 Because the proceedings in this case were involuntary as to Birth Father, and because he acknowledged paternity as required under ICWA, he had a right to receive notice of and to intervene in the adoption proceeding. Consequently, we reverse the district court's denial of Birth Father's motion to intervene and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 90 In addition, I would hold that (a) Birth Mother did not give valid consent to the termination of her parental rights, (b) the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the adoption of the Child, and (c) the issue is properly before us. I dissent from the majority's holding to the contrary on issues (b) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Associate Chief Justice Lee authored the opinion of the Court as to Part I, in which Chief Justice Durrant and Justice Pearce joined; and a dissenting opinion as to Part II, in which Chief Justice Durrant joined:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 91 Contested adoption proceedings are difficult. They cut at the heart of the most sacred, essential institution of our society-the family. And the disposition of such a case has profound effects on the lives of many-on the child in question and on all who assert an interest in the child's parentage or upbringing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 92 The sensitivity of these issues is heightened when one or more of the interested parties hails from another state. And the difficulty is compounded further when, as here, a party claiming rights as a putative father is a member of an Indian tribe, protected by the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 93 For these and other reasons Justice Himonas is right to urge a course of caution. I could not agree more with the admonition that the \" 'best interests' \" of children and others involved in adoption proceedings require careful \"obedience to the policies and procedures mandated by law.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 94 That's about as far as my agreement with the lead opinion goes, however. The lead opinion claims to be following the \"majority\" approach on a range of the issues it addresses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 (asserting that its jurisdictional analysis is consistent with \"the great majority of states' views on the issue\");\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71 (stating that the majority's federal \"reasonableness\" standard of establishing or acknowledging \"paternity\" under ICWA \"is consistent with ICWA case law\" in other states). But the cited cases are easily distinguishable. And Justice Himonas's approach is quite unique. No court that I am aware of (Justice Himonas cites none) has ever held\n   that a timing defect in an earlier consent order is the sort of\n   <em>\n    subject-matter\n   </em>\n   jurisdictional defect that must be considered\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   by the court presiding over an adoption. And the court's analysis of the ICWA standard of establishing or acknowledging \"paternity\" is equally novel. No court that I am aware of (and again the lead opinion cites none) treats the notion of \"paternity\" in ICWA as a purely federal standard-a standard of \"reasonableness\" to be developed on a case-by-case basis by the courts, and not by reference to standards established as a matter of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 95 On these and other points the lead opinion stretches existing law beyond recognition. Justice Himonas claims fealty to existing precedent but his approach is a novel one. It threatens to unsettle this important field on numerous points of heretofore settled law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 96 The question presented in this case is a simple one. We are asked to decide whether the district court erred in denying a motion to intervene filed by E.T., a member of an Indian tribe who asserts an interest in B.B. as a putative father. The district court denied that motion on the ground that E.T. could not qualify as a \"parent\" under Utah law or under ICWA, which excludes an unwed father whose \"paternity has not been acknowledged or established.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). The ICWA notion of acknowledgement or establishment of paternity, in the district court's view, was an invocation of state law principles of paternity. And the district court denied E.T.'s motion to intervene because E.T. had not acknowledged or established his paternity as a matter of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 97 I would affirm that decision, which is entirely in line with the terms of ICWA and with established case law in other jurisdictions. I would hold that E.T. does not qualify as a \"parent\" because he did not acknowledge or establish his paternity under Utah law. While a majority of the court disagrees with my analysis on this point, a majority nonetheless rejects the lead opinion's subject-matter jurisdiction analysis. Thus, the court concludes that there is no subject-matter jurisdiction defect in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 98 Justice Himonas's contrary conclusions are premised on a series of distortions of settled principles of law. First, the lead opinion distorts the law of appellate procedure and subject-matter jurisdiction. The root of its jurisdictional analysis is its decision to question a final order finding that the birth mother (C.C.) consented to the adoption more than ten days after the birth of the child as required by ICWA. That order was a final, appealable one when entered. But no one ever challenged it. Not C.C. And not even E.T.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And that should have rendered the merits of that decision final, foreclosing our prerogative of second-guessing it, under settled rules of finality and appellate procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 99 The lead opinion would unsettle our law of appellate procedure in reopening an order that no party ever sought to challenge. And it would distort the law of subject-matter jurisdiction by treating a purported defect in the consent order as a matter going to the adoption court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 100 Second, the court distorts the standard set forth in ICWA. It does so by interpreting the statute's reference to the acknowledgement or establishment of \"paternity\" to call for a wholly\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   standard of paternity-a standard the court declines to define except to say that it calls for a case-by-case evaluation of \"reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72. This unsettles the law in this important field. No court to date has interpreted ICWA to call\n   for a wholly federal standard of establishing paternity. By declaring the existence of such a standard without ultimately defining it, the court ensures chaos and unpredictability for years to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 101 I find all of the above untenable. And easily avoidable. All we have to do is follow settled rules of procedure and jurisdiction and the plain text of ICWA. I would do so here. While a majority of the court holds that there is no defect in the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction, I would also affirm the district court's denial of the motion to intervene because E.T. did not timely acknowledge or establish his paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   I. SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 102 We have no quarrel with Justice Himonas's assertion that our court has a duty to make a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   assessment of our own subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. But upon review of the supplemental briefing, we see no basis for the conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide E.T.'s motion to intervene. We see at least four independent grounds for rejecting Justice Himonas's determination of a subject-matter jurisdiction defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   A. The Consent Order Is Not Properly Before Us\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 103 The heart of Justice Himonas's jurisdictional analysis is his determination that the district court erred in concluding that C.C.'s consent complied with ICWA's timing requirements. Because Justice Himonas would reverse the district court's conclusions on this issue, he would determine that the district court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 104 But Justice Himonas cites no authority for the power to revisit a final order in a collateral termination proceeding not challenged by any of the parties at any stage of these proceedings-below or on appeal. When a court enters a final order stating its findings of fact and conclusions of law, that order is binding unless and until a litigant successfully challenges the order's validity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snell v.

And he failed to do so at any time prior to the court's final adjudication of his motion to intervene. E.T.'s decision not to raise such a challenge constituted a waiver of the issue before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 106 E.T.'s waiver is equally clear on appeal.

It makes no mention of the consent order. And the consent order, as a distinct final judgment, was not a subsidiary order. That is fatal.

We decline to disregard this rule of appellate procedure in this case. Accordingly, we do not review the order adjudicating C.C.'s consent under ICWA because E.T. did not raise a rule 60(b) challenge to this order below and likewise did not identify this order in his notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 108 We see no basis for the notion of a free-ranging duty to search the record to \"ensure\" that an adoption case is \"as free as possible\" from any \"defects\" we deem \"fatal.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. That premise runs counter to our settled rules of appellate procedure, which are rooted in the adversary system. Our law leaves it to the parties to identify legal deficiencies undermining the legality or finality of a judgment rendered in a collateral matter. Under our longstanding rules the appellant bears the burden of identifying any and all orders being challenged on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 109 We follow that pattern here. We hold that the consent order in question is not properly presented for our review because it was not identified in the notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6 110 The effects of the lead opinion's contrary conclusion would be substantial. In proposing the reversal of an order not identified in the notice of appeal and the\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reconsideration of factual and legal conclusions underpinning a final judgment, the lead opinion would undermine the rights of a party who has not been heard at any point in the proceedings on appeal (C.C.). To our knowledge, C.C. has not received any notice that the termination order is under review on appeal. And were the lead opinion's decision to control, we have no reason to believe that C.C. would receive formal notice that her rights had been reinstated by the lead opinion's proposed vacatur of the termination order. This would be deeply problematic-and an apparent violation of C.C.'s right to procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 111 The proposal to disregard our settled rules of appellate procedure would come at a cost to the legitimacy of our judicial system. It would also threaten the certainty and predictability that are essential to a well-functioning adoption system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 112 Justice Himonas's approach would inject uncertainty of an indefinite duration into the lives of those who place their children for adoption. This uncertainty is wide-ranging. A mother who consents to an adoption would never be certain that the child's placement would be final. She would be left with the risk that a court might peer down long after judgment has become final and identify an error missed by the district court, counsel, and all parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 113 Under Justice Himonas's approach, such a mother need not even receive notice that the validity of her consent is being reviewed. Yet there would always be the possibility that lives might be turned upside down by a judicial decision vacating consent and re-imposing the obligations of parenthood. This would be more than unfair. It would be fundamentally at odds with our adoption statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-6-102(5)(b) (\"[A]n unmarried mother, faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions about the future of a newborn child, is entitled to privacy, and has the right to make timely and appropriate decisions regarding her future and the future of the child, and is entitled to assurance regarding the permanence of an adoptive placement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 114 Justice Himonas's approach would also jeopardize the security and reliance interests of adoptive children and adoptive parents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not positively countenance\n   C.C.'s conduct in this case. But the lead opinion's proposal to cast aside settled rules of law governing appellate procedure would impact more than this case.

In isolation, this language does not answer the critical question-whether parties may waive an objection to a defect in the timing of consent by failing to timely challenge it. But section 1914 provides strong evidence that any defect in ICWA compliance is subject to waiver. It provides that \"[a]ny Indian child ..., any parent or Indian custodian ..., and the Indian child's tribe\n   <em>\n    may petition\n   </em>\n   any court of competent jurisdiction to\n   <em>\n    invalidate\n   </em>\n   such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 1911, 1912, and 1913 of this title.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1914. The permissive \"may petition\" clearly implies a choice-to petition or not. To give meaning to that choice, the statute cannot be interpreted to void orders that have not been challenged under section 1914. The term \"invalidate\" also carries a negative implication. It suggests that unless a party affirmatively challenges a proceeding's compliance with ICWA section 1913, the consent and resulting termination order are valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 118 This conclusion is consistent with case law in other jurisdictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few courts have held that section 1914 preempts rules governing preservation.

Justice Himonas's contrary conclusion is not just unprecedented; it would threaten the interests of the very population ICWA was intended to protect. By voiding an action not challenged by the Indian child, his mother, putative father, or his tribe, the lead opinion would slight the autonomy of the stakeholders Congress empowered by enacting section 1914. That smacks of paternalism. And it would disrupt finality and inject greater uncertainty into already complicated proceedings-at great cost to all involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   C.

The concept of subject-matter jurisdiction encompasses (a) statutory limits on the \"authority of the court to adjudicate a class of cases,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In extending the principle of subject-matter jurisdiction to include a mere legal prerequisite to the issuance of an order granting the relief sought by the plaintiff, the lead opinion would unsettle our law and open the door to any of a wide range of issues being injected\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   by the court-or by a party long after a case is otherwise finally decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 122 In opening the door to reconsider the legal basis for an order that our law deems final and jurisdictionally insulated from review, the lead opinion would threaten the principles of efficiency and finality at the heart of our adoption system. And its novel conception of subject-matter jurisdiction would sow the seeds of uncertainty that would threaten the finality of cases in other fields as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b6 123 The adoption cases cited by Justice Himonas are all distinguishable on grounds mentioned above.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. None of them supports the lead opinion's novel theory. The cited Utah cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25, are also distinguishable. Those cases go to a principle of justiciability and the propriety of a case being heard in a particular forum at a particular time (before a governmental entity has a chance to rule on a notice of claim, or before a party exhausts administrative avenues for relief). That is not at all what is at issue here. So the lead opinion's view does not follow from existing cases. The lead opinion would open up a broad new category of subject-matter jurisdictional issues that would undermine the efficient operation of our justice system and the finality of our judgments for years to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6 124 We accordingly reject the notion that any defect in the timing of the mother's consent deprived the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction. The timeliness of the entry of consent under ICWA has nothing to do with subject-matter jurisdiction as that term is understood in our law. Valid consent is just one of many statutory prerequisites to the issuance of a valid adoption decree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 78B-6-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (identifying a host of statutory requirements for the issuance of an adoption in varying circumstances). And a deficiency in this or any other prerequisite falls outside the traditional scope of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   1. Theory\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6 125 The notion of \"jurisdiction\" is a slippery one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a word that means different things in different circumstances. Sometimes it is used to characterize the scope of a court's power to issue a certain form of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that sense we may speak of a court lacking \"jurisdiction\" to award relief that is precluded by the substantive law under the facts of a particular case. And we may identify legal preconditions to the availability of such relief as bars on the exercise of a court's \"jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 126 Another conception of \"jurisdiction\" goes to the territorial authority of the court that issues a decision. This is the notion of\n   <em>\n    personal jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . It may be invoked in a case in which a judgment is entered against a party lacking in a sufficient connection to the state in which the court sits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is another instance in which we may speak of a court lacking \"jurisdiction\" to enter an award against a particular party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 127 Yet neither of these notions of jurisdiction goes to a court's\n   <em>\n    subject-matter\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction. Both of these forms of jurisdiction, moreover, are subject to the rules of preservation and waiver. A failure to raise them at the appropriate time results in a forfeiture of the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is accordingly improper for a court to raise these \"jurisdictional\" matters\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6 128 Subject-matter jurisdiction is special. It is distinct from other notions of jurisdiction in that we require our courts to consider such issues\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , or in other words we do not allow the parties to waive or forfeit them from consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The distinction is crucial, as it cuts at the heart of\n   our adversary system. If an issue is subject-matter jurisdictional, the general rules of finality and preservation are off the table. So for each such issue we undermine the premises of efficiency, speedy resolution, and finality that generally undergird our justice system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6 129 That is why our law has been careful to cabin the notion of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We limit this concept carefully because\n   an expansive notion of subject-matter jurisdiction will undermine the basic premises of our justice system. And that is why the law has long defined the concept of subject-matter jurisdiction to consist of the two categories noted above-statutory limits on the class of cases assigned to the authority of a certain court, and other limits that go to the concept of justiciability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6 130 These principles are well-embedded in our law. And cases in Utah and elsewhere have long warned of the perils of expanding these categories to encompass mere preconditions to the availability of a particular form of judicial relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We heed that warning here. We do not treat a defect in a birth mother's consent as a defect in an adoption court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \u00b6 131 Clearly our district courts have the statutory authority to issue an adoption decree.

Cases on Adoption and Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 132 Justice Himonas claims to find support for his contrary conclusion in a line of adoption cases in other states. Those cases, in his view, establish the well-settled general rule that courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction over adoption proceedings predicated on invalid consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 n.10. Justice Himonas also proffers support for his analysis in Utah precedent-in this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Deveraux' Adoption v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8866104\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/2/30/\">\n    268 P.2d 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1954), and in cases requiring a notice of claim under the Governmental Immunity Act and the exhaustion of administrative\n   remedies as prerequisites to jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Yet none of the cited cases supports the lead opinion's framework. Here, a court rendered a final judgment that C.C.'s consent was valid and complied with ICWA. And no one has challenged that final judgment-either via direct appeal or collateral attack. No court that we are aware of-and Justice Himonas cites none-has ever revisited the factual or legal underpinnings of a mother's consent\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in a subsequent proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 133 All of the cases cited by Justice Himonas are distinguishable. First, nearly all of them fit within the two categories of subject-matter jurisdiction identified above. And the few that do not fit this paradigm bear no resemblance to the facts of this case, as they involve statutory prerequisites to jurisdiction that are not present in our code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 134 Justice Himonas's cases generally fall into three categories. In one category the courts are simply stating that a defect in a mother's consent is a legal barrier to the issuance of an adoption order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   No one doubts that conclusion. A birth mother's consent is undeniably a prerequisite to the issuance of an adoption decree. And in that sense it can certainly be said that the court lacks \"jurisdiction\" to issue an adoption decree. Yet these holdings appear in cases in which\n   <em>\n    the birth parent\n   </em>\n   appears and challenges the validity of the consent. So they tell us nothing useful about the question presented here-which is whether a failure of consent is a\n   <em>\n    subject-matter jurisdictional\n   </em>\n   defect that can be raised by the court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6 135 Other cases cited in the lead opinion rest on principles of\n   <em>\n    personal jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . In these cases courts have allowed a collateral attack on a final order by a birth parent whose connection to or notice from the forum state was constitutionally defective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Occasionally the courts have offhandedly referred\n   to such a defect as going to\n   <em>\n    subject-matter jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, confusing terminology aside, this is decidedly not a matter of\n   <em>\n    subject-matter jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . The lack of notice or connection to the forum goes to\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    territorial jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . And that sort of jurisdiction has long been understood as subject to the law of preservation and waiver-in that a failure to raise a personal jurisdiction defense at the first opportunity results in a forfeiture, and the matter is not the court's to raise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6 136 Justice Himonas also cites a few cases where the states' adoption statutes require that specific documents be filed simultaneously with the petition for adoption as a precondition to the court's acquisition of subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even under this third category of cases, jurisdiction is determined as of the filing of the action. It is not divested by any subsequent interpretive error that may arise in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00b6 137 Here Justice Himonas does not assert that there was any defect in jurisdiction at the time the case was initiated. He couldn't. By statute, our Utah courts are expressly authorized to assume jurisdiction over adoption petitions and determine parental rights and consent at any time during the proceeding-prior to the issuance of the adoption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   And there is no dispute that the district court did in fact terminate C.C.'s rights and determine that no father had established rights in the child prior to proceeding on the petition for adoption.\n   <em>\n    See Order Allowing Relinquishment of Parental Rights, Terminating Birth Mother's Parental Rights, and Determining Birth Father's Rights\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Sept. 25, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6 138 The cases cited by Justice Himonas should also be viewed in historical perspective. Many of the cited cases are from a bygone era-in which adoption was disfavored and the rights of biological parents were elevated above the best interests of the child and the interests of adoptive parents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \u00b6 139 But these principles have no application to Utah adoption law today. Our Utah Adoption Act was enacted in 2008. And in enacting this law our legislature made express findings rejecting the notion that adoption is disfavored because it disrupts biological family ties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-6-102. Our legislature has thus rejected the premises underlying many of the cases cited by Justice Himonas. In Utah the best interests of the child are paramount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-6-102(1). We also have recognized the fundamental interests of adoptive parents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-6-102(5)(d). These are other grounds for suspicion of Justice Himonas's reliance on the cited cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6 140 The issue presented in this case, moreover, is quite distinct from that presented in the cases cited by the majority. Here we are squarely presented with a question regarding\n   <em>\n    subject-matter jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   -whether we may consider a potential objection that no party has raised and that goes to an order that was rendered final and unappealable many months back. The lead opinion's theory on this point is unprecedented. It has cited no authority for the proposal to review a final order that determined that valid consent was given and that was never challenged by the mother who gave the consent. Indeed, the district court's order was not even challenged by the putative father-either below or on appeal. The lead opinion's view that we have authority, indeed an obligation, to review the mother's consent is without support in the cited cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6 141 Utah law is likewise unhelpful to the lead opinion. The\n   <em>\n    Deveraux' Adoption\n   </em>\n   case is similar to the line of adoption cases cited by Justice Himonas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Deveraux\n   </em>\n   speaks of a court \"never obtain[ing] jurisdiction to exercise the power to grant\" an adoption in a case in which there was a defect in a birth mother's consent.\n   <em>\n    Deveraux' Adoption v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8866104\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/2/30/\">\n    268 P.2d at 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the\n   <em>\n    Deveraux\n   </em>\n   court's notion of \"jurisdiction\" goes only to the legal authority of the court to award certain relief (to issue an adoption decree).\n   <em>\n    Deveraux\n   </em>\n   had no occasion to consider whether a defect in the birth mother's consent deprived the court of subject-matter jurisdiction because the birth mother herself intervened in the adoption and \"objected that her consent was never validly given.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Deveraux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8866104\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/2/30/\">\n    268 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   996 ). So\n   <em>\n    Deveraux\n   </em>\n   likewise tells us nothing of relevance to the matter before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   3. Governmental Immunity Act and Administrative Exhaustion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6 142 That leaves only the governmental immunity and administrative exhaustion cases cited by Justice Himonas. The lead opinion cites those cases to support its view that \"[t]here are often prerequisites individual litigants must meet to show that they have satisfied the requirements of subject matter jurisdiction even when we unquestionably have subject matter jurisdiction over\" a general category of cases.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. We have no quarrel with that general proposition. The \"categories\" of cases over which our courts have subject-matter jurisdiction certainly have boundaries to them. And litigants must make a case-by-case showing as to whether they fall within the relevant boundaries. But that unobjectionable proposition is hardly a license for us to treat mere preconditions to the issuance of a given type of order as a bar to the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   \u00b6 143 Conditions that go to subject-matter jurisdiction are clearly denominated as such.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   And they are, by necessity, conditions that can be established fairly easily at the outset of the litigation. Familiar examples in federal court are the existence of a federal question or the diversity of citizenship of the parties (and a sufficient amount in controversy).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 32. But in Utah our district courts are courts of general jurisdiction. They have general power to hear \"all matters civil and criminal\" so long as they are \"not excepted in the Utah Constitution and not prohibited by law.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-5-102(1). The code, admittedly, places certain restrictions on the jurisdiction of our district courts. But they are expressly denominated as such-as jurisdictional limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   And they are matters that may be easily assessed at the outset of the litigation, unlike legal preconditions to the issuance of a given form of judicial relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   \u00b6 144 It is true that the governmental immunity and administrative exhaustion cases identify \"case-specific procedural facts\" that have been deemed to go to subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. But these cases provide no authority to treat any legal precondition to the issuance of a form of judicial relief as subject-matter jurisdictional. Instead these cases fit comfortably within the settled paradigm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   \u00b6 145 It is also true that we have held that the filing of a notice of claim with the government is a statutory \"prerequisite to vesting a district court with subject matter jurisdiction over claims against governmental entities.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler v. McPherson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474753\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/632/\">\n    2002 UT 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474753\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/632/\">\n    40 P.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that does not at all mean that any statutory prerequisite to a successful tort claim is subject-matter jurisdictional. It means that our law treats the failure to file a notice of claim as a matter rendering the judicial proceeding\n   <em>\n    unripe\n   </em>\n   . This fits comfortably within the traditional notion of justiciability. A failure to file a claim with a non-judicial department of government can be understood to deem the judicial filing premature. And a premature filing can easily be viewed as a categorical defect that goes to subject-matter jurisdiction; it is subject-matter jurisdictional in that it deems the non-judicial department the appropriate body to resolve the matter, and accordingly holds that the filing in court is premature. That is ultimately what our cases say.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rushton v.

We leave it at that, as doing so avoids the slippery slope introduced by the lead opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6 146 The exhaustion cases are similar. They hold that a court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction where a plaintiff has failed to exhaust its avenues for relief in an administrative agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hous.

But again this is no broad conclusion that all legal preconditions to a successful claim are subject-matter jurisdictional. It goes to traditional justiciability in the sense of ripeness. So our exhaustion cases similarly identify a categorical defect that goes to subject-matter jurisdiction. They conclude that a non-judicial entity is the appropriate body to resolve the matter, and that a court lacks jurisdiction because the case belongs in an administrative proceeding and not in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   \u00b6 147 We follow these precedents but do not extend them in the manner devised by the lead opinion.

Systemic Costs and Slippery Slope\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6 148 The lead opinion's framework may appear to protect the interests of a sympathetic party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1 (expressing concerns about the \"septic\" nature of this case, infected by a birth mother who \"perpetrated a fraud\" and deprived a birth father of his chance to intervene to protect his interests). But it would do so at a substantial cost to the coherence of our law and to basic tenets of our judicial system-to the law of subject-matter jurisdiction, to rules of waiver and preservation, and to principles of finality and efficiency embedded deeply in our jurisprudence. Such costs are immediately apparent in the adoption setting; but the decision proposed in the lead opinion would also reverberate in other fields.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b6 149 If Justice Himonas's view prevailed, it would be the judge's duty (both in the district court and on appeal) to search the record for statutory prerequisites to an adoption that may not have been fulfilled. And whenever such a defect was found, the subject-matter jurisdiction of the adoption court would be in jeopardy. Such jeopardy would last for at least a year beyond the entry of the adoption decree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 n.11. And throughout such proceedings, both in the district court and during any appeal, the parties could expect a more sluggish and less efficient disposition-as judges would be required to make ongoing assessments on issues heretofore left to the adversary system. All interested parties would suffer as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   \u00b6 150 The lead opinion purports to limit its rule to a specific prerequisite to the issuance of an adoption decree-to the validity of the birth mother's consent. But the logic of its\n   analysis sweeps more broadly. Any and all \"case-specific procedural facts\" would be eligible for classification as subject-matter jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. All that matters under the lead opinion is that the matter in question be an important precondition to the availability of the relief sought by the plaintiff. The possibilities for inclusion are endless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the timeframe for upsetting a final adoption is potentially unlimited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6 151 Justice Himonas says that a defect in the mother's consent deprives the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction because \"absent consent,\" the court is \"without authorization to interfere with the fundamental right that is the parent-child relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The lead opinion even goes so far as to say that without valid consent \"no child has been made available for adoption.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6 152 But that is an unvarnished judicial fiction. Of course there is a child to be adopted. We call him \"B.B.\" here to protect his anonymity. But he is a real child with a real interest in these proceedings. And he has been living with his would-be adoptive parents since just after his birth in 2014. Since that time all of these individuals have proceeded in reliance on the finality of the order terminating the birth mother's parental rights. They may not yet have an adoption decree. But they have rested easily on the conclusion that the birth mother no longer has a right to interfere with the adoption because her consent was deemed valid, her rights were terminated, and the time for questioning the basis for those decisions has long passed. So the lead opinion may say there is no child to be adopted, but all those who had anything to do with B.B. have long thought otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \u00b6 153 What the lead opinion is really saying is that it thinks the validity of a mother's consent is particularly important. It says as much in asserting that the \"requirement of consent is mandatory and jurisdictional because it goes to the soul of the adoption.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Fair enough. We don't doubt that a mother's consent is a crucial step in the proceedings. But subject-matter jurisdiction is different. Our law has long assessed subject-matter jurisdiction at the categorical level-encompassing only statutory limits on\n   the classes of cases to be decided by the court and traditional limits on justiciability. A defect in consent fits in neither category. So if a consent problem is a jurisdictional problem then so are many other legal grounds for challenging the propriety of a district court's decision. That cannot be-unless we are prepared to abandon the central tenets of finality and adversariness at the heart of our justice system. We are not. And we reject the lead opinion's view that a defect in consent might deprive our courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over an adoption proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   D. Jurisdiction Is Proper Under the Lead Opinion's Theory\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   \u00b6 154 If a defect in a birth mother's consent really deprived the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction, then the proper course would be an order of vacatur and dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the lead opinion would not dismiss the case. It would remand to allow the mother to decide whether to enter a valid consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84 n.32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \u00b6 155 That is telling. What it tells us is that even the lead opinion would not ultimately conclude that the district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over any of the issues it undertakes to review-namely the adjudication of C.C.'s consent and the denial of the E.T.'s motion to intervene. Even taking the lead opinion's view of the cases at face value, there isn't a single case for the proposition that a district court lacks jurisdiction to decide whether consent was validly given or to determine whether a party claiming an interest in the child may properly intervene in the proceedings. These are pre-adoption issues that, under any view, a district court has power to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   \u00b6 156 The lead opinion tries to split the baby. It concludes that the court has jurisdiction to take \"valid consent\" but lacks jurisdiction to take \"invalid consent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84 n.32. But there is no such thing as a defect in subject-matter jurisdiction that arises only if the court decides an issue one way. What the lead opinion is really trying to do is reopen the merits of the termination order. But the merits of the termination order are foreclosed from our consideration here for all of the reasons set forth in Part I.A above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   \u00b6 157 We leave the matter there. The contrary path articulated in the lead opinion would upend the settled law of subject-matter jurisdiction in troubling ways. We decline to take that path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   II. MOTION TO INTERVENE AND FEDERAL PATERNITY STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b6 158 The lead opinion's decision on the merits of E.T.'s motion to intervene is likewise problematic. Here a majority of the court expands the reach of ICWA in a manner that its plain language cannot bear-and that ignores a countervailing purpose that Congress was also balancing in enacting ICWA. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b6 159 ICWA, like most statutes, is not \"aimed at advancing a single objective at the expense of all others.\"\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

It is a \"result of a legislative give-and-take that balances multiple concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . A key countervailing purpose at stake under ICWA is the protection of the traditional jurisdiction of state courts over adoption proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (noting that states possess \"recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   ICWA does not oust the\n   states of that traditional area of their authority.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It recognizes it to a large degree-balancing against the interests of the integrity of Indian families the rights of the states to vindicate the important interests protected by their laws of adoption and parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b6 160 In other words, ICWA does not create an independent federal adoption regime. Its substantive provisions function only within the context of a state or tribal adoption proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201901\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1911-13. And Congress did not override the traditional jurisdiction inherent in adoption cases. It simply mandated some minimum standards that state adoption schemes must satisfy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201901\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1902.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \u00b6 161 This confirms that Congress understood the importance of state law in this field. And it recognized the fundamental nature of the interests protected by such law-including the welfare and best interests of children, which are implicated whenever an adoption proceeding is underway. Thus, ICWA does not guarantee an unfettered right of members of Indian tribes to intervene in or object to an adoption in any circumstance or at any time. It sets forth specific, limited rights of tribal members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b6 162 The provision at issue here is along these lines. It does not guarantee a right to notice and intervention to any tribal member with a claimed interest in a child in an adoption proceeding. It limits that right to a \"parent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And ICWA defines \"parent\" in a careful, limited way. It states that a \"parent\" is \"any biological parent or parents of an Indian child,\"\n   <em>\n    not including\n   </em>\n   \"the unwed father where paternity has not been acknowledged or established.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1903(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b6 163 To me this is an obvious invocation of state law. I say\n   <em>\n    obvious\n   </em>\n   because paternity has never been a creature of federal law. It has always been a matter within the exclusive sovereignty of the states. The longstanding rule in Utah and elsewhere is that an unwed father's legal rights as a father-his \"paternity\"-is established by the law of the state in which his putative child's adoption goes forward.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Baby B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256060\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/382/\">\n    2012 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256060\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/382/\">\n    308 P.3d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   HOMER H.

These are terms that impose varying standards throughout the fifty states (and the laws of Indian nations). We cannot possibly interpret this language of ICWA to prescribe a uniform federal standard. The only way to achieve uniformity would be to legislate a specific, binding federal standard. Yet even the majority declines to do that. It just says it thinks that a reasonability standard would work the best.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   And it provides no analysis under that standard other than to say that E.T. has acknowledged or established paternity under any possible standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   \u00b6 167 To me that suggests that we are not really interpreting the terms of the governing federal statute. If we are unable to state a meaningful legal standard, we are not really judging in accordance with a rule of law. We are only picking a winner in litigation. I cannot agree with this decision.

ICWA Invokes State Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6 168 The starting place for our analysis should be the statutory text. And that text strongly signals the congressional adoption of a state standard of paternity. It does so by employing legal terms of art with settled meaning in family law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \u00b6 169 A person cannot qualify as a\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   under ICWA if he is an \"unwed father\" whose \"paternity has not been acknowledged or established.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). Four elements of this phrasing cut against the majority's conclusion that ICWA directs state courts to establish a uniform\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   standard of paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   \u00b6 170 First, the words\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    establishment\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    paternity\n   </em>\n   are long-established terms of art in state family law. All fifty states prescribe their own standards and procedures for\n   <em>\n    acknowledging\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    establishing paternity\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the phrases employed\n   in ICWA encompass concepts that most all states share in common: (a) the notion of an\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   of paternity, which generally refers to a writing by a father (with or without a requirement of consent by the mother), where the writing itself has the legal effect of sustaining a father's parental rights to some degree;\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (b) the concept of an\n   <em>\n    establishment\n   </em>\n   of paternity, which is initiated by a court filing and culminates in the issuance of a judicial order (sometimes contested but not necessarily) establishing the father's parental rights and obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Surely it was no accident that Congress utilized terms with accepted meaning in state family law. And because it did, we should presume that ICWA embraced the principles embedded in these state law terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   \u00b6 171 Second, the statute speaks in the past tense. It forecloses the right to notice and intervention for unwed fathers whose paternity \"\n   <em>\n    has not been\n   </em>\n   acknowledged or established.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). This backward-looking phrasing further underscores the state term-of-art premise of the ICWA definition. Congress made the putative father's right to notice and intervention dependent on what\n   <em>\n    had been\n   </em>\n   acknowledged or established-past tense. And there is not and never has been any way for a father to \"acknowledge\" or \"establish\" his parental rights as a matter of\n   <em>\n    federal law\n   </em>\n   . There is no such thing as federal family law (see more on that below). And for that reason it would be very odd for Congress to be speaking of a\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   acknowledgement or establishment of paternity as a prerequisite to a right to notice and intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   \u00b6 172 Third, the statutory duty to provide notice to those whose paternity has been\n   <em>\n    acknowledged\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    established\n   </em>\n   indicates that these are established, formal mechanisms. A family who wishes to adopt a child of Indian heritage has a statutory duty to provide notice to any\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   . But if\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   includes anyone who has vaguely\n   <em>\n    acknowledged\n   </em>\n   paternity in some informal way, the adopting family will have no way to know how to fulfill its obligations under ICWA. And an Indian mother would have no way of assuring that her child will actually be given to the adoptive couple, even after her own parental rights have been terminated. That is a further strike against the majority's construction. Surely Congress didn't mean to require biological mothers and adoptive families to give notice to persons whose\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   of paternity was so vague and informal that they cannot reasonably be identified. And the majority's decision to require this only enhances the practical concerns identified above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   \u00b6 173 A fourth and related point builds on a series of established canons or norms of statutory construction in this field.

So to make law on the appropriate standards, we would have to step into the role long held by our legislature. I have no idea how to do that. (Should we hold legislative hearings the way the legislature does when it adopts or amends laws in this field?) And I am certain Congress didn't mean for the Utah Supreme Court to have the final say on the matter. We are one of fifty state courts of last resort. So to interpret ICWA to give this body the power to decide on an ideal standard for the acknowledgement or establishment of paternity is to assure a lack of a uniform standard.

The court's starting premise is overbroad; it misses the obvious implications of our American federalism. The law of paternity is like many other pockets of state law, with substantial variation from state to state. State law varies widely on a wide range of questions, such as negligence, strict liability, breach of contract, divorce, child custody, and intestate succession. But a federal statute invoking legal terminology from one of these fields would not properly be understood as using the words of the law in an ordinary (non-legal) sense just because there are legal variations from state to state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   \u00b6 188 The terms in question here-\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    establishment\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    paternity\n   </em>\n   -moreover, are legal terms with a common \"core meaning.\" At the heart of every state's standards for\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    paternity\n   </em>\n   is the question whether the purported parents have shown that they accept responsibility for the child.\n   <em>\n    Acknowledge\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (9th ed. 2009) (defining \"acknowledge\" as \"[t]o show that one accepts responsibility for \").\n   <em>\n    Establishment\n   </em>\n   of paternity also has a core meaning.

But a statutory reference to these established legal terms should be viewed against the backdrop of the law. And we will misunderstand or misuse the terminology if we ignore its legal context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority commits this fatal error in its approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6 192 In my view it is beside the point that \"Utah law requires the birth mother's signature in addition to the unmarried biological father's signature\" as a condition of an acknowledgement \"through a declaration of paternity.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.

It is simply an indication that\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   means of securing rights of paternity in a given state's law will suffice as a matter of federal Indian law. And certainly E.T.\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   secured his paternity rights under Utah law; he simply failed to do so in any of the means required by our law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   \u00b6 193 There is likewise nothing \"anomalous\" about the notion that \"an unmarried biological Indian father's status as a parent under ICWA\" depends on his compliance with the laws of the state where the child is born.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. That is not some unforeseen oddity of my reading of ICWA; it is an inherent feature of our longstanding system of federalism that was well-known to Congress-a system in which parental rights are a creature of state law, and thus may be established under the various laws of the fifty states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   \u00b6 194 The alternative, moreover, is a make-it-up-as-we-go standard-a standard without any real content, except the notion that a biological father must meet an undefined \"reasonability standard\" that is \"less exacting\" than the requirements of Utah law.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. That seems close to an admission that the court has no standard. And the lack of a standard assures that the majority cannot ultimately live up to its premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6 195 Instead the majority offers only a bare holding-that E.T.'s \"actions satisfied the requirements for acknowledging paternity under ICWA using a reasonability standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. And the court simply lists the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   it deems sufficient under the circumstances of this case. That is a further admission that we are not stating a legal standard but only a disposition of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \u00b6 196 Perhaps that's understandable. The logic of the court's opinion, after all, is one that can lead only to the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   bare \"acknowledgement\" of paternity, however minimal, must suffice as a matter of federal Indian law. To support its holding, the majority points to hurdles set by Utah law that E.T. has not satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. And it concludes that Utah law is too \"exacting.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Thus, it is unacceptable, in the court's view, to allow \"state law to determine who is a parent under ICWA\" because that \"would, in some cases, provide a lower level of protection of parental rights than ICWA intends.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. With this in mind, the court sets forth a vague reasonability standard that purports to be more protective \"of parental rights pertaining to Indian children.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   \u00b6 197 But why stop there? The logic of the court's opinion will lead inevitably to the most minimally \"exacting\" acknowledgement of paternity imaginable. Anything less, after all, could sustain the same conclusion reached in this case-that ICWA's purpose is to protect the rights of Indian tribal members, and that allowing state law (or any law except a minimalist acknowledgement) \"to determine who is a parent under ICWA would ... provide a lower level of protection of parental rights than ICWA intends.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   \u00b6 198 The majority apparently perceives the problem with that approach. If any bare\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   by a putative father will do, then the statutory definition will be eviscerated: All unwed putative fathers will become entitled to notice and a right to intervene because any father can plausibly say he made a bare acknowledgement of paternity at some point. And that cannot be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VCS, Inc. v. Utah Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6976358\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/290/\">\n    2012 UT 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6976358\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/290/\">\n    293 P.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that an interpretation that would \"swallow\" statutory language \"runs afoul of the settled canon of preserving independent meaning for all statutory provisions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   \u00b6 199 Presumably that is why the court stops short of stating a meaningful standard. Perhaps it acknowledges that we cannot defensibly pick a paternity standard out of the air. But unless we are willing to set the bar at the lowest imaginable level, the logic of the court's opinion will always call for us to set it lower; otherwise we will have a standard that is too \"exacting\" to satisfy the purpose of ICWA. So the court, naturally, is left to state no meaningful standard at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6 200 And that is also untenable-and completely at odds with the core premise of the court's opinion. The majority's premise is that Congress could not have intended a state-law-based notion of\n   <em>\n    acknowledgement\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    establishment\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    paternity\n   </em>\n   because it intended a nationwide uniform standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Yet the court's holding assures the exact opposite. This court today says that Utah law has set the paternity bar too high. But absent any meaningful legal standard, our opinion today assures a complete lack of uniformity. If today's opinion takes hold in other states, it will guarantee chaos and unpredictability-not uniformity. It will invite each court faced with the paternity question to offer its own subjective assessment of what is a \"reasonable\" acknowledgment of paternity and whether the state or tribal paternity laws in question are too \"exacting.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b6 201 The majority's approach may also produce devastating unintended consequences. By recognizing an unwed father's right to notice and intervention upon a vague, informal \"acknowledgement\" of paternity, and ignoring the backward-looking requirement of paternity that \"has ... been acknowledged,\" the court opens the door to the possibility that a putative Indian father will come forward months or even years later and assert a right to disrupt even a finalized adoption. If and when this eventuality arises, perhaps the courts will find a \"reasonability\" time bar or estoppel basis to avoid this disruption. But I see no basis for it on the face of ICWA. So as the law stands there is no assurance that an adoption of an Indian child\n   will ever be truly final. The court's approach leaves open the possibility of disruption of any adoption of an Indian child whose biological father might one day claim to have \"acknowledged\" his paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \u00b6 202 This cannot be what Congress had in mind when it limited the rights of notice and intervention to unwed fathers who have had their paternity\n   <em>\n    acknowledged\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    established\n   </em>\n   . Surely Congress meant for courts to apply a fixed legal standard. And because ICWA uses settled terms of art from family law, I would interpret it to incorporate state (and tribal) law on this question. I would accordingly affirm the district court's denial of E.T.'s motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   \u00b6 203 For reasons stated in Part I of this opinion a majority of the court finds no defect in subject-matter jurisdiction. A different majority nonetheless reverses the denial of the motion to intervene. I dissent from that decision for reasons set forth in Part II of my opinion. I would also affirm the district court's denial of E.T.'s motion to dismiss and remand for finalization of the adoption.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-260\">\n    I refer to E.T., the unmarried biological father, as \"Birth Father,\" C.C., the unmarried biological mother, as \"Birth Mother,\" and B.B. as the \"Child.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-261\">\n    Put a little differently, this case implicates issues of subject matter jurisdiction and statutory interpretation. The subject matter jurisdiction issue turns on whether we may void the termination of Birth Mother's parental rights by holding that Birth Mother failed to give valid consent, and that, therefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate her parental rights. But the majority of the court-Chief Justice Durrant, Associate Chief Justice Lee, and Justice Pearce-holds that this issue is not properly before us and therefore does not reach the issue of Birth Mother's consent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    On the statutory interpretation question, which turns on whether Birth Father is a \"parent\" under ICWA, a majority of the court-Justices Himonas, Durham, and Pearce-holds that Birth Father qualifies as a parent because he met the federal standard for acknowledging or establishing paternity. The dissent would hold that there is no federal standard for acknowledging or establishing paternity, and that Birth Father's failure to follow Utah procedures for acknowledging or establishing paternity means that he is not a parent under ICWA. Because the court concludes that Birth Father is a parent under ICWA, it also holds that he has a right to notice and to intervene in the adoption proceedings, reversing the district court's contrary conclusion and remanding for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-263\">\n    In its decision, the district court listed facts that \"the Court from a careful review of the parties' submissions believe[d] ... to be undisputed, and [did] not by th[e] factual recitation intend to resolve disputed factual issues, if any.\" We mirror the district court in this regard, reciting facts from the record that appear largely undisputed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    Birth Mother claims that \"within one week of th[e] court entering its order to relinquish [her] rights, [she] contacted [the adoption agency] and informed them that [she] wanted to withdraw [her] consent\" and was told that it was too late.

Rather than focusing exclusively on E.T.'s actions prior to the termination order, it spends significant time on the actions E.T. took after the termination order.

The relevant \"actions\" boil down to E.T. providing for C.C. for the first six months of pregnancy and believing that C.C. would come back to South Dakota or that he would join C.C. in Utah after the baby was born. If this amounts to a reasonable acknowledgment of paternity, almost anything will. After all, E.T. appears to have provided for C.C. even before the child was conceived, and he does not assert that he articulated or documented his beliefs regarding future plans before the custody proceedings were initiated. Under those circumstances I cannot see how the adoptive parents or the district court would have any way of knowing that E.T. had an interest in the child-or of providing E.T. notice at the time the adoption petition was filed.
