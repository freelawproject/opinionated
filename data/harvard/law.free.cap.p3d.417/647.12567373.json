As relevant here, Yesha Anthony Garcia appealed his conviction for attempted murder, arguing that his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel had been violated when his counsel failed to object to an error-ridden jury instruction regarding imperfect self-defense,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804912\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/970/\">\n    2016 UT App 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-16 &amp; n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804912\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/970/\">\n    370 P.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and failed to request a jury instruction explaining that arson and aggravated arson are forcible felonies that Garcia was entitled to use deadly force to defend against,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804912\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/970/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We concluded that approving the errors in the imperfect self-defense instruction, including the misplaced burden of proof, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore vacated Garcia's conviction for attempted murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Because we vacated Garcia's conviction on this basis, we did not address his arson-instruction contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 n.7. We also expressed skepticism as to whether Garcia was entitled to an imperfect self-defense instruction under the facts of the case,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 n.4, but noted that Garcia's counsel, the State, and the trial court had all agreed that he was so entitled,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The Utah Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Garcia had not been prejudiced by the erroneous instruction regarding imperfect self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Garcia II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2053\">\n    2017 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48, --- P.3d ----. The supreme court highlighted Garcia's statements to police and his trial testimony and concluded that \"[t]he evidence that Garcia pulled the trigger out of\n   a desire to kill [the victim] overpowers any evidence that he acted on a reasonable but erroneous belief that he was defending himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. The supreme court therefore held that no prejudice arose from counsel's failure to request a correct imperfect self-defense instruction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 We now address the question we did not reach in\n   <em>\n    Garcia I -\n   </em>\n   whether Garcia received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel did not seek to have the jury instructed that arson and aggravated arson were forcible felonies for purposes of an imperfect self-defense claim. \"To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that trial counsel's performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced thereby.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880601\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/769/\">\n    2015 UT App 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880601\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/769/\">\n    345 P.3d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Garcia's contention revolves around the imperfect self-defense instruction given to the jury. Imperfect self-defense would have applied here if the jury had determined that Garcia had acted \"under a reasonable belief that the circumstances provided a legal justification or excuse for the conduct although the conduct was not legally justifiable or excusable under the existing circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-203\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(a) (LexisNexis 2012). Garcia argues that his counsel was not effective because counsel did not ensure that the jury understood that defending against the threat of arson or aggravated arson would have justified shooting at the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 However, this argument is foreclosed by the supreme court's conclusion that Garcia did not suffer prejudice from other defects in the imperfect self-defense instruction given at trial. The supreme court determined that the evidence that Garcia \"was motivated by a desire to kill [the victim] overwhelmed the evidence that Garcia acted in imperfect self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2053\">\n    2017 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45, --- P.3d ----. Therefore, no prejudice resulted when the imperfect self-defense instruction misstated the law in several ways.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. A jury instruction defining and explaining that arson and aggravated arson were forcible felonies would merely have clarified an arguably vague term of the imperfect self-defense instruction, i.e., what crimes, as perceived by Garcia, could have given him a legal justification for shooting at the victim. Because Garcia was not prejudiced by the erroneous imperfect self-defense instruction actually given to the jury,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , no prejudice could have resulted from an alleged ambiguity in that instruction that a more definite arson instruction would have cured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 We also reject Garcia's cumulative-error claim. Given the supreme court's conclusion that Garcia did not suffer prejudice from the erroneous imperfect self-defense instruction, we do not see any greater risk of prejudice from an ambiguity in that instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips Co. v. Utah Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342727\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/397/772/\">\n    2017 UT App 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342727\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/397/772/\">\n    397 P.3d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our confidence [in the fairness of a verdict] is more likely to be shaken when the errors work together in a pernicious manner so as to cause more prejudice than the mere sum of the individual errors.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The supreme court's opinion did not contain an explicit remand instruction. After that opinion was issued, counsel for Garcia indicated to the clerk of the supreme court that further issues existed requiring remittitur to this court. The clerk remitted the case to us, with the direction to \"address any potential independent grounds for decision that were properly raised on appeal but that have not yet been addressed.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
