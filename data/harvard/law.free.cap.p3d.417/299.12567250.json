We exercise our authority pursuant to M. R. App. P. 15(4) and reformulate the question as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Under Montana law, when a plaintiff claims he was injured directly by an officer's affirmative acts, does the public-duty doctrine exclude all duties that may arise\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pursuant to generally applicable principles of negligence?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the answer to the reformulated question is no. Law-enforcement officers owe the public a general duty to preserve the peace and protect the public from harm inflicted by third persons or other independent sources. The public-duty\n   doctrine recognizes that, because the duty to protect\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is owed to the public generally, an officer does not have a legal duty to protect each individual plaintiff absent a special relationship. Accordingly, breach of that general duty is actionable only in the form of criminal prosecution or administrative disposition; it is not a proper basis for an individual plaintiff's negligence claim. However, independent of the duty to protect and based on generally applicable principles of negligence, an officer may owe a legal duty to a person injured directly by the officer's affirmative actions. The public-duty doctrine only applies to an officer's duty to protect the general public, and therefore does not apply to exclude the legal duty an officer may owe to a person injured directly by the officer's affirmative actions. In this case, Robert Bassett-a homeowner injured in the course of Officer Paul Lamantia's pursuit of a criminal suspect-alleges he was injured directly by Lamantia's affirmative acts. Therefore, the public-duty doctrine is inapposite and we find that Lamantia owed Bassett a legal duty to exercise the same care that a reasonable officer with similar skill, training, and experience would under the same or similar circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit submitted factual information in its certification order, which we summarize as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Officer Lamantia and his partner responded to a neighborhood disturbance around 12:30 a.m. At the scene, Lamantia observed a male suspect running into a driveway. The suspect jumped over a retaining wall and proceeded into Bassett's backyard. Lamantia identified himself as a police officer and ordered the suspect to stop. The suspect continued to run and Lamantia followed on foot, jumping over the retaining wall but dropping his flashlight in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 In the meantime, Bassett came out of his house to investigate the commotion. Lamantia, searching for his flashlight, heard footsteps behind him and turned around to see Bassett approaching. Fearing for\n   his safety, Lamantia tackled Bassett to the ground. Lamantia released Bassett as soon as he realized that Bassett was not a threat. Bassett then pointed Lamantia in the suspect's direction and Lamantia continued pursuit. Later that morning, Lamantia returned to check on Bassett, who declined an ambulance or medical help. A few hours later, however, Bassett called the police department to report that he was injured during his encounter with Lamantia. Bassett was subsequently diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Bassett later sued Lamantia and the City of Billings in state court. Bassett alleged a state-law negligence claim against Lamantia for failing to exercise reasonable care in performing his duties and a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   violation. Lamantia and the City removed the case to federal court, where the United States District Court entered summary judgment in their favor on both claims. Regarding the negligence claim, the court found that the public-duty doctrine shielded Lamantia and the City from liability because no special relationship existed. Bassett appealed the court's decision concerning only the negligence claim to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Based on these facts, the Ninth Circuit certified to this Court the public-duty doctrine question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 M. R. App. P. 15(3) permits this Court to answer a question of law certified to it by another qualifying court. Accordingly, as a question of law, our review of a certified question is \"purely an interpretation of the law as applied to the agreed facts underlying the action.\"\n   <em>\n    N. Pac. Ins.

For example, Bassett disputes whether he approached Lamantia prior to being tackled; instead, he maintains that he was standing in his front yard near his house when tackled. We can nonetheless answer the certified question without relying on potentially disputed facts, as our inquiry deals exclusively with whether Lamantia owed Bassett a legal duty. Importantly, the certification order specifies that Bassett alleges Lamantia failed to exercise reasonable care in performing his duties when Lamantia tackled Bassett to the ground. Because our answer to the reformulated certified question depends entirely on what specific duty Bassett alleges Lamantia owed him, disagreement over other facts is immaterial to our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 As another preliminary matter, we explain our reasons for reformulating the certified question. The question as originally asked risks an overly broad answer that could expand application of the public-duty doctrine to exclude other applicable duties. We also do not want to improperly blend negligence elements, such as duty and causation. The question as originally phrased asked us to consider whether the public-duty doctrine shielded \"a law enforcement officer from liability for negligence where the officer is the direct and sole cause of the\" plaintiff's harm. In his briefing, Bassett urges us to hold that the public-duty doctrine does not apply in cases where an officer is \"the direct and sole cause of the harm suffered by the plaintiff.\" Causation, however, is a separate element of a negligence claim, unrelated to identifying any legal duty the defendant may owe the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"184990\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/295/416/\">\n    1999 MT 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"184990\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/295/416/\">\n    295 Mont. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"184990\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/295/416/\">\n    986 P.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The public-duty doctrine applies only to the legal duty owed, not to causation. Further, any question of causation must be left to the fact finder. Our reformulated certified question allows for consideration of whether Lamantia owed Bassett a duty, independent of the duty to protect and preserve the peace. Bassett contends that he was injured directly by Lamantia's affirmative\n   acts, not from harm inflicted by a third party. Specifically, Bassett is not claiming that Lamantia failed to protect Bassett from an outside harm; instead, Bassett is claiming that Lamantia's affirmative act of tackling him to the ground was negligent. Therefore, we reformulated the certified question to allow for inquiry of whether a duty, independent of the duty to protect and preserve the peace, is owed when a person in Bassett's circumstances alleges he was directly injured by an officer's affirmative acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 To succeed in a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant had a legal duty; the defendant breached that duty; the breach caused injury; and damages.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. Thus, any claim of negligence first requires that the defendant owe a legal duty to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. Whether a legal duty exists is a matter of law to be decided by the court.\n   <em>\n    Massee\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27. In determining whether duty exists, we consider whether imposing a duty comports with public policy and \"whether the defendant could have foreseen that his conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Fisher v. Swift Transp. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638145\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/342/335/\">\n    2008 MT 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638145\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/342/335/\">\n    342 Mont. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638145\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/342/335/\">\n    181 P.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, duty is mainly a question of foreseeability-whether the person injured was within the scope of risk created by the defendant's action.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Law-enforcement officers assume an obligation to the public to protect and preserve the peace. Indeed, law enforcement's duty to protect arises from its overarching duty to furnish police protection to the public in general. The public-duty doctrine, a rule of common law negligence, provides that a law-enforcement officer does not owe a legal duty to an individual plaintiff where the plaintiff alleges he or she suffered harm from the officer's breach of the general duty to protect and preserve the peace.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. In cases where the public-duty doctrine applies to exclude an officer's duty, no duty is owed because \"a governmental entity cannot be held liable for an individual plaintiff's injury resulting from a governmental officer's breach of a duty owed to the general public rather than to the individual plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Massee\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41 ;\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson v. City of Miles City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757284\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/367/414/\">\n    2012 MT 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757284\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/367/414/\">\n    367 Mont. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757284\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/367/414/\">\n    291 P.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The doctrine exists to address and define the element of duty and is premised upon the principle that each discretionary\n   choice made by an officer while carrying out his professional duty to protect the general public should not be subject to a jury's review with the benefit of hindsight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 The public-duty doctrine \"serves the important purpose of preventing excessive court intervention into the governmental process by protecting the exercise of law enforcement discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21, and protects government entities \"from liability for failure to adequately enforce general laws and regulations, which were intended to benefit the community as a whole,\"\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 (quoting E. McQuillin,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Municipal Corporations\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 53.04.25 at 195-97 (3d ed. 2003) ).

Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487227\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/59/396/#p401\">\n    59 U.S. 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487227\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/59/396/#p401\">\n    18 How. 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487227\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/59/396/#p401\">\n    15 L.Ed. 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1856), where a plaintiff,\n   kidnapped and held for ransom, contended that the sheriff knew about the incident but neglected to \"protect and defend\" him. The Court noted the plaintiff did not allege the sheriff breached a duty in which the sheriff was personally interested, such as execution of a writ, but instead the plaintiff alleged that the sheriff neglected to \"\n   <em>\n    preserve the public peace\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    South\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487227\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/59/396/#p401\">\n    59 U.S. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

We continually recognize that the public-duty doctrine \"expresses the policy that an officer's overarching\n   <em>\n    duty to protect and preserve the peace\n   </em>\n   is owed to the public at large, not to\n   individual members of the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Doris Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41 (citing\n   <em>\n    Eklund\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33, and\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21 ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 In this case, Bassett is not alleging that Lamantia breached a general duty to protect the public; instead, Bassett is alleging that Lamantia acted negligently in tackling him to the ground as Lamantia pursued a suspect. The public-duty doctrine is therefore inapposite and not relevant when, as here, the negligence action is premised upon the existence of a duty other than the duty to protect and preserve the peace. \"A duty owed to all is a duty owed to none\" does not apply when the alleged duty breached is not owed to \"all,\" but rather owed to an individual. The foregoing precedent demonstrates that expanding the public-duty doctrine to apply to other duties owed to an individual in Bassett's position, arising from generally applicable negligence principles, would be both analytically unsound and clearly inconsistent with the underlying principles justifying the doctrine. While an officer must be afforded discretion in protecting the public and preserving the peace, it does not follow that an officer owes no other duties to those he encounters as he carries out his job responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Although we have not previously considered whether a duty independent of the duty to protect and preserve the peace arises where the plaintiff alleges he was directly injured by an officer's negligent affirmative acts, our precedent does recognize that the public-duty doctrine is not applicable in every negligence case where the defendant is a government entity or person.\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the public-duty doctrine \"was not intended to apply in every case to the exclusion of any other duty a public entity may have. It applies only if the public entity truly has a duty owed only to the public at large ... [and] does not apply where the government's duty is defined by other generally applicable principles of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. When presented with a negligence claim where the defendant is a governmental entity or person, courts must first identify the alleged duty breached and determine whether the \"defendant has a specific duty to a plaintiff arising from 'generally applicable principles of law' that would support a tort claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Kent\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17 ). In most instances involving law enforcement, the alleged duty breached is the duty to protect and preserve the peace. The public-duty doctrine applies in those cases and provides that an officer does not owe a plaintiff a legal duty absent a special relationship. However, in instances where the facts inform that an officer owed a duty to an individual, independent\n   of the general duty to protect and preserve the peace owed to the public, the public-duty doctrine does not foreclose a plaintiff's negligence claim. The inquiry\n   necessarily focuses on identifying what duty, if any, is owed to whom. Where the plaintiff claims he was\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   injured by an officer's\n   <em>\n    affirmative\n   </em>\n   acts, the officer owes the plaintiff a legal duty to exercise the same care that a reasonable officer with similar skill, training, and experience would under the same or similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Recently, in\n   <em>\n    Kent v. City of Columbia Falls\n   </em>\n   , we distinguished a claim of negligence based on an affirmative act by a government entity or person from a claim of negligence based on a failure to protect or preserve the peace.\n   <em>\n    Kent\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 47-50.

Thus, a person has a duty to exercise the same level of care that a reasonable and prudent person would when placed in a position where, if he did not use such care, he would injure another's person or property.

Therefore, we ask whether the injured party was a foreseeable plaintiff-whether he \"was within the scope of risk created by the alleged negligence of the tortfeasor.\"\n   <em>\n    Eklund\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28 ).

The question of foreseeability, however, is germane to both roles: the court's in determining the presence or absence of a legal duty and the jury's in determining causation. The court first considers foreseeability to define the legal duty. The jury then considers foreseeability to determine whether the defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's injury. Even though the existence of a legal duty is normally determined by the trial court and necessarily depends on the facts of a particular case, we may decide the issue, as it is a matter of law and the determinative facts in this case-Bassett's allegation that Lamantia's affirmative acts directly injured him-are not in dispute. Accordingly, we conclude that, under the circumstances presented, an officer owes a plaintiff a legal duty where a plaintiff claims that he was directly injured by the officer's affirmative acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 27 Here, Bassett alleges that he was directly injured by Lamantia's affirmative acts. Lamantia's direct and affirmative acts\n   establish the parameters of a legal duty that is independent of any findings the jury might make that Lamantia failed to exercise due care and caused Bassett's injury. Lamantia could have reasonably foreseen that his conduct-tackling someone to the ground-could have resulted in injury to that person. We conclude that Lamantia owed Bassett a legal duty, as Bassett was a foreseeable plaintiff directly injured by Lamantia's affirmative acts. Because we find that Lamantia owed Bassett a legal duty, the question becomes what duty is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28 The standard of care prescribes how a person must act to satisfy the duty of care he owes to the plaintiff. We begin by noting the obvious: an officer does not stand in the same shoes as an ordinary citizen when pursuing a criminal suspect. Inherent in an officer's job responsibilities is a potential risk of injury to those he encounters. In certain professions, the standard of care is defined by determining what standard of care the reasonably prudent professional in that line of work would exercise. For example, a physician who is \"a non-board-certified general practitioner is held to the standard of care of a reasonably competent general practitioner acting in the same or similar community in the United States in the same or similar circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapel v.

Upon a similar rationale, we conclude that a law-enforcement officer's actions should be judged by a standard of care which considers his profession and concomitant obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 29 We determine that law-enforcement officers owe a standard of care in cases where the plaintiff claims an officer breached a duty other than the general duty to protect and preserve the peace. Although the duty arises based on the plaintiff's claim that he was directly injured by the officer's affirmative acts, the standard of care an officer owes in that situation is the care that a reasonable officer with similar skill, training, and experience would exercise under the same or similar circumstances. Whether \"similar circumstances\" exist is a question for the trier of fact in determining whether the defendant breached the duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2665982\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/241/83/#p92\">\n    241 Mont. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2665982\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/241/83/#p92\">\n    785 P.2d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 30 Accordingly, Lamantia owed Bassett a duty to exercise the care that a reasonable officer with similar skill, training, and experience would under the same or similar circumstances. Whether Lamantia departed from that standard of care and thus breached the duty he owed to Bassett, and whether his actions were the cause of Bassett's injuries, are questions of fact to be resolved by the fact finder at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13 ;\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 31 We exercise our authority to reformulate the certified question as: Under Montana law, when a plaintiff claims he was injured directly by an officer's affirmative acts, does the public-duty doctrine exclude all duties that may arise pursuant to generally applicable principles of negligence? We answer that the public-duty doctrine does not exclude other applicable duties under the circumstances presented by the certified question. The public-duty doctrine is only applicable to the duty to protect and preserve the peace, and therefore not relevant where the plaintiff alleges he was directly injured by an officer's affirmative acts. The public-duty doctrine does not exclude other duties which might arise independently pursuant to generally applicable principles of negligence. Here, where Bassett alleges that he was directly injured by Lamantia's affirmative acts, Lamantia owed Bassett a legal duty to exercise the same care that a reasonable officer with similar skill, training, and experience would under the same or similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   DIRK M.

Opinion, \u00b6 24. Ordinary care, in turn, will be measured by the standard that a reasonable officer with similar skill, training, and experience would follow under the same or similar circumstances. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 19, 29-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 34 Because of its reliance on the statutes generally governing the duty of ordinary care, the Court does not separately examine the public policy considerations our cases have employed to determine whether a duty of care arises in a particular circumstance. It bears noting that our Opinion today imposes a common-law duty of negligence; it does not hold that an officer owes a statutory duty. We have not before relied exclusively on the general ordinary care statutes when determining whether a common-law duty exists in a given situation. To my knowledge, the only cases in which we have held the public policy consideration satisfied by legislative expression involved statutes that impose specific duties of care applicable to the circumstances of the case.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 28-29 (holding that several statutes within the motor vehicle code imposed specific duties of care for motor vehicle operators);\n   <em>\n    Prindel\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29 (holding that specific statutes requiring a detention center to receive and confine a prisoner imposed a duty on the county to a plaintiff injured by a committed offender). In\n   <em>\n    Prindel\n   </em>\n   , even though we recognized a statutory duty of care, we considered the public policy factors when determining whether a common-law duty existed.\n   <em>\n    Prindel\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 35 Although the Court does not separately examine these public\n   policy considerations firmly established in our precedent, it does not overrule any prior decisions and reaffirms that public policy is part of the analysis in deciding whether to impose a common-law duty. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 23. I do not read today's Opinion to suggest that \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-701 and 28-1-201, MCA, require the imposition of a new common-law duty any time a person is injured by the acts of another. In the context of the circumstances of this case and the Opinion's thorough consideration of the responsibilities of law enforcement officers, our traditional public policy considerations support the imposition of a duty here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 36 Our precedent recognizes the moral blame that reasonably attaches where a person's conduct causes or allows serious injury.\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22 ;\n   <em>\n    Henricksen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24 ;\n   <em>\n    Estate of Strever\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5383228\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/278/165/#p173\">\n    278 Mont. at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5383228\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/278/165/#p173\">\n    924 P.2d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A law enforcement officer's job is fraught with risk and danger, and the officer has powerful tools at her disposal. Failure to exercise that level of care and skill to which officers are trained-particularly when encountering members of the public in a volatile situation-quickly can lead to serious injury or death. And the desire to prevent future harm is compelling. There is near-daily news of law enforcement officers involved in confrontation and conflict; public interest in the safety of both officers and the people they encounter in their work is strong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 37 The third and fourth considerations tend to go hand in hand when public entities are involved. The extent of burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of holding the public duty doctrine inapplicable here are important considerations. The community bears a cost either way: if a duty is imposed for a law enforcement officer's affirmative acts, the potential liability for breach ultimately falls on the taxpayers; but if a duty is not imposed, the community suffers from the potential that officers will not think through the consequences of their actions and from deterioration in public trust of law enforcement generally. The burden that will fall on the defendant by imposing a duty in the circumstances presented also brings potential to cut both ways. On one hand, the burden is not substantial when considered in light of the Court's ruling that the duty imposed is cabined by the standard of care to which a reasonable officer would be held in similar circumstances. Incorporating the standard of care will ensure that officers\n   are held only to the standards they are trained to meet and that the fact-finder will consider the inherent risk of injury when determining whether an officer's affirmative acts constitute a breach of that legal duty. On the other hand, whether or not they ultimately are determined to be liable, law enforcement officers will be burdened\n   by more litigation and court appearances to defend their actions. And the governments that employ them-and consequently, again, taxpayers-will assume the burden of defending those lawsuits and hiring experts to demonstrate that their officers exercised reasonable care in carrying out their duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 38 The burden on government employers overlaps with the final consideration of insurance. We have recognized that public officers and entities are insured under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gatlin-Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <em>\n    Henricksen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. The public, of course, ultimately bears the cost of that insurance. But, as long as the officer is acting within the course and scope of employment and meets other requirements of law, she will not bear personal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-9-305, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 39 On balance, the strong interests in safety, public trust in government, and accountability of public officers weigh in favor of concluding that public policy supports imposition of the duty the Court recognizes in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Justice Jim Rice and District Court Judge Nickolas Murnion join in the Concurrence of Justice Beth Baker.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
