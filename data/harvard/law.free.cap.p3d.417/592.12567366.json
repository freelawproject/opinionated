Despite the presence of two of its prior decisions with contradictory holdings, the court of appeals then dismissed Mr. Legg's case as moot because of his release. This case presents two issues for our review. First, we must determine whether the court of appeals acted appropriately when it overturned these prior decisions. Second, we must decide whether collateral legal consequences are presumed when an appeal from a probation revocation has otherwise become moot or whether a defendant will be required to show actual collateral legal consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 We conclude that the court of appeals has the same authority to overturn its own precedent as this court and, moreover, acted appropriately in overturning its prior precedent in this case. Additionally, in a well-reasoned and thoughtful opinion, the court of appeals concluded that collateral legal consequences won't be presumed when an appeal from a probation revocation has otherwise become moot.\n   <em>\n    State v. Legg\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Legg II\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177595\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/360/12177595/\">\n    2016 UT App 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177595,12340414\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/360/\">\n    380 P.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the court of appeals on both issues and therefore affirm their decision to dismiss Mr. Legg's appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Mr. Legg pled guilty in two separate cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count each of possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, both third-degree felonies. The district court\n   sentenced Mr. Legg in both cases to the Utah State Prison for the indeterminate term of zero to five years. The court then suspended the prison sentences and placed Mr. Legg on probation for a period of twenty-four months. The court ordered the prison commitments and the periods of probation to run concurrently to one another. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Legg's probation was revoked in both cases for three probation violations, requiring him to serve out his prison sentences. Mr. Legg appealed the district court's decision to revoke his probation in both cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court of appeals upheld the district court's findings on one of the probation violations but found that the district court had insufficient evidence in the record to support the other two findings of probation violations. The court of appeals then remanded the cases to the district court to determine if there was sufficient evidence to support the other two probation violations and to \"reassess whether, under all of the circumstances, [Mr.] Legg's probation should be revoked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 On remand, the state dropped the two probation violations that the court of appeals said were not yet supported by sufficient evidence. The district court determined that the single probation violation upheld by the court of appeals was sufficient to warrant revoking Mr. Legg's probation. The district court therefore upheld the probation revocations in both of Mr. Legg's cases. Mr. Legg then filed an appeal in one case\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that the district court erred by not making evidentiary determinations on the two probation revocations, as mandated by the court of appeals. During the pendency of the second appeal, Mr. Legg completed his sentence and was released from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The court of appeals determined that Mr. Legg's appeal was moot and dismissed his case.\n   <em>\n    Legg II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177595\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/360/12177595/\">\n    2016 UT App 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177595,12340414\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/360/\">\n    380 P.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This conclusion doesn't foreclose the potential for loss of a 402 reduction to serve as an actual legal consequence that is\n   sufficient to render a case not moot.

But this isn't an actual adverse harm that Mr. Legg will suffer. It's merely speculative and a potential future possibility. Mr. Legg hasn't argued that he's again violated the law and will have his probation revocation used against him. And even if he had again violated the law, the potential use of his probation revocation against him in that case would still not be enough to overcome mootness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, as the court of appeals noted, the district court isn't required to follow the sentencing recommendations in the PSR.\n   <em>\n    Legg II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177595\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/360/12177595/\">\n    2016 UT App 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177595,12340414\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/360/\">\n    380 P.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Legg's probation revocation is simply a factor used in a decision that is made with the vast discretion of the district court. Thus, the potential future use of Mr. Legg's probation revocation in a future sentencing decision isn't a consequence imposed by law. Instead, it's hypothetical and speculative, which is insufficient to establish an actual adverse consequence to survive mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b635 Second, Mr. Legg asserts that prosecutors will be unwilling to provide Mr. Legg favorable offers or probation offers in future criminal cases. This too is dependent on Mr. Legg again violating state law. Even if Mr. Legg does violate the law, a prosecutor's\n   decision not to offer Mr. Legg a favorable offer isn't imposed by law. \"[T]raditional prosecutor discretion.... allows prosecutors to plea-bargain with offenders in some cases, saving the public the expense of criminal prosecutions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, Mr. Legg hasn't presented us with any argument that he either (1) had an agreement with the prosecutors that they would recommend a 402 reduction if Mr. Legg successfully completed probation or (2) would have been a good candidate for a 402 reduction. Although we note that a judge still retains discretion as to whether or not to grant a 402 reduction,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p14\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-3-402(2)(a), we may consider whether a particular defendant's loss of a possible 402 reduction is sufficient to overcome mootness, specifically in circumstances where a 402 reduction isn't merely hypothetical or possible but significantly likely to occur.

Moreover, unlike the use of previous commitment in future civil commitment hearings, a defendant is able to completely avoid the use of a probation revocation in a future sentencing decision by not committing a future violation of the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Additionally, since\n    <em>\n     In re Giles\n    </em>\n    was decided in 1982, there has been evolution in the federal case law about presuming collateral consequences in parole revocations that we find persuasive.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Spencer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p14\">\n     523 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p14\">\n     118 S.Ct. 978\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The court reasoned that a prior parole revocation doesn't render a defendant ineligible for parole and is simply a factor considered by the parole board, which has \"almost unlimited discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p14\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Although not dispositive to our holding, we note that Mr. Legg's arguments regarding potential use of his probation revocation in future sentencing decisions or favorable prosecutorial offers are even weaker given the procedural posture of this case. On this appeal, Mr. Legg is challenging the decision to revoke his probation in one of his cases. However, in Mr. Legg's first appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the district court's finding that Mr. Legg had committed one probation violation in both cases.\n    <em>\n     State v. Legg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960673\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/324/656/\">\n     2014 UT App 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 21,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960673\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/324/656/\">\n     324 P.3d 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That probation violation finding will remain in Mr. Legg's record in both cases regardless of the outcome of this appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Additionally, Mr. Legg's probation was revoked in both his \"aggravated assault with a deadly weapon\" case and in his \"possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person\" case. However, Mr. Legg has only appealed the probation revocation in his aggravated assault case. Therefore, if we were to decide the merits of this case in Mr. Legg's favor, and it was ultimately determined that Mr. Legg's probation revocation shouldn't stand in the aggravated assault case, the probation revocation would still stand in the possession of a dangerous weapon case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Of course, this isn't to say that the existence of one probation revocation could never cause actual collateral legal consequences merely because another probation revocation already exists on the defendant's record. But, in a situation such as this, where it's a probation revocation on the exact same probation violation, which occurred in two cases that were sentenced concurrently, we see even less potential for the challenged probation revocation to impact discretionary decisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Mr. Legg's recidivism would certainly not be imposed by law.
