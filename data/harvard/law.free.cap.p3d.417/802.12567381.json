He argues he should be granted a new trial because the court admitted into evidence his confession to law enforcement officials without first determining whether the confession was voluntary. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The State charged Snee with nine felonies and two misdemeanors. A jury returned not-guilty verdicts on two counts and guilty verdicts on four counts, but could not reach a decision on the five remaining counts. Snee was subsequently sentenced to prison. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) section 12-120.21(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Before trial, Snee filed a motion to suppress his confession, but later withdrew it. Nevertheless, on appeal he argues that \" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3988(A) required the court to sua sponte conduct a voluntariness hearing\" because the evidence indicated that the confession was induced by an impermissible promise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 We review de novo issues of statutory interpretation and constitutional law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Section 13-3988(A) states that \"[b]efore [a] confession is received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the presence of the jury, determine any issue as to voluntariness.\" An \"issue,\" however, is defined as \"a point, matter, or question to be disputed or decided.\" Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 975 (2d ed. 1983);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   American Heritage Dictionary 931 (5th ed. 2011) (defining an \"issue\" as \"[a] point or matter of discussion, debate, or dispute\"). Therefore, the statute only requires courts to determine whether a confession was involuntary when voluntariness is disputed by the defense, and not, as Snee contends, in every case in which the State seeks to introduce a confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Our interpretation is consistent with Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 16.1, which governs pretrial motions and requires parties \"to make all motions no later than 20 days before trial ....\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We simply conclude that courts are not statutorily required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Snee also argues the evidence here presented a question of voluntariness that, under\n   <em>\n    State v.
