The Association hired a law firm to collect on the delinquent fees. The firm sent demand letters to Ms. Gonzalez, who upon receipt of the letters, claimed that the letters misrepresented the amount she actually owed. When negotiations between the Association and Ms. Gonzalez fell through, the Association again contacted the law firm for collection services, and the firm subsequently filed a lawsuit against Ms. Gonzalez on behalf of the Association. After several years of proceedings, Ms. Gonzalez brought a counterclaim against the law firm, asserting, in addition to other claims, that the law firm had violated \u00a7 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by misrepresenting the character, amount, and legal status of the debt she owed in the law firm's demand letters and in its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 The law firm brought a motion for summary judgment on the counterclaims and the trial court granted the motion in part, dismissing Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e counterclaims. In support of its dismissal, the court relied on a Utah Court of Appeals decision,\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding LLC v. Sotolongo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which held that the FDCPA was not a strict liability statute and that a debt collector may rely on its client's representations of the amount of the debt owed without incurring FDCPA liability. The district court held, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   , that the law firm relied on the Association's representation and so was not liable under \u00a7 1692e of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Ms. Gonzalez appeals the district court's dismissal of her \u00a7 1692e claims and also contends that we should abrogate the holding in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   . She argues that the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court applied the wrong standard for evaluating \u00a7 1692e claims. She further argues that her \u00a7 1692e claims should be evaluated under a strict liability standard (a standard in which a debtor is not required to show that a debt collector intended or had knowledge that it was misrepresenting the character or amount of the debt) and that the district court was therefore wrong in dismissing her claims merely because the law firm produced evidence showing that it had relied on the representations it had received from the Association. Ms. Gonzalez asks this court to overturn\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   and to reverse the district court's partial grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 We hold that the court of appeals erred in the standard it applied to \u00a7 1692e claims and accordingly abrogate\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   . Not only does\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   misstate the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' standard for \u00a7 1692e claims, but the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   clearly contradicts the language of the FDCPA. Additionally, a strict liability interpretation of \u00a7 1692e is consistent with \u00a7 1692k(c) of the FDCPA. That section creates an affirmative defense to strict liability for \"bona fide errors\"-those errors that are unintentional and not preventable by procedures the debt collector should have in place to check the accuracy of representations made to it by clients. Reading a scienter requirement into \u00a7 1692e, as\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   suggests, would render \u00a7 1692k(c) superfluous-an action we should avoid. We accordingly follow the overwhelming majority of courts and hold \u00a7 1692e claims to a strict liability standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Even under a strict liability standard, however, a plaintiff is still required to make a threshold showing that a misrepresentation occurred under the FDCPA. And, because the law firm was the moving party on summary judgment in this case, it bore the initial burden of showing that it did not engage in an act prohibited by the FDCPA-or, in other words, that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to its claims that it made no false representation of the character, amount, or legal status of Ms. Gonzalez's debt. Yet the district court failed to determine whether the law firm had met its initial burden. We therefore remand the case to the district court to make such determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 Tamara Gonzalez purchased a condominium unit in 2006 located within Pemberley at Robinson's Grove in Pleasant Grove, Utah. She purchased her unit subject to a validly recorded Declaration of Condominium,\n   a document containing certain covenants, conditions, and restrictions on the property, one of which required the payment of monthly assessments to cover maintenance and services provided by the Condominium Unit Owners Association. The Declaration also provided that a unit owner would be liable to the Association for late payment fees, interest, and cost incurred in collecting on delinquencies of such assessments, including reasonable attorney fees. Sometime in 2009, Ms. Gonzalez allegedly fell behind on her assessment payments. In November 2009, the Association hired the Law Office of Kirk A. Cullimore (the Cullimore firm) to collect on Ms. Gonzalez's delinquent assessments. At the time the Cullimore firm was hired, Sam Bell, an attorney for the Cullimore firm, reviewed the Association's ledger to see if Ms. Gonzalez was in arrears. Shortly thereafter, the Cullimore firm sent Ms. Gonzalez demand letters, notifying her that her account with the Association was in arrears and demanding payment. The Cullimore firm also recorded a lien on her unit, pursuant to the Declaration. After receiving these letters, Ms. Gonzalez contacted the Cullimore firm and the Association by phone and disputed the amount of the debt represented by the Cullimore firm. Thereafter, Ms. Gonzalez and the Association entered an oral payment agreement, but the agreement soon fell apart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 In January 2010, the Association again hired the Cullimore firm to commence collection proceedings on Ms. Gonzalez's delinquent fees. Mr. Bell, who was still working for the Cullimore firm, again checked the Association's ledger to confirm that Ms. Gonzalez's account with the Association was delinquent. The Cullimore firm then filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Association on March 12, 2010. Ms. Gonzalez failed to file an answer within the prescribed time and a default judgment order was entered against her on March 14, 2011. Mr. Bell thereafter left the Cullimore firm and started SEB Legal, LLC. The Association transferred its business, including Ms. Gonzalez's collection lawsuit, to SEB Legal, who represented the Association through the rest of its litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 After two years of negotiations and proceedings, the parties eventually stipulated to setting aside the original default judgment against Ms. Gonzalez. The district court set aside the judgment and granted Ms. Gonzalez leave to answer and make counterclaims. Ms. Gonzalez filed her answer and counterclaim on December 15, 2013, asserting claims under the FDCPA against the Law Office of Kirk A. Cullimore and Kirk A. Cullimore, Jr. (collectively, Cullimore) and SEB Legal, LLC, Sam Bell, and Jayln Peterson (collectively, SEB). Ms. Gonzalez's counterclaim included, among others, claims under \u00a7 1692e of the FDCPA for false representation of the character, amount, and legal status of the debt she owed. Specifically, Ms. Gonzalez argued that SEB and Cullimore had falsely represented the amount she owed the Association in the demand letters she received and in the lawsuit commenced against her. She also asserted that both law firms continued to falsely represent the amount and character of the debt she owed throughout the course of litigation. Ms. Gonzalez attached to her counterclaim a detailed accounting of the assessment payments she owed and those she paid during the years of 2009 to 2013. She also attached a verification statement, in which she swore, under penalty of perjury, that the factual allegations within her counterclaim were true and that she did not owe the amount claimed by the Association, SEB, or Cullimore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 Both SEB and Cullimore filed motions for summary judgment seeking to dismiss Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1962e counterclaims. In support of these motions, the law firms provided the court with the Association's ledger on Ms. Gonzalez's account, a copy of the Declaration, Ms. Gonzalez's warranty deed, and an affidavit signed by Mr. Bell stating that he had verified Ms. Gonzalez's arrearage on the Association's ledger when Cullimore initially received her file from the Association in November 2009, and again in January 2010, before Cullimore filed suit against Ms. Gonzalez with the district court. Ms. Gonzalez filed memoranda in opposition to these summary judgment motions and provided the court, through reference to her counterclaim, with a detailed spreadsheet illustrating the payments she allegedly had made to the Association\n   from 2009 to 2013, her calculated delinquency for each month, as well as a sworn statement from Ms. Gonzalez affirming that the facts alleged in the counterclaim were true and that she did not owe the purported amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 The trial court granted both motions in part and dismissed Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e claims, leaving her other claims intact. Before the court ruled on Cullimore's motion, but after it had dismissed Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e claims against SEB, Ms. Gonzalez moved the court to reconsider its order on SEB's motion, but the court issued an order refusing to do so. In all three orders from the district court-the order on SEB's summary judgment motion, the order on Cullimore's summary judgment motion, and the order denying reconsideration of its ruling on SEB's summary judgment motion-the court held Ms. Gonzalez was precluded from bringing her \u00a7 1692e claims against Cullimore and SEB by\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding LLC v. Sotolongo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Utah Court of Appeals decision, because SEB and Cullimore had reasonably relied on the Association's representation of the character and amount of debt Ms. Gonzalez allegedly owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 After the district court denied Ms. Gonzalez's motion to reconsider, Ms. Gonzalez entered into a settlement agreement with SEB and the Association. She therefore did not seek reversal of the district court's order on SEB's motion or the order denying reconsideration of the court's ruling on SEB's motion. Instead, Ms. Gonzalez timely appealed the court's order granting in part Cullimore's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Ms. Gonzalez argues that Cullimore falsely represented the amount of debt Ms. Gonzalez owed to the Association in its demand letters and in the complaint Cullimore filed. Ms. Gonzalez also argues that Cullimore improperly sought assessment fees altogether because the Association allegedly failed to follow all legal requirements in assessing the fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 We have jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 Ms. Gonzalez raises two intertwined issues on appeal: first, whether the court of appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   applied the wrong standard in evaluating \u00a7 1692e claims, and second, whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e claims. This court is not, of course, bound by prior decisions of the court of appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, we \"review a district court's legal conclusions and ultimate grant or denial of summary judgment for correctness, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the\n   nonmoving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Summary judgment is appropriate when 'there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 The purpose of the FDCPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   is to \"eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The heart of the FDCPA-\u00a7 1692e-prohibits debt collectors from using \"any false, deceptive, or misleading representations or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, \u00a7 1692e provides that a debt collector is liable when it makes \"false representation of (A) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt; or (B) any services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 In her counterclaim, Ms. Gonzalez asserted that Cullimore violated \u00a7 1692e by making a \"false representation of the character, amount, and legal status\" of her debt in its demand letters and in Cullimore's complaint. Cullimore argued, and the district court agreed, that it was not liable under \u00a7 1692e because it had relied on representations from the Association as to the character, legal status, and amount owed and simply relayed this information to Ms. Gonzalez. In its ruling and order on Cullimore's summary judgment motion, the district court implicitly concluded, by relying on\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding LLC v. Sotolongo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   that \u00a7 1692e was not a strict liability statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the district court reasoned that because Cullimore \"rel[ied] on its client's representation as to the amount of the debt,\" and Ms. Gonzalez could not show that Cullimore had knowledge that the Association's representations to it were false, it was not subject to liability under the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 Cullimore argues on appeal that the district court's interpretation of \u00a7 1692e is correct and precludes liability in this case. Conversely, Ms. Gonzalez argues that her \u00a7 1692e claims were improperly dismissed by the district court because the court relied on the incorrect analysis in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   . Ms. Gonzalez asserts that \u00a7 1692e establishes a strict liability standard that does not require a showing of intent, knowledge, or negligence, and that mere reliance on a client's representation does not automatically preclude liability under \u00a7 1692e. We agree with Ms. Gonzalez and, because the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   is incorrect, we abrogate it. We further remand this case\n   to the district court to consider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Cullimore made a false representation of the amount, character, or status of the debt Ms. Gonzalez allegedly owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I. The Court of Appeals' Holding in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   is Incorrect Because \u00a7 1692e is a Strict Liability Provision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 Cullimore argues that the district court correctly dismissed Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e counterclaims because, as the court of appeals concluded in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding LLC v. Sotolongo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the FDCPA is not a strict liability statute. According to Cullimore, \"to maintain a claim for misstating the amount of debt\" under \u00a7 1692e of the FDCPA, \"a debtor must show that the debt collector\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   misrepresented the amount of the debt.\" Cullimore argues that the district court correctly held that \"a debt collector may rely on its client's representations as to the amount of debt\" without violating the statute and has no duty to \"independently investigate the amount owed.\" In other words, Cullimore contends, and the district court agreed, that under\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   a consumer cannot make a successful \u00a7 1692e claim when the debt collector merely relays the creditor's representation of the amount owed to the consumer, even when the consumer adamantly denies the amount owed. This conclusion is wrong and stems from the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court's (1) incorrect application of caselaw and (2) incorrect reading of the FDCPA. We therefore overturn\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   on these two bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    A. The\n   </em>\n   Midland Funding\n   <em>\n    Court Incorrectly Relied on\n   </em>\n   Clark,\n   <em>\n    Which Held the Opposite of\n   </em>\n   Midland Funding,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Bleich,\n   <em>\n    Which Confused the Correct Standard Under \u00a7 1692e\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 We first abrogate\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   because the court of appeals incorrectly based its holding on\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Capital Credit &amp; Collection Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   which actually stands for a proposition directly opposite to the one adopted by the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court. In\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   , the Utah Court of Appeals assessed a consumer's \u00a7 1692e claim that a debt collector misrepresented the amount of debt the consumer owed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court cited\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   for the assertion that, under \u00a7 1692e, \"[a] debt collector may rely on its client's representations as to the amount of the debt\" without violating the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court also concluded that \"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ... clearly holds that debt verification involves 'nothing more' than confirming in writing the amount owed with the creditor and that the FDCPA imposes no duty on a debt collector to independently investigate the claimed debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court therefore concluded that any \u00a7 1692e claim asserting that the debt collector unreasonably relied on the creditor's representation, even absent further proof of intent or knowledge of the misrepresentation on the part of the debt collector, \"is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 The\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court misconstrued\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   . While each of the assertions the Utah Court of Appeals cited above came from the\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Ninth Circuit made such statements solely in reference to claims brought under \u00a7 1692g of the FDCPA, as opposed to \u00a7 1692e-the provision in dispute in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is an important distinction. Section 1692g of the FDCPA deals with the \"[v]alidation of debts,\" requiring a debt collector to follow specific notice provisions when initially communicating the debt to the consumer, and, upon written request of the consumer, to \"obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment\" from the creditor and mail such verification or judgment to the consumer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1692e, on the other hand, deals with \"any false, deceptive, or misleading representation[s] ... in connection with the collection\n   of any debt\"-not notice procedures and debt verification requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 In\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit responded to one of the plaintiffs' arguments that defendants had \"failed to verify properly the alleged debt, violating \u00a7 1692g.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, plaintiffs asked the Ninth Circuit to hold that a debt collector's duty to verify the debt under \u00a7 1692g also requires a debt collector to carefully review the creditor's representation of the balance, track the transactions that have occurred between the creditor and debtor in the past, and verify that the balance is still unpaid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit refused to establish such a \"high threshold\" under \u00a7 1692g, and instead chose to adopt a more \"reasonable standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   court held that, \"[a]t the minimum, '\n   <em>\n    verification of a debt\n   </em>\n   involves nothing more than the debt collector confirming in writing that the amount being demanded is what the creditor is claiming is owed.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the debt collectors in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , upon written request for verification by the plaintiffs, \"obtained information from [the creditor] about the nature and balance of the outstanding bill and provided the [plaintiffs] with documentary evidence in the form of an itemized statement,\" the\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   court held the debt collectors \"were entitled to rely on their client's statements to verify the debt ... and they did not violate \u00a7\u00a7 1692g(a)(4) or 1692g(b).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   But none of the assertions the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court credited to\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   dealt with \u00a7 1692e. Rather, the \"reasonable standard\" the\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   court established-and the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court adopted-was intended to apply only to debt verification under \u00a7 1692g.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 The very next section in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   further supports this notion. Immediately after setting forth a debt collector's duty under \u00a7 1692g, the Ninth Circuit evaluated a \u00a7 1692e claim, noting that \"[w]hether a violation of \u00a7 1692e may be predicated upon conduct that is neither knowing nor intentional appears to be an issue of first impression in the Ninth Circuit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   court then went on to expressly agree with the Seventh and Second Circuits that \"\u00a7 1692e applies even when a false representation was unintentional.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   court noted that a few courts had \"[e]xamined [\u00a7 1692e] in isolation\" and concluded that \"[t]o successfully state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1692e(2), [the plaintiff] must show that [the debt collector] knowingly or intentionally misrepresented the amount of the debt in its collection letters,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   it decided to follow the majority of jurisdictions and held that the FDCPA's \"broad language seems to make FDCPA a strict liability statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   expressly required knowledge or intent to bring a \u00a7 1692e claim. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court fundamentally misconstrued\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 Also, the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court relied on a second source that, unlike\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , did incorrectly apply \u00a7 1692g 's standard to \u00a7 1692e claims. In\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that an \"allegation that the debt is invalid, standing alone, cannot form the basis of a lawsuit alleging fraudulent or deceptive practices in connection with the collection of a debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cullimore relies heavily on this rule to argue that Ms. Gonzalez presented the district court with no genuine issue of material fact on her \u00a7 1692e claims. The\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court took this rule verbatim from\n   <em>\n    Bleich v.

Rather, the court continued on to analyze the plaintiffs' claim that the debt collectors knew that the debt alleged by the creditor was invalid and misstated in violation of \u00a7 1692e(2)(A).

The District Court Erred in Dismissing Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e Claims on Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 31 With the correct standard for \u00a7 1692e claims in mind, we must next determine whether the district court erred in granting in part Cullimore's motion for summary judgment, thereby dismissing Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e claims. We hold that it did. The district court failed to determine whether Cullimore made false representations under \u00a7 1692e of the FDCPA and instead relied entirely on\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   to dismiss Ms. Gonzalez's counterclaims. Under the correct standard, the district court should have first determined whether there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Cullimore misrepresented the amount, character, and legal status of the debt allegedly owed by Ms. Gonzalez. So we reverse the district court's grant of partial summary judgment and remand this case to the district court to make this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 32 The district court erred in dismissing Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e counterclaims because it relied on the erroneous holding in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   . We note that the district court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   was\n   certainly understandable, however, because, as it stated in its order denying reconsideration of its order on SEB's motion for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   was an appellate court case that, at the time of the district court's determination, was \"binding\" on the court and had not been \"reversed or disavowed.\" [AIS Dist Dckt 127] Operating under the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   standard, the district court focused solely on whether Cullimore reasonably relied on the Association's records for the amount and character of the debt owed. Determining that Cullimore had, the district court granted Cullimore's motion and dismissed Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e claims. The district court's analysis, however, was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 33 The proper analysis of a \u00a7 1692e claim requires the district court to first make a determination as to whether a false representation was made under \u00a7 1692e. In order to prevail on a FDCPA claim, a plaintiff must prove that \"(1) the plaintiff has been the object of collection activity arising from consumer debt, (2) the defendant is a debt collector as defined by the FDCPA, and (3) the defendant has engaged in an act or omission prohibited by the FDCPA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that the first two criteria are satisfied in this case. This case therefore turns on whether Cullimore met its initial burden on summary judgment to show that it did not engage in an act prohibited by the FDCPA-or, in other words, that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to its claims that it made no \"false representation of ... the character, amount, or legal status\" of Ms. Gonzalez's debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 34 A debt collector may plead, however, the affirmative bona fide error defense, pursuant to \u00a7 1692k(c) of the FDCPA, in order to preclude liability under the statute. \"[A]n FDCPA defendant seeking the protection of the bona fide error defense carries the burden of proving that the violation was 1) unintentional, 2) a bona fide error, and 3) made despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   And a debt collector must prove these three elements \"by a preponderance of [the] evidence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is important to note that a defendant seeking summary judgment based on the bona fide error defense under \u00a7 1692k(c) also bears the initial burden of demonstrating that no disputed issue of fact exists regarding the affirmative defense asserted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a debt collector meets this burden on all three elements, the district court should dismiss a plaintiff's \u00a7 1692e claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 35 It is well established that summary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, although the parties provided the court with affidavits and documents, the district court erred in failing to determine whether there was any genuine issue as to whether the amount of debt Cullimore represented to Ms. Gonzalez was a misrepresentation of the amount she actually owed the Association, or, whether the fees\n   represented to her were legally assessed. As noted above, Cullimore represented several arrearage amounts to Ms. Gonzalez in its demand letters, complaint, and continually throughout litigation. Ms. Gonzalez denied these amounts in phone conversations with Cullimore after she received the demand letter, in her answer and counterclaim, and continually throughout litigation. In its ruling and order on Cullimore's summary judgment motion, however, the district court did not determine whether there was a genuine dispute as to whether a misrepresentation, and therefore a violation of \u00a7 1692e, had occurred. Instead, the district court focused on whether a genuine issue of fact existed as to Cullimore's reliance on the Association's representations-as required by the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 36 The district court's order on Cullimore's summary judgment motion on the \u00a7 1692e claims in its entirety reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   First, Plaintiff claims Defendants lied about the amount of money she owed in both the demand letters they sent her and in the complaint.

Rule 8(c) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure requires a party to \"set forth affirmatively ... any ... matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\" If a party fails to raise an affirmative defense pursuant to rule 8(c), generally it is considered waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cullimore failed to raise the bona fide error defense in its answer to Ms. Gonzalez's counterclaim and so likely waived this defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38 But rule 15 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedures provides that a party may amend its pleading-including a responsive pleading-by leave of the court, and that \"[t]he court should freely give permission when justice requires.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, \"[w]e have consistently encouraged liberal treatment of motions to amend a pleading as long as justice is furthered, and not hindered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of our liberal treatment of motions to amend and the fact that the parties were working under the then-operative\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   standard at the time Cullimore filed its answer, Cullimore may seek to amend its answer to include the bona fide error defense of \u00a7 1692k(c). In determining whether Cullimore should be allowed to amend, the district court should consider whether justice so requires, weighing \"(1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the justification for delay; and (3) any resulting prejudice to the responding party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39 Accordingly, we reverse the district court's grant of partial summary judgment and remand this case to the district court to make the appropriate determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 40 The district court granted in part Cullimore's motion for summary judgment and dismissed Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e claims based solely on the Utah Court of Appeals' holding in\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   . Because the\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   court misconstrued\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , misstated the correct standard, one observed by an overwhelming majority of courts, and set forth a holding that contradicts the plain language of the FDCPA, we overturn its opinion. We therefore reverse and remand this case to the district court to determine whether Cullimore satisfied its initial burden on summary judgment of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to its claims that it did not misrepresent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt Ms. Gonzalez owed the Association.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1692p (2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6963307\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/325/871/\">\n     2014 UT App 95\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6963307\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/325/871/\">\n     325 P.3d 871\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Although we refer to the FDCPA, including \u00a7 1692e, as a strict liability statute, we acknowledge that this characterization does not entirely comport with the way in which the term \"strict liability\" is traditionally used.

However, the allegation that the debt is invalid, standing alone, cannot form the basis of a lawsuit alleging fraudulent or deceptive practices in connection with the collection of a debt. A debt collector may rely on its client's representation as to the amount of debt. And the FDCPA does not impose on debt collectors a duty to independently investigate the amount owed but only to confirm the amount claimed with their client.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The SEB defendants have provided affidavit evidence that they confirmed the amount of the debt with their client.

But here Cullimore has provided no facts or evidence of procedures that it employed or implemented to avoid misrepresentations. In fact, Cullimore has never argued that it had procedures in place to avoid errors or that the procedures it did have were reasonably adapted to avoid the specific error in this case. Cullimore merely submitted an affidavit stating that one of its attorneys, Mr. Bell, checked the Association's ledger before filing the lawsuit against Ms. Gonzalez. It has made no assertion, nor provided any evidence, that verifying the debt owed on the ledger is a policy of the company or that a policy to check a client's ledger before filing a suit or sending letters was reasonably adapted to avoid the false representation of the amount, character, or status of the debt owed to a consumer. Because Cullimore bears the burden of proving its affirmative defense on summary judgment, and Cullimore failed to carry this burden, we cannot affirm the district court's dismissal of Ms. Gonzalez's \u00a7 1692e counterclaims under the bona fide error defense. Rather, we reverse the district court's order and remand for further determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"68\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Utah R. Civ.
