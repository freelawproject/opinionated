Shump II pled no contest to certain crimes in two separate criminal cases in exchange for the State's promise to recommend a controlling suspended sentence of 12 months in jail and 12 months' supervised probation. At sentencing, the district court declined to impose the agreed-upon sentence and instead imposed a controlling suspended sentence of 24 months with 12 months' supervised probation. Shump appeals, asserting that the State violated the terms of the plea agreement. We affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shump and Camille Eichorn had previously been in a relationship. In January 2016, after Eichorn ended the relationship, Shump sent Eichorn numerous harassing phone messages that contained rude allegations and called her vulgar names. As a result, the State charged Shump with harassment by telecommunication device, violation of a protective order, and intimidation of a witness in case No. 16CR175 (the harassment case). Several months later, on July 7, 2016, Shump damaged Austin Bahr's car windshield and then ran from the police. As a result, Shump was charged with criminal damage to property and interference with law enforcement in case No. 16CR708 (the criminal damage/interference case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 20, 2016, Shump and the State entered into a plea agreement to resolve both criminal cases. Under the agreement, Shump would plead no contest to harassment by a telecommunication device in the harassment case. In return, the other two charges were dismissed. The State would recommend a 6-month suspended sentence with 12 months' probation. In the criminal damage/interference case, Shump agreed to plead no contest to both charges. In return, the State agreed to recommend a 6-month suspended sentence on each count to run concurrently with each other and 12 months' probation. The sentences imposed in each case were to run consecutive to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the same day the plea agreement was made, October 20, 2016, a plea and sentencing hearing was jointly held in both cases. At the hearing, the State accurately stated the terms of the plea agreement with Shump. Shump acknowledged that the State's description of the plea agreement was correct. After Shump pled no contest to the agreed-upon charges in both cases, the district court proceeded immediately to sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At sentencing, the district court first asked the State if it had any comments. The State informed the district court that Eichorn was comfortable with the plea agreement but that Bahr wanted to address the court regarding the criminal damage/interference case. Bahr then personally addressed the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the outset, Bahr stated that Shump had many traits of \"sociopathic and/or narcissistic personality disorder,\" noting that he was a \"compulsive liar\" and delusional. Bahr also stated he was disappointed Shump was not charged with assault as his intent was to break Bahr's windshield and cause him bodily harm. Bahr stated that allowing Shump to avoid jail time would not benefit anyone and blaming Shump's actions on passion or psychiatric issues allows \"him to avoid repercussions which he deserved.\" Pointing to Shump's repeated violation of court orders, Bahr said Shump \"feels he is beyond the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At this point, Shump's attorney objected on the grounds that Bahr was not competent to accuse Shump of having personality disorders and his allegations were not relevant to this case. The district court overruled the objection, reasoning that it was an appropriate time for Bahr to express his feelings about being a crime victim. Bahr concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"I hope [Shump] gets the psychiatric help he needs; but in my opinion, this is not enough. He needs real repercussions and time to repent for his behavior in prison. I feel in not doing so, he will only emotionally abuse the next woman in his life and continue to threaten their friends and family because he will see he has gotten away with this. That is my statement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both Shump and his attorney then addressed the court. In particular, Shump asked the district court to follow the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court departed from the plea agreement and sentenced Shump to a 12-month suspended jail sentence in the harassment case and a 12-month suspended sentence in the criminal damage/interference case with the sentences to run consecutively for a controlling 24-month term. Shump was placed on a 12-month probation in both cases. The district court also ordered Shump to pay restitution to Bahr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shump appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   THE STATE DID NOT VIOLATE THE PLEA AGREEMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Shump contends his right to due process was violated because the State breached the plea agreement. Shump argues the State violated the plea agreement in two ways: (1) by failing to recommend the sentence agreed to by the parties and (2) by undermining the agreed-upon sentence by allowing Bahr to speak forcefully regarding the crime's impact upon him. Shump asks our court to vacate the sentences and remand for resentencing before a different judge. The State counters that it did not violate the plea agreement because it was not required to restate the terms of the plea agreement at sentencing and Bahr was entitled to give a victim's impact statement at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our standard of review provides that a claim that the State breached a plea agreement presents a question of law over which this court exercises unlimited review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, the plea and sentencing hearing was one continuous proceeding. During the plea portion, the State properly advised the district court of the terms of the plea agreement. Shump complains, however, that during the sentencing portion of the hearing the State did not repeat its agreed-upon sentencing recommendations. As a consequence of this omission, Shump claims the State violated the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , the terms of the plea agreement were announced at a plea hearing which occurred on October 24, 1988. At sentencing before the same judge almost two months later, the State did not specifically state that it was recommending the agreed-upon sentence, but instead referred the district court to the sentencing agreement in the presentence investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our Supreme Court found the State was not required to restate the agreement's terms at sentencing because \"[t]he same judge presided at all hearings and, without question, was aware that the State had agreed to recommend a controlling term of two consecutive life sentences. Furthermore, the State made no recommendation contrary to the agreement made known to the judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436883\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/247/377/\">\n    247 Kan. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   383-84 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Chesbro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670997\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/35/662/#p675\">\n    35 Kan.

As in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor agreed to recommend a certain sentence and did in fact recommend that agreed-upon sentence to the district court. In both cases, the district court was fully aware of the details of the plea agreement because the plea and sentencing hearing was presided over by the same judge. Moreover, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   where there was almost two months between the plea hearing and the sentencing hearing, the combined hearing here was conducted at the same time on the same day. As a result, the district court was fully aware of the State's recommendations.

Under the Kansas Constitution, \"[v]ictims of crime, as defined by law, shall be entitled ... to be heard at sentencing or at any other time deemed appropriate by the court, to the extent that these rights do not interfere with the constitutional or statutory rights of the accused.\" Kan. Const. art. 15, \u00a7 15 (a).

In\n   <em>\n    Urista\n   </em>\n   , although the State asked the court to follow the sentence in the plea agreement, the prosecutor gave an \"extensive statement\" regarding the defendant's lengthy juvenile record, gang affiliation, and information from victim impact statements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417008\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/576/#p583\">\n    296 Kan. at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
