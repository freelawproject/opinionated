BOHNHOFF, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {1} The district court ruled that Appellant Michael H. (Father) had neglected his child (Child) by abandoning her. Father argues that his lack of knowledge that Child's mother, Gina S. (Mother), who had custody of the infant, would neglect her and also his lack of certain knowledge through DNA testing that he in fact was the father of Child negate any conclusion of abandonment under NMSA 1978, Section 32A-4-2(A)(2) (2009, as amended 2016 and 2017), and thus neglect under Section 32A-4-2(F)(1) (current version at Section 32A-4-2(G)(1) ). We reject Father's arguments, and therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {2} Child was born in March 2015. The New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) took Child into custody on April 11, 2016. CYFD then filed an abuse/neglect petition on April 13, 2016 naming Mother and Father as respondents, and Carlos G. (Husband) as an interested party. Based on information provided by Mother, CYFD alleged that Father is the biological father of Child and that Mother had not been in a relationship or had contact with Father since she was one month pregnant with Child. The petition alleged that Father abused Child as defined in Section 32A-4-2(B)(1) (one \"who has suffered or who is at risk of suffering serious harm because of the action or inaction of the child's parent, guardian or custodian\") and Section 32A-4-2(B)(4) (one \"whose parent, guardian or custodian has knowingly, intentionally or negligently placed the child in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health\"). The petition also alleged that Father neglected Child as defined in Section 32A-4-2(F)(1) (one \"who has been abandoned by the child's parent, guardian or custodian\") and Section 32A-4-2(F)(2) (one \"who is without proper parental care and control or subsistence, education, medical or other care or control necessary for the child's well-being because of the faults or habits of the child's parent, guardian or custodian or the failure or refusal of the parent, guardian or custodian, when able to do so, to provide them\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {3} The district court entered a stipulated order for DNA testing on May 18, 2016. On June 2, 2016, Mother entered a no contest plea to the allegation that she neglected Child under Section 32A-4-2(F)(2). The district court then conducted Father's adjudication hearing on July 7, 2016, during which the following witnesses testified: Mother; Amber Martinez, the CYFD permanency planning worker for Child; and Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mother's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {4} Mother testified that she had just ended a relationship with another man when she began a sexual relationship with Father. Mother testified that she did not live with Father and that she did not have any relationship with him other than a sexual one. When Mother discovered she was pregnant, she immediately identified Father as the father of Child. Mother told Father she was pregnant with Child, and said that \"[Father] believed me, like right away, he was all there for it, saying that, yeah, he was gonna take responsibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {5} When Mother was three months pregnant, she told Father's live-in girlfriend that she was pregnant with Father's child. When Father learned that Mother had told his girlfriend that she was pregnant with Father's baby, Father told Mother that if she retracted the statement and told his girlfriend that her baby was not Father's, then Father would \"take care of [her] and the\n   baby.\" Mother acceded to Father's request and told the girlfriend that someone else was the father, but Mother did not tell anyone else that he was not Child's father. Shortly thereafter, Mother reaffirmed to Father's girlfriend that Father was the father of Child. Mother also received messages from Father's girlfriend acknowledging that Mother was pregnant with Father's child. Mother testified that, after she reaffirmed to Father's girlfriend that Father was the father of her baby, Father \"dropped off the face of the earth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {6} Father did not provide any support to Mother during her pregnancy. Child was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico; Father was not present at the birth. After Child was born, Mother was told that in order to receive welfare benefits, she had to file a petition for child support from Father. Mother filed the child support petition, but \"dropped it\" after she married Husband, as she believed Husband \"was a better father than [Father].\" Mother testified that her only contact with Father since she was three months pregnant had been during a meeting with CYFD after Child was removed from her custody. Father never supported Mother or Child following Child's birth, and Father did not visit Mother to meet Child after Child's birth. The first time Father met Child was when Ms. Martinez brought Child to his home. Other than that one visit, for the first fifteen months of Child's life, Father had no contact with Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CYFD Permanency Planning Worker's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {7} Ms. Martinez testified that she emailed Father on April 28, 2016, regarding Child, and Father called her that day. During that phone call, Father said that he had had sex with Mother one time. Father also told Ms. Martinez that he had a vasectomy two years earlier and so could not be Child's father. The next day, Father called her and stated that after investigating and looking at a timeline, Father did not have a vasectomy two years ago and that Child looked just like his son who was born three months before Child. Ms. Martinez also testified that she had seen Facebook messages in which Mother reported to Father that Child was Father's baby. According to Ms. Martinez, Mother notified Father that Child was his and that after Mother married, Mother told Father that \"she didn't ... need anything from him because her husband was there to step up and be a father to [Child].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {8} Ms. Martinez testified that she and her supervisor brought Child to Father's home so Father could meet Child. During a family-centered meeting facilitated by CYFD, Father stated that the only reason \"he stepped up was because [Child] was in foster care and he didn't want [Child] in foster care.\" Ms. Martinez testified that Father had not established a relationship or a bond with Child since he had only met Child once before the hearing. Ms. Martinez was also concerned because Father had never provided any financial support to Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {9} Ms. Martinez testified that the week before Father's adjudication hearing, Father called her and left a voicemail indicating that he wanted to relinquish his parental rights to Child. Father explained his decision by stating that he did not want to do any parenting classes required by CYFD because he did not feel that he had done anything wrong with respect to Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Father's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Father's Testimony Regarding When He Had Notice of Mother's Pregnancy With Child\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {10} Father testified that he first found out about Child and that he was Child's father when Ms. Martinez emailed him in April 2016, although he did not remember the date. Father, however, also admitted he had notice that Mother was pregnant with his child much earlier than April 2016, when Mother was communicating with both him and his girlfriend on Facebook about Mother's pregnancy with Child, but that Mother told him Child was not his. Father continued, \"She kept ... trying to argue with us on Facebook, that\n   <em>\n    she just wanted me to take care of my responsibilities\n   </em>\n   , and I said that you told me that it wasn't my responsibility because it's not my kid.\" According to Father, because Mother was trying to argue with him on Facebook, he blocked her, and therefore did not find out about Child until CYFD took Child into its custody. Mother\n   never asked him for anything related to Child, which made him believe that Child was not his, because \"if it was my daughter, [Mother] would have pursued [me] as being the dad, not telling me and arguing with my [girlfriend] that it was someone else's, we don't need your money no way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {11} Father insisted he had \"no idea\" Mother was pregnant with his child until CYFD contacted him because he believed someone else could have been the father and because Mother became pregnant \"so soon.\" On cross-examination by Mother's attorney, when asked whether Mother did give him notice that she was pregnant with his child, Father answered, despite his previous denial, \"And when I asked her for a DNA test, she did never get back a hold of me, and she kept writing other letters-that I don't need your help, I don't need your money, I don't need this, I don't need that-and we just blocked her from all the pages, and this is the first time I'm hearing about it now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Father's Other Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {12} Father testified that he has eight children including Child, ranging in age from 25 years to Child's age, which was 16 months at the time of the hearing. Father did not have any previous record with CYFD. When Father's counsel asked him if he wanted to provide for his daughter financially, emotionally, and in every way possible, Father responded yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {13} Father admitted that he saw a photograph of his daughter for the first time after he found out where she was (implying foster care), looked on Facebook, found a photograph of Child and said, \"Wow, kinda looks like [my son].\" Father continued, \"[My girlfriend] is the one that said, hey, that's your baby, if it's yours, we're gonna have the DNA test, if it's your kid, we don't want her in foster care. Because [Ms. Martinez] told me the first couple-the family she stayed with, didn't want her for long term. That's what made me push for my kid. I never said, oh, the only reason I want her is because she's in foster care. I wanted her because she's my daughter and I'm a stay at home dad with her brother that's three months older than her.\" Father also testified that he will \"always provide for my kids whether their mothers need me or not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {14} Father testified that he felt he was being \"bullied\" and treated unfairly by CYFD because although he was not in Child's life, that was not his fault, and he could not do everything CYFD was asking him to do with the short notice that CYFD was providing him for some tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {15} At the conclusion of the July 7, 2016 hearing, the district court orally ruled that Father had abandoned Child. The district court also found that Father knew about Child at the beginning of Mother's pregnancy and, significantly, that Mother was more credible than Father. The district court was troubled by Father's expressed desire to relinquish his rights to Child the week before the adjudicatory hearing, stating that it did \"not sit well with the [c]ourt.\" Finally, the district court stated, \"fifteen months have gone by, and here we are. And you didn't step forward, [Father], until you were finally tested, and there you are.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {16} The district court entered Father's adjudicatory judgment on July 20, 2016, which stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   3. CYFD has proven by clear and convincing evidence that as to [Father], [Child] is a neglected child as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   a. [Child] has been abandoned by her [Father], pursuant to Section 32A-4-2(F)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. The [district court made] the following findings and conclusions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   a. [Father] had knowledge that [Mother] was pregnant and that [Mother] indicated he was the father of [C]hild;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   b. [Father] did not provide any financial or other support to [Mother] throughout her pregnancy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   c. [Mother] filed a paternity action for child support listing [Father] as the Respondent in 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   d. [Father] has not provided any financial support and did not have contact with [C]hild for a period of over three months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   e. [Father] left [Child] in the care of [Mother] where [Child] was neglected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   f. There was no justifiable cause for [Father] leaving [Child] in the care of others without provision for support and without communication for over three months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {17} The Children's Code, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 32A-1-1 to -25-5 (1993, as amended through 2017), contains the Abuse and Neglect Act (the Act), NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 32A-4-1 to -35 (1993, as amended through 2017). The purpose of the Children's Code is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   first to provide for the care, protection and wholesome mental and physical development of children[,] ... then to preserve the unity of the family whenever possible. A child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern.... It is the intent of the [L]egislature that, to the maximum extent possible, children in New Mexico shall be reared as members of a family unit[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Section 32A-1-3(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {18} The Act defines child abuse, child neglect, and provides the process for the adjudication of both.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 32A-4-2(A)(2)(a) defines \"abandonment\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   abandonment includes instances when the parent,\n   <em>\n    without justifiable cause\n   </em>\n   : ... (2) left the child with others,\n   <em>\n    including the other parent\n   </em>\n   or an agency,\n   <em>\n    without provision for support and without communication\n   </em>\n   for a period of: (a)\n   <em>\n    three months\n   </em>\n   if the child was under six years of age at the commencement of the three-month period[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Section 32A-4-2(F)(1) in turn defines a \"neglected child\" as a child \"who has been abandoned by the child's parent, guardian or custodian[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {19} Under the Act, a district court holds an adjudication hearing to determine whether a parent abused and/or neglected his or her child. Section 32A-4-20. According to Section 32A-4-20(H), \"If the court finds on the basis of ... clear and convincing evidence, competent, material and relevant in nature, that the child is neglected or abused, the court shall enter an order finding that the child is neglected or abused and may proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing to make disposition of the case.\" Section 32A-4-20(I) provides for immediate appeal to this Court of an adjudication determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The District Court's Findings Were Supported by Clear and Convincing Evidence and Those Findings Supported the District Court's Determination That Father Had Abandoned and Thus Neglected Child\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {20} Father states that he \"challenges Findings of Fact Nos. 4(e) and 4(f) for lack\n   of substantial evidence. As a matter of law, Father [also] challenges whether these findings, even if supported by substantial evidence, support the ultimate finding of neglect.\" As we understand Father's legal argument, he is contending that his lack of knowledge that Mother would neglect Child while Child was in Mother's care and also lack of certain knowledge based on DNA testing that he was the father of Child amount to justifiable cause that negates any conclusion of abandonment under Section 32A-4-2(A)(2) and thus neglect under Section 32A-4-2(F)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {21} \"To meet the standard of proof in an abuse or neglect proceeding, the fact finder must be presented with clear and convincing evidence that the child was abused or neglected.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Mother testified and Father admitted that Father did not support her during her pregnancy. Father further admitted that the first and only time he met his daughter was when she was fifteen months old, about a month before the adjudication hearing, during a visit that was also facilitated by CYFD. Thus, the district court's finding that Father left Child in Mother's care was supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {24} Further, as stated above, early in this proceeding Mother entered a no contest plea to CYFD's allegation that she had neglected Child. Father does not address the evidence regarding and otherwise does not challenge the underlying finding that Child was neglected while in the care of Mother. \"[W]e review substantial evidence claims only if the appellant apprises the Court of all evidence bearing on the issue[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Chavez v.

Therefore, Father's substantial evidence challenge to Finding 4(e) is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {25} Finding 4(f) states: \"There was no justifiable cause for [Father] leaving [Child] in the care of others without provision for support and communication for over three months. As stated, there also was clear and convincing evidence that, following Child's birth, Father did not support Child or communicate with Child for over three months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The evidence showed that Father did nothing to contact Mother, to provide support to Child, or even to meet Child or inquire as to her well-being. In short, Father did nothing to support or foster any kind of relationship with Child for the first fifteen months of her life, i.e., absent a showing of justifiable cause he abandoned Child as that term is defined in Section 32A-4-2(A)(2). Father testified at the hearing that he would \"always provide for my kids whether their mothers need me or not.\" His actions indicate otherwise. Father did nothing with respect to Child until Ms. Martinez contacted him. Although Mother never reached out to Father again following Child's birth to specifically ask him for support or to introduce Child to him, Father's obligations owed to Child were not contingent upon such action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {26} Substantial evidence therefore supports the basic factual determinations that underlie the district court's Findings 4(e) and 4(f). Father's main challenge in fact is legal: that as a matter of law he cannot be adjudicated to have neglected Child unless he knew that Mother herself had neglected Child and also that, on the basis of DNA testing, he was the father of Child. We address those arguments in the following sections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {27} However, because it is material to our analysis, we also note that substantial evidence established that Father was on notice that he was the father of Child. Father and Mother engaged in sexual intercourse. Mother testified that she told Father about her pregnancy by him as soon as she knew about it, and that Father told her he would take responsibility for Child. Mother also testified that Father later told her he would support her during her pregnancy if she would tell Father's girlfriend that Child was not his. Indeed, Father does not challenge the district court's Finding 4(a) that he knew Mother was pregnant and that Mother had identified him as the father of Child. Thus, Father was on notice for several months before Child's birth that he was the father of Child. Further, the fact that Father initially told Mother he would take responsibility for Child amounts to an admission of paternity. The district court specifically stated that it credited Mother's testimony that Father knew he had a child when she was three-months pregnant. As stated above, we do not reweigh this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Father's Knowledge That Child Would Be Neglected While in Mother's Care\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {28} Father's first challenge to Findings 4(e) and 4(f) focuses not so much on the fact of Mother's neglect of Child while in her care as on the implication that he bears responsibility for that neglect. That is, he argues that for him to be found to have abandoned and thus neglected Child while Child was in the custody of Mother, as a matter of law he \"would have to know that Child would be neglected in his absence.\" He contends that the district court's adjudication was flawed because it \"made no findings with regard to any knowledge by Father that Mother would neglect Child or that Child was otherwise in need of his protection.\" Using the rubric of Section 32A-4-2(A), we understand his position to be that the absence of such knowledge amounts to \"justifiable cause\" that negates a determination of abandonment. We are not persuaded. Father identifies no case law that supports such a construction of \"justifiable cause,\" and considerable authority supports the conclusion that, on the contrary, Section 32A-4-2(A)(2) imposes an affirmative obligation on a parent to act to ensure that the child is receiving necessary care and support. Mere ignorance is not justifiable cause for the failure to provide support for, and communicate with, the child that is the statutory predicate for a determination of abandonment and thus neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {29} Under the Children's Code, \"[a] child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern.\" Section 32A-1-3(A). Further, without justifiable cause, Section 32A-4-2(A)(2) mandates a finding of abandonment if the parent \"[leaves] the child with others, including the other parent or an agency,\n   <em>\n    without provision for support and without communication\n   </em>\n   \" for a specified period of time. (Emphasis added.) We understand this language ordinarily to require a parent, if he or she does not have custody of the child, to take necessary steps to communicate with the child and otherwise verify that the child is being cared for and supported while in the custody of the other person.

Further, the paramount concern of the Children's Code is protecting the health and safety of the child, not punishing conduct that the Legislature has deemed subject to criminal sanction.

There is no evidence that Father took any steps to check on and ensure Child's well-being while Child was in Mother's care. Under the facts of this case, Father's lack of knowledge of Mother's neglect is not justifiable cause for leaving Child with Mother without provision for support and without communication for a period of three months, i.e., it is no defense to a determination that Father neglected Child by abandoning her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Because there was no such clear and convincing evidence that he had such certain knowledge\n   that he was the father of Child, he urges, the district court's adjudication of neglect on the basis of abandonment was error. Whether a father must have confirmation by DNA test after he is on notice that he has fathered a child before he can be adjudicated to have neglected the child by abandonment is a matter of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {34} We conclude that the lack of certainty of paternity is not a defense to an adjudication of neglect by abandonment. That is, such uncertainty will not constitute \"justifiable cause\" for a man who is otherwise on notice that he may have fathered a child to fail to make provision for support of, and communicate with, the child. Under the facts of this case established by clear and convincing evidence, Father had more than sufficient notice that he was the father of Child to give rise to an affirmative obligation to either provide such support and undertake such communication or, alternatively, take steps to establish he was not the father. If he did neither, Father assumed the risk of an adjudication of neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

If Father in fact harbored any doubt about Child's paternity, he bore the burden of taking steps to resolve the question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Father neither established he was not the father nor provided the necessary care to Child, the district court properly found that he had neglected Child based on abandonment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cosme V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244184\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/809/\">\n    2009-NMCA-094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244184\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/809/\">\n    146 N.M. 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244184\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/809/\">\n    215 P.3d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under certain circumstances, parents cannot demand parental rights without pro-actively fulfilling their obligations as parents to care for their children.

The definition of \"abandonment\" is unchanged, and in both the 2009 and the 2016 versions, it is found at Section 32A-4-2(A). The definition of \"neglect\" is also unchanged, but has been renumbered from Section 32A-4-2(E)(1) in the 2009 version to Section 32A-4-2(F)(1) in the 2016 version. (In its 2017 session our Legislature amended Section 32A-4-2 again (effective June 16, 2017), so that the definition of neglect is now found at Section 32A-4-2(G).) The district court's adjudicatory judgment cites to the 2016 version, and the parties do so on appeal.

In that case, the father did not communicate with his child for five months, and this Court affirmed the district court's finding that he had neglected and abandoned his child.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 41-42. Here, Father did not communicate with his child for fifteen months.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Under NMSA 1978, Section 40-11A-602(C) (2009) of the New Mexico Uniform Parentage Act, \u00a7\u00a7 40-11A-101 to -903 (2009), a man whose paternity of the child is in question may bring a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, and \"the district court shall order the child and other designated persons to submit to genetic testing if the request for testing is supported by the sworn statement of a party to the proceeding: (1) alleging paternity and stating facts establishing a reasonable probability of the requisite sexual contact between the persons; or (2) denying paternity and stating facts establishing a possibility that sexual contact between the persons, if any, did not result in the conception of the child.\" Section 40-11A-502(A). Father, therefore, could have brought a proceeding to adjudicate his parentage of Child, and if he or Mother had submitted a sworn statement either alleging or denying his paternity, the district court would have been required to order genetic testing. Thus, an alleged or putative father can act to determine his parentage with a DNA test.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Father testified that he asked Mother for a DNA test during her pregnancy. This testimony is inconsistent with Father's other testimony that he did not know about Child or that Child was his until April 2016. But even assuming the statement was truthful, Father never followed up on the request. On the contrary, he proceeded to block communication with Mother on social media. For these reasons, we do not conclude that Mother's inaction following Father's claimed request for a DNA test to be justifiable cause for Father leaving Child in the care of others without communication or provision for support.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Father also argues that he \"is not required to submit to assessments or attend parenting classes\n    <em>\n     unless and until\n    </em>\n    he has otherwise been found guilty of neglect[,]\" and therefore the district court could not take into account Father's actions post-petition when finding that he neglected Child. We need not consider this argument because we hold that there was clear and convincing evidence that Father abandoned Child before CYFD filed its abuse and neglect petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
