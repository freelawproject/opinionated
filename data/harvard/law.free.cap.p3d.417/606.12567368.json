She subsequently filed a medical malpractice claim against Dr. David Grigsby. This appeal is from a medical malpractice suit where the jury concluded that Ms. Arnold's lawsuit against Dr. Grigsby was time-barred. In particular, the jury found that Ms. Arnold's cause of action against Dr. Grigsby had accrued-that she should have known of her injury and that it was caused by Dr. Grigsby's negligence-more than two years before she filed suit. Because of this, the jury concluded that the Utah Medical Malpractice Act's two-year statute of limitations barred Ms. Arnold's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 On appeal, Ms. Arnold argues that the trial court committed four errors. First, she argues that the trial court erroneously denied her motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether she should have known that she had a cause of action more than two years before she filed suit. Second, Ms. Arnold argues that the trial court made a variety of evidentiary errors: it erred in admitting two pieces of evidence that she says were impermissible hearsay-(1) her husband's statement that a nurse had told him Ms. Arnold had received substandard care, and (2) a document on which a nurse had noted that Ms. Arnold said she intended to sue her doctors-and it also erred in excluding evidence Ms. Arnold had proffered. Third, she argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict regarding whether she should have known of her cause of action more than two years before she filed suit. Finally, Ms. Arnold argues that the trial court gave the jury several misleading instructions pertaining to what Dr. Grigsby had to show to prove she should have known about her cause of action more than two years before she filed suit. Dr. Grigsby cross-appealed the trial court's entry of summary judgment for Ms. Arnold on the issue of whether she actually knew of her cause of action more than two years before she filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 We affirm. We hold that a jury could permissibly find for Dr. Grigsby based on the evidence before it. We hold that the trial court's decision not to grant summary judgment isn't reviewable-and we further explain why an earlier decision by this court,\n   <em>\n    Arnold v. Grigsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980351\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/289/449/\">\n    2012 UT 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980351\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/289/449/\">\n    289 P.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which we affirmed the court of appeals\n   reversal of a grant of summary judgment to Dr. Grigsby on this same issue, isn't to the contrary. We hold that the trial court's evidentiary decisions weren't in error: it wasn't an abuse of discretion for the court to admit Ms. Arnold's husband's testimony, and the nurse's report was admissible under the business records exception to the bar on hearsay; similarly, the court correctly excluded all the evidence Ms. Arnold proffered. We hold that a directed verdict isn't warranted here where sufficient evidence was offered to sustain a jury verdict in favor of Dr. Grigsby. And, finally, we hold that, read as a whole, the jury instructions in this case weren't misleading. And because we affirm, we dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 In July 1999, Dr. Gary White performed an outpatient colonoscopy on Ms. Arnold. During the procedure, Dr. White unknowingly perforated Ms. Arnold's colon when removing a small polyp. The next day, Ms. Arnold, experiencing symptoms, went to the emergency room where Dr. White diagnosed the perforation and admitted her to Uintah Basin Medical Center hospital (UBMC), a small rural hospital in Roosevelt, Utah. Initially, she was unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics. Dr. White and Dr. Grigsby subsequently performed four laparoscopic procedures to treat the infection caused by the perforation. Their efforts were unsuccessful. Mr. Arnold testified that before his wife was transferred to St. Mark's Hospital, a nurse had told him that she needed to be transferred or she'd die, and the nurse was critical of the physician's care. At her husband's request, she was transferred on August 16, 1999, to St. Mark's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where major surgery (a colostomy ) commenced within hours to treat her perforation and infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 On August 26, 1999, a home health care nurse, Denice Vernieuw, recorded on a sticky note attached to the intake form that Ms. Arnold had crossed out portions of the form because she'd been told by her lawyer not to sign papers agreeing to pay. This note was entered into her record and recorded in Ms. Arnold's electronic patient notes by office staff five days later. Ms. Arnold's friend, daughter of attorney Harold Hintze, visited and assisted Ms. Arnold frequently after she returned home to Roosevelt. After some form of consultation, Ms. Arnold signed an authorization and request for release of medical information in September 1999. Mr. Hintze sent a request to UBMC for her medical records on November 16, 1999. Mr. Hintze has no recollection of receiving Ms. Arnold's records, and by November 1999, began other legal work in Panama. And Ms. Arnold, not having heard back from Mr. Hintze, hired another attorney the next spring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Ms. and Mr. Arnold filed their initial complaint on December 4, 2001, against three defendants: Dr. Gary White, Dr. David Grigsby, and the UBMC. This appeal only encompasses the action against Dr. Grigsby. In 2005, Dr. Grigsby moved for summary judgment because he purported that the two-year statute of limitations had expired. The trial court granted summary judgment. The Arnolds subsequently appealed, arguing that the statute of limitations had been tolled when Dr. Grigsby left the state in July 2000. The court of appeals reversed the trial court, a decision Dr. Grigsby appealed.\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.

After several hearings on the admissibility of evidence, the remaining issue was tried to a jury in November 2015. After both sides had presented their evidence to the jury, Ms. Arnold moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that the evidence admitted at trial established as a matter of law that the court should find in her favor. The trial court denied the motion, finding that \"what a reasonable person should have known\" according to the evidence \"is always a jury question.\" The issue of whether Ms. Arnold should have known of her legal injury then went to the jury for deliberation, and the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Dr. Grigsby.

EVIDENTIARY DECISIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 Ms. Arnold asserts that the trial court erred in admitting improper hearsay evidence and excluding other evidence that would have been favorable to her case. We hold that the trial court correctly determined the law with regard to its evidentiary decisions, that there was no clear error in its factual findings, and that it didn't abuse its discretion in its evidentiary rulings. Therefore, these rulings do not constitute reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Husband's Recollection of Unknown Nurse's Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 While at UBMC, an unidentified nurse warned Mr. Arnold that he needed to get Ms. Arnold out of UBMC \"or she was going to die.\" Ms. Arnold argues that the statement was inadmissible hearsay. On the other hand, Dr. Grigsby argues that the statement is admissible because it directly led Mr. Arnold to request Ms. Arnold's transfer to another hospital. The trial court concluded that the statement wasn't hearsay because it was \"offered to show the effect on Mr. Arnold, the hearer, rather than for the truth of the matters asserted in the statement.\" The court was correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hutchison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10432346\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/655/635/#p636\">\n    655 P.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (Utah 1982) (\"When an out-of-court statement is offered only to prove that the statement was made, without regard to its truth or falsity, it is not proscribed by the hearsay rule.\" (citations omitted) ). Also, because it wasn't offered to establish the truth of Ms. Arnold's actual risk of death or the deficiency of medical care, the qualifications of the nurse to make a medical assessment were irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court also determined that sufficient foundation was laid under Utah Rule of Evidence 602 and that Utah Rule of Evidence 403 didn't require exclusion of this evidence. Mr. Arnold himself was able to establish sufficient foundation under rule 602 because he personally participated in the conversation. Moreover, the probative value of the statement wasn't substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The fact that Mr. Arnold ultimately gave testimony at trial that he never communicated this statement to Ms. Arnold does not undermine the trial court's conclusion, but strengthens it. On appeal, Dr. Grigsby admits that the nurse's statement \"provided no basis for [Ms. Arnold] discovering her injury.\" Both parties agree that the nurse's statement was not communicated to Ms. Arnold, so it wasn't prejudicial to her. And the statement had probative value. It was given to the jury not to prove what the nurse told him was actually true or whether Ms. Arnold knew of the nurse's statement, but to show its effect on Mr. Arnold and present to the jury a possible reason for the desire to move Ms. Arnold to St. Mark's Hospital. We hold that the trial court correctly interpreted the relevant legal issues and didn't abuse its discretion in admitting the nurse's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   2. Nurse's Document\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 Conversely, the \"sticky note\" on the eight-page pharmacy document is hearsay because it's being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted-that Ms. Arnold had consulted an attorney and was considering a lawsuit. To be admissible, then, it must fall within one of the hearsay exceptions. Further, each statement on the sticky note may also be hearsay because they weren't \"transmitted by ... someone with knowledge\" as to their truthfulness, and so must comply with Utah Rule of Evidence 805 : \"Hearsay within hearsay is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the rule.\" We first determine whether the sticky note is admissible under the business records exception and then determine which, if any, statements also qualify for admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 The trial court correctly concluded that a portion of the sticky note was permissible under rule 803(6), \"Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity,\" also known as the business records exception. To be admissible under the business records exception, \"[a] record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis\" must meet the following requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (A) the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted by-someone with knowledge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian ...; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (E) neither the source of information nor the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   UTAH R. EVID. 803(6). Ms. Vernieuw, the home healthcare nurse, testified that she handwrote the sticky note to explain the changes made to the standard form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She then gave the paperwork to the pharmacy, which was scanned into the pharmacy's electronic records within days of the visit. Thus, \"the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted by-someone with knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   803(6)(A). Ms. Vernieuw also testified that the \"papers belong[ed] to the pharmacy\" for which she worked and that they were completed \"in the ordinary course of ... rendering services,\" satisfying rule 803(6)(B)-(D). The trial court didn't abuse its discretion in finding that the source of information, the method, or the circumstances were trustworthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 26 After finding that the sticky note qualified under the business records exception, the trial court analyzed the note as hearsay within hearsay. There are four separate independent clauses that the trial court analyzed individually for admissibility under a hearsay exception: (1) \"Client has been told by her lawyer, not to sign any papers indicating she'll pay\"; (2) \"therefore she crossed out those sections or would not sign them\"; (3) \"Apparently she's preparing a suit for problems in beginning of illness\"; and (4) \"After billing any expense after insurance pays, you may need to go through her lawyer for pay.\" This note was signed \"Denice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 27 The trial court determined that the first clause, \"Client has been told by her lawyer, not to sign any papers indicating she'll pay,\" was admissible under rule 803(3). This rule allows hearsay statements that demonstrate \"the declarant's then-existing state of mind (such as motive, intent, or plan).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   803(3). There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 28 The trial court also correctly concluded that the second clause, \"therefore she crossed out those sections or would not sign them\" was an \"event\" as described in rule 803(6), and therefore admissible. The third clause, \"Apparently she's preparing a suit for problems in beginning of illness\" was originally determined inadmissible hearsay, but was later allowed for jury consideration under rules 801(d)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 803(6) when Ms. Vernieuw was able to provide foundation for the statement in her trial testimony. We therefore don't find any abuse of discretion in the application of the hearsay rules to the facts at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 29 The fourth clause, \"After billing any expense after insurance pays, you may need to go through her lawyer for pay,\" was deemed to be only the opinion of Ms. Vernieuw, and was therefore stricken and the jury didn't consider it in its deliberations. We give the trial court deference and uphold its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    B. Exclusion of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   1. Testimony of Dr. White and Dr. Grigsby on Their Negligence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 30 First, Ms. Arnold argues that the trial court erred in determining that testimony by Dr. White and Dr. Grigsby about whether they believed they had been negligent was irrelevant. While relevant evidence is generally admissible, irrelevant evidence isn't. UTAH R. EVID. 402. \"Evidence is relevant if ... it has any tendency to make a fact [of consequence] more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" UTAH R. EVID. 401. We have said that \"[t]rial\n   courts have wide latitude in making determinations of relevance, probativeness, and prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Diversified Holdings, L.C. v.

The purpose of this trial wasn't to determine whether the doctors breached a standard of care, but whether Ms. Arnold should have known about her legal injury within the specified timeframe. The court decided that the doctors' personal beliefs about their standard of care were irrelevant to a determination of when the statute of limitations began to run. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   2. Mr. Hintze's Expert Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 32 Second, Ms. Arnold contends that the trial court erred in prohibiting Mr. Hintze from testifying about the general steps an attorney takes in a malpractice case. The trial court ruled that Mr. Hintze could testify about his own actions and motivations, but hadn't been qualified as an expert witness and therefore couldn't establish what an attorney's standard of care would be in this type of case or what a reasonable attorney would do when litigating a case similar to Ms. Arnold's. We find no abuse of discretion in the court's application of the evidentiary rule regarding expert witnesses to Mr. Hintze.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. EVID. 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   III. DIRECTED VERDICT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 33 A directed verdict wasn't warranted here.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   , we upheld a jury's verdict because the evidence before it-notably, evidence that the plaintiff suspected that a doctor acted negligently and evidence that the plaintiff's expectations about how long he'd have to stay in the hospital were \"dashed soon after the surgery\" (and over two years before the plaintiff filed suit)-could license a jury's inference that the plaintiff's suit was time-barred.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11582153\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/984/960/\">\n    1999 UT 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11582153\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/984/960/\">\n    984 P.2d 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the evidence before the jury was more than enough for a reasonable jury to find in favor of Dr. Grigsby. As in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the jury heard that Ms. Arnold's expectations about the complications she would suffer from her colonoscopy-as well as the length of her stay in the hospital-were repeatedly dashed more than two years before she filed suit. First, she was told that it was a routine procedure and that she was fine to be discharged. Then, a complication arose, she entered the hospital for another stay, and she was again told she was cured. And then yet another complication arose. She went back in for another hospital stay. She was told she was \"clean as a whistle.\" Not ten days later, she required emergency life-saving surgery that resulted in a colostomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 38 And, also like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Arnold suspected that her doctors had acted negligently well over two years before she filed suit-going so far as to refuse to sign any paperwork because she planned to sue. The home healthcare nurse assigned to her case noted on the paperwork that Ms. Arnold \"has been told by her lawyer not to sign any papers indicating she'll pay. ... Apparently she's preparing a suit for problems in the beginning of the illness.\" This evidence informs the significance a reasonable jury might have ascribed to the troublesome course of Ms. Arnold's treatment-it reflects that her experience of the objectively suspicious treatment she received had been of such a nature as to put her on the alert that her complications might well have been caused by her doctors' negligence. This accumulated evidence could have led a jury to believe that she had been put on alert of all the facts necessary to lead an ordinary person using reasonable diligence to conclude that a claim for negligence may exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 39 In short, a reasonable jury, when confronted with these pieces of evidence, could have inferred that Ms. Arnold should have known that her injury was attributable to negligence over two years before she initiated her medical malpractice action.

PacifiCorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801204\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/629/\">\n    2016 UT 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801204\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/629/\">\n    372 P.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). When determining whether a set of jury instructions sufficiently inform the jury, \"we look at the jury instructions in their entirety and will affirm when the instructions taken as a whole fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801204\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/629/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). This means that \"a trial court does not err by refusing a proposed instruction if the point is properly covered in other instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801204\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/629/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 41 Ms. Arnold's claims that the jury instructions were an abuse of discretion are unsubstantiated. Ms. Arnold attempts to show the insufficiency of the jury instructions by evaluating each instruction separately, challenging the specific language in each instruction rather than looking at them as a coherent set of instructions. But taken as a whole, the jury instructions correctly stated the law. In fact, the language in the instructions she challenges are direct quotes from our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Arnold IV\n   </em>\n   . Because of this, our \"confidence in the jury's verdict is [not] undermined\" as the instructions sufficiently informed the jury regarding to the applicable law.\n   <em>\n    Turner v. Univ. of Utah Hosps. &amp; Clinics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975059\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/1212/\">\n    2013 UT 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975059\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/1212/\">\n    310 P.3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Thus, the trial court didn't abuse its discretion with regard to the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 42 We hold that there were material facts in dispute and that a jury could permissibly find for Dr. Grigsby based on the evidence before it. Therefore summary judgment and directed verdict were unwarranted. We further hold that it wasn't an abuse of discretion for the court to admit Ms. Arnold's husband's testimony and the nurse's report. The trial court didn't err in excluding the evidence Ms. Arnold asserts should have been admitted. Finally, we conclude that read as a whole, the jury instructions in this case correctly stated the law of the case. We affirm the trial court and we dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The 2015 amendments to Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 56 weren't meant to make any substantive changes to Utah law.
