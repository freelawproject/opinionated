After\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find Appellant could prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief because the Pardons and Paroles provisions,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    57 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 331\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , do not require the Pardon and Parole Board to reconsider an inmate for parole after his initial denial. We also affirm the court's finding that Appellant's action is subject to the registry of frivolous and malicious appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Appellant, an inmate of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, was sentenced to life imprisonment on April 6, 1989. Appellant was denied parole in April 2015. The Pardon and Parole Board (the Board) voted to set off Appellant's next parole reconsideration for five years. Appellant filed a lawsuit in Oklahoma County seeking a declaratory judgment that the Administrative Code conflicts with statutory changes concerning the scheduling of parole reconsideration. Specifically, Appellant claimed the Board's discretion to set off his next reconsideration date was nullified when the Legislature repealed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    57 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 332.7 in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 The trial court dismissed Appellant's case, finding that Appellant was required to bring his suit under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act in Stephens County, where Appellant's judgment and sentence were imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant then filed an \"Amended Petition\" and argued that the relief he was seeking,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , declaratory relief under the Administrative Procedures Act, was not available under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act. The State filed a motion to dismiss. The State argued that Appellant had no liberty interest in parole and that the Board's discretion to set off parole consideration was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   repealed by the Legislature. The State also requested a finding that Appellant's action was frivolous, malicious, failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and thus, was subject to the registry of frivolous or malicious appeals pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    57 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 566.2.

Title 57 O.S. Supp. 2013 \u00a7 332.7(D) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   D. Any inmate who has parole consideration dates calculated pursuant to subsection A, B or C of this section shall be considered at the earliest such date. Except as otherwise directed by the Pardon and Parole Board, any person who has been considered for parole and was denied parole or who has waived consideration shall not be reconsidered for parole:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Within three (3) years of the denial or waiver, if the person was convicted of a\n   violent crime ... unless the person is within one (1) year of discharge; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Until the person has served at least one-third (1/3) of the sentence imposed, if the person was eligible for consideration pursuant to paragraph 3 of subsection A of this section. Thereafter the person shall not be considered more frequently than once every three (3) years, unless the person is within one (1) year of discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This provision, in short, provides that the Board may not reconsider a person for parole sooner than three years after his previous denial, unless that person is within one year of being discharged. The provision does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   , however,\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the Board to reconsider an inmate's parole every three years or establish a limitation on how long the Board may postpone reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Appellant focuses on the discretionary language in \u00a7 332.7(D) and argues that the Legislature nullified that language when it repealed 57 O.S. \u00a7 322.17 in 2013. This argument fails for several reasons. First, the Board's authority to postpone parole reconsideration is not derived from \u00a7 332.7. As noted above, \u00a7 332.7 merely imposes a minimum amount of time that must pass before a previously denied inmate may be reconsidered for parole. Further, we disagree with Appellant's argument that the Legislature implicitly nullified the Board's discretion when it repealed 57 O.S. \u00a7 322.17. Section 322.17 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   No person who is appearing out of the normal processing procedure shall be eligible for consideration for parole without the concurrence of at least three (3) members of the Pardon and Parole Board. The vote on whether or not to consider such person for parole and the names of the concurring Board members shall be set forth in the written minutes of the Board meeting at which the issue is considered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellant, however, fails to explain how or to otherwise convince us that the repeal of \u00a7 322.17 requires the Board to reconsider previously denied prisoners for parole at any particular time. If anything, the repeal of this provision gives the Board\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   leeway to schedule parole reviews, as a three-member vote is no longer required to consider prisoners out of the normal processing procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Appellant also argues the court erred when it found his claim was frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and was, therefore, subject to the registry of frivolous or malicious appeals. When a prisoner has had three or more actions or appeals dismissed on the grounds that they were frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, the court may require that prisoner to prepay filing fees.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    57 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 566.2(A). Section 566.2(B) requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to maintain a registry of frivolous or malicious appeals, which is posted on the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network website. The trial court here properly found that Appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Accordingly, we find the court did not abuse its discretion by finding this action is subject to the registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   BUETTNER, C.J., and GOREE, J.
