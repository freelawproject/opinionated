According to Lopez, he drove home while he and Shannon argued in the cab of his truck. Lopez claimed that the argument continued until Shannon shot herself with a gun Lopez had in his truck. A jury disbelieved Lopez and convicted him of murder. On appeal, Lopez argues the district court erred in two ways. First, Lopez challenges the admission of expert testimony that assessed Shannon's risk of suicide. Second, Lopez contends that the district court erred by admitting evidence that he had, on one occasion, pointed a gun at Shannon's head, and that on another, he had leveled a gun at an ex-wife and threatened to kill her. Lopez also argues that the errors were harmful both individually and cumulatively, and that insufficient evidence existed to convict him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 We conclude that the State did not lay a sufficient foundation to demonstrate that the theory its expert employed could be reliably used to assess the suicide risk of someone who had died. We also conclude that the district court erred by admitting the evidence of Lopez's prior actions. The errors were harmful. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Lopez and Shannon, who were married at the time of Shannon's death, both enjoyed shooting guns. Lopez used a gun throughout his career in the military and law enforcement. Shannon, who had been introduced to firearms at the age of nine, was a recreational shooter. Lopez and Shannon kept multiple guns in their home. Lopez usually carried a gun in his truck and another on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 On the night of Shannon's death, Shannon picked Lopez up from work. Shannon had consumed methamphetamine in a quantity that the medical examiner described as \"toxic.\" Lopez also had methamphetamine in his system. During their commute, Lopez and Shannon argued about Shannon's methamphetamine use and their financial problems. Lopez said during a police interview \"that Shannon's last words were ... that she would take the kids and go to her father's[.]\" He \"repeat[ed] ... several times during [one of the] interview[s]\" that \"[s]he said she'd take the kids, she's already packed, and she'll leave....\" He further stated that he \"told her ... during the argument he was going to leave her also.\" During his trial testimony, Lopez maintained that he said he would leave her, but denied hearing Shannon say that she would leave him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Lopez testified that as he was making a left hand turn, he heard the sound of breaking glass. Lopez turned to see that Shannon was \"slumped forward.\" Lopez tried to turn the truck around to take Shannon to a hospital, but crashed into another car and then into a fence. Witnesses saw Lopez jump out of the truck and lie on the ground while saying \"sorry mommy\" or \"sorry mama\" repeatedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Shannon had been shot in her left ear. When police arrived, they found that Shannon's legs were crossed at the ankles. Shannon's right hand-Shannon was right handed-was hidden in her jacket sleeve. Officers found a gun and holster on the floor of the driver's side of the cab.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Months before she died, Shannon sent a text message to Lopez expressing a desire to end her life. Shannon had spoken to her son, M.N., about suicide in the past. A month before she died, Shannon had threatened to shoot herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State charged Lopez with criminal homicide murder. Because the medical examiner's report ruled out the possibility that the gun had accidentally discharged, the key dispute was who fired the shot that killed Shannon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The physical evidence was inconclusive. The medical examiner testified that the location of the wound was \"atypical\" for a suicide, but that he could not determine the manner of death conclusively. Examiners found gunshot residue on Lopez's hand, but all that could be gleaned from this was that Lopez was \"in proximity when [the] firearm was discharged.\" A blood spatter analyst was unable to conclude whether Shannon's wound was self-inflicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 To prove that Shannon did not shoot herself, the State offered expert testimony from Dr. Craig Bryan, a clinical psychologist. Dr. Bryan specializes in the treatment of suicide patients using the Fluid Vulnerability Theory of Suicide (FVTS). FVTS is the \"most commonly used theory and approach to developing treatment and understanding suicide risks.\" The theory is based on \"scientific evidence gained from clinical care of suicide patients as well as multidisciplinary scientific efforts internationally.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 FVTS assesses two different types of risk: baseline and acute. Predispositions-including demographic factors, \"[d]ifficulty managing emotions,\" and \"history of psychiatric disorders\"-increase the baseline risk, meaning that \"[i]ndividuals with many predispositions.... experience more suicidal crises more often and take longer to 'recover' from crises and discrete periods of emotional distress.\" This baseline risk can be \"offset[ ]\" by \"protective factors,\" such as an optimistic outlook, a strong support network, or motherhood. \"Acute risk,\" on the other hand, \"entails the emotional, physiological, behavioral, and cognitive factors associated with an active suicidal episode.\" Taking baseline and acute risk together, the model posits that \"a triggering event will only lead to suicide among individuals with sufficient [baseline risk].\" When applying FVTS, Dr. Bryan conducts interviews with his patients. Sometimes, Dr. Bryan employs testing \"designed to ... identify the risk and protective factors in a way that might not be obvious to the respondent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Lopez challenged the admission of Dr. Bryan's testimony on various grounds, including that it was neither helpful nor reliable. The district court admitted \"Dr. Bryan's opinion as to whether Shannon Lopez's behavior prior to her death was inconsistent with suicide\" into evidence. The district court excluded, however, \"[a]ny testimony that Dr. Bryan's opinions are definitive or based on scientific certainty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 In response to Dr. Bryan's testimony, the defense called an expert who testified that Shannon's death was a \"classic suicide,\" noting that \"[t]ypically someone doesn't hold their head still while you shoot them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 The State also sought to offer evidence of several prior acts involving Lopez threatening a family member with a gun and/or pointing a gun at their head. The court allowed the admission of two of those acts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first described Lopez and Shannon talking with their coworker about how to kill effectively. To demonstrate, Lopez pulled out a gun and pointed it at Shannon's head near her left ear. The district court found that \"the act of someone describing the best place to shoot someone, in fact even demonstrating that, is very relevant to the identification of someone who may have done that at another time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 The second prior act involved an argument Lopez had with an ex-wife where he \"hit her in the stomach,\" \"pointed a gun at her head,\" and verbally threatened to kill them both if she ever sought a divorce. The\n   district court reasoned this evidence was admissible because \"the identity of the shooter is the issue, and therefore, it is relevant to that, what he did to a prior spouse, under a prior circumstance when she indicated she was leaving him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The jury found Lopez guilty of murder. The jurors additionally found Lopez had used a dangerous weapon. The district court sentenced Lopez to sixteen years to life. Lopez appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Lopez first argues that Dr. Bryan's testimony should not have been admitted because, among other things, it lacked an adequate foundation. Next, Lopez contends that the character evidence should not have been admitted because it was not relevant, not offered for a proper purpose, and was prejudicial. Lopez also argues cumulative error and claims there was insufficient evidence to convict him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 We review the admission of expert testimony and character evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The District Court Abused Its Discretion by Admitting Dr. Bryan's Testimony Without an Adequate Foundation Establishing Its Reliability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 Lopez challenges the admissibility of Dr. Bryan's testimony. Dr. Bryan used the Fluid Vulnerability Theory of Suicide (FVTS) to assess the likelihood that Shannon had taken her own life. Lopez asserts that the FVTS testimony was not helpful, that it impermissibly addressed the ultimate issue, and that there was not an adequate threshold showing of its reliability. We agree with Lopez that the State did not make the threshold showing of FVTS's reliability when applied to a decedent, and that therefore the district court abused its discretion by admitting Dr. Bryan's testimony under Utah Rule of Evidence 702.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 We rely on our district court judges to act as \"gatekeeper[s]\" to \"screen out unreliable expert testimony.\" UTAH R. EVID.702 advisory committee's note. This requires our judges to view proposed expert testimony with \"rational skepticism.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Utah Rule of Evidence 702 details the framework a judge should employ to perform her gatekeeping function. First, the judge must determine that the expert is qualified \"by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" and that the proposed expert testimony will \"help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" UTAH R. EVID.702(a). Second, the judge inquires as to whether the \"[s]cientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\" underlying the expert's testimony meets a threshold showing that the \"principles or methods ... underlying ... the testimony (1) are reliable, (2) are based on sufficient facts or data, and (3) have been reliably applied to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   702(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 The threshold showing is satisfied if \"the underlying principles or methods, including the sufficiency of facts or data and the manner of their application to the facts of the case, are generally accepted by the relevant expert community\" or if the testimony meets a threshold showing of reliability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   702. If the expert testimony clears those hurdles, the district court may admit the evidence. And we afford the district court discretion in its decision to admit or exclude expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v. Maestas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979864\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/299/892/\">\n    2012 UT 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 122,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979864\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/299/892/\">\n    299 P.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court abuses its discretion when \"no reasonable person would take the view the trial court adopted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979864\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/299/892/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    A. There Was No Threshold Showing that the Fluid Vulnerability Theory of Suicide Is a Reliable Method to Evaluate the Risk of Suicide of a Deceased Person\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 Although Lopez raises several challenges to Dr. Bryan's testimony, we focus\n   our analysis on the question of threshold reliability. As noted above, the State could have met this threshold showing by demonstrating that the method Dr. Bryan used is \"generally accepted by the relevant expert community\" or by establishing that the principles underlying his testimony are \"reliable, ... based upon sufficient facts or data, and ... have been reliably applied to the facts.\" UTAH R. EVID.702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 The State attempted to meet its rule 702 burden with evidence that FVTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is generally accepted in the psychological community.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked if FVTS was generally accepted, Dr. Bryan replied that it was, elaborating that \"when you look particularly at researchers who are treatment developers, [and] they are testing therapies to reduce suicidal behaviors, this particular model is the leading and the most commonly used theory and approach to\n   <em>\n    developing treatment\n   </em>\n   and to understanding suicide risks.\" (Emphasis added). And, \"[w]hen ... use[d] [for] treatment[ ] ... based on the principles contained within the theory, [there is] typically [a] 50 to 60 percent reduction[ ] in suicidal behaviors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 Dr. Bryan's testimony addressed the acceptance of FVTS as a tool to evaluate patients. The foundation the State attempted to lay did not speak to the precise question the district court needed to answer: Is FVTS generally accepted as a means of assessing the risk of suicide in someone who has passed away? With respect to that question, Dr. Bryan provided no information on how effective the theory was at determining suicide risk of those who are deceased, nor did he indicate whether there was any peer-reviewed literature regarding this application. Indeed, it appears that Dr. Bryan never even addressed whether FVTS had ever been used to assess the risk of someone who had died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 The district court nevertheless concluded that the FVTS \"methodology ... is generally accepted in the psychological community.\" As suggested above, the problem with this conclusion is that the State placed no evidence before the court that FVTS was generally accepted in the psychological community for the purpose of determining whether any particular death was the result of suicide. The evidence before the district court demonstrated that FVTS is based on \"scientific evidence gained from\n   <em>\n    clinical care\n   </em>\n   of suicide patients as well as multidisciplinary scientific efforts internationally.\" (Emphasis added). Dr. Bryan's published works on suicide are similarly based on \"[c]linical\n   trials, epidemiological research as well as laboratory-based research.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 Demonstrating that FVTS was generally accepted to assess suicide risk in live patients is not the same as demonstrating that it is generally accepted to gauge whether a decedent died by her own hand. On the record before the district court, there were reasons to question whether FVTS is reliable as a post-mortem tool. Dr. Bryan referenced interviews with his patients to assess their suicide risk. And Dr. Bryan's description of FVTS demonstrated its reliance on accurately identifying baseline and acute factors. Dr. Bryan never discussed whether he could accurately identify those factors in someone he had never interviewed, let alone someone who was incapable of being interviewed. For example, Dr. Bryan testified that Shannon's acute risk for suicide was low because of her positive outlook, social engagement, and improved mood. Dr. Bryan never testified, however, that he could accurately assess those risks without actually interviewing Shannon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 The State argues that the \"question of whether someone\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   at risk to commit suicide is the same question as whether someone\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   at risk-it merely focuses on a different time.\" And the State may be correct about that, but the question for the district court was whether the difference in that timing undercut FVTS's reliability. We do not rule out the possibility that FVTS could be used to determine whether a decedent was at risk of suicide, but the State needed to lay a foundation that it could. It failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 The district court held that FVTS was generally accepted, but did not draw a distinction between how FVTS had been used to gain general acceptance in the psychological community and the manner in which Dr. Bryan proposed to use it here. On the record before it, the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony as the product of a generally accepted scientific method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 The State could have also satisfied the threshold showing by offering evidence that the \"principles or methods ... underlying ... the testimony (1) are reliable, (2) are based on sufficient facts or data, and (3) have been reliably applied to the facts.\" UTAH R. EVID.702(b). For the same reasons we have just discussed, we conclude that there was an insufficient basis for the district court to conclude that FVTS is reliable when used to assess suicide risk post-mortem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    B. Dr. Bryan's Testimony Likely Swayed the Jury and Was Therefore Harmful Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 \"[A]n [evidentiary] error requires reversal only if there is 'a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable result' for the accused had the error not occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tuttle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10394721\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/780/1203/\">\n    780 P.2d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1213 n.12 (Utah 1989) (citation omitted). \"A reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome exists if our confidence in the result of the trial is eroded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10394721\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/780/1203/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Because the admission of Dr. Bryan's testimony has eroded our confidence in the jury's verdict, we conclude that the error was harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 As the State said multiple times, this case hinged on whether Lopez or Shannon fired the weapon. Some evidence pointed to Lopez, including the fact that Shannon was right-handed and was shot on the left side of her head. Lopez \"admitted ... that [Shannon] was not familiar with [the gun].\" The gun and holster were also found on the driver's side of the car (where Lopez had been) and Shannon's right hand remained hidden in her sleeve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 32 Other evidence suggested Shannon took her life. An expert testified that this was a \"classic suicide\" and \"[t]ypically someone doesn't hold their head still while you shoot\n   them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was also evidence that Shannon was experienced with firearms and could shoot with her left hand, albeit with some difficulty. And there was evidence that Shannon had mentioned suicide on occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 33 Given this conflicting evidence, Dr. Bryan's opinion that Shannon's death was inconsistent with suicide likely swayed the jury. It was the strongest statement the State introduced to demonstrate that Shannon's death was not a suicide. Without Dr. Bryan's testimony, the most direct evidence speaking to whether Shannon had killed herself was a State expert opining that the location of the wound was \"atypical\" for suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 34 Dr. Bryan's testimony drove to the heart of the matter such that we conclude that the admission of Dr. Bryan's testimony on the foundation presented was prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   II. The District Court Abused Its Discretion by Admitting Evidence of the Prior Acts to Attempt to Prove that Lopez Fired the Weapon\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 35 Lopez also argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of prior instances of Lopez pointing guns at family members. The State initially sought the admission of six instances where Lopez pointed a gun at a member of his family. The State argued that this evidence could be admitted for a number of non-character purposes, including lack of mistake, knowledge, intent, and identity. Lopez countered by arguing, among other things, that the State was seeking to admit the testimony solely to show that he had a propensity to point firearms at family members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 36 The district court excluded four of the prior acts but allowed the State to introduce evidence that Lopez had discussed the best way to commit suicide or kill someone, and that in the course of that discussion, he had placed his gun behind Shannon's left ear. The district court also admitted testimony that during an argument with a former spouse, Lopez had pointed a gun at her and suggested that if she were to leave him, he would kill them both. The district court reasoned that both of these acts could be admitted for the noncharacter purpose of showing \"the identity of the shooter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 37 Lopez challenges the district court's decision to admit these prior acts. Specifically, Lopez argues that: (1) admission of the prior acts was not relevant to a proper non-character purpose and (2) the probative value of such evidence was substantially outweighed by its ability to unfairly prejudice the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 38 Generally, \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character.\" UTAH R. EVID.404(b)(1). We recognize an exception to that rule where prior acts are \"relevant[,] offered for a genuine, noncharacter purpose,\" and not unduly prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

To find that the prior incident of Lopez pointing a gun at Shannon to demonstrate how to kill effectively was admissible, the court emphasized \"the similarity between the position of the gun as demonstrated and the position of the gun in the crime that was committed.\" And the district court was correct that the positioning was indeed similar: in the prior act and the crime, the gun was pointed at or near Shannon's left ear. But the commonality of the positioning of the gun on a single occasion is not enough to establish that Lopez had a modus operandi when it came to pointing a gun. The similar positioning does not establish a \"signature\" like the combination of commonalities in\n   <em>\n    Decorso\n   </em>\n   did; pointing a gun in an approximate location is not the same as entering the same chain of shoe stores right before closing and using the same method to rob it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. There simply are not enough factual similarities between the gun pointing incidents to constitute a modus operandi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 43 The other admitted act-Lopez threatening to shoot his ex-wife if she left him-is not sufficiently similar to the alleged behavior to be considered a modus operandi. The district court noted that the \"similarities between the crimes are very close\" because both of them involved \"[p]ointing a gun at a spouse in the context of ... the discussion that the spouse was leaving.\" But threatening one's wife with a gun on two occasions is not a \"unique or singular methodology.\"\n   <em>\n    Lucero,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6936746\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/328/841/\">\n    2014 UT 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6936746\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/328/841/\">\n    328 P.3d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Indeed, neither the context of the act nor its execution is similar enough to the charged conduct to suggest a modus operandi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 44 We have also upheld the admission of 404(b) evidence when it supported an intermediate inference that tied the defendant to the charged crime. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court reasoned that, because the defendant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   assert[ed] that he was not present at the [subsequent] shooting, identity of the perpetrator was clearly at issue in this case.... Evidence that [the] [d]efendant was carrying the ... handgun when he arrived at the scene of the [prior] shooting, that he displayed a familiarity with the handgun's operation, and that he actually used the handgun in that incident all tend to show that the handgun was actually his.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Therefore, the use of the gun in the prior shooting tended to show that the defendant was the perpetrator in the later shooting by demonstrating that he likely had access to the gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 47 The evidence at issue here did not support any intermediate inference of identity like those in\n   <em>\n    Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shaffer\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   . The State did not, for example, seek to show the identity of the shooter with evidence that Lopez had access to a firearm like the one that killed Shannon. Rather, the district court said it would admit the evidence that Lopez had pointed a gun at Shannon to prove \"identification\" and the evidence that Lopez had aimed a firearm at an ex-wife and threatened to kill her to show the \"identity of the shooter.\" In other words, the district court admitted the evidence because it tended to show that Lopez had in the past pointed guns at family members. And the fact that he had done this in the past suggested that he had done it on the night Shannon died. This is nothing more than the propensity evidence 404(b) excludes, and the district court abused its discretion by admitting it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 MCCORMICK ON EVID. \u00a7 190 (7th ed. 2016) (\"[T]he need to prove identity should not be, in itself, a ticket to admission.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 48 On appeal, the State raises an argument that the district court rejected below. The State argues that the district court could have admitted the evidence because it established identity through the doctrine of chances. The district court rejected that argument, and the State did not cross-appeal that determination. As such, the State asks us to affirm the district court on an alternative ground apparent from the record.\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

The independence requirement helps ensure there is no collusion between the victims and that the victims have not influenced each other's recollections of what occurred. All but one of the prior acts involved either K.L. or Lopez's ex-wife (K.L.'s mother). And K.L. and Lopez's ex-wife lived together for over a year after all five of the prior acts involving them occurred.

Although each involved Lopez drawing a firearm in the presence of family members, they happened in very different contexts. The two incidents where Lopez threatened his ex-wife with a gun are the most similar to one another but because his ex-wife \"could not recall the [closet] incident with great detail[,]\" the district court may not have been well-positioned to accurately assess the degree of similarity of those events. And the prior act in which K.L. thought he heard Lopez rack a gun bears some resemblance to those two. But the other prior acts describe different actions. Two of the other events-pointing a gun to \"educat[e]\" his family and pointing a gun at Shannon in front of a co-worker to show the most effective way to kill, do not bear great similarity to the instances where Lopez pointed a firearm during a domestic argument.
