Among its limitations, the AMMA prohibits the possession or\n   use of medical marijuana at certain specified locations. A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2802(B). In 2012, the Arizona Legislature added another location by enacting a statute under which \"a person, including [a qualified AMMA cardholder], may not lawfully possess or use marijuana on the campus of any public university, college, community college or postsecondary educational institution.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 15-108(A). Because that statute violates Arizona's Voter Protection Act (\"VPA\") with respect to AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use, we hold it unconstitutional as applied to the university student/cardholder in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 In March 2014, an Arizona State University police officer arrested Andre Lee Juwaun Maestas after the officer observed Maestas sitting in a road near Maestas's dormitory on the university campus. The officer searched Maestas and found a valid AMMA registry identification card in Maestas's wallet. After Maestas admitted that he had marijuana in his dorm room, the officer obtained a search warrant, searched Maestas's dorm room, and found two envelopes containing 0.4 grams of marijuana. (The AMMA provides that an \"[a]llowable amount of marijuana\" is \"[t]wo-and-one-half ounces of usable marijuana.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(1)(a)(i). Maestas's 0.4 grams of marijuana is roughly equivalent to 0.014 ounces.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State charged Maestas with obstructing a public thoroughfare and possession of marijuana. Before trial, Maestas moved to dismiss the marijuana-possession charge, arguing that his possession was AMMA-compliant and he was therefore immune from prosecution under \u00a7 36-2811(B). The State opposed the motion, arguing that Maestas's AMMA-compliant possession of marijuana was nevertheless unlawful under \u00a7 15-108(A), which prohibits even AMMA cardholders from possessing marijuana on public college and university campuses. The superior court denied Maestas's motion, convicted him on both counts after a bench trial, imposed a fine on the marijuana-possession charge, and placed him on probation for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The court of appeals vacated Maestas's conviction for possession of marijuana and held that \u00a7 15-108(A) is unconstitutional under the VPA.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State reasons that the AMMA \"expressly authorizes restrictions for cardholders on university campuses\" and \"expressly authorizes penalties in order to assure continued access to federal funding.\" Alternatively, the State argues that even if the VPA's requirements apply to \u00a7 15-108(A), the legislature complied with those requirements because at least three-fourths of the members of each chamber voted to enact \u00a7 15-108(A), and that law is consistent with the AMMA when\n   the statutory scheme is viewed as a whole. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The VPA limits the legislature's power to amend, repeal, or supersede voter initiatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, \u00a7 1 (6)(B)-(C), (14). A threshold question, therefore, is whether the legislature amended, repealed, or superseded the AMMA when it enacted \u00a7 15-108(A). It is undisputed that \u00a7 15-108(A) did not repeal or supersede the AMMA, but the parties disagree about whether \u00a7 15-108(A) amends it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 The AMMA specifies the circumstances under which the legislature may impose \"civil, criminal or other penalties\" when a person, including a qualified AMMA cardholder, possesses or uses marijuana. A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2802(B). Specifically, the AMMA \"does not authorize any person\" to possess or use marijuana in the following locations: \"[o]n a school bus,\" \"[o]n the grounds of any preschool or primary or secondary school,\" and \"[i]n any correctional facility.\" \u00a7 36-2802(B)(1)-(3). In general, when the legislature (or voters) expressly prescribes a list in a statute (or initiative), \"we assume the exclusion of items not listed.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Ault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1522356\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/157/516/#p519\">\n    157 Ariz. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1522356\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/157/516/#p519\">\n    759 P.2d 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1323 (1988). Because the AMMA sets forth a list of locations where the legislature may impose \"civil, criminal or other penalties\" when a person possesses or uses marijuana, \u00a7 36-2802, and because that list does not include college and university campuses (unlike pre-, primary-, and secondary-school grounds), we assume that the voters did not intend to criminalize AMMA-compliant possession or use of marijuana on public college and university campuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 By its terms, \u00a7 15-108(A) amends the AMMA by adding a location to the AMMA's list of specified locations where the legislature may impose \"civil, criminal or other penalties\" for a person's possession or use of marijuana otherwise allowed under the AMMA. \u00a7 36-2802. Indeed, \u00a7 15-108(A) begins by stating that \"[i]n addition to the limitations prescribed in\" \u00a7 36-2802(B), a person \"may not lawfully possess or use marijuana on the campus of any public university, college, community college or postsecondary educational institution.\" Consequently, the legislature amended the AMMA when it enacted \u00a7 15-108(A) because that statute makes AMMA-compliant possession or use of marijuana on public college and university campuses criminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Although this conclusion is apparent from the statute's terms, it is also bolstered by \u00a7 15-108 's legislative history. When that proposed law was introduced in the legislature as House Bill 2349, the Bill Summary noted that it would \"require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the members of each house of the Legislature\" to be enacted. Ariz. H.B. Summary for H.B. 2349, 50th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Jan. 23, 2012). With one exception that is inapplicable here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 9, \u00a7 22 (A) (requiring three-fourths vote of legislature to override governor's veto of revenue-raising act), such a requirement applies only when a legislative enactment is subject to the VPA. Accordingly, when House Bill 2349 was introduced, the bill's sponsor presumably understood that its provisions would amend the AMMA if enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the VPA's restrictions apply to the legislature's enactment of \u00a7 15-108(A) because it amends the AMMA.

Criminalizing AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use on public college and university campuses plainly does not further the AMMA's primary purpose as expressed in those statements supporting the voter initiative. Section 15-108(A) does not \"protect\" qualifying AMMA cardholders from criminal penalties arising from AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use on public college and university campuses, but rather subjects them to such penalties. Therefore, because \u00a7 15-108(A) does not further the purpose of the AMMA, we hold that \u00a7 15-108(A) violates the VPA as applied to AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 In so holding, we disagree with the State that the AMMA's anti-discrimination provision, A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2813(A), authorizes the legislature to criminalize AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use on public college and university campuses to preserve federal funding. Section 36-2813(A) provides that a \"school\" may \"penalize a person solely for his status as a cardholder\" only if \"failing to do so would cause the school ... to lose a monetary or licensing related benefit under federal law or regulations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 By its terms, \u00a7 36-2813(A) does not authorize the legislature to criminalize AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use on public college and university campuses for two reasons. First, \u00a7 36-2813(A) authorizes a \"school\" to penalize a cardholder to preserve federal funding. But a school is not authorized to enact criminal laws. Therefore, any authority that is vested in a school under this statute does not extend to criminalizing AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 Second, even if \u00a7 36-2813(A) did authorize the legislature to take some action to preserve federal funding, criminalizing AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use is impermissible because it is unnecessary to achieve the statute's purpose. The State has not shown that failing to \"penalize a person solely for his status as a cardholder ...\n   <em>\n    would cause\n   </em>\n   \" a school to lose federal funding. \u00a7 36-2813(A) (emphasis added). A university can comply with federal funding requirements by adopting and implementing \"a program to prevent the use of illicit drugs.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011i(a). The program must prohibit \"the unlawful possession ... of illicit drugs,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329356\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/119/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1011i(a)(1)(A), and describe \"the applicable legal sanctions under local, State, or Federal law for the unlawful possession ... of illicit drugs,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329356\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/119/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1011i(a)(1)(B), which may include \"referral for prosecution,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329356\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/119/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1011i(a)(1)(E).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But a university does not have to guarantee prosecution for violations of its program. And it can refer violations of its program to the federal prosecutor. The State has not shown that a university would lose (or has lost) federal funding if a state prosecutor did not prosecute violations of the university's program. Consequently, we conclude that A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2813(A) does not authorize the legislature to criminalize AMMA-compliant marijuana possession or use on public university and college campuses to preserve federal funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

We should welcome wisdom from any source, but if we embrace it we should make sure it is, indeed, wisdom. The textual requirement, which forbids the judiciary from ruling on matters constitutionally entrusted to the political branches of government, is central to our system of separation of powers. But the judicially created prudential requirement, as a standalone doctrine, does quite the opposite by abdicating the judiciary's central role of constitutional interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 The textual requirement of the political question doctrine is deeply embedded in our constitutional design, but the prudential requirement is not. The Constitution's framers intended that courts would not decide matters entrusted to other branches of government, but equally intended that the courts and not the other branches would determine respective constitutional boundaries. In\n   <em>\n    The Federalist No. 78\n   </em>\n   , Alexander Hamilton articulated a bright line of demarcation between the two, recognizing hegemony of the political branches in matters assigned to their discretion, but recognizing the Constitution as \"fundamental law\" and that it \"belongs to [the judiciary] to ascertain its meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    The Federalist No. 78\n   </em>\n   , at 430 (Alexander Hamilton) (Gideon ed., 2006).
