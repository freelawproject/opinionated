Nelson and Jo Marie S. Nelson purchased property from Mary Jo Davis and Anthony Palese, Jr., in 1997. The deed purported to sell the Nelsons the property in its entirety save a portion of the mineral estate reserved in Davis and Palese. After years of farm use, the Nelsons and Davis and Palese leased the property for oil and gas development. In the ensuing title research, the Nelsons' counsel uncovered possible remote heirs with an interest in the property-George Salituro, Jr., and Rose M. Salituro. The Nelsons brought a quiet title action in the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Roosevelt County, and the District Court ruled in their favor. The court quieted surface title and a one-half interest in the mineral estate in the Nelsons, with the remaining half interest in Davis and Palese. The Salituros appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The parties dispute the ownership of, and title to, a 160-acre tract of land in Roosevelt County, Montana (the \"Property\"). For purposes of the issues involved in this case, title to the Property is traced back to Paul Bisceglia. Paul died intestate in 1916, leaving behind his wife Louise and their five children. Under a recorded Decree of Distribution\n   issued by a district court to distribute Paul's estate, Louise received a one-third interest in the Property, and each of their five children received a two-fifteenths interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Three of the five children preceded Louise in death and died intestate with no children or spouses. Under the laws of intestate succession, their interests in the Property passed to Louise. Louise died intestate in 1965. There were no probate or intestacy proceedings commenced to distribute Louise's estate. Under the laws of intestate succession, her interests in the Property passed equally to her two surviving children: Rose Bisceglia and Angelo Bisceglia. Thus, after the death of their mother, Rose and Angelo each owned a one-half interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Rose Bisceglia married twice. She had two children from her first marriage: Josephine Palese and a son who preceded her in death. After her first husband's death, Rose married George Salituro. George Salituro and Rose had no children together. When Rose died intestate in 1987, there were no probate or intestacy proceedings commenced to distribute Rose's estate. Under the laws of intestate succession, her one-half interest in the Property passed in equal one-quarter shares to her surviving daughter-Josephine Palese-and her second husband-George Salituro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The parties to this action do not dispute that an interest in the Property passed to George Salituro upon Rose's death. The record\n   shows, however, that Angelo Bisceglia-Rose's surviving brother and intestate successor to a one-half interest in the Property through his parents, Paul and Louise-and Josephine Palese-Rose's surviving daughter and intestate successor to a one-quarter interest in the Property through Rose-did not realize that George Salituro took an interest in the Property upon Rose's death. After Rose's death, Angelo Bisceglia prepared and recorded an affidavit in the property records of Roosevelt County, Montana, accounting for the descendants of his parents. The affidavit does not mention Rose's second marriage. In 1988, Josephine Palese and her husband, along with Angelo Bisceglia and his wife, issued a deed purporting to convey the entirety of the Property to Josephine's two children-Mary Jo Davis and Anthony Palese, Jr. (\"Davis and Palese\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 From 1988 to 1997, Davis and Palese leased the Property to Tom Nelson for grazing and grain farming, placed it in the Conservation Reserve Program (\"CRP\"), and paid all of the property taxes. In 1997, they sold the Property to Mark T. Nelson and Jo Marie S. Nelson (the \"Nelsons\"), reserving \"an undivided one-half of all Grantor's right, title and interest in and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in and\n   under\" the Property. The Nelsons used the Property for grazing and enrolled the Property in CRP. Starting in 2006, the Nelsons began leasing the Property for oil and gas development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 At some point after mineral production started, a mineral developer sought confirmation of the Property's title. Upon investigation, the Nelsons' attorney discovered the overlooked one-quarter interest that vested in Rose's second husband, George Salituro. George Salituro died intestate in 1991 and no probate or intestacy proceedings were commenced to distribute his estate. Under the laws of intestate succession, his one-quarter interest in the Property passed to his two children from a prior marriage: George Salituro, Jr., and Rose Salituro (the \"Salituros\"). The Nelsons filed a quiet title action, naming George Salituro's children as defendants. Davis\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Palese also filed an answer to the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Nelsons and Davis and Palese, concluding in part that Davis and Palese had extinguished the Salituros' interest in the Property through adverse possession before transferring it to the Nelsons in 1997. The District Court quieted title in favor of the Nelsons, except for a fifty percent mineral reservation in favor of Davis and Palese.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    RN &amp; DB, LLC v.

Although the\n   District Court discussed alternative bases for its decision, we confine our analysis to the determinative question whether Davis and Palese adversely possessed the Property before conveying it to the Nelsons in 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The Salituros argue that Davis and Palese never filed an adverse possession lawsuit against the Salituros and are now barred by the statute of limitations from doing so. The Salituros argue that Davis's and Palese's adverse possession claims also fail on the merits because to extinguish the\n   interests of fellow cotenants, a cotenant not only must meet the elements of adverse possession, but also must \"oust\" fellow cotenants from the property.

Davis and Palese maintain that they ousted the Salituros and adversely possessed the Property under \u00a7 70-19-407, MCA. The Nelsons argue in the alternative that if Davis and Palese did not adversely possess the Property, then the Nelsons did. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Fitschen Bros. Commercial Co. v.

In addition, the claimant must have paid all taxes due on the property during the statutory period. Section 70-19-411, MCA. Section 70-19-407, MCA, governs adverse possession under color of title. It provides that a party may adversely possess property if he or she \"entered into the possession of the property under claim of title, exclusive of other right\" and continued in occupation and possession for\n   five years.

Two of the cotenants-Angelo Bisceglia and Josephine Palese-purported to convey the entirety of the Property to Davis and Palese, who were third\n   parties to the cotenancy. Davis and Palese recorded this deed. Davis and Palese both stated in affidavits that they believed they received the entirety of the Property in the 1988 deed. These statements are uncontradicted in the record. The Salituros presented no evidence in the District Court and do not argue on appeal that Angelo Bisceglia and Josephine Palese had actual knowledge of George Salituro's interest. And the public record in Roosevelt County included an affidavit of heirship from Angelo Bisceglia purporting to account for all Bisceglia heirs. On this record, we conclude that Davis and Palese had no actual or constructive knowledge that they were cotenants with anyone. Although the 1988 deed could not convey title to the entirety of the Property because Angelo Bisceglia and Josephine Palese did not own the Property in its entirety, the deed gave Davis and Palese color of title to the entirety of the Property because the deed purported to convey the entirety of the Property, was not void on its face, and was made in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitschen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8517619\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/76/175/\">\n    76 Mont. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8517619\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/76/175/\">\n    246 P. at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 After the 1988 deed, Davis and Palese leased the Property to Tom Nelson,\n   enrolled it in CRP, and paid all of the property taxes. These actions meet the requirements for possession and occupation of the Property under \u00a7 70-19-408, MCA. We agree with the Salituros that many of the acts upon which Davis and Palese rely to demonstrate possession and occupation would be consistent with holding an interest in a cotenancy if Davis and Palese's entry were not hostile. But because they entered under a recorded deed that purported to convey to them the entirety of the Property, Davis and Palese's initial entry of the Property was \"obviously consistent with the disclaimer and disavowal of other tenants' interests.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitschen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8517619\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/76/175/\">\n    76 Mont. at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8517619\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/76/175/\">\n    246 P. at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Their entry under color of title constitutes ouster. Five years after the 1988 lease, Davis's and Palese's claims to the Property in its entirety ripened into good title. When Davis and Palese conveyed the Property to the Nelsons in 1997, the Salituros' interests in the Property already had been extinguished. The District Court correctly quieted titled to the Property in favor of the Nelsons, except for and subject to Davis and Palese's combined fifty percent mineral reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 The District Court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DIRK M.
