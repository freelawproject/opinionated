Lee made a U-turn and stopped Zimmerman\n   for speeding. Once Lee observed several indicators of intoxication after asking for Zimmerman's license, registration, and proof of insurance, the traffic stop ripened into a DUI investigation. Lee's report and testimony stated: Zimmerman's breath smelled of alcohol; his eyes were \"pie-eyed,\" bloodshot, and watery; his movement was slow and labored; and his speech was slurred. Lee asked Zimmerman to perform standardized field sobriety tests, which Lee concluded indicated that Zimmerman was intoxicated. Lee cited Zimmerman for speeding and arrested him on suspicion of DUI. Zimmerman refused a preliminary breath test at the scene, but he later consented to a blood test. The blood test indicated Zimmerman had a 0.088 blood alcohol content (\"BAC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 On June 17, 2015, the State charged Zimmerman with DUI, fourth or subsequent offense, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(1)(a), MCA. On June 16, 2016, the State filed a Second Amended Information, charging Zimmerman with: Count I-Aggravated DUI, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-465(1)(e), MCA ; or, in the alternative, Count II-Aggravated DUI per se (0.08 or higher BAC), a felony, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-465(1)(e), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 On November 17, 2015, Zimmerman moved for discovery of Lee's other police reports, and the District Court ordered the State to make available Lee's reports that involved DUI arrests and investigations for six months before and six months after Zimmerman's June 15, 2015 arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 On December 23, 2015, Zimmerman filed a motion to suppress field sobriety tests based on newly discovered evidence in twenty-nine DUI reports generated by Lee between January 18, 2015, and December 5, 2015. Zimmerman argued that Lee's reports, which provided the basis for particularized suspicion for all his DUI investigations, contained nearly identical language, including the same typographical errors. Zimmerman asserted these indistinguishable reports called into question whether Lee made accurate individualized reports of his traffic stops and whether he possessed sufficient particularized suspicion to investigate Zimmerman for DUI in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 At the suppression hearing on February 9, 2016, Lee explained his report-writing process in which he cuts and pastes previous reports and amends the reports while reviewing the video of the stop, deleting irrelevant information, and adding observations cued from the video and his memory. Lee testified his reports contain nearly identical language because DUI investigations themselves are similar in both indications of DUI and the process of the stop. He denied fabricating\n   any observations, insisted the report regarding Zimmerman was accurate, and stated that his cut-and-paste report-writing technique saves time. Lee acknowledged making a mistake in a previous DUI report in which he reported the suspect's Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (\"VGN\") test indicated the suspect was intoxicated, but video evidence showed Lee did not even administer the VGN test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The District Court denied Zimmerman's motions to suppress. Addressing Zimmerman's assertion that Lee's cut-and-paste method of preparing reports indicated he falsely created the report regarding Zimmerman, the District Court reasoned that \"to accept Zimmerman's argument, the Court must conclude that Lee is not credible.\" The District Court concluded that Lee had sufficient particularized suspicion to investigate Zimmerman for DUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 On June 22, 2016, Zimmerman filed a motion in limine pursuant to M. R. Evid. 403, requesting exclusion of his prior DUI convictions, which were the predicate offenses to the charge of Aggravated DUI. On the first day of trial the parties argued the motion in limine and jury instructions related to the prior DUI evidence. Zimmerman argued that if the jury heard evidence of his prior DUI convictions, the prejudice would be insurmountable. Zimmerman offered to stipulate to and requested the District Court take judicial notice of the prior DUI convictions to mitigate this prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State argued that Zimmerman's prior DUI convictions were admissible because the convictions were an element of Aggravated DUI pursuant to\n   \u00a7 61-8-465(1), MCA, which the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The District Court denied Zimmerman's motion in limine and allowed the State to use evidence of Zimmerman's prior DUI convictions, stating: \"That's exactly the nature of the [Aggravated DUI] offense, someone who has engaged in repeat behavior violating the DUI laws. And so it seems like everything is on the table under that scenario.... The State is entitled to show those elements in full.\" The District Court read the jury a limiting instruction that stated, in part: \"That evidence [of prior DUI convictions] was not admitted to prove the character of [the Defendant] or to show he acted in conformity with that character.\" The jury returned a guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The District Court sentenced Zimmerman to the Montana Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") for thirteen months followed by a four-year DOC-suspended sentence with conditions. Zimmerman timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The District Court was within its discretion to reject this challenge for purposes of the motion to suppress. However, when granting the State's motion in limine, the District Court's conclusion that Zimmerman's challenge to Lee's credibility was inadmissible because the challenge was being made with extrinsic evidence failed to acknowledge the pertinent exception of M.

Further, the District Court made a factual finding that, because Lee's reports resulted in the other suspects being found guilty of DUI, the evidence of Lee's prior DUI reports were not relevant, and precluded under M.

Meyer filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence of any prior convictions under M. R.

At the trial court, Meyer argued that his prior DUI offenses were not an element of the crime of Aggravated DUI, but were relevant only as a \"penalty provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. Meyer offered to stipulate to his prior DUI convictions for \"sentencing purposes\" if the jury did not hear about them.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The justice court rejected this argument, holding that conviction of a prior DUI is an element of the charge of Aggravated DUI, which the State had the burden to prove at trial.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. The district court, conducting appellate review of the justice court's ruling, agreed, holding that \"Meyer's offer to stipulate to the prior convictions at sentencing failed to address the issue that the Aggravated DUI statute requires the jury to find that there were prior DUI convictions in order to convict Meyer of the charged offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 34 We affirmed. While noting that admission of Meyer's prior DUIs was undoubtedly prejudicial, we held that it was not erroneously admitted because \"[p]roof of the prior DUI was required as an element of the offense of Aggravated DUI. Indeed, the evidence contributed to the conviction because it established a statutory element required for a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 35 The State relies exclusively on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   in support of its contention that evidence of Zimmerman's prior DUIs was properly admitted to establish a necessary element of the charge of Aggravated DUI. However,\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case in one critical respect. Although at the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   argued similar evidentiary bases for exclusion of his prior DUI convictions, they were framed within the context of the prior DUI convictions being \"relevant only as a 'penalty provision' [that] did not need to be proven at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. Thus, dispositive to our ruling on appeal was whether \"Meyer's offer to stipulate to the prior convictions at sentencing failed\n   to address the issue that the Aggravated DUI statute requires the jury to find that there were prior DUI convictions in order to convict Meyer of the charged offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8 (emphasis added). We affirmed on that basis.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 36 Unlike Meyer, Zimmerman did not offer to stipulate to his prior DUI offenses merely for sentencing purposes. Zimmerman acknowledged that his prior DUI convictions were an element of the crime. However, in order to mitigate the unquestionable prejudice of this evidence, Zimmerman offered to stipulate to his prior convictions\n   <em>\n    as an element of the offense\n   </em>\n   , to obviate the need to introduce this evidence. Relevant evidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" M. R. Evid. 401. While there is no question that the fact of Zimmerman's prior convictions was of consequence to determining whether he was guilty of Aggravated DUI, the existence of that fact was uncontested. With the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of the prior DUIs being stipulated to, the\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   of the prior DUIs would not tend to make the existence of that fact any more or less probable. Zimmerman proposed to the District Court that the jury receive the standard DUI instruction, and he would \"stipulate to the fact that he has a prior DUI conviction under [the Aggravated DUI] statute.\" Thus, Zimmerman's stipulation would have established this necessary element of Aggravated DUI without incurring the prejudice of the jury being advised of the prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 37 In opposing Zimmerman's offer to stipulate to the predicate offenses, the State argued at trial that one of the purposes of the Aggravated DUI statute is to allow the jury to use the prior DUI offenses \"for other purposes than just to satisfy an element.\" Specifically, the State argued that one reason\n   that the Legislature made prior offenses an element of the crime, was \"so that the jury understood that this is a person who is familiar with the process and is still doing it.\" The District Court agreed, noting that when \"someone who has engaged in repeat behavior violating the DUI laws ... it seems like everything is on the table under that scenario.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 38 Under the Aggravated DUI statute, a defendant is subject to increased minimum and maximum penalties when he or she is convicted of one of the underlying DUI statutes, and there is also present one of several different aggravating factors. Section 61-8-465(1)(a)-(e), (2)(a)-(b), MCA. Although a prior DUI conviction is indeed one of these aggravating factors, other aggravating factors are\n   not dependent at all on the defendant having been previously convicted of a DUI. For example, a defendant who has never been charged with, much less convicted of, a prior DUI may nevertheless be convicted of Aggravated DUI if the defendant's BAC at the time of the present offense is at or above 0.16%. Section 61-8-465(1)(a), MCA. A defendant who refuses a breath test under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, may be convicted of Aggravated DUI if he or she had refused a breath test in the previous ten years, whether or not he or she had ever been convicted of a prior DUI. Section 61-8-465(1)(d), MCA. Although these aggravating factors are elements of the offense of Aggravated DUI that must be proven in order to subject the defendant to the increased penalties of this crime, they do not abrogate a defendant's right to be tried on the merits of the charge for which he is being prosecuted, without injecting undue prejudice into the proceedings if that prejudice can be avoided. In this case, the prejudice could have been avoided by means of Zimmerman's stipulation. The District Court thus erred when it denied Zimmerman's motion in limine, and allowed the evidence of his prior DUI convictions to be presented to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 39 The District Court did not err by denying Zimmerman's motion to suppress. The District Court abused its discretion by granting the\n   State's motion in limine regarding the use of the arresting officer's other police reports and by denying Zimmerman's motion in limine regarding the introduction into evidence of his prior DUI convictions.
