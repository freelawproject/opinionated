Young's work related injuries that formed the basis for her workers' compensation claim occurred prior to the effective date of the new Administrative Workers' Compensation Act (AWCA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We were clear in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   that the retaliation statute under the AWCA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     does not apply to conduct relating\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to other workers' compensation statutes.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346192\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/404/829/\">\n    2017 OK 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346192\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/404/829/\">\n    404 P.3d at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even though Young's employment termination occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the effective date of the AWCA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   her claim for retaliatory discharge related back to the injury date giving rise to her workers' compensation claim. We held that Young's retaliatory discharge action was governed by the statute in effect on the date of her injury,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    85 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 341.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b64 Hopson, the plaintiff/appellant in the instant appeal, sustained work related injuries and sought workers' compensation benefits prior to the effective date of the AWCA. He was terminated after the effective date of the AWCA. As in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , the employer urged that the AWCA governed the resolution of the retaliatory discharge claim as Hopson's discharge occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the AWCA became effective. We rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , and made clear that the retaliatory discharge claim relates back to the date of the injury giving rise to the original workers' compensation claim. We hold that Hopson's retaliatory discharge claim is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    85 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 341, the statute in effect at the time of the injuries giving rise to his workers' compensation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b65 We further deny Appellee's motion to dismiss appeal. Appellee relied on\n   <em>\n    Buckley v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1927%20OK%20191\">\n    1927 OK 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6409375\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla/126/20/\">\n    126 Okla. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8742879\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla-crim/37/302/\">\n    257 P. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and urged that Hopson abandoned his appeal when he filed an action before the AWCA for retaliatory discharge after initiating this appeal. Appellee's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. After Buckley initiated his appeal, he filed an identical action in federal district court and then asked this Court to (1) strike his appeal from hearing and (2) requested his appeal remain pending awaiting the final termination of his federal court action. Buckley specifically asked this Court to delay our decision pending action by the federal court. Under such circumstances, we held that Buckley abandoned his appeal before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b66\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   is inapposite to the facts of this instant appeal. Hopson has made clear that he is seeking resolution from this Court. The district court issued an order dismissing his action for retaliatory discharge ruling that the trial court lacked jurisdiction and his claims were covered by the retaliatory discharge statute under the AWCA and must be filed in that venue. Hopson filed this appeal as he believed his claims for retaliatory discharge were governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    85 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 341, the statute in effect at the time of his injury. However, being mindful of the one year statute of limitations under the AWCA for retaliatory discharge, Hopson filed a claim in that venue to preserve any possible claim. Hopson has not sought a trial before the Commission; he has remained active in his appeal and continued to request this Court to rule on his appeal. On October 12, 2017, he filed a pleading, Appellant's Advice of Ruling, asking to supplement the record and note the holding in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   that the district court has jurisdiction over this claim and not the AWCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b67 We find that the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss, and that Hopson has standing to pursue his retaliatory discharge claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b68 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the district court's order of dismissal is vacated, and the cause remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DONE BY ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT IN CONFERENCE THIS 23rd day of April, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ALL JUSTICES CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    85A O.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1 -125.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    85A O.S.
