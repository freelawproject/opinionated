He was sentenced to nineteen-and-one-half years in prison-nine years for each of the manufacturing counts, and eighteen months for possession-less time served. Defendant raises numerous issues on appeal, which we summarize as follows: (1) his conviction for possession must be vacated to avoid violation of his right to be free from double jeopardy; (2) multiple evidentiary errors deprived him of a fair trial; (3) his convictions for manufacturing child pornography are unconstitutional because the Legislature lacks a rational basis for criminalizing his particular alleged conduct (recording a sex act with a consenting sixteen-year-old girl) where the same conduct with an eighteen-year-old would not be a crime; and (4) there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. We disagree with Defendant and affirm his convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} In January 2013 Defendant, at the time thirty-five years old, was living in a one-bedroom trailer with his then-sixteen-year-old stepdaughter (Stepdaughter), whose mother had passed away in September 2012. Defendant allowed a sixteen-year-old friend (Friend) of Stepdaughter who had run away from home to stay with them. Stepdaughter slept on the pullout couch in the living room, while Defendant and Friend slept in the only bedroom. One night, Stepdaughter observed what she believed was Friend performing oral sex on Defendant in the trailer's bedroom and, after confronting Friend, reported the incident to an adult and later spoke with law enforcement. Stepdaughter reported to law enforcement that Friend and Defendant were \"having a sexual affair\" and that she\n   had seen \"naked pictures of unknown girls [of unknown age] on Defendant's cell phone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Law enforcement conducted a search of Defendant's residence, seized Defendant's phone, and downloaded three videos depicting Friend engaged in sexual acts. Defendant was initially charged with one count of sexual exploitation of children (possession) contrary to NMSA 1978, Section 30-6A-3(A) (2007, amended 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After law enforcement officers further investigated the matter and obtained evidence indicating that Defendant was the male participant in what the officers believed were self-recorded videos where Defendant was engaged in sexual acts with Friend, Defendant was additionally charged with two counts of sexual exploitation of children (manufacturing) in violation of Section 30-6A-3(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant denied both having a sexual relationship with Friend and that he was the male participant in the video. At trial, the central issue to be decided was the identity of the male participant in the videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} The State's first witness was Stepdaughter, whose testimony primarily established (1) when and why Friend had come to live with Stepdaughter and Defendant, (2) where Friend slept in the trailer, and (3) what prompted Stepdaughter to make a report concerning Friend and Defendant to authorities. Additionally, after the district court denied Defendant's motion in limine to exclude testimony by Stepdaughter regarding her observation of a prior sexual encounter between Defendant and Friend, Stepdaughter was allowed to testify that she once observed Friend performing oral sex on Defendant in the bedroom of the trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} The State next called Friend, who testified that she was the female in the videos and that Defendant was the male. Friend admitted that she had previously stated that the male in the video was someone other than Defendant, but at trial she testified that her prior statement was a lie. Friend stated that she was aware that the video was being made and that Defendant was the person taking the video using his own cellular phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {6} Deputy Victor Hernandez of the Lea County Sheriff's Department described the investigation that followed Stepdaughter's report. He testified that when he went to Defendant's home to investigate and questioned Defendant, Defendant denied having sexual intercourse with Friend and told Deputy Hernandez that Friend slept on the couch. Deputy Hernandez's testimony also laid the foundation for the admission of State's Exhibit 1-the videos downloaded from Defendant's phone, which Deputy Hernandez seized during his investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {7} Detective Mark Munro of the Hobbs, New Mexico Police Department testified regarding the videos themselves and how he came to suspect that Defendant was both the male participant in the videos and the person who manufactured the videos. He explained that \"the angle and the manner [in] which [the video] was recorded was consistent with a participant recording the video.\" He testified that while only the face of the female in the videos was \"readily apparent,\" the abdomen and genitals of the male participant were visible and contained what Detective Munro described as \"a consistent abnormality to the abdomen, ... some sort of a scar or possibly a tattoo\" in each of the videos. He then explained that as part of his investigation he reviewed photographs of Defendant's unclothed torso that were taken by Deputy Hernandez and watched the videos again, comparing the images in the video of the male participant's abdominal area to the photographs of Defendant. Because Friend, who initially told law enforcement that Defendant was the male in the videos, changed her story and identified another person as the\n   male participant, Detective Munro also personally examined and photographed the torso of the other suspect in order to compare it to the videos. Detective Munro explained that he \"freeze frame[d] and pull[ed] ... screenshot[s]\" from the videos in order to be able to compare the images in the videos with the photographs of Defendant and the other suspect. Based on his comparison of the videos-including the screenshot images-and the photographs, Detective Munro believed that the photograph of Defendant was \"consistent\" with the person that he saw in the video and that the other suspect was not the person in the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {8} The district court admitted, and the State published to the jury, the videos in their entirety, the photographs of Defendant's and the other suspect's respective torsos, and the screenshot images taken from the three videos showing the male participant's abdominal area. The jury found Defendant guilty on all counts, and Defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

On the first manufacturing charge (Count 2), the jury was instructed that the essential elements it had to find included that Defendant (1) manufactured (2) child pornography (3)\n   <em>\n    on or about January 26, 2013\n   </em>\n   . On the second manufacturing charge (Count 3), the jury was instructed that it had to find that Defendant (1) manufactured (2) child pornography (3)\n   <em>\n    on or about January 18, 2013\n   </em>\n   . And on the possession charge (Count 1), the jury was instructed that it had to find Defendant (1) had child pornography (2) in his possession (3)\n   <em>\n    on or about January 28, 2013\n   </em>\n   . On their faces, these instructions required the State to prove different elements-and thus different facts-based on the charges stemming from acts on three different dates: manufacturing on January 18, manufacturing on January 26, and possession on January 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, Defendant does not contend that the jury relied on the same evidence to convict Defendant of possession and manufacturing, nor, as we next explain, would such a contention be availing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.

Detective Munro testified regarding the videos recovered from Defendant's phone that (1) the video titled \"video 005\"-which formed the basis for Count 2-had a \"creation date\" of January 26, 2013; and (2) the video titled \"video 006\"-which formed the basis for Count 3-had a \"creation date\" of January 18, 2013. This evidence alone was sufficient to support each of the distinct elements contained in Counts 2 and 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {15} Regarding the possession charge-which was based not on any particular video but rather on what the State describes as Defendant's \"possession of a collection of child pornography\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the State presented altogether different evidence to establish the elements of possession than that used to support the manufacturing charges. Deputy Hernandez testified that he executed a search warrant at Defendant's home on January 28, 2013, during which he seized Defendant's phone. He further testified that three videos were downloaded from the phone, meaning that it could be reasonably inferred that the videos existed on the phone-and thus were in Defendant's possession-on or about January 28 when the phone was seized\n   from Defendant. Detective Munro, in addition to testifying that the videos had been created at an earlier point in time (i.e., on January 18 and 26, 2013), testified that two of the videos-those titled \"us\" and \"video005\"-had been \"duplicated,\" meaning that a second copy of each video had been saved on the phone. Furthermore, all of the videos that were downloaded from the phone seized on January 28, 2013, were published to the jury; those videos showed Friend engaged in a prohibited sexual act (to wit, sexual intercourse).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-6A-2(A)(1) (defining \"prohibited sexual act\" as including, among other acts, \"sexual intercourse\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {16} From this, the jury could independently infer that Defendant completed a separate act-possession of child pornography-that was sufficiently distinct from the previously completed acts of manufacturing because the acts of manufacturing and possession were separated not only in time but also by the intervening event of the duplication of the videos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243113\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/706/\">\n    2009-NMCA-024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243113\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/706/\">\n    204 P.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Contreras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668540\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/141/434/\">\n    2007-NMCA-045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668540\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/141/434/\">\n    156 P.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting a double jeopardy challenge to convictions for possessing and trafficking cocaine where the state had \"provided the jury with sufficient factual bases for finding that [the d]efendant possessed the cocaine both before and after he sold some if it[,]\" and holding that the conduct supporting possession and trafficking was not unitary).

Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Contreras\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that \"it is extremely unlikely that the jury based its verdict on a theory that [the d]efendant only possessed\" the videos at the time he manufactured them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668540\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/141/434/\">\n    2007-NMCA-045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668540\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/141/434/\">\n    156 P.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, he contends that the district court erred in admitting: (1) Stepdaughter's testimony that she had witnessed a prior sexual encounter between Defendant and Friend; (2) Detective Munro's opinion testimony-including his comparison of photographs of Defendant's torso with screenshot images from the videos-regarding his belief that Defendant was the male participant in the videos; and (3) Deputy Hernandez's statements indicating there was another \"victim\" in the case. We address each of Defendant's claimed evidentiary errors in turn and conclude that even assuming error occurred, it was harmless, not cumulative, and does not require reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Stepdaughter's Testimony Regarding Defendant's and Friend's Prior Sexual Encounter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {19} Defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude Stepdaughter's testimony \"concerning what she perceived as sexual activity between [D]efendant and [Friend]\" on a prior occasion. The district court denied the motion, and Stepdaughter was allowed to testify as follows. On one occasion, Stepdaughter saw Friend \"moving up and down\" in the bedroom around ten o'clock at night and that Defendant, who was also in the bedroom, had his pajama pants pulled down \"more than they should've been.\" Based on that observation, she confronted Friend about whether Friend was having a sexual relationship with Defendant. Stepdaughter thereafter reported to an adult her \"concerns about [Friend] ... and things\n   going on at [the] house\" and spoke with law enforcement a few days after making her initial report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {20} Defendant argues that under Rule 11-404(B) NMRA, Stepdaughter's testimony about a prior sexual contact between Friend and Defendant should not have been admitted because it was offered for the prohibited purpose of showing that because Defendant \"had relations with [Friend] on one day, he was more likely to act in conformity on the day the video was made[,]\" and because its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The primary evidence supporting Defendant's conviction for possession of child pornography came from (1) Deputy Hernandez's testimony regarding seizing Defendant's phone, which contained the videos, from Defendant's residence on January 28, 2012, and (2) the videos themselves, which contained child pornography. From the State's closing argument, it is clear that the State attributed little, if any, importance to Stepdaughter's challenged testimony. On numerous occasions, the State emphasized the aforementioned unchallenged pieces of evidence as being what supported the charges against Defendant. On only one occasion did the State, in passing, refer to Stepdaughter's statement that Stepdaughter once saw \"something going on in the bedroom.\" In fact, it was defense counsel who, during closing, repeatedly reminded the jury of the evidence he sought to exclude when he first stated, \"[Stepdaughter] is so outraged because she sees a head bobbing up and down that she feels compelled to report it[,]\" and later reiterated, \"[Stepdaughter] said the reason she was outraged is because she could see a fully-dressed young lady with her head going up and down, and that's the reason [Stepdaughter] was propelled out into reporting this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {24} In the context of all of the evidence presented at trial, we cannot say that there is a reasonable probability that Stepdaughter's testimony describing her observation of a sexual encounter between Friend and Defendant contributed to any of Defendant's convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46 (explaining that \"because an error may be prejudicial with respect to one conviction, but harmless with respect to another, courts must separately assess the effect the error may have had on each of the defendant's convictions\").

Detective Munro's and Deputy Hernandez's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {25} Defendant alleges three evidentiary errors related to the testimony of Detective Munro and Deputy Hernandez. First, Defendant contends that the district court erred in allowing Detective Munro to engage in \"image-to-image comparison\" and \"digital manipulation\" of the photographs of Defendant's torso and the screenshot images that Detective Munro made from the videos without first qualifying Detective Munro as an expert. Next, Defendant alternatively argues that Detective Munro's testimony-if deemed lay opinion-was inadmissible because it was not \"helpful to a factual issue in dispute.\" Finally, regarding Deputy Hernandez's testimony, Defendant argues that Deputy Hernandez's \"repeated references to a 'second victim' result[ed] in undue prejudice.\" Because the parties dispute whether certain of these challenges were preserved, we begin by identifying the applicable standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {26} Defendant concedes that he failed to preserve his challenge to Deputy Hernandez's testimony, as well as his challenge to the admission of Detective Munro's testimony adjusting the screenshot images and comparing those images to the photograph of Defendant's torso as lay opinion.

With regard to the admission of alleged improper expert testimony by Detective Munro, while not clear, Defendant appears to suggest that he preserved his challenge to the admission of that testimony; however, his failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 12-318(A)(4) NMRA renders his argument waived.

Moreover, Defendant does nothing more than describe three instances during trial when defense counsel objected during Detective Munro's testimony. Critically, Defendant wholly fails to establish that the grounds for those objections-one of which Defendant concedes was, in fact, \"inaudible\"-are the same that provide the basis for his challenges on appeal.

Detective Munro did so by first describing the personal observations he made from watching the videos. He testified that while only the face of the female in the videos was \"readily apparent,\" the abdomen and genitals of the male participant were visible and contained what Detective Munro described as a \"consistent abnormality to the abdomen, ... some sort of scar or possibly a tattoo\" in each of the videos. He then explained that he reviewed photographs of Defendant's unclothed torso that were taken by a fellow investigating officer and watched the videos again, comparing the images in the video of the male participant's abdominal area to the photographs of Defendant. The State published the photographs taken of Defendant's abdominal area, which, Detective Munro testified, showed a \"vertical scar that goes above and below the belly button\" that was similar to what Detective Munro observed on the videos. At that point in Detective Munro's testimony, the State published Exhibit 1-containing the three videos-to the jury and asked that Detective Munro be allowed to play the videos for the jury. One by one, the jury was shown each of the three videos. After each video was played, Detective Munro explained that he made screenshots-also described as \"freeze frames\"-from the video, displayed the screenshot, then pointed to the area on the screenshot showing the same \"indentation\" or \"abnormality\" that Detective Munro had pointed out to the jury in\n   the photographs of Defendant. While publishing the screenshot images to the jury, Detective Munro noted that the images as projected in the courtroom were \"a little dark\" and offered to \"lighten [the] image if it could assist.\" As he was making the in-court adjustments to the laptop display settings, Detective Munro explained that \"without altering the actual intent of it, I can adjust the brightness level and increase the contrast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {29} Defendant describes these adjustments as \"digital manipulation\" and \"digital alteration.\" Citing a Connecticut case,\n   <em>\n    State v.

According to Defendant, Detective Munro's testimony included the presentation of \"altered photographs,\" but that is simply not what the record indicates. The record is clear (1) that Detective Munro's screenshots were nothing more than \"freeze frames,\" i.e., images depicting single frames from the video akin to pausing the video at a particular moment, and (2) that Detective Munro did nothing more than alter the \"brightness\" setting on the laptop to control the outward projection of the image. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Swinton\n   </em>\n   , where the witness's testimony included an in-court demonstration of how he used special software to manipulate the bite-mark photograph,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20921\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20921\">\n    at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , i.e., there was no doubt that the photographs themselves were altered before being presented to the jury, here, there is no evidence that any of the images presented to the jury had been modified in any way. As noted previously, Detective Munro even stated that the in-court adjustments he was making were done \"without altering the actual intent.\" We have little difficulty concluding that the screenshots and Detective Munro's testimony were simply a means of\n   <em>\n    presenting\n   </em>\n   evidence to the jury rather than the creation of new evidence that would necessitate qualification as expert opinion.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20921\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20921\">\n    at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, they did not constitute expert testimony, and we hold that there was no error in not qualifying Detective Munro as an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {32} Defendant next argues that Detective Munro's testimony identifying Defendant as the male in the videos was improper lay opinion because \"the jury could watch the video[s] for itself,\" meaning that Detective Munro's testimony was not \"helpful to [determining] a factual issue in dispute\"-i.e., the identity of the male participant-as required by Rule 11-701 NMRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 11-701(B) (providing that \"testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to one that is ... helpful ... to determining a fact in issue\").

This Court concluded otherwise, adopting for purposes of analysis the five-factor approach \"deemed relevant to a determination of whether a lay witness is more likely than the jury to identify the defendant correctly\" that was articulated in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Relevant to the\n   <em>\n    Sweat\n   </em>\n   Court's analysis was, among others, the fifth factor: \"the degree of clarity of the surveillance recording and the quality and completeness of the subject's depiction in the recording.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Sweat\n   </em>\n   , this Court considered that the defendant \"himself describe[d] the quality of the surveillance video as 'grainy' and 'of poor quality' \" in reaching its conclusion that the detective's testimony regarding the identity of the person in the surveillance video was admissible because it was helpful to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Likewise, here, Defendant describes the videos in question as \"dark and grainy\" and asserts that \"scarring or other details in the video are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   clear ... when viewed on a computer monitor.\" Thus, we conclude that Detective Munro's testimony was admissible under Rule 11-701 because it would have been \"helpful ... to determining a fact in issue[,]\" i.e., the identity of the male participant in the videos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Defense counsel objected, arguing that the State had not laid a sufficient foundation for the admission of the CD because it had not been established whether Deputy Hernandez was the \"police officer [that created the CD] or not.\" During defense counsel's ensuing voir dire of Deputy Hernandez, defense counsel elicited from Deputy Hernandez that the videos were taken off the cell phone using Cellebrite,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Deputy Hernandez was not the person who downloaded the videos onto the CD. Based on this, defense counsel again objected to the CD's admission, arguing that the State had not established chain of custody. Even after the State established that Deputy Hernandez was present when the CD was created, took possession of the CD after it was created, and could confirm that the data on the CD was identical to that on the cell phone, defense counsel continued to object to the CD's admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {36} Defense counsel was allowed to continue his voir dire, during which he questioned\n   Deputy Hernandez about the serial numbers of the seized cell phones that Deputy Hernandez had recorded on the search warrant inventory. Defense counsel then questioned Deputy Hernandez about information contained on the Cellebrite-generated report, which contained numbers identifying each of the cell phones that had been seized, and attempted to show that the serial numbers documented in the search warrant inventory did not match the numbers contained in the Cellebrite report. Deputy Hernandez, after comparing the documents, confirmed that the numbers on the two documents did not match. Defense counsel, seizing upon what he perceived as a fatal discrepancy, then challenged Deputy Hernandez to explain how the court could admit \"evidence of a cell phone that wasn't seized.\" Deputy Hernandez responded by pointing out to defense counsel that the Cellebrite report in question \"has nothing to do with [Friend]\" but rather contained the name of a different person, whom Deputy Hernandez referred to as \"also a victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {37} Upon hearing Deputy Hernandez refer to another \"victim,\" the district court immediately called a bench conference, asked counsel if the current line of questioning should occur outside the presence of the jury, and excused the jury. The district court, attempting to clarify matters, asked counsel if the discrepancy in the numbers was attributable to there being separate evidence related to another victim. The prosecutor answered \"no\" and explained that the numbers did not match because the Cellebrite report contained the phones' model numbers, not serial numbers. After a short recess, defense counsel indicated he had no further voir dire and agreed to allow the State to proceed with its direct examination of Deputy Hernandez. The State then laid a foundation for the admission of and again moved to admit Exhibit 1, which the district court then admitted over no objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {38} In light of the context of Deputy Hernandez's testimony, we conclude that it was not plain error to admit Deputy Hernandez's passing mention of another \"victim.\" As Defendant himself describes it, what he complains of is \"essentially a spontaneous statement\"-one that the record indicates Deputy Hernandez inadvertently made as he explained counsel's misinterpretation of documents on which the State relied for the admission of key evidence. While it may have been error to allow Deputy Hernandez to testify as he did, and while such error could be deemed plain as evidenced by the district court's immediate reaction to the testimony, we are unconvinced that admission of the testimony \"constituted an injustice that creates grave doubts concerning the validity of the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002350\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/144/775/\">\n    2008-NMCA-117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002350\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/144/775/\">\n    192 P.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

However, for purposes of the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 30-6A-1 to -4 (1984, as amended through 2016), a \"child\" is considered to be anyone \"under eighteen years of age.\" Section 30-6A-3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    While Defendant was convicted of two separate manufacturing counts under Section 30-6A-3(D) -one for each of two videos containing child pornography that the jury concluded Defendant manufactured-he does not challenge those convictions as violating the Double Jeopardy Clause under our \"unit of prosecution\" cases. He only challenges his conviction under Section 30-6A-3(A) for possession of child pornography as being duplicative of one of the two manufacturing counts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    We note that Defendant's double jeopardy argument relies on an outdated criminal information-the third amended criminal information filed in January 2014 rather than the\n    <em>\n     corrected\n    </em>\n    third amended criminal information filed in May 2014-that did not contain these distinct dates but instead identified January 28, 2013, as the date on which all alleged prohibited conduct occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The State originally relied on the video titled \"us\" to form the basis for the possession charge. However, the final criminal information filed prior to trial removed the specific reference to video \"us\" from the possession count and based the charge on Defendant's knowing and intentional possession of \"any visual or print medium depicting\" child pornography.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    While the\n    <em>\n     Sweat\n    </em>\n    Court also considered the presence of other factors, it stated that \"[t]he existence of even one of the[ ] factors indicates that there is some basis for concluding that the witness is more likely to correctly identify the defendant from the photograph than is the jury[,]\" i.e., that the witness's testimony is admissible under Rule 11-701 because it is helpful to the jury.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 22.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Later testimony from Detective Munro clarified that Cellebrite is a \"forensic evidence recovery device\" that (1) allows for the removal of information from a cell phone onto a CD, USB, or other storage device, (2) prevents the cell phone and information contained thereon from \"being manipulated in any way\" during the removal/copying process, and (3) generates a report and a CD on which the evidence can be reviewed without risk of manipulating the cell phone.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \"[I]n order to satisfy the prejudice prong, it is necessary to show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Patterson v.

However, apparently persuaded by the State's argument regarding the distinctions between the two cases and likely owing to the fact that defense counsel neither argued that there were mitigating factors the court should consider nor asked the court to run the sentences concurrently, the district court acted within its discretion and sentenced Defendant in accordance with the State's recommendation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    We note that the Legislature, in fact, very recently amended the Criminal Sentencing Act in order to\n    <em>\n     increase\n    </em>\n    the penalties for those who are convicted of manufacturing, distributing, and/or possessing child pornography. [\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Section 31-18-15 (2007),\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Section 31-18-15 (2016) ]. Under the amended act, someone convicted of the charges against Defendant in this case would face a term of imprisonment of up to thirty-four years: twelve years for each of the manufacturing counts and ten years for possession.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 31-18-15(A)(6), (12).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
