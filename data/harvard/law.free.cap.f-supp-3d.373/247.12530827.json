COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 11 and 12, 2012, a group of Libyan militants attacked U.S. diplomatic and intelligence facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans died in the attacks, including then-United States Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens. The United States alleges, in a seventeen-count superseding indictment, that Defendant Mustafa Muhammad Mufta Al-Imam participated in the attacks. Al-Imam has moved to dismiss all but one of the counts. He contends that most of the statutes under which he is charged do not apply to conduct undertaken outside of the United States; that he cannot be prosecuted for eleven of the counts because his capture violated international law; and that six counts must be dismissed because the offenses charged apply only to legally operated federal facilities, which he says excludes the facilities here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Save for the illegal capture argument, the Court has previously considered and rejected each of Al-Imam's challenges in ruling on a motion to dismiss brought by one of his purported co-conspirators, Ahmed Abu Khatallah, who was convicted in November 2017 of three of the offenses with which Al-Imam is also charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ahmed Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   , 14-cr-141, ECF No. 547. Recognizing this obstacle to dismissal, Al-Imam urges the Court to reconsider its prior\n   analysis, particularly with respect to his extraterritorial challenge. But the Court finds no reason to depart from its conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   . It also finds Al-Imam's capture argument unavailing. Accordingly, and for the reasons that follow, the Court will deny Al-Imam's motion to dismiss with respect to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The war erupted in the Libyan coastal city of Benghazi, which was controlled by rebels and served as the base of operations for the rebel-led Transitional National Council (\"TNC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 25, 2011, the U.S. Department of State evacuated American personnel from Libya and suspended its operations at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Less than two months later, in April 2011, the State Department reestablished its presence in the country with the arrival in Benghazi of U.S. Special Envoy J.

The United States established a second Benghazi facility, this one known as the Annex, where additional U.S. personnel were based.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2012, the United States dispatched Stevens, now the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, to the Libyan capital of Tripoli.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.

After breaching the facility, the attackers set fire to several buildings, causing the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The remaining State Department personnel escaped to the Annex, which soon also came under attack, ending in mortar fire that killed Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Al-Imam was captured in Libya on or about October 29, 2017, during an operation by U.S. armed forces personnel. He was thereafter transported to the District of Columbia to stand trial. A federal grand jury on October 25, 2018 returned a seventeen-count superseding indictment. According to the indictment, the Mission and Annex attacks were carried out, at least in part, by members of the extremist group Ubaydah Ibn Al Jarrah (\"UBJ\"), whose commander was Abu Khatallah. Indictment \u00b6 9. The government alleges that Al-Imam was a close associate of Abu Khatallah and was present for, helped orchestrate, and participated in the attacks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.

That law appears to have remained in its current form since being amended as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 727(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201214\">\n    110 Stat. 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor have the parties provided concrete information on the number of U.S. officers and employees working and residing abroad, either in 1996 or today. The Government asserts (though without substantiation) that \"[t]he United States government has over one hundred thousand officers and employees stationed abroad.\" Opp. at 21. Al-Imam has not questioned this estimate. Because a purely territorial statute cannot become extraterritorial as a result of changing conditions-only a deliberate congressional choice can rebut the presumption-present-day figures matter only insofar as they indirectly reflect what conditions either obtained when a statute was passed or were understood to be likely to exist in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, the Court is satisfied that \u00a7 1114\"ha[d] many obvious extraterritorial applications\" when the law was last amended in 1996-enough to have put Congress on notice of the issue of extraterritoriality and to permit an inference under\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   that the law was intended to reach conduct undertaken outside the United States. It is widely known that then, as now, large numbers of U.S. diplomats and Foreign Service Officers, military servicemembers, members of the intelligence community, and other government personnel served the United States's interests abroad. Executive and legislative officials (and their staff) also frequently traveled-and obviously still do-outside the United States in the course of performing their official duties.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Al Kassar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843293\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/108/#p118\">\n    660 F.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (2d Cir. 2011) (\"[A] significant number of [U.S.] employees perform their duties outside U.S. territory.\"). Such U.S. employees and officials could obviously be killed while engaging in or on account of performing their official duties. Under\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , this is enough to conclude that Congress authorized extraterritorial prosecutions under \u00a7 1114. Al-Imam may well be correct that \"nothing in the statute suggests an international focus,\" MTD at 13, whereas the\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   court found the relevant statute to be \"fundamentally international ... in focus and effect,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   still allows an inference that Congress intended to authorize overseas prosecutions for crimes enacted in the wake of purely domestic incidents. Under\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , a criminal offense whose most natural or obvious applications are domestic can still be prosecuted abroad if the law had \"many obvious extraterritorial applications\" at the time of enactment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    at 1346-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Al-Imam nonetheless argues that a comparison between \u00a7 1114 and \u00a7 1116, which criminalizes the murder of internationally protected persons, reveals that Congress did not intend for \u00a7 1114 to apply extraterritorially. MTD at 12-13. Both statutes were amended in 1996; whereas \u00a7 1116 broadened the \"internationally protected person\" category to reach \"any other representative, officer, employee, or agent of\n   the United States Government,\" \u00a7 1114 remained generally worded and geographically ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. As a result, Al-Imam claims, \u00a7 1116's amendment \"would have been unnecessary if Congress had intended \u00a7 1114 to apply to the extraterritorial killing of all [U.S.] officers and employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. The Court is not persuaded.

On the other hand, a number of federal criminal statutes designed to prevent harm to the Government that would frequently occur abroad are expressly limited to domestic offenses. Congress apparently understood that\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   would otherwise apply in these instances, but for some reason chose to limit its operation. Such criminal offenses include discriminating against persons wearing the uniform of the armed forces,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; commencing or facilitating an expedition against a friendly nation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and enlisting \"to serve in armed hostility against the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202390\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore declines to demand clear statements of extraterritorial application in this case-essentially, to render\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   toothless-merely because some criminal statutes have not relied on\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   to signal their geographic reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The D.C.

The Court notes that embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic missions would seem to be fairly encompassed within \u00a7 930(g)(1)'s definition of \"Federal facility,\" as would the component structures of military bases. Such structures were no doubt similarly prevalent when \u00a7 930(c) was enacted in 1994. The Government also asserts that \"many [Federal facilities abroad] are in more dangerous areas than Federal facilities within the United States,\" which presumably alerted Congress to the likelihood of attacks on overseas facilities for\n   reasons apart from those facilities' sheer numerosity.

Accordingly, the Court joins the Southern District of New York in concluding that \u00a7 930(c) applies extraterritorially under\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , because that law had many foreseeable extraterritorial applications at the time of enactment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bin Laden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11528911\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/92/189/#p203\">\n    92 F.Supp.2d at 201-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A prohibition can have many obvious extraterritorial applications even if it is most readily and naturally deployed domestically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nor is it material that \u00a7 844(f) prohibits the damaging or destruction of \"any institution or organization receiving Federal financial assistance,\" the great majority of which are presumably located domestically. Section 844 clearly targets a vast range of destructive behavior undertaken within the territorial United States. But its independently operative provisions that protect U.S. property could foreseeably be applied abroad in a great number of situations; this must have been known when the statute was modified in 2002, as well. As a result, the Court will deny Al-Imam's motion as to Counts Fourteen and Fifteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A : Providing Material Support and Resources to Terrorists Resulting in Death (and Conspiring to Do the Same)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Count One charges Al-Imam with conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A (\"the material-support statute\"), and Count Two charges him with a substantive violation of that statute. As with each of the offenses discussed above, \u00a7 2339A does not explicitly authorize extraterritorial prosecutions. Section 2339A provides, in relevant part (with only potentially applicable predicate offenses listed below):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (a) Offense. Whoever provides material support or resources or conceals or disguises the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources, knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, a violation of section ... 844(f) ..., 930(c), ... 1114, 1116, ... [or] 1363, ... or in preparation for, or in carrying out, the concealment of an escape from the commission of any such violation, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both, and, if the death of any person results, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Section 1116 (corresponding to Count Three) explicitly authorizes extraterritorial prosecutions; the other four offenses (corresponding to Counts Four through Seventeen) do not. Al-Imam therefore moves to dismiss Counts One and Two insofar as they charge him with providing (or conspiring to provide) material support for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 844(f), 930(c), 1114, and 1363.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Al-Imam and the Government agree that \u00a7 2339A is an ancillary crime that applies extraterritorially to the extent that an associated substantive offense does. Deciding whether to dismiss an ancillary offense for lack of extraterritoriality requires no new analysis when the geographic reach of any predicate crimes has already been determined. The Court therefore incorporates by reference its earlier holdings and denies Al-Imam's motion as to Counts One and Two. The Government may continue to proceed under \u00a7 2339A insofar as it charges Al-Imam with providing (or conspiring to provide) material support\n   for a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 844(f), 930(c), 1114, or 1116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201363\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    : Maliciously Destroying or Injuring Property Within the Special Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction of the United States\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In the Court's initial motion-to-dismiss ruling in\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   , the Court reserved judgment on the extraterritorial application of \u00a7 1363 issue and ordered supplemental briefing.

Rather, Al-Imam contends that \u00a7 1363 defines a single property crime concerned with buildings or property within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction.

The government recognizes as much. The crime with which Al-Imam is charged, therefore, has the following elements: (1) willfully and maliciously destroying or injuring any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property, or attempting or conspiring to do such an act, (2) within the SMTJ, (3) where the destroyed or injured building is a dwelling or where the act results in the life of any person being placed in jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court finds that the government is not legally precluded from presenting evidence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9) in support of the second element.

Prosecution under \u00a7 1363-for an offense \"committed ... against a national of the United States\"-is therefore appropriate where the government alleges and seeks to prove that, in the course of maliciously destroying and injuring dwellings and property within the SMTJ, a defendant placed the lives of U.S. nationals in danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Al-Imam's objections on this point are unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his view, he has not been charged with committing a crime against a U.S. national-or any person, for that matter-because \u00a7 1363 simply defines a property crime that can be committed only ..., if there has been damage, or the intent to damage, a building,\" and which has the \"unambiguous statutory purpose\" of protecting \"[b]uildings or property within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction.\" Def's Suppl.

Yet the government has charged Al-Imam with a crime that includes as one of its elements the endangerment of human life and that carries a maximum penalty fifteen years greater than when no life is placed in jeopardy. That crime is most assuredly concerned with protecting people, not just buildings or property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In addition, Al-Imam claims, \"[p]lacing a life in jeopardy is not an offense against a person under federal law. The word 'offense' necessarily means a chargeable offense under U.S. federal law; if an 'offense' against a U.S. national could be any conceivable offense-criminal or otherwise- \u00a7 7(9) would be rendered meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Al-Imam is surely correct that the word \"offense\" refers to a chargeable offense under U.S. federal law, and that an \"offense against a national of the United States\" cannot mean any conceivable offense.

Any argument to the contrary appears foreclosed by the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   . There, the court acknowledged the \"differences\" between the case before it and\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , including the nationality of the defendants, but concluded that they \"do not lessen\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's force as applied to this case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Al-Imam seems to suggest that it was permissible for\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   to use\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   as persuasive authority despite the citizenship distinction because\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   \"involved a prohibition on importing immigrants that is patently concerned with foreign conduct,\" but that it would be improper for the Court to rely on\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   here because the statutes at issue are not so obviously focused on foreign conduct. Reply at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD at 9 (contending the citizenship issue mattered less because the court was \"interpreting [a] clearly-internationally-focused statute\"). But whether\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's reasoning can be applied to cases involving different types of harm is a separate question from whether it can be applied to cases involving foreign nationals.\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   made this abundantly clear. There, the court identified\n   <em>\n    two separate\n   </em>\n   distinctions from\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   : that it involved (1) \"aliens\" (as opposed to American citizens) and (2) \"immigration offenses\" (as opposed to fraud offenses).\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Reply at 5. The Court therefore concludes, consistently with the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , that the citizenship distinction does little to lessen\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's applicability to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   To the extent Al-Imam contends that\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   misapplied\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   by giving too little weight to the defendant's citizenship, that is an argument for the Circuit, not this Court. Nevertheless, his\n   critique strikes the Court as misguided. As Al-Imam admits, the\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   Court's use of the word \"especially\" with regard to the American defendants does not necessarily indicate an intent to limit its extraterritoriality reasoning to American citizens.

His basic contention is that\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's discussion of\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   must be viewed in light of how the former treated the latter, which was as additional support\n   for its conclusion, rather than as its decisional framework.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"[T]he court in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   was not applying\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   as a precedential framework....\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"both contextual and textual evidence\" show that statute \"applies extraterritorially\" before reaching\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , which \"supports the validity of this inference\"). Because the D.C. Circuit merely \"cite[d]\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   as support for its ultimate conclusion that the statute at issue applied extraterritorially,\" Al-Imam contends it \"had no reason to formulate a\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   'test,' or even pay close attention to the distinction in its language between 'probable' applications abroad and 'many' such applications.\" MTD at 9. As a consequence, Al-Imam says the Court in\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   mistakenly substituted\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's \"many obvious extraterritorial applications\" (and similarly worded variations) for\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's \"probable place\" in the locus inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 1 (\"[T]o the extent any binding 'test' ... can be divined from these cases, it requires textual or contextual evidence of a 'natural' or 'probable' extraterritorial focus or effect....\"). In his view, that was never the D.C. Circuit's intention, and if it did so incidentally, that was only because\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   was being used as additional, not indispensable, authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Al-Imam's argument is creative but ultimately unpersuasive. To start, his attempt to downplay\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's significance to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   does not withstand closer inspection. At the conclusion of the majority's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , it singled out \"the same textual evidence used by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 1324(a)'s international focus\" as the \"two reasons\" supporting its decision that the statute applied extraterritorially.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition,\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   is mentioned nearly 40 times in the opinion, occupying several pages of analysis. It is also telling that\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   went to great lengths to explain why the factual distinctions between the case and\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   did not preclude\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    at 1345-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the D.C. Circuit took pains to explain away those distinctions suggests that the court understood\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   was critical to its decision. This sharply undermines Al-Imam's contention that the court treated\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   haphazardly because it played an ancillary role in its reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   But regardless of the role\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   played in the\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   decision, Al-Imam fails to convince the Court that the latter's various \"many\" formulations should not guide the\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   locus inquiry. As an initial matter, the D.C. Circuit offered these formulations in discussing what was necessary to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   . Most tellingly, when the dissent tried to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   on the basis that the cases involved different types of harm, the majority responded that \"[t]he border-control statutes at issue here are 'not logically dependent on their locality' in the same sense that the fraud offense against the United States was not in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   : they have many obvious extraterritorial applications.\"\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1346-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is a clear indication that the D.C. Circuit\n   <em>\n    equates\n   </em>\n   statutes having \"many obvious extraterritorial applications\" with their being \"not logically dependent on their locality.\" The sheer number of times the D.C.

In any event, far from being inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's \"many obvious extraterritorial applications\" and related \"much\" and \"often\" phrasings seem largely in keeping with the Supreme Court's decision. While\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   did use \"probable place\" in discussing one particular offense (forging a ship's papers) and \"most likely\" in discussing another (enticing desertions), it said that another offense \"would naturally often occur at sea,\" which was enough to show that Congress did not want \"to confine it to the land of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    260 U.S. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    43 S.Ct. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in discussing two other examples of laws that would apply extraterritorially, the Court focused on whether the offenses\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be committed outside the country, not on whether it was more likely than not that they would be.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    at 99-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    43 S.Ct. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that bribe of government official and theft of military property could occur \"in a foreign country or on the high seas\"). Finally, and crucially, when the Court turned to the fraud statute directly at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , it said the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   We cannot suppose that when Congress enacted the statute or amended it, it did not have in mind that\n   <em>\n    a wide field\n   </em>\n   for such frauds upon the government was in private and public vessels of the United States on the high seas and in foreign ports and beyond the land jurisdiction of the United States, and therefore intended to include them in the section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    260 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    43 S.Ct. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). There again, the Court did not replicate its \"probable place\" language, instead choosing a phrase the focused on numerosity, not probability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Al-Imam counters that\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's use of \"wide field\" must be understood in context. He says that the Court used that phrase \"in a sentence that specifically was about frauds against the Emergency Fleet Corporation,\" Hr'g Tr. (Rough) 38:20-21, which the Court noted would \"engage in [ ] a most extensive ocean transportation business,\" and which Congress's 1918 amendment seemed designed to protect,\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    260 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n    43 S.Ct. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, according to Al-Imam, while the Court may have said it was sufficient that a \"wide field\" of offenses would be committed abroad, that was only because it was otherwise obvious that the 1918 amendment was calibrated to apply to a corporation doing business abroad. Not so. Although the Court in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   did emphasize that the 1918\n   <em>\n    amendment\n   </em>\n   to the statute suggested extraterritorial intent, it also said the statute reflected the same intent when Congress\n   <em>\n    enacted\n   </em>\n   the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925424\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/94/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"We cannot suppose that when Congress\n   <em>\n    enacted the statute\n   </em>\n   or amended it, it did not have in mind that a wide field for such frauds\" would occur \"beyond the land\n   jurisdiction of the United States.\" (emphasis added) ). This undercuts Al-Imam's contention that\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   would have come out differently absent the statute's 1918 amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. (Rough) 8:20-9:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The long and short of this discussion? It would misread\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   to give priority to its \"probable place\" statement, as Al-Imam urges, and\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's \"many obvious extraterritorial applications\" standard is in fact fully consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 12 (arguing that\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's \"many\" and \"much\" phrasings \"dovetail[ ] with\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   's analysis of federal offenses that 'naturally often occur' overseas or where there was a 'wide field' for the commission of the offense overseas\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Even so, this particular dispute may be a tempest in a teapot, especially in light of Al-Imam's representations at the hearing. While the Court grants there could be a substantive difference between a \"probable place\" standard and a \"many applications\" standard, that would be true only if the word \"probable\" is read to mean \"more likely than not,\" which is at least one reasonable interpretation of the term. But defense counsel at the hearing disclaimed any argument to that effect.

MTD at 7 (arguing that the\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   \"many\" formulations \"reflected what was necessary, but not sufficient, to establish the extraterritoriality of statutes.\"). Or, as Al-Imam puts it in his reply: \"these cases must be read as a whole in light of the facts before them, rather than parsed for specific language into a 'test' the cases did not formulate themselves.\" Reply at 1. This argument parallels the one Al-Imam made in regard to the citizenship distinction: just as he argued that the citizenship distinction did not matter in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   because the statute was so clearly focused on international conduct, he argues that a statute having \"many\" extraterritorial applications was sufficient in\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   only because other contextual factors also made clear that the statute was intended to guard against international misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Al-Imam is correct that\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's determination that the immigration statute at issue applied extraterritorially\n   did not turn\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the fact that the statute would have many extraterritorial applications. Rather, the court noted other \"contextual feature[s]\" of \u00a7 1324(a), including that the statute protected U.S. borders and was \"international in focus.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240833,3429348\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1337/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hence, in\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   the Court made clear that, for a statute to apply extraterritorially, a statute\n   <em>\n    need not\n   </em>\n   evince an international \"focus,\" even if such a focus would provide an additional indication that a statute was intended to apply extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917259\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/151/116/#p123\">\n    151 F.Supp.3d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under\n   <em>\n    Delgado-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , a criminal offense whose most natural or obvious applications are domestic can still be prosecuted abroad if the law had many obvious extraterritorial applications at the time of enactment.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In sum, then, the Court rejects Al-Imam's request for the Court to reconsider its extraterritoriality analysis in\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   .

Seemingly admitting that the IPP Convention and Terrorism Convention do not by their own express terms bar extraterritorial forcible abductions, Al-Imam argues instead that the relationship between the conventions and the U.N. Charter accomplishes as much. In his words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   By entering the U.N. Charter, signatory nations agreed in principle to give up their power to violate the territorial integrity of another nation except under certain conditions. And by entering into the \"extradite or prosecute\" conventions-both of which begin with express references to the U.N. Charter, and both of which state that they may form the legal basis for an extradition request-the United States extracted promises from signatory nations to \"extradite or prosecute\" persons found in their territory suspected of crimes of terrorism or against internationally-protected persons, in exchange for adherence to and promotion of the values found in the U.N.

Without identifying a specific provision in the U.N. Charter, he asserts that the Charter's signatories \"agreed in principle to give up their power to violate the territorial integrity of another nation except under certain conditions.\" MTD at 26. And because the conventions cited the U.N. Charter as the \"premise\" for their agreements, those agreements now effectively contain the Charter's prohibition on territorial violations. Reply at 11. It seems the same conclusion the Supreme Court reached in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   should follow: the fact that many actions might violate the territorial integrity principle embodied in the U.N.

There, the defendant asked the Court to imply a no-abduction\n   term into the U.S.-Mexico treaty by reading the treaty \"against the backdrop of customary international law,\" as reflected by, among other things, the U.N. Charter.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    504 U.S. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the conventions themselves make explicit reference to the U.N. Charter, which Al-Imam contends effectively incorporated the U.N. Charter into the conventions. Reply at 11 (\"Unlike the U.S.-Mexico treaty ... the conventions cited by Al-Imam\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   refer to the U.N.

What is more, according to Al-Imam, the Terrorism Convention \"enshrine[s] the principle of territorial sovereignty into three different articles,\" Reply at 12, including one that provides that the parties will \"carry out their obligations under the Convention\" consistently \"with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity,\" Terrorism Convention, Article 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   By his reading, then, the conventions' incorporation of the U.N. Charter and the Terrorism Convention's explicit reference to territorial integrity supply what was missing in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   : the \"additional requirement\" that parties to the conventions \"respect[ ] the territorial integrity of all signatories.\" MTD at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Court disagrees. To start, it is unclear whether the conventions' references to the U.N. Charter suffice to \"incorporate\" the Charter, such that violations of the Charter\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   constitute violations of the conventions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply at 12 (discussing conventions' use of phrases like \"having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United States\"). Although Al-Imam admits that the IPP's \"incorporation of territorial sovereignty\" is \"opaque,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , he contends that the Terrorism Convention is perfectly explicit on this point, noting one provision discussing the \"territorial integrity of States\" and another assuring that the Convention's dictates do not conflict with \"the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Even so, the Court seriously doubts the proposition that these statements are enough to make a violation of the U.N. Charter, or specific provisions of it, a violation of the Conventions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   But the Court need not resolve that doubt. For even if the Charter were incorporated into the IPP and Terrorism Conventions, that distinction does not remove this case from\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   's orbit. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   did not, as Al-Imam seems to suggest, reject the defendant's argument about \"customary international law\" and the U.N. Charter simply because it was not explicitly incorporated into the bilateral extradition treaty. To the contrary, it rejected that argument for the reason highlighted above: the \"general principle of international law that one government may not exercise its police power in the territory of another state\" did not \"relate[ ] to the practice of nations in relation to extradition treaties.\"\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    504 U.S. at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the Court's analysis suggests that its reasoning would have been any different had the U.S.-Mexico treaty, like the IPP and Terrorism Conventions, included a statement that it \"had in mind\" the principles enshrined in the U.N. Charter or that it was not disturbing any of those principles. The\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   Court considered customary international law principles, including those codified in the U.N. Charter; it just found\n   nothing in them to suggest that a forcible abduction must be considered a violation of an extradition treaty. Al-Imam responds that, however general the principle of respect for territorial integrity may be in a vacuum, it should be understood as a bar to forcible abductions when it is included in an extradition treaty. Reply at 14 (\"[T]he conventions identify themselves as extradition treaties and expressly connect the principles of the U.N. Charter to the 'prosecute or extradite' regime they establish[.]\"). But the Court is not convinced that the U.N. Charter's general respect for territorial integrity transforms into a specific prohibition on abductions any time it is alluded to in an extradition treaty. Nor does the Terrorism Convention's promise that signatories will act consistently with \"the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity\" function as such a prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Al-Imam in reply offers one other distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   . He notes that the IPP and Terrorism Conventions, unlike the U.S.-Mexico treaty, contain arbitration provisions binding signatories to handle disputes that arise under the conventions. Reply at 16-17 (\"Obviously, it would make no sense for two parties to contract to a binding arbitration process, but permit that process to be subverted by the simple expedient of allowing one party to invade the other and capture the subjects of the arbitration.\"). But this is little more than a variant of the argument, rejected by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   , that an extradition treaty's purpose would be frustrated if a signatory to the treaty could use means other than extradition to subject a foreign national to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    504 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The arbitration provisions in the conventions may well still serve a purpose; if a party believes the conventions require extradition, and for various reasons that party thinks that extradition is either its best or its only option to bring a suspected terrorist to justice, they may compel the other nation to arbitrate their claim. In any event, as in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   , the creation of one legal mechanism for achieving a signatory's end goal does not necessarily imply the illegality of all others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    504 U.S. at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p664\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   controls and forecloses Al-Imam's\n   <em>\n    Ker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frisbie\n   </em>\n   argument.

When the United States sought to reestablish an American presence in Libya a few months later in April 2011, it sent Special Envoy Stevens to Benghazi, and then set up a \"U.S. Special Mission\" and an annex building there in late 2011. Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Within six months, Stevens had returned to Tripoli as the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, though he was present, and was killed, in Benghazi during the attack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473959\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/186/383/#p387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Al-Imam appears not to dispute that the Special Mission in Benghazi was established as a temporary concern. The State Department report that he cites for support, MTD at 29-30, describes the Mission's staffing as \"short-term\" and \"transitory,\" Accountability Review Bd., U.S. Dep't of State, Benghazi Attack Report 14 (Unclassified) (2012),\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   noting that the Mission \"was never a consulate and never formally notified to the Libyan government,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The bipartisan Senate intelligence report on the attacks, issued in January 2014, likewise characterizes the Mission as nonpermanent, using the term \"U.S. Temporary Mission Facility.\" U.S. Senate Select Comm.

And commentators have hypothesized that part of the reason the attack was so devastating was the mission's \"confusing legal status\": \"It wasn't an embassy or even an official consulate; it was so off-book that the Libyan government was never officially notified of its existence. This put the mission outside the normal State Department procedures used to allocate security funding and personnel.\" Zack Beauchamp,\n   <em>\n    9 Questions About Benghazi You Were Too Embarrassed to Ask\n   </em>\n   , Vox (Oct. 12, 2015, 9:00 AM), http://www.vox.com/2015/10/12/9489389/benghazi-explained. While this account may bolster Al-Imam's argument that the United State never obtained consent from the TNC to establish the Mission or Annex, it demonstrates that such consent was not required under the Vienna Conventions given the transitory nature of the posts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Moreover, as the Government points out, it would make little sense for a foreign state to have veto power over the protections these statutes afford federal employees working in federal facilities. While requiring the host state's consent to establish diplomatic or consular relations or permanent diplomatic facilities is consistent with the purposes of diplomacy and international cooperation, limiting the scope of a U.S. criminal statute designed to protect federal workers, whether within U.S. boundaries or abroad, subverts Americans' safety to the decision of a foreign state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Government also urges the Court to reject Al-Imam's Vienna Convention argument because it presents a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, which the Government is entitled to establish at trial. The Government does not explicitly concede that it did not seek or obtain consent from the TNC to set up or operate the posts, but it also does not directly refute\n   Al-Imam's claim that it never made the recognized Libyan Government aware of the locations. It focuses instead on the inapplicability of the treaties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   As discussed above, however, resolution of the questions before the Court does not turn on the Mission's or Annex's status under the Vienna Conventions. Rather, the Court is able to determine as a matter of law that, whether or not the United States obtained consent from the TNC to set up the Mission and Annex, the Vienna Conventions do not bear on those entities' status as federal facilities or U.S. property. The Court may therefore address Al-Imam's argument at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
