But that does not address, the agency's concern that von Spakovsky may have erroneously characterized individual b6-3 as\n   being on his \"side of the political aisle,\" and apparently the agency has not been able to verify the accuracy of that statement, notwithstanding von Spakovsky's representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While a privacy interest in avoiding a possibly inaccurate portrayal has not been established with any degree of likelihood, the Court finds that the risk is more than minimal, and that is all that is required to move on to the balancing test.\n   <em>\n    Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11403496,3700499\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/26/\">\n    309 F.3d at 35, 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
