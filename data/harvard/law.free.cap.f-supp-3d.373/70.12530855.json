Whether or not the Service relies on the same information to make its individual enhancement determinations does not give the withdrawn country-wide findings any operational effect in and of themselves. Instead, the proper vehicle to challenge the Service's methods in coming to an enhancement finding is to challenge the new enhancement determinations themselves-findings that affect the ability to import a sport-hunted trophy. In other words, these new enhancement findings do not create a live controversy over the withdrawn ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiffs do not-and could not-argue that were the Service to issue a country-wide enhancement finding like the one challenged in this case that it would evade review. After all, the D.C. Circuit effectively reviewed the 2014 and 2015 enhancement findings in\n   <em>\n    Safari Club II\n   </em>\n   . And plaintiffs cannot keep their claims alive on the basis that future litigation challenging the issuance of specific imports permit might evade review. If the concern is that those individual adjudication decisions are too short in duration to be fully litigated, the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception can be applied in that context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The voluntary cessation doctrine is equally inapplicable.
