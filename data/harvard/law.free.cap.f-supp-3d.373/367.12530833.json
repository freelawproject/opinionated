First, Olivo-Rosa's reference to paragraphs 8, 10-12,\n   21 and 22 of the Affidavit of FBI SA Devin J. Kowalski, submitted with the Complaint in criminal case 13-095 (ADC), is clearly not new evidence. Second, Petitioner fails to establish that the documents submitted as Exhibits A, B and C, are newly discovered evidence. In addition, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that said documents were new evidence, none of them present any new evidence that would sustain his claim of innocence. Exhibit A, which he identifies in his Motion as \"the GPS locator on his phone\", appears to be a GPS locator titled:\n   <em>\n    Zoom-In of towers used at 8:39 PM\n   </em>\n   . However, Exhibit A is not reliable evidence since it has no date and makes no reference to Olivo-Rosa. Exhibit B, which he identifies in his Motion as \"the phone record of his co-defendants\", appears to be Olivo-Rosa's mobile phone locator. However, although Exhibit B might challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence, it is not a proper claim of innocence. Exhibit C, which he identifies as \"a sworn affidavit from [his] co-defendant Domenech-Andino,\" is an undated and unsigned letter. As such, it is not an affidavit or an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury, as provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   , that would support his claim of actual innocence. Therefore, since Olivo-Rosa has not presented in his Petition any new evidence that would sustain his allegation of innocence, his claim of actual innocence is meritless and is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plea was not voluntary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Petitioner claims that his plea was not voluntary because \"counsel forced him to plead guilty by telling him that he either had to go to trial on all counts or plead guilty to all counts\" (D.E. 1 at p. 2). He also claims, \"that the United States forced him to plead guilty to all four robberies since he did commit the two on 09 and 20 October 2012\" (D.E. 1 at p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The record contradicts Petitioner's contentions. First, the Defendant stated under oath that he was not threatened by \"anybody\" to enter into a guilty plea in this case. Answer: No. (D.E. 168, p.27).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Has anybody forced you, threatened you or coerced you to enter a guilty plea in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   DEFENDANT: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, at the change of plea hearing, the Prosecutor read the stipulation of facts attached to the Plea Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Very well.

Full Discovery was timely made available to the Defendant.\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. Ol\u00edvo, do you admit as true the summary of the evidence that has just been given by the Prosecutor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: How do you wish to plead to count one, in Case 12-626, and\n   counts one, three, four, and five, in Case 13-095, guilty or not guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   DEFENDANT: Guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (D.E. 168, pp. 27-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Third, at the Change of Plea hearing the Magistrate Judge went thoroughly over all the elements of the four Robberies that he was accepting, plus the weapon charge, i.e., the \"use,\" \"carry\" and \"brandish\" of a firearm \" a black pistol\", during and in relation to a crime of violence as to Count Four related to the robbery at Count Three in Criminal 13-095 (Cr. No. 12-626 (DRD) D.E. 168 at pp. 16-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Olivo-Rosa represented to the Court that nobody had forced, threatened, or coerced him to enter a guilty plea. At no time during the change of plea hearing, Petitioner gave any indication that he was being forced to enter a guilty plea. Quite to the contrary, he admitted to every element of the offenses charged and did so in an intelligent and voluntary manner, with full knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea. (D.E. 168). Therefore, for the reasons stated above, Petitioner's allegation that he was forced to enter a guilty plea is consequently absolutely meritless, and, hence is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Petitioner alleges his counsel was ineffective for failing to file an Alibi defense under Rule 12.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (D.E. 1 p. 2). However, it is well settled that by \"waiving the right to a trial through a guilty plea, the defendant waives all non-jurisdictional defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

An Alabi defense is a non-jurisdictional defense that Olivo-Rosa waived when he entered a plea agreement with the government. See\n   <em>\n    Frye v.

Since Olivo-Rosa's conviction was as a result of his guilty plea, and the Court has established that Olivo-Rosa's guilty plea was made voluntarily and knowingly, Olivo-Rosa waived his right to an Alibi defense. Therefore, the Court finds that Petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file an alibi defense is meritless and the same is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.
