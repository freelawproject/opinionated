I have divided the case into separate trials based on families of patents. (D.I. 280). For the Family 2 trial, Plaintiff currently asserts two claims of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C453%2C881\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,453,881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '881 patent\"). The Accused Products are 2Wire's 5168N, 5168NV, 5268AC, and i3812V CPE devices. The '881 patent relates to DSL technologies. Specifically, the '881 patent claims systems and methods of \"reducing latency, or end-to-end delay of data transmission, in asynchronous transfer mode ('ATM') communications systems ... thereby generating a high data rate connection in ATM communication systems.\" (D.I. 486 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The asserted claims read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   17. A plurality of bonded transceivers, each bonded transceiver utilizing at least one transmission parameter value to reduce a difference in latency between the bonded transceivers, wherein a data rate for the first of the bonded transceivers is different for a second of the bonded transceivers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   18.

Plaintiff contends that compliance with these standards establishes infringement.

R. Evid. 702. The Third Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Rule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that the witness possess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert. Secondly, the testimony must be reliable; it must be based on the methods and procedures of science' rather than on 'subjective belief or unsupported speculation; the expert must have good grounds for his or her belief. In sum,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   holds that an inquiry into the reliability of scientific evidence under Rule 702 requires a determination as to its scientific validity. Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert testimony must fit the issues in the case. In other words, the expert's testimony must be relevant for the purposes of the case and must assist the trier of fact. The Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   that Rule 702's helpfulness standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   By means of a so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing,\" the district court acts as a gatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the requirements of qualification, reliability and fit from reaching the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   (\"Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Schneider ex rel.

Genuine Material Disputes of Fact Exist as to Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment of infringement. (D.I. 746). Defendant independently moved for summary judgment of non-infringement. (D.I. 715). Defendant affirmatively argues that \"the unrebutted evidence establishes that the Accused [ ] Products do not meet the limitations of the claims of the '881 patent\" (D.I. 716 at 5), and that Plaintiff cannot present evidence that creates a material dispute of fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). Plaintiff argues in its motion, \"There is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute that the Accused Products infringe claims 17 and 18 of the '881 patent.\" (D.I. 747 at 5). After reviewing the parties' submissions, I determine there are material disputes of fact that make summary judgment on the issue of infringement inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , there is a material dispute of fact as to (1) whether the source code functions in an infringing manner and (2) if so, whether the identified source code is compiled in the accused product. Plaintiff has identified testimony by its experts that the operation of the source code used in the accused chip \"corresponds to the limitation 'utilizing at least one transmission parameter value to reduce a difference in latency between the bonded transceivers, wherein a data rate for a first of the bonded transceivers\n   is different than a data rate for a second of the bonded transceivers.' \" (D.I. 747 at 12-13 (citing D.I. 748-18 \u00b6\u00b6 51-54, 56-57 &amp; Attachment E) ). Defendant has identified contradictory testimony from Broadcom's 30(b)(6) witness, Dr. Yu, that the chipset used in the Accused Products does not calculate transmission parameters as required by the claims because \"any minor difference in latency between bonded lines is not likely to be a problem.\" (D.I. 716 at 13 (citing D.I. 734-10 at 427:6-8; 427:10-16) ). Defendants also provide opinions from its expert, Dr. Walker, that Plaintiff's expert has failed to show that the purported infringing code is actually compiled into any Accused Product. (D.I. 716 at 22 (citing D.I. 717 \u00b6\u00b6 68-72) ). However, Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Almeroth, has provided an opinion that if the infringing code were not compiled, the Accused Product would be incapable of any bonding operation at all. (D.I. 747 at 13 (citing D.I. 748-25 \u00b6 24) ). Thus, there is a material dispute of fact as to whether the Accused Products use infringing source code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , there is a material dispute of fact as to what the ITU G.998.2 standard requires and whether compliance with that standard infringes the '881 patent. Dr. Cooklev, Plaintiff's expert, and Dr. Jacobsen, Defendant's expert, disagree on whether the standard requires that \" '[t]he PMD [physical medium dependent] control of aggregated links controls the maximum latency difference between any two aggregated links' which 'is achieved by configuring the bit rate, error correction and interleaving functions of the PMA/PMD of each link.' \" (D.I. 716 at 14; D.I. 729-2 \u00b6\u00b6 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Third\n   </strong>\n   , there are material disputes as to the weight to be given to the testimony of Dr. Yu and Dr. Cooklev. Plaintiff alleges that Broadcom's corporate witness, Dr. Yu, is biased and therefore his testimony should be disregarded. (D.I. 925 at 4 n.1). Defendant argues that Dr. Cooklev's test were not appropriately configured and should be disregarded. (D.I. 716 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The resolution of these disputes is reserved for the jury. In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, I am required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. The evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for either party. Thus, neither party is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of infringement. I deny both Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment of infringement and Defendant's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Material Disputes of Fact Exist as to Anticipation and Obviousness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff moves for summary judgment of no invalidity under \u00a7 102 and \u00a7 103. (D.I. 735). Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not shown and cannot show that any of the three identified references-Counterman, Edvardsen or Keller-Tuberg-taken individually teaches each element of the Asserted Claims. (D.I. 736 at 7). Plaintiff also asserts that summary judgment of no obviousness should be granted because each combination that Defendant asserts lacks at least one element of the asserted claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Defendant argues that there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the prior art references and combinations teach the limitation that Plaintiff alleges is missing-\"each bonded transceiver utilizing at least one transmission parameter value to reduce a difference in latency\n   between the bonded transceivers.\" (D.I. 930 at 1). Defendant additionally argues that Plaintiff's motion asks me to weigh the credibility of Dr. Jacobsen's testimony, which is a matter reserved for the jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff's motion relies entirely on purported contradictions between Dr. Jacobsen's deposition testimony and her expert reports to allege that the facts are undisputed. Plaintiff thus asks me to weigh the purportedly contradictory testimony in her deposition to negate her opinions from her reports. (D.I. 736). That is improper on a motion for summary judgment. \"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge [on summary judgment]... The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson,\n   </em>\n   477 U.S. at 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable jury, looking at both Dr. Jacobsen's testimony from her expert report and deposition could determine that that the Asserted Claims are invalid for anticipation and obviousness. Thus, summary judgment of no invalidity under \u00a7 102 and \u00a7 103 is inappropriate and Plaintiff's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Asserted Claims are not Invalid for Indefiniteness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff moves for summary judgment of no invalidity for indefiniteness. (D.I. 739). Plaintiff asserts two theories: (1) that Defendant waived an indefiniteness defense by abandoning its attempt to construe the claim and failing to raise the issue of indefiniteness at claim construction, and (2) that Defendant has failed to prove the claim to be indefinite by clear and convincing evidence. (D.I. 740 at 15-16). Defendant argues that (1) it has not waived the indefiniteness issue and (2) it has presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the asserted claims are indefinite. (D.I. 858 at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , Defendant has not waived its indefiniteness defense. There is no requirement that indefiniteness be raised at claim construction. Moreover, case law in this district supports Defendant's position \"that the submission of a proposed construction for a claim term does not amount to a waiver of a later indefiniteness challenge,\" and thus the failure to raise indefiniteness at claim construction is not a waiver.\n   <em>\n    Leader Techs, Inc. v.

Del. 2011). Therefore, I determine that Defendant has not waived its indefiniteness defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , Plaintiff has demonstrated that Defendant has failed to make a sufficient showing for its indefiniteness defense. Defendant argues that it \"has presented competent evidence that claims 17 and 18 of the '881 patent are indefinite because a POSITA would not know, with reasonable certainty, when \"each bonded transceiver [of a plurality of bonded transceivers is] utilizing at least one transmission parameter value to reduce a difference in latency between the bonded transceivers.\" (D.I. 858 at 14). Specifically, Defendant points to Dr. Jacobsen's testimony that \"the transmission parameters for a transceiver ... are not known until a transceiver is initialized\" and therefore \"there is no way to establish a reference point to determine that a difference in latency has been reduced.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (citing D.I. 867 \u00b6\u00b6 179-80, 184) ). Plaintiff argues that Defendant's indefiniteness argument resurrects its abandoned and incorrect construction of the claim term \"to reduce a difference in latency.\" (D.I. 740 at 15). Plaintiff asserts that the claim language does not require \"reduc[ing] a [known] difference in [already-existing] latency\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   but at minimum requires only \"reducing the potential difference in latency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant's \"arguments appear to be based on the wrong legal standard, i.e., written description or enablement as opposed to indefiniteness.\"\n   <em>\n    Augme Techs., Inc. v.

Cir. 2014). The indefiniteness standard requires that the claims \"viewed in light of the specification and prosecution history, inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707010\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/898/#p910\">\n    572 U.S. at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580976,12707010\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2120/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The asserted claims are clear on their face as to what is claimed. Dr. Jacobsen's testimony reflects that a person of ordinary skill would understand the scope of the claim language; her opinion identifies what the claim requires. Her objection is that there is no embodiment demonstrating how to reduce rather than how to eliminate the difference in configuration latency. This is not an issue of whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the claim scope, but an issue of whether that claim is properly supported by written description or enabled by the patent specification. Therefore, I determine that the term \"each bonded transceiver utilizing at least one transmission parameter value to reduce a difference in latency between the bonded transceivers\" is not indefinite. Thus, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment of no invalidity for indefiniteness is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Material Disputes of Fact Exist as to Written Description\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff moves for summary judgment of no invalidity for written description. (D.I. 739). Plaintiff asserts that there is no dispute that the specification describes an embodiment of the claims and that description of a single embodiment satisfies the written description requirement of \u00a7 112. (D.I. 740 at 20). Defendant argues that \u00a7 112 requires sufficient written description for the full scope of the claim and the '881 patent fails this requirement. (D.I. 838 at 18-19). Specifically, Defendant's expert, Dr. Jacobsen, provides testimony that \"the written description and drawings do not disclose and do not provide any guidance regarding how to reduce, without eliminating entirely, a difference in configuration latency between the bonded transceivers.\" (D.I. 867 \u00b6 197).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the '881 patent discloses how to eliminate any difference in configuration latency. (D.I. 838 at 19). However, the parties do not agree that disclosure of how to eliminate that difference is an adequate disclosure to support the broader claim on how to\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   the difference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant alleges that there are important differences between elimination and reduction of differential configuration latency. (D.I. 838 at 20). Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, as I am required to do, I determine that a reasonable jury could find that the asserted claims are invalid for lack of written description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The Asserted Claims are Not Invalid for Lack of Enablement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff moves for summary judgment of no invalidity for lack of enablement. (D.I. 739). Plaintiff asserts that Dr. Jacobsen's analysis \"is insufficient to demonstrate that 'a person of ordinary skill in the art would not be able to practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation,' \" because she \"has not explained why a POSITA ... will be unable to realize non-identical configuration latencies by adding an offset value.\" (D.I. 740 at 19-20 (citing\n   <em>\n    Alcon Research Ltd. v.

Defendant argues that it has presented evidence that the full scope is not enabled because the '881 patent does \"not describe to a POSITA how to reduce a difference in latency without eliminating it entirely.\" (D.I. 858 at 17 (citing D.I. 867 \u00b6\u00b6 205-10) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The appropriate standard for enablement assesses whether a POSITA \"after reading the specification, could practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Sitrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641168\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/993/#p999\">\n    516 F.3d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Jacobsen's expert testimony on enablement in both her expert report and declaration, taken in the light most favorable to Defendant, does not satisfy this standard. (D.I. 743-5 \u00b6\u00b6 145-148; D.I. 867 \u00b6\u00b6 205-210). Dr. Jacobsen makes no assessment of whether a POSITA would be able to practice the claimed invention after reading the specification. The closest she comes is the statement that \"enabling [reduction in differential latency] would have required one of ordinary skill in the art to add functionality to the transceivers, or the system.\" (D.I. 743-5 \u00b6 146; D.I. 867 \u00b6 206). She does not, however, offer any opinion on whether a POSITA would understand how to add that functionality to the transceiver without engaging in undue experimentation. Dr. Jacobsen's report focuses wholly on what the specification discloses and ignores that information \"already known to and available to one of ordinary skill in the art\" need not be included in the specification for the patent to be enabled.\n   <em>\n    Koito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9202977\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1142/#p1156\">\n    381 F.3d at 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I agree with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , Dr. Walker's reliance on printouts of the source code produced under the protective order, Dr. Almeroth's review of the source code, and Mr. Haeberli's review of the source code, is permissible under Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . Expert testimony must be based on sufficient facts or data and be the product of reliable principles and methods. Fed. R. Evid. 702. Courts in the Third Circuit allow expert witnesses to \"use assistants in performing [their] work, so long as those assistants do not exercise professional judgment that is beyond the expert's ken.\"\n   <em>\n    Adani Exports Ltd. v.

June 8, 2012). Additionally, I have previously found expert testimony admissible over a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   objection where the expert relied on excerpts of source code provided to him.\n   <em>\n    Iplearn, LLC v. Blackboard, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204954462\">\n    2014 WL 4954462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2014). As in that case, Dr. Walker was able to evaluate whether any pieces of the produced source code were related to infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (D.I. 732-20 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 54). Whether Dr. Walker should have personally reviewed the entirety of the source code is a matter for cross-examination, not admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , I do not find Dr. Walker's opinions relying on Mr. Haeberli's review of the source code to be \"mere parroting\" of another's opinion. Dr. Walker's rebuttal report makes clear that he directed the methodology of Mr. Haeberli's review of the source code and gave specific instructions. (D.I. 732-20 \u00b6\u00b6 38, 46). I determine that Mr. Haeberli's review is the type of information upon which an expert would reasonably rely in making his opinions. Moreover, Plaintiff may cross-examine Dr. Walker on the methodology about which he instructed Mr. Haeberli and whether he actually reviewed the source code himself. This is not an issue of admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    Third\n   </strong>\n   , I determine that Dr. Walker's testimony is not so likely to mislead the jury and confuse the issues as to substantially outweigh the probative value of his testimony. Dr. Walker's expert report makes clear when he is relying on \"produced\" source code and when he is relying on Mr. Haeberli's review of the escrowed source code. (D.I. 732-20 \u00b6\u00b6 33-56). Moreover, these distinctions are the sort that are easily clarified on cross-examination. Therefore, under Rule 403, I do not find the probative value of Dr. Walker's expert testimony to be substantially outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues or misleading the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Thus, Plaintiff's motion to exclude Dr. Walker's testimony is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dr. Cooklev's Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude Dr. Cooklev's testimony because (1) he is not qualified to render opinions, (2) his opinions are not relevant because they do not test for differential latency, and (3) his methodology is flawed. (D.I. 721 at 11, 13, 16). Plaintiff asserts (1) that Dr. Cooklev is qualified in the field of DSL technology, (2) that his opinions are reliable, and (3) that his methodology is reliable. (D.I. 850 at 12, 16, 20). I agree with Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , I determine that Dr. Cooklev is qualified to offer his opinions. \"The Third Circuit has interpreted the 'qualification' requirement liberally, explaining: 'Qualification requires that the witness possess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert as such.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sonos, Inc. v.

Dr. Cooklev holds a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering. As a professional, \"Dr. Cooklev has worked extensively in the network communications industry, including with various types of wired and wireless multicarrier communications systems.\" (D.I. 850 at 9). Dr. Cooklev's research has also involved DSL standards. (D.I. 850 at 10). Dr. Cooklev's qualifications far exceed the qualifications of a POSITA as set out by Defendant's\n   expert. (D.I. 743-5 \u00b6 53). Defendant objects that Dr. Cooklev's experience is with wireless technologies, and that his experience with wired DSL technology is insufficient to qualify him to testify as an expert. (D.I. 721 at 12). Defendant attempts to define the pertinent art too narrowly. I determine that Dr. Cooklev has sufficient experience with communication systems, including DSL, to offer specialized testimony that would be helpful to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , I find Dr. Cooklev's opinions are relevant to aid the jury in assessing the accused products for infringement. Defendant objects that Dr. Cooklev does not test for differential latency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). Both Plaintiff and Dr. Cooklev acknowledge that his testing has limitations. That Defendant disagrees with the value of Dr. Cooklev's tests, however, is not a matter of admissibility, but of weight and credibility. Defendant may address the purported deficiencies of Dr. Cooklev's testing through cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    Third\n   </strong>\n   , I find Dr. Cooklev's methodology to be reliable. The parties and their experts appear to disagree as to the existence of standard industry testing. (D.I. 721 at 16; 850 at 20). Moreover, Defendant's dispute as to whether Dr. Cooklev selected the appropriate test or configured his test appropriately goes to the weight and credibility of Dr. Cooklev's opinion, not to its admissibility. Defendant may challenge Dr. Cooklev's opinions through cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Dr. Jacobsen's Testing Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiff moves to exclude Dr. Jacobsen's opinions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding both Dr. Cooklev and Defendant's testing of the Accused Products because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (1) her rebuttal report's failure to cite to and provide the \"service profiles,\" and explain some portion of the \"service profiles\" [which] supports her opinions violates the disclosure requirements of Rule 26; (2) such opinions are unreliable under FRE 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   because Dr. Jacobsen does not provide any information on the service profiles that she relied on; and (3) such opinions are irrelevant because infringement of claims 17 and 18 of the '881 patent by the Accused Products is not dependent on actual use of the Accused Products by 2Wire's customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (D.I. 719 at 7). Defendant asserts that Dr. Jacobsen's opinions should not be excluded because Plaintiff had the \"service profile\" information from a separate document disclosure and had sufficient information such that Dr. Cooklev could have properly configured his tests. (D.I. 854 at 24). I agree with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   While Dr. Jacobsen's rebuttal report, dated November 30, 2018, does not contain the service profile information upon which she relies for her opinions, citing \"confidentiality\" concerns (D.I. 743-14 \u00b6\u00b6 70, 77), Defendant provided the service profiles to Plaintiff as a part of \"document production\" in an email on November 29, 2018, the day before Dr. Jacobsen's report. (D.I. 743-17). Plaintiff argues that this production is not sufficient to save Dr. Jacobsen's opinions because the report did not indicate that the service profiles would be provided (D.I. 743-14 \u00b6\u00b6 70, 77), and the email did not indicate that the production was related to Dr. Jacobsen's rebuttal report. (D.I. 743-17). However, I note that Plaintiff waited until December 20, 2018,\n   the day before Dr. Cooklev's reply report was due, to inquire about the underlying service profile information. (D.I. 743-18 at 2-3). Given how close in time the production of the service profiles was to Dr. Jacobsen's report, exclusion of Dr. Jacobsen's opinions under Rule 26 or\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   would elevate form over substance. Moreover, Plaintiff has had the opportunity to depose Dr. Jacobsen on her opinions and the underlying methodology used in Defendant's testing of the Accused Products. Thus, Dr. Jacobsen's opinions regarding the service profile testing will not be excluded under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   or Rule 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   I also agree with Defendant regarding Dr. Jacobsen's reliance on a conversation with Mr. Miller, Defendant's corporate witness on technical issues. Dr. Jacobsen's conversation with Mr. Miller is the sort of evidence that an expert would normally rely on in reaching his or her conclusions. Moreover, Plaintiff's primary objection is that Dr. Jacobsen \"provides absolutely no documentation regarding the scope of the alleged interview or what facts and data were discussed during such interview.\" (D.I. 719 at 20). However, Plaintiff had the opportunity to depose both Mr. Miller and Dr. Jacobsen, and Dr. Jacobsen's opinion discloses the relevant facts from her interview with Mr. Miller. (D.I. 743-14 \u00b6 61). Thus, Dr. Jacobsen's reliance on her interview with Mr. Miller does not violate either Rule 26 or\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to exclude Dr. Jacobsen's opinions is thus DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
