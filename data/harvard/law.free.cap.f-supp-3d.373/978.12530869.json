REMEDY AND ORDER...1168\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   APPENDICES OF MAPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs have brought this action alleging that H.B. 369, the redistricting plan enacted by the Ohio General Assembly and signed into law by the Governor in 2011, constitutes an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and exceeds the powers\n   granted to the states under Article I, \u00a7 4 of the United States Constitution. As to the First and Fourteenth Amendment district-specific claims, we find that Districts 1-16 were intended to burden Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, had that effect, and the effect is not explained by other legitimate justifications. Moreover, we find that that the plan as a whole burdens Plaintiffs' associational rights and that burden is not outweighed by any other legitimate justification. Finally, we find that the plan exceeds the State's powers under Article I. Therefore, H.B. 369 is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. This opinion constitutes our findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Due to the length of this opinion, we provide the reader with the following, more concise summary:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Partisan gerrymandering\" occurs when the dominant party in government draws district lines to entrench itself in power and to disadvantage the disfavored party's voters. Plaintiffs in this action are individual Democratic voters from each of Ohio's sixteen congressional districts, two non-partisan pro-democracy organizations, and three Democratic-aligned organizations. They challenge the constitutionality of Ohio's 2012 redistricting map. Defendants are Ohio officials, and Intervenors are Ohio Republican Congressmen; Defendants and Intervenors both argue that the Plaintiffs' claims are not properly before this Court and defend the map's constitutionality on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In 2011, when Ohio's redistricting process began, Republican dominance in the Ohio State government meant that Republican state legislators could push through a remarkably pro-Republican redistricting bill without meaningful input from their Democratic colleagues. Ohio Republicans took advantage of that opportunity, and invidious partisan intent-the intent to disadvantage Democratic voters and entrench Republican representatives in power-dominated the map-drawing process. They designed the 2012 map using software that allowed them to predict the partisan outcomes that would result from the lines they drew based on various partisan indices that they created from historical Ohio election data. The Ohio map drawers did not work alone, but rather national Republican operatives located in Washington, D.C. collaborated with them throughout the process. These national Republicans generated some of the key strategic ideas for the map, maximizing its likely pro-Republican performance, and had the authority to approve changes to the map before their Ohio counterparts implemented them. Throughout the process, the Ohio and national map drawers made decisions based on their likely partisan effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The map drawers focused on several key areas of the Ohio map where careful map design could eke out additional safe Republican seats. They split Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati in a strange, squiggly, curving shape, dividing its Democratic voters and preventing them from forming a coherent voting bloc, which ensured the election of Republican representatives in Districts 1 and 2. They drew a new District 3 in Franklin County, efficiently concentrating Democratic voters together in an area sometimes referred to as the \"Franklin County Sinkhole.\" This strategy allowed them to secure healthy Republican majorities in neighboring Districts 12 and 15. They paired Democratic incumbent Representatives Kaptur and Kucinich to create the infamous \"Snake on the Lake\"-a bizarre, elongated sliver of a district that severed numerous counties. They drew a District 11 that departed from its traditional territory to snatch up additional African-American Democratic\n   voters in Summit County, allowing for the creation of a new District 16 in which a Republican incumbent representative could defeat a Democratic incumbent representative. They designed these districts with one overarching goal in mind-the creation of an Ohio congressional map that would reliably elect twelve Republican representatives and four Democratic representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ohio Republican legislators enacted the first iteration of the 2012 map, H.B. 319, in September 2011. Ohio voters then challenged the map, seeking to subject it to a voter referendum, but their efforts failed. As a result, Ohio Republicans passed a slightly different version of the map, H.B. 369, in December 2011. The changes they made did not materially alter the strong pro-Republican partisan leaning of the map's first iteration. Four cycles of congressional elections have occurred under the map embodied in H.B. 369. Each resulted in the election of twelve Republican representatives and four Democratic representatives. No district has been represented by representatives from different parties during the life of the map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During a two-week trial, experts testified to the extremity of the gerrymander. They demonstrated that levels of voter support for Democrats can and have changed, but the map's partisan output remains stubbornly undisturbed. The experts used various metrics and methodologies to measure their findings, but several takeaways were universal: (1) the Ohio map sacrifices respect for traditional districting principles in order to maximize pro-Republican partisan advantage, (2) the Ohio map's pro-Republican partisan bias is extreme, compared both to historical plans across the United States and to other possible configurations that could have been adopted in Ohio, and (3) the Ohio map minimizes responsiveness and competition, rendering one consistent result no matter the particularities of the election cycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We join the other federal courts that have held partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional and developed substantially similar standards for adjudicating such claims. We are convinced by the evidence that this partisan gerrymander was intentional and effective and that no legitimate justification accounts for its extremity. Performing our analysis district by district, we conclude that the 2012 map dilutes the votes of Democratic voters by packing and cracking them into districts that are so skewed toward one party that the electoral outcome is predetermined. We conclude that the map unconstitutionally burdens associational rights by making it more difficult for voters and certain organizations to advance their aims, be they pro-Democratic or pro-democracy. We conclude that by creating such a map, the State exceeded its powers under Article I of the Constitution. Accordingly, we declare Ohio's 2012 map an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, enjoin its use in the 2020 election, and order the enactment of a constitutionally viable replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Overview of the Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. The redistricting process begins\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Every ten years, the United States government conducts a census. The census results dictate the size of each state's delegation to the United States House of Representatives because House seats are based on population. Following the release of the census results, state legislatures redraw their United States congressional districts in order to reflect population changes. In Ohio, the 2010 census revealed that the State's comparative population stagnation required reducing the State's previous congressional delegation from\n   eighteen to sixteen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that same year, Ohioans elected a Republican Governor, elected a Republican majority in the State Senate, and flipped the Ohio House of Representatives to be majority Republican as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the State of Ohio, the Ohio General Assembly is responsible for enacting legislation that delineates the federal congressional districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both the State Senate and the State House of Representatives must pass such a bill by a simple majority and the Governor must then sign the bill into law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, when map-drawing activities commenced in 2011, the Republican Party had effective control of all bodies necessary to pass a redistricting bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In Ohio, redistricting is facilitated by the Joint Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment, and Demographic Research (\"Task Force\"). The Task Force is a six-person bipartisan committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Task Force does not actually draw the maps. Rather \"it is the entity to which the state legislature appropriates money\" so that the Task Force can then contract with other entities and individuals to assist in the redistricting process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the 2011 redistricting, the Task Force requisitioned from Cleveland State University (\"CSU\") a dataset containing demographic and political data that map drawers of both parties could use in the redistricting process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The practice of the Ohio General Assembly has been to allow the Task Force to allocate separate funds in equal amounts to the Ohio Democratic Caucus and the Ohio Republican Caucus and to allow the parties to conduct much of their redistricting work separately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is precisely what occurred during the 2011 map-drawing process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eventually, maps are produced that are then sent for the General Assembly to enact in a bill, which is then sent to the Governor. The Ohio Senate and House of Representatives also established committees on redistricting, chaired by Republicans State Senator Keith Faber and Representative Matthew Huffman, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Logistics of the Republican map drawing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Republican map-drawing planning occurred at both the State and federal levels, and the two levels worked together, collaborated, and consulted one another throughout the process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the State level, Ray DiRossi and Heather Mann\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   served as the principal on-the-ground map drawers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   DiRossi had previously been employed as a staffer for Republican members of the General Assembly and as a fundraiser for the Ohio Republican Senate\n   Campaign Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was also deeply involved in the 2001 redistricting process following the 2000 census.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mann had been working for the Ohio House Republican Caucus since 2004, most recently as Deputy Legal Counsel and Redistricting Director, reporting to Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives William Batchelder (\"Speaker Batchelder\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was decided that both DiRossi and Mann should formally cease their employment with the Ohio House Republican Caucus and instead conduct their map-drawing work as independent consultants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a consultant, Mann reported to Speaker Batchelder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and DiRossi reported to State Senate President Tom Niehaus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Troy Judy, Chief of Staff for Speaker Batchelder, was also deeply involved in the map drawing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   DiRossi secured a room at the DoubleTree Hotel in Columbus beginning in July 2011 to serve as the base for the map-drawing operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   DiRossi had the hotel move the usual furnishings out of the hotel room and instead had desks and three computers installed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Various Republican legislators, staff members, and operatives visited the DoubleTree room during the map-drawing process. They included Mann, DiRossi, Judy, Speaker Batchelder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   President of the Ohio Senate Tom Niehaus, Representative Matt Huffman, State Senator Keith Faber, Chief of Staff in the Ohio State Senate Mike Schuler, Chief Legal Counsel to the majority in the Ohio House of Representatives Mike Lenzo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   map-drawing expert John Morgan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   head of Team Boehner Tom Whatman, and legal counsel Mark Braden. No Democratic legislator or staffer ever visited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mann, DiRossi, and Judy each used a computer equipped with a software package called \"Maptitude.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Various types of demographic data as well as historical election data and compilations of that data can be uploaded into Maptitude. The software then allows map drawers to draw district lines over a map of a state. Map drawers can view and work on maps in very fine detail-down to the census block unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the map drawer draws or alters lines, the program will calculate, recalculate, and display the corresponding demographic and historical election data for the newly drawn districts in real time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Map drawers can save their draft maps both as visual depictions and as data files that contain the assignments of each geographical unit\n   to a particular district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maptitude will also export into Excel spreadsheets the political data that corresponds to the draft maps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As mentioned above, much of the data that the map drawers used had been furnished to them through a contract that the Ohio General Assembly entered into with CSU. CSU created and provided the Task Force with the Ohio Common Unified Redistricting Database (\"Database\" or \"OCURD\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Database included many types of geographic, demographic, and historical partisan election data for the State of Ohio, broken down to the split census block level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Task Force provided this information to both the Democratic and Republican Caucuses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mark Braden, who was retained by the Ohio Attorney General to represent and advise the General Assembly during the 2011 redistricting process,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   hired Clark Bensen from the company Polidata to do some additional work with the data sets to make the data more workable and to provide additional historical election data for the Republican map drawers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mann, DiRossi, and Judy were tasked by the Republican Caucuses with drawing maps that were favorable to Republicans. Many Republican leaders indicated their preference for a 12-4 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to gauge whether their draft maps would achieve this goal, they used partisan indices, created by compiling the historical partisan voting data from certain chosen elections. The indices were then uploaded into Maptitude so that the map drawers could predict how their draft districts would likely perform politically in future elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Various indices were used because individuals involved in the map-drawing process preferred different indices. At times they used an index that they created and termed the \"Unified Index.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Unified Index averaged the results of five races, overall reflecting a partisan landscape more favorable to the Democratic Party than an index that would have included a fuller set of elections from the decade preceding the redistricting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The map drawers also used the \" '08 McCain Index,\" which also reflected a strong Democratic\n   performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The map drawers used Maptitude to create spreadsheets by \"output[ting] the numbers to show what various indexes, as well as other data, were for all the districts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   They sometimes created comparison spreadsheets to allow them to compare the political index scores of different draft maps to one another. Individuals involved in the map-drawing process also used the Partisan Voter Index (\"PVI\"), which is used in the well-known Cook Political Report. PVI scores classify districts as either Republican leaning (R+) or Democratic leaning (D+). These classifications are accompanied by a score quantifying the strength of such a leaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Individuals not involved in the day-to-day map drawing were sometimes shown the draft districts' predicted partisan proclivities as assessed with various indices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The map drawers would also print out spreadsheets that contained the draft districts' predicted partisan leanings using various indices and share them with Republican Party leaders at redistricting meetings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judy regularly checked in on DiRossi and Mann as they worked, received updates, reviewed draft maps, and relayed information between Batchelder, DiRossi, and Mann.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   DiRossi and Mann regularly reported developments to and received feedback from Speaker Batchelder and President Niehaus. They also kept Senator Faber and Republican Chief of Staff in the Ohio State Senate Matt Schuler informed as changes were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. National Republican involvement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   National Republican operatives supported the State-level map drawers in their work from beginning to end. This collaboration started prior to the map drawing itself, when Ohio Republican staffers such as DiRossi, Mann, Judy, Schuler, and Chief Legal Counsel for the Ohio House Republican Caucus Michael Lenzo, as well as Representative Huffman attended a redistricting conference hosted by the National Conference of State Legislatures (\"NCSL\") in Washington, D.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lenzo had also attended a Redistricting and Election Law Seminar hosted by the Republican National Committee (\"RNC\") in Washington, D.C., in Spring 2010. At these meetings, the Ohio Republican staffers made contact with national Republican operatives such as Mark Braden, Tom Hofeller, and John Morgan, who later advised them and collaborated with them during the map-drawing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the Spring 2010 seminar, Morgan gave a presentation on map drawing, advising map drawers to keep the process secret and to score the maps to determine the likely partisan outcome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2011, Morgan conducted a follow-up visit to Ohio, where he presented on map-drawing\n   tactics to DiRossi, Mann, and Judy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Speaker Batchelder and President Niehaus also attended a redistricting meeting in Washington, D.C. in the spring of 2011 with Whatman and Republican members of the U.S. congressional delegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the time of the census and redistricting, Congressman John Boehner of Ohio was the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Ohio Republicans understood that Speaker Boehner would have considerable input in the 2012 map and were committed to enacting a map that he supported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Batchelder spoke with Boehner about once each month during the creation of the 2012 map and met with Boehner twice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Boehner employed Tom Whatman as the head of his \"Team Boehner.\" Boehner tasked Whatman with liaising between Republican members of the congressional delegation and the Ohio map drawers;\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whatman began working on the redistricting process at the federal level in December 2010 or January 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Whatman employed Adam Kincaid, the Redistricting Coordinator of the National Republican Congressional Committee (\"NRCC\"), to assist in the redistricting efforts. Kincaid drafted proposed maps and district lines that incorporated Whatman's requests and sent them to DiRossi and Mann and, on occasion, Braden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kincaid also met repeatedly with members of Ohio's congressional delegation throughout the redistricting process to hear their concerns and keep them abreast of developments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the districts were drawn, Kincaid updated Whatman and the Republican congressmen about the political leanings of their new districts based on the historical election data, producing spreadsheets with partisan index information for the various draft districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the final days of the drafting, state and national Republicans tweaked the map, mindful of the partisan consequences of very minor tweaks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   some cases, it was clear that national Republican operatives had the authority to \"sign off\" on changes before they were implemented by the State-level team.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Major features of H.B. 319\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because of the stagnation in Ohio's population compared to other states, two districts had to be eliminated. This meant that if all incumbents were to run for office, at least two sets of incumbents would have to be paired. The Republicans decided to pair two Republican representatives and two Democratic representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whatman made the decision to pair Republican Congressmen Turner and Austria; Speaker Boehner approved the pairing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whatman also spoke to both Austria and Turner about the decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Speaker Batchelder was not involved in the decision to pair those two Republican congressmen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As for the Democratic pairing, the map drawers paired Representative Marcy Kaptur of former District 9 and Representative Dennis Kucinich of former District 10; Kaptur won the Democratic primary that ensued. Kaptur testified that she did not want to be paired with Kucinich,\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   but she was not consulted by the Republican\n   map drawers on the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   She saw the map embodied in H.B. 319 for the first time in media reports around the time of the bill's introduction. Kaptur was \"astonish[ed],\" upset, and offended by the map, which she understood to break up communities of interest and involve unnatural groupings of communities with diverging interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The map drawers also paired Republican Representative Jim Renacci of the former District 16 and Democratic Representative Betty Sutton of the former District 13 to run against each other in the new District 16. DiRossi testified that the third pairing was necessitated by: drawing District 11 to include portions of Akron, population loss in Northeast Ohio, \"two congresspeople who were living very close together,\" and the creation of the new District 3 in Franklin County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The map drawers drew District 11 to include some portions of the City of Cleveland in Cuyahoga County and a thin strip dropping southward into Summit County where it incorporated sections of the City of Akron. Representative Marcia Fudge, who had represented District 11 under the previous map prior to the 2011 redistricting, was not consulted by Republican map drawers and did not learn of District 11's new boundaries until around the time that H.B. 319 was introduced in the legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was displeased with the new shape of the district, particularly the extension of the district into Summit County and Akron, areas with which she was not familiar and that she had not previously represented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   District 11 had historically been a majority-minority district that elected African-American congressional representatives by large margins. Some map drawers expressed that it \"was a consideration for us in a proposed map to make sure it remained a majority-minority district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The map drawers created a new district, District 3, in Franklin County, where the City of Columbus is located. Columbus had been experiencing population growth while metropolitan areas in northern Ohio had been losing population.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is an urban center that is the home of The Ohio State University, and it contains many Democratic voters. Whatman and Kincaid had the idea to create the new District 3 in Columbus that would concentrate many of Columbus's Democratic voters into one district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   One spreadsheet sent among those involved in the map-drawing process referred to the new District 3 as the \"Franklin County Sinkhole,\" but it is unclear who exactly included that term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   The draft map creating the new District 3 allowed for safe quantities of Columbus's Democratic voter bloc to be absorbed by the neighboring Districts 12 and 15 such that those districts could maintain or achieve safe Republican majorities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   State-level and national Republican operatives emailed back and forth sharing and consulting on plans for this new district. Kincaid created a proposed map that included such a district, which scored as D+15 using his PVI metric, and shared the draft map with DiRossi and Mann.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Braden asked Hofeller to consult on one draft of the map created by Kincaid, including the new district. Hofeller approved it after removing from District 15 some territory that Kincaid had allocated to it. Hofeller noted that this \" 'downtown' area\" was \" 'dog meat' voting territory\" and \"awful\" in explaining why it should not be included in the Republican-assigned District\n   15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kincaid followed up with minor tweaks of the Columbus area division, but the general contours, as tweaked by Hofeller, remained the same. The 2012 map, which placed downtown Columbus in District 3, uses irregular lines to divide Franklin County and Columbus into three districts-3, 12, and 15. In every election under the 2012 map, the Democratic candidate has won District 3 while Districts 12 and 15 have elected Republican representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For a time, the Republicans considered drawing a map that would include \"13 'safe' seats\" for their party rather than twelve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to accomplish this, Franklin County and the City of Columbus would be split into four different districts rather than the three they were split into under the 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kincaid developed such a map and calculated the PVI scores of the resulting districts. Although such a map could have secured the election of thirteen Republican representatives, the map drawers believed that the margins of victory would have been tighter, as evidenced by lower R+ PVI scores.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Republicans eventually opted for the map\n   that promised one less Republican seat, but in which those twelve Republican seats were safer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The map drawers sometimes rejected specific requests from Republican members of the Ohio General Assembly, instead prioritizing maintaining the partisan balance of the draft map. For example, State Senator Christopher Widener requested that the map keep Clark County whole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   DiRossi and the other map drawers rejected Widener's request in part because unifying Clark County would have negative consequences for the partisan scores of District 15-making the Republican seat there less secure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The resulting map featured twelve districts likely to elect a Republican representative (Districts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 16) and four districts likely to elect a Democratic Representative (Districts 3, 9, 11, and 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Secrecy surrounding the map\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Republican map drawers did not share plans for the map with either the public or Democratic legislators or staffers prior to introducing it in the Ohio House of Representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the State Senate's and State House's committees on redistricting, chaired by Senator Faber and Representative Huffman, respectively, held five public hearings in different locations across Ohio in July and August of 2011 while the maps were being drafted, their members did not share drafts of the maps or political indices at the hearings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Republican map drawers shared the map with Representative Armond Budish, the Democratic Minority Leader in the Ohio State House of Representatives, only just immediately before the bill was introduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   The map drawers even declined to share information with other Republican members of the Ohio General Assembly prior to the formal introduction of the bill.

District 12 had moved nine PVI points in favor of Republicans because portions of Democratic Columbus had been removed from the district and into District 3. Similarly, District 15 had moved seven PVI points in favor of Republicans, as the new District 3 now also contained many of District 15's former Democratic constituents. Kincaid's presentation also noted that Districts 6 and 16 were \"Competitive R Seats Improved\" because their PVI scores had become more pronouncedly pro-Republican as a result of the redistricting, District 6 by three points and District 16 by one point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kincaid continued to praise the results of his map-drawing collaboration with the Ohio Republicans, representing that the \"new [Ohio] map should be a 12-4 map,\" that it \"eliminat[ed] Ms. Sutton's seat,\" and that it \"created a new Democrat seat in Franklin County.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated elsewhere that the Ohio \"Republican map shored up multiple seats for the decade.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   U.S. Representative Stivers's communications with his staff reflected his similar\n   belief that various previously competitive districts had been made solidly Republican as a result of the redistricting.

In addition to being Democratic voters, the individual Plaintiffs are politically active in supporting, volunteering for, and working for Democratic candidates and causes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   Collectively, they have engaged in a variety of activities, including door-to-door canvassing, calling other voters to support candidates, writing campaign postcards, fundraising for and donating to candidates, writing letters to representatives and opinion pieces, and protesting. Several of the Plaintiffs have also worked on Democratic campaigns and served on boards of groups or political committees affiliated with the Democratic Party. Finally, the individual Plaintiffs testified, based on their direct lay experiences\n   of engaging in political activity, to the burdens that they themselves have experienced in translating their Party's political efforts in the electorate into political power in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   The individual Plaintiffs testified that their efforts included candidate recruitment, fundraising, and get-out-the-vote activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Organizational Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   APRI, the League, and HCYD each testified at trial through a representative, and some additional members of the organizations supplemented the testimony. Several themes ran throughout this testimony. First, the organizations actively engage in politics by encouraging citizens to vote, registering and educating voters, and in the case of HCYD, advocating on behalf of Democratic candidates. Second, in their experience, voter outreach and engagement work was made more difficult by continuously encountering significant voter apathy. They heard voters state their beliefs that their votes did not matter; voters believed that the outcome of any given election was preordained and that the same Republican or Democrat would be elected regardless of whether they voted. Third, the organizational plaintiffs encountered voter confusion-voters did not know to which district they belonged, who represented them, or who was running for office in their districts. Fourth, the organizational plaintiffs testified that they were forced to divert resources from their other work to address this voter apathy and confusion. Individual members of the organizations testified about their involvement with their organizations and their own political work supporting the elections of Democratic candidates. They testified that in their experience, they found their Republican congressional representatives unresponsive to them and not engaged in their communities. They also explained how their communities had been split into different districts under the 2012 map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Andre Washington, the president of APRI, testified at trial on the organization's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   Washington is a Democrat who votes regularly and resides in District 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Plaintiffs' Proposed Remedial Plan, Washington would reside in the reconfigured District 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   APRI is a nonpartisan organization but supports civil rights and labor issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its activities center around voter education, registration, and outreach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   APRI has eight chapters across Ohio, seven of which are currently active, and has between 150 and 200 members spread throughout nearly every congressional district in Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is a volunteer-run\n   organization, funded by membership dues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Washington testified that he has personally witnessed voter apathy-people feeling like their vote does not matter-while attempting to engage voters in his own district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that because of the way the lines are drawn, voters do not know where to vote or who is running in their district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   Washington testified that APRI must deploy some of its limited resources to combat voter apathy and confusion rather than spending these resources on its other work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Stephanie White, the vice president of APRI's Toledo chapter, also testified at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   White is a Democrat who votes regularly and resides in District 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   White believes that District 5 \"is not part of the Lucas County community,\" but rather that \"it's part of the Fulton County, Defiance, Williams County area, which is predominantly Republican.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   She is represented by Republican Congressman Bob Latta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   White testified that she has spent time in her political work with ARPI addressing Toledo voters' confusion about their assigned congressional districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also conducts partisan political activities such as door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, voter registration drives, and get-out-the-vote (\"GOTV\") work to help elect Democratic candidates such as James Neu and John Galbraith, who ran for Congress against Representative Latta in the 2016 and 2018 elections, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Jennifer Miller, the Executive Director of the League testified at trial on the organization's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   The League is a nonpartisan organization that hosts candidate forums, publishes voter education materials, registers voters, and participates in GOTV activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   It has around 2,800 members across Ohio, living in all of Ohio's congressional districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   The League has a long history of attempting to reform the districting process and Ohio's district lines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, it commissioned and published a report criticizing the process through which the 2012 map was drawn, and in 2011 it hosted a competition in which members of the public could submit redistricting map drafts that comported with non-partisan traditional redistricting principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Miller testified that the League spends resources combating voter apathy and confusion due to the 2012 map that it then cannot spend on its other initiatives such as voter registration and education.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, during the 2018 special election in District 12, the League had to divert significant resources to fielding voters' calls inquiring about their assigned congressional districts.

He defines partisan bias broadly as \"the idea of trying to quantify whether one party or another has an advantage in the translation of votes to seats.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    303\n   </footnotemark>\n   Successful partisan gerrymanders efficiently translate votes for the favored party into seats for that same party. \"In practice, this entails drawing districts in which the supporters of the advantaged party constitute either a slim majority ... or a small minority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    304\n   </footnotemark>\n   Map designers accomplish the former by cracking voters from the opposition party into different districts so that they are highly unlikely to break the 50% mark in a given district and are therefore unable to elect the candidate of their choice. They accomplish the latter by packing voters from the opposition party into districts such that they have an unnecessarily large margin of victory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The concept of \"wasted\" votes underlies both of these strategies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    305\n   </footnotemark>\n   In cracked districts, the votes of the losing disfavored party are all wasted because they were allocated to a race that the disfavored party did not win. The closer the margin of victory in cracked districts, the more disfavored party votes are wasted. In packed districts, many votes of the winning disfavored party are wasted because there are many excess votes beyond those needed for victory. A party designing a partisan gerrymander will attempt to waste few of its own supporters' votes and waste many of the opposing party's supporters' votes. Partisan bias, an asymmetry or advantage in the efficiency of vote-seat translation, results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Dr. Warshaw used the efficiency gap, symmetry in the vote-seat curve, the mean-median difference, and the declination metric to measure partisan bias in the 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    306\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Efficiency Gap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The efficiency gap compares the wasted votes for each party by calculating \"the difference between the parties' respective wasted votes, divided by the total number\n   of votes cast in the election.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    307\n   </footnotemark>\n   The efficiency gap reflects \"the extra seats one party wins over and above what would be expected if neither party were advantaged in the translation of votes to seats (i.e., if they had the same number of wasted votes).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    308\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Dr. Warshaw surveyed historical efficiency gaps across the country and found that they were generally quite small. Around 75% were between -10% and 10%, and only around 4% had an efficiency gap of greater than 20% in either direction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    309\n   </footnotemark>\n   He demonstrated that Ohio's 2012 efficiency gap of -22.4% was a historical outlier-\"more extreme than 98% of previous plans in states with more than six seats over the past 45 years, and ... more Republican-leaning than 99% of previous congressional redistricting plans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    310\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also reflected a major increase from Ohio's efficiency gap prior to the 2011 redistricting efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    311\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ohio's efficiency gaps in 2014 and 2016 were -9% and - 8.7%, respectively, \"imply[ing] that Republicans in Ohio won 1-4 more seats in these elections than they would have won if Ohio had no partisan bias in its efficiency gap.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    312\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ohio's efficiency gap in the 2018 election was -20%, more extreme than 96% and more pro-Republican than 98% of previous comparable plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    313\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Partisan symmetry in the vote-seat curve\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Symmetry in the vote-seat curve compares how both parties' seat shares change as their vote shares increase or decrease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    314\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw explained that in an unbiased districting scheme, if Democratic candidates receive 52% of the votes and earn 60% of the seats, then when Republican candidates receive 52% of the votes, they should also earn 60% of the seats. One can measure symmetry by applying a counterfactual uniform swing in vote shares from 45% to 55% and measuring departures from parity in seat share between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    315\n   </footnotemark>\n   One applies a uniform swing by increasing the vote share of a given party by a fixed percentage across all districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    316\n   </footnotemark>\n   Symmetry can also be measured simply by comparing the seat share that each party achieves when it receives 50% of the vote. Applying uniform swings, the level of partisan asymmetry in Ohio's 2012 election was \"more extreme than 96% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than 97% of previous U.S. congressional elections over the past 45 years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    317\n   </footnotemark>\n   The result was the same when the symmetry analysis was conducted using the method that compares seat shares when each party earns 50% of the vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    318\n   </footnotemark>\n   With uniform swings, the 2018 elections were more asymmetric than 92% of previous elections\n   and more pro-Republican than 94% of the comparison group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    319\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Mean-median gap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The mean-median gap reflects \"the difference between a party's vote share in the median district and their average vote share across all districts. If the party wins more votes in the median district than in the average district, they have an advantage in the translation of votes to seats.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    320\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw found that Ohio's mean-median gap jumped from 1.7% in 2010 to 7.8% in 2012, following the redistricting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    321\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also found that the 2012 mean-median gap was more extreme than that in 83% of prior elections and more pro-Republican than that in 92% of prior elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    322\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2018 mean-median gap was 5%, more extreme than in 62% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than in 81% of previous elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    323\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Declination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Lastly, the declination metric involves graphically plotting the districts in a plan from least Democratic to most Democratic and then measuring and comparing the angles formed by best-fit lines for each party's seats measured from the 50% Democratic vote share line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    324\n   </footnotemark>\n   The calculations result in a score between -1 and 1, which indicates the size and direction of the partisan bias of the map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    325\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ohio's 2012 declination score of -0.77 was \"more extreme than 99% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than any previous U.S. congressional election over the past 45 years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    326\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ohio's 2018 declination score of -0.69 \"was more extreme than 98% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than 99% of previous U.S. congressional elections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    327\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Strengths and weaknesses of the metrics\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Dr. Warshaw highlighted some of the strengths and weaknesses of each partisan-bias metric. For example, a strength of the efficiency gap is that it \"can be calculated directly from observed election returns even when the parties' statewide vote shares are not equal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    328\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the efficiency gap can also be a more volatile metric than some of the others, and it is not recommended for use in smaller states with relatively few congressional districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    329\n   </footnotemark>\n   A strength of the symmetry metric is that it is far less volatile over time and has been widely used and accepted in academic work on partisan gerrymandering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    330\n   </footnotemark>\n   One weakness of both symmetry metrics is that they involve the calculation of counterfactual elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    331\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mean-median gap is easy to apply, but it is \"sensitive to the outcome in the median district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    332\n   </footnotemark>\n   For its part, the declination measure \"is somewhat unstable when a party holds a very small number of seats in the legislature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    333\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw explained that all these metrics are \"closely related both theoretically and empirically, but nonetheless, there's small differences between them ... [and] looking at a suite of different metrics in concert gives us greater confidence in any conclusion that we ... draw.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    334\n   </footnotemark>\n   Looking across all the metrics, Dr. Warshaw concluded that \"Ohio's recent elections [under the 2012 plan] display a larger partisan bias in favor of Republicans than most previous plans in Ohio or in other states.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    335\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Requirements of a partisan gerrymander\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Dr. Warshaw testified about how he determines in his academic work whether a redistricting plan is a partisan gerrymander. According to Dr. Warshaw, to qualify as a partisan gerrymander, a districting plan must satisfy four different elements. First, a single party must have controlled the redistricting process-meaning that in a state with a bicameral legislature, it must have had control of both houses and the governorship-and that same party must be favored by the map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    336\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Dr. Warshaw's criteria, whether members of the disfavored party cast roll-call votes in support of the redistricting plan is meaningless in determining whether the plan was a gerrymander.\n   <footnotemark>\n    337\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, all partisan-bias metrics that Dr. Warshaw employs (efficiency gap, symmetry in the vote-seat curve, mean-median gap, and declination) must \"indicate [that] the same party that controlled the redistricting process was actually advantaged in the translation of votes to seats.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    338\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the map must be an outlier in terms of its partisan-bias metrics when compared to historical elections across the country in the last forty-five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    339\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, all four partisan-bias metrics measuring a given map must point in the same direction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    340\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Dr. Warshaw found that under this rubric, the 2012 plan was a partisan gerrymander because: (1) the Republican Party controlled the redistricting process and the map favored the Republican Party; (2) all four of his partisan metrics indicated that the Republicans were actually advantaged in the translation of votes to seats; (3) the map was an outlier when compared to the dataset of hundreds of historical maps; and (4) all four partisan metrics pointed in the same direction-toward a pro-Republican bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Responsiveness, competitiveness, and durability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Dr. Warshaw also evaluated the responsiveness and competitiveness of the 2012 map. Responsiveness measures \"how insulated a plan is from changes in voter preferences\" or, conversely, \"how likely the election results are to change due to changes in voter preferences.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    341\n   </footnotemark>\n   A map is more responsive if it yields different seat shares when there are swings in voter preferences from year to year. Dr. Warshaw measures responsiveness in two ways: (1) determining how many districts with competitive seats exist and (2) applying a uniform swing of vote shares between 45% and 55% across all districts and measuring how the seat-share outcome changes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    342\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Dr. Warshaw concluded that Ohio's present map \"has led to historically uncompetitive elections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    343\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, in 2012, Ohio had only two competitive congressional seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    344\n   </footnotemark>\n   In both 2014 and 2016, not a single congressional district in Ohio saw a competitive election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    345\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2018, Ohio again had only two competitive seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    346\n   </footnotemark>\n   The uniform swings also demonstrated that the 2012 map is highly unresponsive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    347\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying uniform swings to the 2012 election results, he found that Democrats would win the same 25% of the congressional seats if they won anywhere from 30% to 52% of the statewide vote. To advance to holding 37.5% of seat-share, they had to win 55% of the statewide vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    348\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw determined that 2018 was a more responsive year than earlier years according to the uniform swing analysis. However, \"most of this responsiveness occurs at the very upper end of the range of plausible statewide vote shares for democrats\"; Republicans would still win \"75% of the seats across most of the range of plausible election swings,\" even if 50% of the vote share was Democratic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    349\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Dr. Warshaw also found that the effects of the 2012 map are durable throughout time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    350\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the partisan-bias metrics generally became somewhat less extreme as time went on, the level of partisan bias\n   in 2012 under each metric was a \"powerful and statistically significant predictor\" of the same metric's level in 2016 and 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    351\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d. Polarization, representation, and trust in representatives\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Dr. Warshaw testified about political polarization and its impact on representation. He defined polarization as \"the distance between the average preferences of members of the two parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    352\n   </footnotemark>\n   He concluded that due to increased ideological polarization between Democratic and Republican members of Congress, Ohio Democratic voters who are disadvantaged by the districting scheme and represented by Republican congressmen are unlikely to have their views represented by their representatives in Congress; gerrymandering therefore negatively affects representation. He also found that \"voters in gerrymandered states ... trust their representatives less than voters in non-gerrymandered states.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    353\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     e.

Dr. Wendy K. Tam Cho\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Dr. Wendy K. Tam Cho testified at trial for Plaintiffs as an expert witness. Dr. Cho is a full professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and she holds appointments in several departments, including political science, statistics, and mathematics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    355\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho is also a Senior Research Scientist at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.\n   <footnotemark>\n    356\n   </footnotemark>\n   She has studied redistricting for thirty years and written extensively on the topic through the lens of multiple academic disciplines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    357\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho previously testified as an expert in a partisan-gerrymandering case on behalf of defendants in Pennsylvania who were defending a map enacted by the Republican legislature in the Commonwealth; the court in that case qualified her as an expert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    358\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court qualified Dr. Cho as an expert in political science, political geography and redistricting, statistics and applied statistics, statistical modeling and sampling from unknown distributions, and the design of algorithms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    359\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Dr. Cho testified about her analysis of the current map and its partisan characteristics as compared to a set of simulated maps that she generated. Dr. Cho used an Evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo (\"EMCMC\") algorithm\n   <footnotemark>\n    360\n   </footnotemark>\n   to run a simulation\n   on a supercomputer, and the algorithm generated 3,037,645 simulated maps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    361\n   </footnotemark>\n   These maps incorporated only neutral redistricting criteria and no partisan data (she analyzed partisanship after generating the maps).\n   <footnotemark>\n    362\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through this analysis, Dr. Cho was \"trying to understand what would be a typical map that would emerge from a non-partisan [map-drawing] process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    363\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, her analysis sought to determine whether neutral factors, primarily political geography, could explain the 12-4 outcome of the current map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Dr. Cho's simulations can be analogized to a coin toss. For example, if you toss a coin 1,000 times, and the coin lands on heads 582 times, that is one datapoint. If you flip the coin another 1,000 times, and the coin lands on heads 602 times, that is another datapoint. Running through this process many times (e.g., 3 million) provides a fuller picture of the typical outcomes. With a fair coin, outcomes of around 500-heads and 500-tails would be typical; 950-heads or even 1,000-heads out of 1,000 flips are also theoretically possible, but such outcomes would be surprising if the coin tosses were done with a fair coin. In this redistricting context, Dr. Cho generated over 3-million simulated maps and then analyzed the seat share between the parties under each. This process allowed her to compare how typical a 12-4 seat share between Republicans and Democrats would be under a neutral map-drawing process and, thus, to analyze whether it is likely that the 12-4 seat share can be explained by factors such as Ohio's natural political geography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    364\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, Dr. Cho's simulated maps are meant to provide a nonpartisan baseline against which to compare the current map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Dr. Cho's methodology includes several key and related components.\n   <footnotemark>\n    365\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr.\n   Cho's EMCMC algorithm, which she used to generate the simulated maps, is grounded in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (\"MCMC\") theorem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    366\n   </footnotemark>\n   MCMC algorithms are a commonly used technique for sampling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    367\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the redistricting context, a Markov Chain randomly walks from one simulated map to another, different simulated map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    368\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Dr. Cho's EMCMC, each movement of the Markov Chain is guided by optimization heuristics, which improve the Markov Chain's \"efficiency and effectiveness in the traversal of the search space.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    369\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MCMC theorem, meanwhile, ensures a representative sample of the massive universe of possible maps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    370\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, Dr. Cho ran the algorithm on the University of Illinois's Blue Waters supercomputer, which enabled the algorithm to output the sample of over 3-million simulated maps relatively quickly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    371\n   </footnotemark>\n   All these\n   components worked together to allow for the drawing of \"a random and large sample of feasible electoral maps,\" out of the much larger universe of feasible alternative maps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    372\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Dr. Cho built in several constraints when she produced her simulated maps, and those constraints are what define a map as \"feasible\" in her simulation. Dr. Cho testified that she arrived at the constraining criteria by \"look[ing] at the legislative record to see what the legislature was applying.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    373\n   </footnotemark>\n   Primarily, Dr. Cho looked at State Representative Huffman's statements in support of H.B. 319.\n   <footnotemark>\n    374\n   </footnotemark>\n   Representative Huffman explained that the map considered compliance with the VRA, equal population, and \"several other traditional redistricting principles\": \"compactness, contiguity, preservation of political subdivisions, preservation of communities of interest, preservation of cores of prior districts, and protection of incumbents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    375\n   </footnotemark>\n   In regards to incumbent protection, Representative Huffman described that criterion as \"a subservient one to the other ones that [he] listed\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    376\n   </footnotemark>\n   and further explained that, \"[n]obody has a district.... There's nobody that owns a piece of land in Congress. People elect them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    377\n   </footnotemark>\n   From this record, Dr. Cho decided to employ the following constraints: the creation of a minority district,\n   <footnotemark>\n    378\n   </footnotemark>\n   county and city preservation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    379\n   </footnotemark>\n   population equality,\n   <footnotemark>\n    380\n   </footnotemark>\n   and compactness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Because she concluded from State Representative Huffman's statement that incumbent protection was not a goal of the legislature when drafting the enacted map, Dr. Cho did not include as a constraint the avoidance of pairing incumbents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    381\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   After generating the 3,037,645 simulated maps based on only neutral criteria, Dr. Cho engaged in two overarching analyses using partisan data. Again, this use of partisan data came into play only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the simulated maps were produced. First, she engaged in a Plaintiff-specific analysis. Second, she examined the partisan unfairness of the map as a whole by comparing its partisan characteristics to the partisan characteristics of the set of simulated maps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Plaintiff-specific analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Dr. Cho was given the home addresses of each individual Plaintiff, which allowed her to determine where each Plaintiff would live in each simulated map and to compare each Plaintiff's current district with each Plaintiff's set of simulated districts. Dr. Cho \"compute[d] the average Democratic vote share for the plaintiff's current district by calculating the average Democratic vote share in that district for congressional races from 2012 to 2016 ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    382\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the simulated maps, Dr. Cho \"calculate[d] the average Democratic vote share for the plaintiff's [simulated] district ... with the 2008-2010 statewide election data.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    383\n   </footnotemark>\n   These data included eight statewide races: the 2008 presidential race, the 2010 U.S. Senate race, the 2008 and 2010 Attorney General races, and the 2010 Governor, Auditor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer races.\n   <footnotemark>\n    384\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho used statewide races to \"avoid issues with district-specific factors and provide[ ] greater comparability across the state as a whole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    385\n   </footnotemark>\n   From there, Dr. Cho compared the likelihood of electing a Democratic candidate in each Plaintiff's simulated districts with the likelihood of electing a Democratic candidate in their current district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    386\n   </footnotemark>\n   We provide a fuller discussion of these findings in Section III.A., but we will provide two illustrative examples here. Some Plaintiffs, such as Plaintiff Goldenhar, live in allegedly cracked districts. Dr. Cho's analysis showed that \"[a]mong the set of simulated maps, 95.68% of them would have placed Plaintiff Goldenhar in a district that would have provided a higher likelihood of electing a Democrat.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    387\n   </footnotemark>\n   That, is 95.68% of the simulated maps placed Plaintiff Goldenhar in a district with a higher average Democratic\n   vote share. Other Plaintiffs, such as Plaintiff Inskeep, live in allegedly packed districts. Dr. Cho's analysis showed that \"none of [the simulated maps] would have placed Plaintiff Inskeep in a district that would have provided a higher likelihood of electing a Democrat.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    388\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, 0% of the simulated maps placed Plaintiff Inskeep in a district with a higher average Democratic vote share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

Competitiveness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Dr. Cho \"consider[ed] a district to be competitive if the margin of victory, or the difference between the Republican two-party vote share and the Democratic two-party vote share, is 1) within 5 percentage points and 2) within 10 percentage points.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    391\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho concludes that \"[a]t the 5% margin of victory, the simulated maps generally have between 2-6 competitive seats,\" and that \"[f]or both parties, [winning] 1-3 seats with a margin of victory within 5% [is] not unusual.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    392\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meanwhile, the current map produced three competitive elections within a 5% margin of victory, one in 2012 (District 16) and two in 2018 (Districts 1 and 12), and the Republican won each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    393\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, one other election in 2012 (District 6) was competitive at the 10% margin of victory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    394\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the simulated maps, \"often, 9 of the seats are competitive at the 10% margin of victory\"; the next most common result was 8 competitive seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    395\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three or four of these competitive seats (at the 10% margin of victory) generally favor Republicans, and four to six generally favor Democrats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    396\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her supplemental report, Dr. Cho provides further analysis of competitiveness based on the 10% margin of victory. \"For the 2012-2014 data, 2-3 of the competitive seats were commonly Republican while 3-5 of the competitive seats were commonly Democratic.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    397\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2018, that number remained the same for Republicans, but competitive seats that leaned Democratic decreased to three or four.\n   <footnotemark>\n    398\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Based on her analysis of competitiveness, Dr. Cho concludes that \"[t]he Republican margins across the entire set of districts [in the current map] are large enough that they are sufficiently insulating to produce an enduring effect.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    399\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, she concludes that because of \"the difference in the competitiveness, via several\n   different measures,\n   <footnotemark>\n    400\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the simulated maps versus the current map, it seems that competitiveness was almost a non-existent factor if one at all in the construction of the enacted map since the current districts lean so heavily toward one party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    401\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Responsiveness and bias\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   In her initial report, which utilized 2008-2010 election data, Dr. Cho assessed the responsiveness and bias in the simulated maps compared to the current map using two measures based on the seats-votes curve (which shows how, as the proportion of votes a party receives increases, so too should that party's seat share).\n   <footnotemark>\n    402\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Dr. Cho measured responsiveness, she produced her results in a histogram in which, as the values along the x-axis increase (from left to right), the responsiveness increases; thus, maps falling along the right of the x-axis are more responsive than those on the left.\n   <footnotemark>\n    403\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho concludes that the current map is \"less responsive than almost all of the simulated maps.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    404\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Dr. Cho employed a symmetry measure to assess biasedness. This measure is grounded in the concept that \"both parties should expect to receive the same number of seats given the same vote proportion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    405\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho again produces her results in a histogram. \"Here, a value of zero [in the middle of the x-axis on the histogram] is unbiased.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    406\n   </footnotemark>\n   Positive values to the right of zero indicate a Republican bias, and negative values to the left indicate a Democratic bias.\n   <footnotemark>\n    407\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho finds that, although most of the simulated maps \"have a Republican tilt[,] ... the tilt toward Republicans is larger in the current map than it is for the simulated maps.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    408\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, some of the simulated maps were neutral and some even had a Democratic tilt; at any rate, H.B. 369 is far to the right of the simulated maps' Republican tilt as presented in figure 26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    409\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Seat share\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Dr. Cho also compared the seat share between the parties from the current map\n   to the seat share in her simulated maps. Based on the use of 2008 and 2010 election data, \"none of the [simulated] maps in [Dr. Cho's] sample had the same 12-4 seat share as in the challenged map.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    410\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, figure 19 of Dr. Cho's initial report shows that the most common outcome in the simulated maps was eight or nine Republican seats, at about 1.3 million and 1.2 million respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    411\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just over 250,000 of the simulated maps produced a 10-6 seat share in favor of Republicans,\n   <footnotemark>\n    412\n   </footnotemark>\n   and some of the simulated maps even produced six or seven Republican seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    413\n   </footnotemark>\n   Very few of the simulated maps produced an 11-5 seat share, but that outcome is barely visible in figure 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    414\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Dr. Cho performed the same analysis using 2012-2014 data and 2018 data in her supplemental report. This analysis shows that over the decade, a 9-7 seat share in favor of Republicans became the most common partisan outcome in the simulated maps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    415\n   </footnotemark>\n   An 8-8 seat share is the second most common outcome, but by 2018, the number of 8-8 outcomes was about equal to the number of 10-6 outcomes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    416\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Eleven [Republican] seats occurred 0.12% of the time in the 2008-2010 analysis, 0.20% of the time in the 2012-2014 analysis, and 1.88% of the time in the 2018 analysis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    417\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, using the 2018 data, \"a small number of maps, 1,445 out of more than 3 million total maps (0.046%) had, like the current map, 12 Republican seats.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    418\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Dr. J. David Niven\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Dr. J. David Niven testified at trial for Plaintiffs as an expert witness. Dr. Niven is a tenured associate professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati, and he has a doctorate in political science from The Ohio State University.\n   <footnotemark>\n    419\n   </footnotemark>\n   He teaches a variety of classes, including on the U.S. Congress and congressional elections, government and politics in Ohio, and political parties, among others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    420\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven's scholarship focuses on questions of congressional representation and elections, public opinion, and voting preferences, and he has published in peer-reviewed journals and book chapters on these topics but not on redistricting and gerrymandering specifically.\n   <footnotemark>\n    421\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before writing his reports in this case, Dr. Niven had never used census tracts specifically, though he had \"used a variety of census data points in understanding the makeup of districts as a whole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    422\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also before writing his reports in this case, Dr. Niven had never tried to identify boundaries for communities of interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    423\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court admitted Dr. Niven as\n   an expert in political science, subject to Defendants'\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    424\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Dr. Niven's report and testimony assessed the current map's makeup and the degree to which the districts divide communities of interest and reflect the political preferences of local residents. He undertook this examination by analyzing census tracts\n   <footnotemark>\n    425\n   </footnotemark>\n   that were either kept intact or split and by using the election data contained in \"the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database ('OCURD')\" that was available to the map drawers during the 2011 redistricting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    426\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven used census tracts as a basis for his analysis because they represent \"a compact delineation of people who live in common geographic, cultural, and economic circumstance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    427\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Dr. Niven finds that between the 2002 redistricting plan and the 2012 redistricting plan, the number of census tracts split between multiple congressional districts rose from 209 to 332 (out of approximately 3,000 census tracts).\n   <footnotemark>\n    428\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven further finds that census tracts kept intact had an average Republican composition of 52.14%, whereas split census tracts had a higher composition of Democratic voters, with Republicans averaging 49.25% in split census tracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    429\n   </footnotemark>\n   We note that Dr. Thornton reaches slightly different results on the partisan makeup of these census tracts and that there is a debate about the statistical significance of these results.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section II.D.2.b. (discussing this issue). Nevertheless, both experts agree that split census tracts lean Democratic and intact census tracts lean Republican, and both agree that the number of census splits increased in the current map from the prior one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   We credit Dr. Niven's census-tract analysis to the extent that it shows some differential treatment between Republican and Democratic voters, and we observe that this difference is consistent with the nature of other splits (not involving census tracts) present in the current map. We do not give any significant weight to just the raw number of splits, without any further context. For example, census tracts could contain more than one municipality, so a split census tract could nonetheless keep\n   its component municipalities intact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    430\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   In his response to Dr. Thornton, Dr. Niven also shows that, using a four-election index,\n   <footnotemark>\n    431\n   </footnotemark>\n   9.4% of Republican census tracts and 13.8% of Democratic census tracts were split among multiple congressional districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    432\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using an eight-election index,\n   <footnotemark>\n    433\n   </footnotemark>\n   9.7% of Republican census tracts and 13.5% of census tracts were split.\n   <footnotemark>\n    434\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, split census tracts leaned Democratic, and census tracts with more Democratic voters were also more likely to be split into multiple congressional districts than census tracts with more Republican voters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    435\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   After his statewide analysis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    436\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven discussed particular districts. His report focuses on Hamilton County (Districts 1 and 2), District 9, Franklin County (Districts 3, 12, and 15), and Summit County (Districts 11, 13, 14, and 16). Dr. Niven's report also surveys political science literature that shows that, when neighborhoods are divided into different districts, campaign efforts become \"more complicated and less efficient ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    437\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven similarly testified at trial that \"the political science literature is very clear that the more you subject a neighborhood to political splitting, ... it has a demobilizing effect.... It's harder for parties and other entities to go into a neighborhood and activate voters when those voters live in separate districts and, therefore, are responding to separate candidates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    438\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Hamilton County: Districts 1 and 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Dr. Niven began his analysis of Hamilton County with District 1. He notes that District 1 swung back and forth between electing Republicans and Democrats under the prior map and that one \"academic analysis deemed [District 1] a 'textbook example of a marginal district.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    439\n   </footnotemark>\n   After redistricting, that has not been the case. Dr. Niven's analysis shows, for example, that in 2008 President Obama won the old District 1 with 55.17% of the vote compared to Senator John McCain's 44.83%. By contrast, the same election under the current District 1, which splits Cincinnati and more of Hamilton County than under the old District 1, results in a 52.3% to 47.7% win for Senator McCain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    440\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new District 1 both split Hamilton County and\n   added the whole of Warren County, which votes heavily Republican (and voted heavily for Senator McCain in the 2008 presidential election).\n   <footnotemark>\n    441\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using an index that incorporates a wider array of elections (\"Dr. Niven's index\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    442\n   </footnotemark>\n   he found that Republican candidates averaged 42.07% of the vote in the old District 1, but that index percentage increased to 51.89% in the new District 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    443\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Meanwhile, District 2 was and remains safely Republican, but fourteen Cincinnati neighborhoods are divided between Districts 1 and 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    444\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven explains that \"Cincinnati is unusual in its commitment to formally recognizing and building policy around the city's 52 neighborhoods. Indeed, the city's economic development strategy is built around the individual needs and assets of individual neighborhoods ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    445\n   </footnotemark>\n   He notes that \"while the rest of Hamilton County gave 52.19% of its vote\" to President Obama in 2008, \"the Cincinnati neighborhoods divided between the 1st and 2nd districts gave 59.37% of their vote\" to President Obama in that election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    446\n   </footnotemark>\n   Looking at those same neighborhoods under Dr. Niven's index, the \"split neighborhoods gave more than 75% of their vote to Democratic candidates\" and the percentage for the rest of Hamilton County was about 45%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    447\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven testified that \"the 2nd District becomes something of a donor district. It had more Republicans than was needed to ensure a safe district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    448\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, Cincinnati and these neighborhoods supported Democratic candidates, and they are split between Districts 1 and 2; District 2 already contained a large Republican majority, and thus it could take on those Democratic voters without putting a Republican candidate at any material risk of losing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Throughout his report, Dr. Niven highlighted certain district boundary lines in which the lines divide census tracts populated by Democratic voters. In the case of his example for Hamilton County, the split census tract \"is overwhelmingly populated by Democrats\" per Dr. Niven's index.\n   <footnotemark>\n    449\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. District 9\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Dr. Niven emphasizes that \"[o]ne of the defining aspects of the 9th Congressional district is its comprehensive propensity to divide communities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    450\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, District 9 contains no whole counties and five partial counties-Cuyahoga is split between District 9 and three other districts, Lorain is split between District 9 and two other districts, and Erie, Lucas, and Ottawa are split between District 9 and one other district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    451\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven further explains that \"[i]n its economic development efforts, the state of Ohio places Cleveland and Toledo in separate regions,\" and thus, in combination\n   with other cultural differences between Cleveland and Toledo, District 9 \"combines quite disparate communities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    452\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven's illustrative example of a suspect boundary for District 9 is in Lorain County, and the boundary divides a census tract that is heavily Democratic and more Democratic than the rest of Lorain County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    453\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, each county in District 9 voted Democratic in the 2008 presidential election and leaned Democratic under Dr. Niven's index.\n   <footnotemark>\n    454\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Franklin County: Districts 3, 12, and 15\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Dr. Niven finds that Franklin County both packs (District 3) and cracks (Districts 12 and 15) Democratic voters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    455\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven ultimately concludes that \"what was achieved in these rather odd-looking districts is that a very Democratic County [Franklin County] winds up with two Republican representatives ... out of its three members of Congress.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    456\n   </footnotemark>\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Niven acknowledged that under the prior map, Franklin County was split into three districts and that Republican candidates for Congress usually won, with some exceptions, the elections in those districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    457\n   </footnotemark>\n   As will be discussed in more detail in the analysis, although this redrawing seemingly adds a Democratic district where there previously was not one, it was part of an overall strategy to solidify Republican districts and reduce the statewide number of Democratic districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   He begins his analysis with District 15, a District which was competitive in 2006 and was won by a Democratic candidate for Congress in 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    458\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven's analysis shows President Obama carried the old District 15 by about 29,000 votes, but the same election in the new District 15 would result in Senator McCain winning by 21,000 votes; under Dr. Niven's index, the old District 15 was nearly evenly split between Democratic and Republican supporters, with a very slight Democratic lean, and the new District 15 leans Republican.\n   <footnotemark>\n    459\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven notes that nine out of the ten counties added to District 15 in the 2011 redistricting process \"were inclined to support Republican candidates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    460\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the portions of three of the four split counties within District 15 leaned heavily Republican in the prior decade, except for the portion of Franklin County in District 15, which voted 50.52% in favor of Senator McCain and scored a 0.5237 (leaning Republican) under Dr. Niven's index.\n   <footnotemark>\n    461\n   </footnotemark>\n   The portions of those same counties not within District 15, however, had: a less-strong Republican tilt (Fayette County), were competitive (Ross County), or leaned heavily Democratic (Franklin County).\n   <footnotemark>\n    462\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also finds that the new District 15 split seventy-two census tracts (with fifty-eight in Franklin County), but the old District 15 split forty-one (all in Franklin County).\n   <footnotemark>\n    463\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, Dr. Niven concludes that\n   Democratic-leaning areas were removed from the old District 15, while Republican-leaning areas were added, together resulting in a \"net gain of more than 40,000 votes for the Republicans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    464\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   District 12 under either the 2008 presidential election results or Dr. Niven's index went from a leaning-Democratic district in the prior decade to a strongly-Republican district under the current map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    465\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven's analysis shows that Democratic-leaning voters in Franklin County were removed from District 12 and Republican-leaning voters were added, resulting in a new gain of 60,518 Republican voters (using the 2008 presidential election data).\n   <footnotemark>\n    466\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further finds that census tract splits increased from forty-eight to sixty-one between the prior map and the current map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    467\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   District 3 is the final Franklin County district addressed by Dr. Niven. He concludes that District 3 \"is a classic packing example\" because it received Democratic voters from Districts 12 and 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    468\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven emphasizes the odd, jagged shape of District 3, and he testified that he included specific, street-level examples of odd lines in his report because \"when we look statewide, ... it's hard to appreciate in the most granular detail the number of cuts necessary to achieve these effects.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    469\n   </footnotemark>\n   Overall, he found that \"14 out of 16 cities in Franklin County are split between multiple [congressional] districts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    470\n   </footnotemark>\n   In responding to Intervenors' expert Dr. Brunell's view that \"funny shaped districts are inevitable,\"\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section II.D.3., Dr. Niven testified that, in this case, the \"funny shapes\" were \"a strategic choice\" and that they are \"an illustration of division ... imposed with a partisan tinge such that democrats are far more likely to have found themselves in the midst of these cuts and divides.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    471\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Dr. Niven explained how gerrymandered district lines can cause confusion. For example, Dr. Niven found that in Franklin County, voters showed up to the polls for the 2018 special election, only to find out that they did not in fact live in District 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    472\n   </footnotemark>\n   As it turned out,\n   <em>\n    election officials\n   </em>\n   had mis-assigned more than 2,000 people to the wrong congressional district, and the Franklin County Board of Elections took more than 4,000 calls (and received hundreds of emails) from confused voters who could not cast a ballot or whose polling locations were closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    473\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d. Summit County: Districts 11, 13, 14, and 16\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Summit County's population is small enough such that it could be placed within a single congressional district-yet\n   Summit County is divided into four congressional districts. (The prior map split Summit County into three districts.)

Consistent with these results, using either 2008 presidential election data or Dr. Niven's index, Dr. Niven's analysis shows that voters placed into Districts 11 and 13 leaned heavily in favor of Democratic candidates; meanwhile, voters placed into Districts 14 and 16 were almost evenly divided in the 2008 presidential election, and under Dr. Niven's index, the voters placed in these Districts leaned Republican.\n   <footnotemark>\n    476\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, Dr. Niven finds that split census tracts leaned more Democratic than census tracts kept intact in Summit County, and he therefore concludes that \"Summit County residents were not equally apt to have their neighborhoods divided between districts - as more heavily Democratic areas were more likely to be divided.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    477\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

[the] partisan\n   gerrymander.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    505\n   </footnotemark>\n   He used Maptitude software, the same kind used by the map drawers in 2011, to do this work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    506\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper relied upon traditional redistricting principles (equipopulation, contiguity, compliance with the VRA, and preserving communities of interest) to craft his Proposed Remedial Plan and also made sure that it would satisfy the requirements of Ballot Initiative 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    507\n   </footnotemark>\n   He \"did not pair incumbents except when in direct conflict with the other factors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    508\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper had the CSU dataset used by the map drawers available to him while he was drawing his Proposed Remedial Plan and \"occasionally glanced at it\" although he \"was not constantly monitoring every little-every little change.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    509\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Proposed Remedial Plan that he created was intended to be a forward-looking plan that avoided the pairing of the current congressional officeholders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    510\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Mr. Cooper explained the traditional redistricting factors that drove his maps and the manner in which those factors are measured. Equipopulation means that a district is the exact population of the ideal district size, plus or minus one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    511\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contiguity means that a district is entirely contiguous with itself; there are no severed sections.

The \"Polsby-Popper score is a perimeter score over area of a district\"-the ratio of the perimeter and the area of a district generates the score. A low score is \"an indication that it's not a very compact district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    513\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Reock score is \"a ratio of an area for a circle drawn around the district.\" Mr. Cooper testified that \"districts that start getting below .20 are somewhat problematic, generally speaking.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    514\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Mr. Cooper defined a community of interest as \"an area or a region where there are certain cultural or socioeconomic ties, historical ties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    515\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that minority populations can be considered communities of interest and that counties or municipal\n   subdivisions are \"a more objective way to identify communities of interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    516\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maptitude allows users to monitor how many counties and metropolitan civil divisions are split as a plan is drawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    517\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that, generally, maps with fewer districts overall should contain fewer county splits if traditional districting principles are being applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    518\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Mr. Cooper also compared the shapes of several districts from the 2012 map to his Proposed Remedial Plan, commenting on the 2012 districts' irregular shapes and frequent splits of county lines and municipal boundaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    519\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Proposed Remedial Plan splits fourteen counties and twenty-seven political subdivisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    520\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, the 2012 map splits twenty-three counties and seventy-three political subdivisions, fifty-five of which are populated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    521\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper also compared the compactness of the districts in the 2012 map with those in his Proposed Remedial Plan.

First, it included a minority-opportunity district contained entirely within Cuyahoga County with a 47% BVAP, higher than the 45% that Dr. Handley calculated was necessary to allow minorities in the district to elect a candidate of their choice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    523\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper testified that simply by keeping the City of Cleveland whole in District 11 and including \"a couple of suburbs,\" achieving this 47% BVAP \"just happened\" without \"trying to max it out in any way.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    524\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Mr. Cooper's Proposed Remedial Plan included a District 1 with a higher percentage BVAP than the 2012 map's District 1. The Proposed Remedial Plan's District 1 has a 26.74% BVAP; the 2012 map's District 1 has a 21.30% BVAP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    525\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that this increase of over five percentage points resulted \"because [he] left Cincinnati in a single district rather than splitting it into part of District 2 as well as District 1.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    526\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the District 3 included in his Proposed Remedial Plan had roughly the same BVAP as was present in the 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    527\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Mr. Cooper also responded to the report of Defendants' expert Dr. Hood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    528\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Hood had challenged the Proposed Remedial Plan, arguing that it would not have been politically viable had it been implemented\n   in 2012 because it would have paired many incumbents.

He found that the Proposed Remedial Plan had \"slightly higher\" compactness scores than the 2002 map measured by both the Polsby-Popper and Reock tests. He also testified that Mr. Cooper's hypothetical plans, which were designed as alternatives that could have been enacted in 2012, also had higher compactness scores than the adopted 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    545\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Proposed Remedial Plan splits fourteen counties while the 2002 map split twenty-one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    546\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Proposed Remedial Plan splits 1.7% of Ohio's municipalities while the 2002 map split 4.3% of them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    547\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper's hypothetical plans also split fewer counties and municipalities than the enacted 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    548\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Dr. Hood also demonstrated that, had Plaintiffs' Proposed Remedial Plan been enacted in 2012, it would have resulted in the pairing of six sets of incumbents, the majority of which would have been Republican pairings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    549\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Hood calculated that had the Proposed Remedial Plan been enacted in 2012, its mean core-retention figure would have been 39.5%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    550\n   </footnotemark>\n   As is discussed in the summary of Mr. Cooper's testimony, the Proposed Remedial Plan was designed principally as a forward-looking map to be implemented today, using the 2012 map rather than the 2002 map as a baseline. It designed its incumbent pairings based off where current representatives live under the 2012 map. This makes it an inapt comparison to count incumbent pairings that would have resulted had it been implemented in 2012, when\n   a different set of representatives would have been the affected incumbents. Similarly, the implementation of the 2012 map shifted the district lines and assigned constituents to new districts. Therefore, it is odd to conduct core-retention analysis of the Proposed Remedial Plan against the baseline of the 2002 district lines when it was designed with the 2012 lines as its baselines. On cross-examination, Dr. Hood acknowledged that Mr. Cooper's hypothetical plans, which were designed as alternatives that could have been enacted in 2012, had core retention rates that were \"highly similar\" to those of the actually-enacted 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    551\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

Dr. Thornton admitted that she is not an expert in C++ and that she cannot read it without the help of a manual;\n   <footnotemark>\n    590\n   </footnotemark>\n   and again, Plaintiffs offered to provide Defendants with the code.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.2. More importantly, the code is not the algorithm; the code simply implements the algorithm. Consequently, nothing prohibited Dr. Thornton from critiquing the MCMC algorithm used by Dr. Cho if she had been qualified to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    591\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Thornton is an expert in statistics generally, not in political science or redistricting, and she has never run an MCMC algorithm or, prior to this case, reviewed, evaluated, or assessed an MCMC algorithm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    592\n   </footnotemark>\n   We consider her findings with that backdrop. Ultimately, we give some weight to her critiques of the underlying data that Dr. Cho used as a basis for assessing her simulated maps,\n   but several of Dr. Thornton's other critiques miss the mark and are not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Rebuttal to Dr. Cho\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Dr. Thornton opines that \"the manner in which [Dr. Cho] generates new maps (i.e., simulations) is biased towards selecting half of the districts in which the Republican votes outnumber the Democratic votes and half of the districts in which Democratic votes outnumber the Republican votes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    593\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Dr. Thornton's opinion is that the process Dr. Cho used to produce the simulated maps was biased toward creating an 8-8 map. This is wrong. As explained earlier, Dr. Cho analyzed the competitiveness and partisan outcomes of the simulated maps only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the simulated maps were generated.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    594\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Thornton offered no evidence to rebut this sequence of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   In a similar manner, Dr. Thornton criticizes the election data that Dr. Cho used to assess the partisanship of the simulated maps as compared to the current map. This criticism, however, is distinct in an important way because it goes to Dr. Cho's after-the-fact assessment of partisanship and not the creation of the simulated maps. The general thrust of Dr. Thornton's critique on this front is that the 2008-2010 data used by Dr. Cho contains higher Democratic vote totals than in the 2012-2016 data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    595\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Dr. Cho never used the 2016 statewide Democratic vote share for her analysis, which Dr. Thornton computed as 42.4% (lower than the other indices used by Dr. Cho).\n   <footnotemark>\n    596\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Thornton concludes that Dr. Cho's selection and use of election data \"is faulty, misleading, and unreliable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    597\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   We give some weight to this particular conclusion-Dr. Cho's omission of the 2016 election data (which was less favorable to the Democratic Party) and use of 2008-2010 data to assess the partisan effect of the 2012 plan raises some concern. At the same time, Dr. Thornton's critique on this point does not significantly undermine Dr. Cho's conclusions. After all, the 2008-2010 election data were part of the data available to the map drawers, so that data is not irrelevant to assessing whether different districts could have been drawn. It is true, however, that the Democratic vote shares have decreased in the present decade as compared to the last, and this waning in support is relevant to partisan effect. In response, Dr. Cho provided an updated analysis in her supplemental report that incorporated the 2012-2014 and 2018 election data; that analysis showed the most common Republican vote share as nine seats, and eight and ten Republican seats were also not uncommon.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.2. This cures at least part of Dr. Thornton's critique, specifically that using the 2008-2010 data misleadingly resulted in eight Republican seats being most common. In any event, Dr. Cho's supplemental report further shows that incorporating\n   recent election data does not significantly alter her conclusions on partisan effect-a 12-4 map is still a\n   <em>\n    highly\n   </em>\n   unusual outlier under all her analyses. In sum, although we give some weight to Dr. Thornton's critique on Dr. Cho's selection and use of data, hence rendering Dr. Cho's findings less probative than they otherwise could be, we do not find that Dr. Thornton has significantly undermined Dr. Cho's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Dr. Thornton also performed her own analysis using a binomial distribution, but we do not give any weight to that analysis. Dr. Thornton's analysis used the Republican statewide vote share in congressional races \"to predict the number of Republican seats.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    598\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an example, in 2016, the Republican vote share was 58.2%, and Dr. Thornton multiplied that number by 16 (i.e., the number of seats) to arrive at 9.31 as the expected number of seats (2.69 fewer seats than the actual outcome of 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    599\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Thornton then calculated \"the number of standard deviations associated with the difference between the actual and predicted number of Republican seats.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    600\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the difference is less than two standard deviations, whether positive or negative, the difference is not considered statistically significant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    601\n   </footnotemark>\n   From this analysis, Dr. Thornton concludes that for 2012, 2014, and 2016, \"the difference between the actual and predicted number of Republican seats using the Republican vote share are not statistically significant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    602\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Several factual and legal problems are apparent in Dr. Thornton's analysis. Factually, under the binomial distribution, the expected number of Republican seats unquestionably reflects proportional representation-Dr. Thornton multiplied the statewide vote share by the number of seats. Legally, proportional representation is not required.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.B. For this reason, Dr. Cho does not assume proportional representation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    603\n   </footnotemark>\n   The analysis incorporates yet another faulty assumption that each district has a 51% chance of being won by a Republican because Republicans won 51% of the congressional vote across the State; this assumption does not comport with basic understandings of congressional elections, i.e., that although some districts may be competitive (a 51% Republican to 49% Democrat district), other districts lean heavily in favor of one party or the other. Finally, Dr. Thornton's analysis has nothing to do with whether Republicans and Democrats are statistically treated similarly or differently under the current map-she assesses only whether the actual number of Republican seats differs in a statistically significant way from the expected number of Republican seats. This analysis, without more, says nothing about how the current map affects Democratic voters compared to Republican voters. For all of these reasons, we give no weight to her statistical significance analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Additionally, Dr. Thornton applied a similar analysis comparing the difference between the number of Republican seats in 2010 and the number of Republican seats\n   in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    604\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, she concluded that this difference was not statistically significant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    605\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find that this analysis is simplistic and not particularly helpful. To be sure, the Republicans flipped the congressional delegation in 2010 from one that was a Democratic majority to one that was a Republican majority, and this Republican majority has been maintained. But that simply shows part of the problem with the 2012 map: Despite fluctuating vote shares, the seat share has remained 12-4; under the prior plan, the seat share fluctuated as did the vote share. Indeed, the fact that a political party that controlled the redistricting process maintained (or slightly improved) their seat-share percentage from before redistricting to after is not surprising if they have drawn an effective partisan gerrymander.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Lastly, Dr. Thornton critiqued Dr. Cho for not considering incumbency in her analysis, and Dr. Thornton herself observed the success of incumbent candidates under the current map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    606\n   </footnotemark>\n   This critique holds some weight, but Dr. Cho's analysis still permits an inference, albeit less strong, on the partisan effect of the current map.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d. (addressing the problems with the incumbent-protection justification as applied to this case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

According to Dr. Thornton, she performed analyses similar to Dr. Niven's but reached different results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    607\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, her \"attempt to replicate Dr. Niven's finding [on the political orientation of census tracts left intact versus those which were split] result[ed] in an estimate that 50.48% of census tracts left intact are Republican in contrast to 48.18% among those that were split under the current plan\" using the same election data as Dr. Niven.\n   <footnotemark>\n    608\n   </footnotemark>\n   The corresponding numbers from Dr. Niven were 52.14% (or 0.5214) and 49.25% (or 0.4925).\n   <footnotemark>\n    609\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Thornton further critiques Dr. Niven's failure to perform the same calculations for the prior plan, which according to Dr. Thornton shows \"a 0.4% increase in the percentage Republican among census tracts left intact\" between the 2002 plan and the 2012 plan \"and a 2.4% decrease in the percentage Republican among census tracts that were split between the two plans ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    610\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Dr. Thornton \"prepared correlation statistics to determine if the splitting of a census tract is correlated with the percentage Republican\" using the same election data as Dr. Niven.\n   <footnotemark>\n    611\n   </footnotemark>\n   She concludes that \"split census tracts are, statistically speaking, not correlated with the percentage Republican in the census tract as measured by Dr. Niven under either the prior plan or the current plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    612\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, Dr. Thornton further testified that \"there is no statistically significant difference in the proportion Republican and\n   whether or not a census tract is split.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    613\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   As an initial matter on this issue, we credit Dr. Niven's census tract analysis for a limited purpose.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3. Debates about the strength of various correlations aside, each expert's calculations are close to 50%, and both experts agree that split census tracts lean slightly Democratic. Moreover, Dr. Thornton's analysis is not entirely clear-she measured whether \"the splitting of a census tract is correlated with the percentage Republican ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    614\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven, on the other hand, seems to have tested the statistical significance of the difference between census tracts that were left intact (which lean Republican) and those that were split (which lean Democratic).\n   <footnotemark>\n    615\n   </footnotemark>\n   An analysis of this differential treatment between Republican and Democratic voters seems to be absent from Dr. Thornton's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

In brief, Dr. Cho's 1% population deviation does not alter or undermine her analysis of partisan outcomes. We further note this criticism, along with others, offered by Dr. Brunell seems to miss the point of Dr. Cho's simulated maps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    624\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho's simulated maps are not offered as examples of maps that should be enacted by the State per se; rather, the simulated maps provide a baseline to compare the partisan outcomes between the current map and maps that incorporate only neutral criteria. Moreover, Dr. Brunell critiques Dr. Cho's failure to consider incumbent protection, and he testified that protecting incumbents is \"automatically going to make all of her districts different from ... one of the main stated goals by the legislature here in Ohio.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    625\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address this point in the context of evaluating the proof of partisan effect and considering Defendants' justifications for the map,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d. (addressing the problems with the incumbent-protection justification as applied to this case), and we observe again that Representative Huffman described incumbent protection as \"subservient\" to other criteria in the process of creating H.B. 319.\n   <footnotemark>\n    626\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Dr. Brunell incorrectly reads Dr. Cho's histograms to \"suggest[ ] that there are just a handful of different maps in Prof. Cho's exercises, each with hundreds of thousands of repetitions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    627\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho responds in her rebuttal report that Dr. Brunell's inference is unsupported by the data provided: \"none of these histograms can suggest anything about how many different maps are represented since two drastically different maps can have the same metrics.... The number of bars in the histograms has no relationship with the similarity of the maps.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    628\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we reject this critique by Dr. Brunell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Next, Dr. Brunell disagrees with Dr. Cho's conclusion that the current map is not responsive to voters. Instead, he \"would characterize Prof. Cho [sic] simulated maps as hyper-responsive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    629\n   </footnotemark>\n   He\n   further offered his normative view that responsiveness is not necessarily a positive feature of a map because \"[m]assive volatility in the seat shares of the two parties is probably not conducive to good public policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    630\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a basis for his conclusions on responsiveness, Dr. Brunell partly relied on \"an old article by Edward Tufte, who was one of the first people to ... talk about these two metrics of swing ratio and bias\" (which are related to responsiveness).\n   <footnotemark>\n    631\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the article is from the early 1970s, and the data provided are for Great Britain, New Zealand, the United States generally, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    632\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, much of the data\n   <em>\n    precede\n   </em>\n   the one-person, one-vote cases decided in the early-to-mid-1960s-an era in which districts were malapportioned. Tufte also used a linear fit of the data, not a seats-votes curve like Dr. Cho, which is a different model with different underlying assumptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    633\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Dr. Brunell's critique is based in on an inapt comparison, we give it little to no weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Lastly, Dr. Brunell misunderstands the point of Dr. Cho's individual Plaintiff-specific analyses. He takes issue with the fact that, because some Plaintiffs end up in the same district under Dr. Cho's simulated maps, \"we cannot know what the partisanship of all 16 of the districts looks like\" in the simulated maps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    634\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Dr. Cho responds, this specific analysis \"was never intended for this purpose, and [she] never suggested that the plaintiff data could be or should be used in this way.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    635\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree. Dr. Cho's Plaintiff-specific analysis provides a comparison between\n   <em>\n    each Plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   current district and\n   <em>\n    each Plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   set of simulated districts, and this analysis is thus some evidence of whether Plaintiffs currently live in a packed or cracked district. The Plaintiff-specific analysis is just that, Plaintiff-specific; it does not compare the current map as a whole to the set of simulated maps as a whole. Dr. Cho has made such a comparison in a separate analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Rebuttal to Dr. Warshaw\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Dr. Brunell's critique of Dr. Warshaw's metrics focuses only on the efficiency gap. First, Dr. Brunell points out supposed issues with using actual congressional elections to calculate the efficiency gap, including uncontested elections and the variability of candidates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    636\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw acknowledges some drawbacks in his report, but he also explains that \"[i]n practice, ... both legislative races and other statewide races produce similar efficiency gap results for modern elections where voters are well sorted by party and ideology.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    637\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not find unreasonable Dr. Warshaw's use of actual congressional election results to calculate the efficiency gap in congressional elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    638\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Dr. Brunell quibbles with the efficiency gap's definition of wasted votes,\n   stating that \"[i]t is not clear why\n   <em>\n    all votes\n   </em>\n   for the winning candidate greater than the total number of votes for the losing candidate are not classified as wasted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    639\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw, however, explains in his rebuttal the logic behind the definition of wasted votes, a term of art in the context of the efficiency gap-only \"50%+1 of the total votes, rather than 1 more vote than the losing candidate's current vote tally, are needed to win a counter-factual election\" and therefore the efficiency gaps considers wasted votes for the winning candidate beyond that 50%+1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    640\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Brunell's critique does not thread the needle, telling us why the generally-accepted definition of wasted votes from the efficiency gap literature poses a problem for measuring the extent of a partisan gerrymander. Accordingly, it does not impact our view of the helpfulness of the efficiency gap as a tool. Third, according to Dr. Brunell, \"[i]t is hard to say how much of a gap is too much. Is five too much, or seven, or ten?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    641\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, he criticizes the metric's variability across elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    642\n   </footnotemark>\n   While these criticisms have some merit, they do not overcome Dr. Warshaw's use of other metrics and how Dr. Warshaw holistically determines whether a map is a gerrymander (e.g., a map must also be an outlier).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.1. Accordingly, we find that Dr. Brunell does not undermine Dr. Warshaw's conclusions or the usefulness of the efficiency gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Rebuttal to Dr. Niven\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   The thrust of Dr. Brunell's response to Dr. Niven is that \"when electoral boundaries are being drawn some cities, counties, communities, neighborhoods have to be divided\" and \"[t]he boundaries have to go somewhere ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    643\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although that may be true as a general proposition, it does not respond to Dr. Niven's findings that the divisions imposed by the current map are more likely to be imposed on Democratic voters than Republican voters.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3. Dr. Brunell also comments on some conceptions of communities of interest used by Dr. Niven, noting that \"[t]here is no clear definition of what constitutes a community of interest, but cities and counties are generally characterized as such[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    644\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d. Rebuttal to Dr. Handley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Dr. Brunell's rebuttal to Dr. Handley does not contain any criticisms. His report simply states: \"It is interesting to note that Dr. Handley recommended a majority African American district of over 61 percent BVAP in a recent lawsuit in Euclid, Ohio, which is in Cuyahoga County ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    645\n   </footnotemark>\n   We find this statement entirely unhelpful. That case addressed a non-partisan election and required a different jurisdiction-specific analysis, and Dr. Brunell agreed that to do a proper assessment of racially polarized voting in this case would require looking at partisan election outcomes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    646\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also admitted that \"[i]n the current District 11, [he] think[s] that Dr. Handley's advice of 45 percent [BVAP] is correct .... That's not for Cuyahoga County. That's for Congressional District\n   11.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    647\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     e. Rebuttal to Mr. Cooper\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Likewise, Dr. Brunell's rebuttal to Mr. Cooper does not contain any helpful critiques. He simply concludes that \"[i]t isn't clear why the policy decisions of Mr. Cooper are better for the citizens of Ohio than the combined policy preferences of the state legislature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    648\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also states that \"[i]t is worth noting\" that the Proposed Remedial Plan pairs more incumbents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    649\n   </footnotemark>\n   The whole question in this case is not whether, in a vacuum, Mr. Cooper's maps are \"better\" than the 2012 map but whether the current map enacted by the State in H.B. 369 is constitutional. If not, the Proposed Remedial Plan is offered as a possible remedy to replace an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. We therefore reject Dr. Brunell's critiques of Mr. Cooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

We further conclude that the individual Plaintiffs and organizational Plaintiffs have standing to bring their statewide First Amendment associational claim. Because Plaintiffs have standing for their claims that H.B. 369 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, they also have standing to pursue their claim that H.B. 369 exceeds the State's powers under Article I. Before turning to these standing analyses, we emphasize that just because Plaintiffs have suffered an \"injury in fact\" for standing purposes does not mean that they necessarily succeed on the merits; in other words, showing \"a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\"\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p204\">\n    369 U.S. at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p204\">\n    82 S.Ct. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not guarantee an outcome in one's favor.

Statewide Evidence of Injury in Fact and Causation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   Statewide evidence bolsters each individual Plaintiff's contention that the current map was drawn with the predominant purpose of packing or cracking Democratic voters in each district and had that effect. As explained above, Dr. Warshaw employed four partisan-bias metrics to\n   measure the partisan advantage of the current plan: the efficiency gap, the mean-median gap, two partisan symmetry metrics, and declination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    714\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on his analysis of these measures, Dr. Warshaw concluded that \"Democratic voters in Ohio are efficiently packed and cracked across districts.... As a result, Ohio's elections are unresponsive to normal shifts in voters' preferences within the historical range of congressional election results in Ohio.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    715\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, these effects align with the map drawers' own statements that \"it is a tall order to draw 13 'safe' seats,\" and their thoughts that \"this map is the one [that] put the most number of seats in the safety zone given the political geography of [Ohio] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    716\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, the map efficiently packs and cracks each and every district in an effort to favor Republican candidates to the fullest and most durable extent possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   The individual Plaintiffs present other evidence of causation as well. Dr. Cho's analysis shows that although \"a 12-4 seat share [the outcome of every election under the 2012 plan] is possible, ... it is unusual given a map creation process that does not consider partisanship.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    717\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her initial report, Dr. Cho's maps were based on 2008 and 2010 election data, which showed that \"\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of [her simulated maps] had the same 12-4 seat share as in the challenged map.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    718\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her supplemental report, in which Dr. Cho uses the 2018 election data, only 0.046% of the over 3-million simulated maps (i.e., 1,445 out of 3,037,645) produce the same 12-4 seat share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    719\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Mr. Cooper's Proposed Remedial Plan splits fewer counties and adheres to traditional redistricting principles (\"one-person-one-vote, incumbent non-pairing where possible, compactness, contiguity, the non-dilution of minority voting strength, and respect for communities of interest\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    720\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Warshaw bolsters these findings by comparing the partisan-bias metrics from elections under the current plan to those under historical elections and concluding that the current plan's partisan bias is extreme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    721\n   </footnotemark>\n   The alternative maps (both the simulations and Mr. Cooper's maps) and Ohio's own historical maps thus provide baselines against which to measure the extremity of this map's partisan bias; collectively, this evidence establishes causation for standing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     18. Redressability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Plaintiffs request injunctive relief that prohibits the State from conducting future elections under the current map. They further request that a non-gerrymandered map be implemented in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   Clearly, the Court can enjoin future use of the 2012 map. Further, it is possible to enact a non-gerrymandered map for the upcoming election.

Similarly, the League has put forth evidence that it has at least one Democratic-voting member who lives in District 14 (John Fitzpatrick). The discussion above in the individual-Plaintiff sections shows that there is evidence, sufficient for standing purposes, that District 14 dilutes Democratic voters' votes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., supra\n   </em>\n   Sections II.A.2., III.A.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   Plaintiffs NEOYBD, HCYD, and OSU College Democrats are all partisan organizations composed of members who vote for Democratic candidates. All three organizations work to educate and mobilize voters to support Democratic candidates, among other things. NEOYBD's Democratic\n   members live in Districts 9, 11, 13, and 14. HCYD's Democratic members live in Districts 1 and 2. OSU College Democrats' members live in Districts 3, 12, and 15. Evidence was presented at trial supporting the conclusion that each of these districts was intentionally gerrymandered for partisan gain.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., supra\n   </em>\n   Sections III.A.1-3, III.A.9, III.A.11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   As previously discussed in the context of the individual Plaintiffs, evidence of causation and redressability pertaining to each of these districts was also introduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   We therefore conclude that APRI, at minimum, has associational standing to bring Fourteenth and First Amendment vote-dilution claims on behalf of its members to challenge Districts 5 and 12 as partisan gerrymanders.

There is some evidence that individual Plaintiffs actually live in packed or cracked districts and, consequently, they have suffered injuries in fact that are fairly traceable to the way in which the current map was drawn. Furthermore, the individual Plaintiffs have evidence of alternative maps, including the Proposed Remedial Plan and Dr. Cho's simulations, that show other possible districts exist in which the individual Plaintiffs' votes would not be diluted. The organizational Plaintiffs, for their part, represent members who, like the individual Plaintiffs, live in arguably packed and cracked districts. They have derivative standing to represent the interests of their members in a suit that is germane to their own interests and may rely on the same evidence of injury, causation, and redressability as do the individual Plaintiffs.

Dr. Warshaw's analysis of the partisan-bias metrics concludes that \"Ohio's congressional districts are unresponsive to changes in voters' preferences\" and that this \"pro-Republican advantage in congressional elections in Ohio causes Democratic voters to be effectively shut out of the political process in Congress.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    726\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the partisan bias \"has been durable between the 2012 and 2018 elections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    727\n   </footnotemark>\n   Actual election results also bear out an injury in fact. Despite Democrats winning between 39% and 47% of the statewide vote, Democratic candidates have won only 25% of Ohio's congressional elections under the current map; meanwhile, the Republican statewide vote share has fluctuated between 51% and 59%, but Republican candidates have won 75% of those elections. Part of Dr. Cho's analysis provides additional support, as she finds that \"[i]n each of the simulation analyses [using data from the 2008-2018\n   election cycles], 9 Republican seats is the common and expected outcome of a non-partisan map creation process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    728\n   </footnotemark>\n   Together, this evidence helps support, for standing purposes, the sort of long-lasting and substantial injury about which the First Amendment associational claim is concerned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Lastly, as with their vote-dilution claims, the individual Plaintiffs satisfy redressability as well.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.18.

The Supreme Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-395\">\n   Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412738\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/207/1280/#p1294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

The first two factors are the most important: (1) a textual commitment of an issue to one of the political branches and (2) an absence of judicially manageable standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vieth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/#p314\">\n    541 U.S. at 277-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/#p314\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality). If an issue qualifies as a political question, the issue is nonjusticiable, and, consequently, the federal courts have no role in adjudicating it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   Defendants make arguments on each factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252 (Defs.' &amp; Intervenors' Post-Trial Br. at 44-52). All the arguments go to essentially three points: (1) The states have authority over elections and redistricting, and courts should not second guess the states' political judgment; (2) To the extent problems exist, plaintiffs should seek a remedy from Congress (or the\n   states); and (3) Judicially manageable standards are lacking. As a threshold matter, we observe that federalism concerns and respect for state sovereignty are conspicuously absent from\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Carr\n   </em>\n   's list of justiciability considerations and, again, the political question doctrine is centered on separation of powers between the judiciary and the federal political branches, Congress and the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p204\">\n    369 U.S. at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p204\">\n    82 S.Ct. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But throughout this opinion, we respond to all these points, and we further conclude that workable standards, which contain limiting principles, exist so that courts can adjudicate these types of gerrymandering claims just as they have adjudicated other types of gerrymandering claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Turning to\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Additionally, if courts were to rely solely on the lack of a judicially manageable standard to conclude that an issue qualifies as a political question, then courts would be opining on the manageability of standards not involved in the case at hand. That would be imprudent because a court can dispose of only the matters in a case currently before it; to be sure, however, the reasoning of a court's decision could spell trouble for a future potential standard if the future standard suffered from the same defects as that which was previously held nonjusticiable.

Defendants argue that none of those evidentiary metrics offers an answer to when a map is unconstitutionally gerrymandered and that no expert has offered an opinion on that subject.

We set forth those legal standards in Part V of this opinion. The evidentiary metrics and simulated maps, however, are offered by a party to show that the legal standard is met.

In other words, the evidentiary metrics are strong evidence that voters were packed and cracked across the 2012 map.

On the one hand, proportional representation means that the number of seats in the legislature that a party receives is equal to the percentage of votes that the party receives in an election. For example, if Party X receives 40% of the popular vote and there are 100 seats in the legislature, then Party X would receive 40 seats under a proportional-representation scheme. On the other hand, partisan symmetry is based on the principle that a particular vote share should translate into a particular number of seats, regardless of which party receives that vote share. For example, if Party X receives 53% of the vote and wins 60 out of 100 seats, then when Party Y receives 53% of the vote, Party Y should also have a real chance to win about 60 out of 100 seats. A difference between the parties' abilities to translate the same vote share into seats demonstrates an asymmetry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   In other areas of election law, several metrics comfortably coexist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nicholas Stephanopoulos &amp; Eric McGhee,\n   <em>\n    The Measure of a Metric: The Debate over Quantifying Partisan Gerrymandering\n   </em>\n   , 70 STAN.

Dkt. 253 (Defs.' &amp; Intervenors' PFOF at 106-13). But Plaintiffs do not offer the efficiency gap as the ultimate Rosetta Stone to decipher what is or is not an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Rather, the efficiency gap is just one tool in the evidentiary toolbox. When it comes to malapportionment, racially polarized voting, and compactness, courts have not limited their toolbox, and we see no reason to limit it for partisan gerrymandering. To the contrary, that all the measures strongly point in the same direction gives us greater confidence in reaching a conclusion in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Importantly, these considerations are absent from the list of considerations for determining whether an issue presents a nonjusticiable political question. Instead, these points are pragmatic or historical in nature, and they are worthy of response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Courts are not picking political winners and losers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   One concern about allowing courts to adjudicate partisan-gerrymandering claims is that the courts would be dictating political winners. Dkt. 136 (Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 18). But, as mentioned, the core concern about partisan gerrymandering is that representatives choose their voters and not vice-versa-that is, when partisan gerrymandering amounts to a constitutional violation, the winners and losers are often already predetermined by those in power. Rather than dictating outcomes in these cases, courts are only fixing\n   <em>\n    the process\n   </em>\n   by which voters enact political change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JOHN HART ELY, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST 102-03 (1980) (explaining that in our system of government \"[m]alfunction occurs when ... the ins are choking off the channels of political change to ensure that they will stay in and the outs will stay out,\" and that judges \"are conspicuously well situated\" to correct such malfunction). If courts find a constitutional violation and fix it, then\n   <em>\n    the voters\n   </em>\n   pick the winners and losers in districts that adhere to the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   As we will explain further, the evidence in this record shows that, in fact, the party in power sought to lock in a 12-4 map, and, despite receiving a fluctuating percentage of the statewide vote, they were successful. Experience has shown that legislators are unlikely to act as neutral umpires in this context. Judges, however, play precisely that role. Rather than decide who wins an election in these cases, the courts' role is to ensure an even playing field, just as courts have done with other forms of gerrymandering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vieth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/#p314\">\n    541 U.S. at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/#p314\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   Furthermore, this non-intervention argument has its roots in reasoning from\n   <em>\n    Colegrove\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377174\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/549/#p554\">\n    328 U.S. at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377174\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/549/#p554\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality) (\"Nothing is clearer than that this controversy concerns matters that bring courts into immediate and active relations with party contests.\").

On the other side of the aisle, the Federalists also engaged in gerrymandering. In New Jersey, Republicans saw an 1812 redistricting law as \"a 'deadly poisoned arrow, levelled with certain aim at the inestimable right of suffrage.' \" ROSEMARIE ZAGARRI, THE POLITICS OF SIZE: REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED STATES , 1776-1850, at 117 (1987) (citation omitted). Thus, despite both sides condemning the practice as unconstitutional, the parties continued to engage in a retaliatory tit-for-tat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   Criticism of gerrymandering persisted into the late-1800s. James Garfield, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, admitted that he benefitted from gerrymandering in Ohio. Then-Representative Garfield stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-437\">\n   [N]o man, whatever his politics, can justly defend a system that may in theory, and frequently does in practice, produce results such as these....

GLOBE , 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 4737 (June 23, 1870) (statement of Rep. James A. Garfield). President Benjamin Harrison similarly criticized gerrymandering. In his Third Annual Message, President Harrison recognized that \"the primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the selection of members of the House of Representatives.\" President\n   Benjamin Harrison, Third Annual Message (Dec. 9 1891).\n   <footnotemark>\n    736\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-440\">\n   If I were called upon to declare wherein our chief national danger lies, I should say without hesitation in the overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of the popular suffrage.

In Wisconsin, the State Supreme Court declared that the challenged \"apportionment act violates and destroys one of the highest and most sacred rights and privileges of the people of this state, guarantied to them by the ordinance of 1787 and the constitution, and that is 'equal representation in the legislature.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The court further explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-443\">\n   If the remedy for these great public wrongs cannot be found in this court, it exists nowhere. It would be idle and useless to recommit such an apportionment to the voluntary action of the body that made it. But it is sufficient that these questions are judicial and not legislative. The legislature that passed the act is not assailed by this proceeding, nor is the constitutional province of that equal and co-ordinate department of the government invaded.

These cases further bolster the ahistorical nature of the claim that gerrymandering has been an\n   <em>\n    accepted\n   </em>\n   practice in American history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   Early gerrymanders often shared a notable attribute-the party in power drew maps in its favor with malapportioned districts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , GRIFFITH ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"A gerrymander is intended to disfranchise the majority or to secure [the majority] an influence disproportionate to its size.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 72-73; ZAGARRI ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 115-16 (\"No longer able to count on a statewide majority, [Federalists] supported a vastly inequitable districting plan designed to elect as many Federalists as possible. The first district, for example, was to contain approximately 30 percent more people than the third district and over 20 percent more than the second and fourth districts.\"). Of course, voters could not even challenge such districting schemes in federal court until the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Gomillion\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Carr\n   </em>\n   . And after the one-person, one-vote cases, legislatures' focus on gerrymandering shifted from malapportionment to other contexts, such as gerrymandering based solely on political affiliation. Accordingly, given that gerrymandering's constitutionality has been questioned essentially since its inception and that the federal courts have played a role in overseeing redistricting since\n   <em>\n    Gomillion\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Indeed, evidence in this case shows just that.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Sections V.A.2., V.C.2. If historically partisan gerrymandering was a self-limiting enterprise, that is increasingly not the case today. Moreover, because gerrymandering has persisted over time, comparative analyses can be done that show the gerrymanders of today are generally historical outliers and can withstand fluctuating statewide votes. Again, the evidence here shows that this applies to Ohio.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.1.;\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Sections V.A.2.b., V.C.2.a. In sum, the long history of gerrymandering does not show that the practice has been \"accepted,\" and, in fact, history allows courts to compare today's gerrymanders to past ones and thus better to understand the scope and gravity of the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

Apart from the measures of asymmetry in the vote-seat curve, every other metric utilized by Dr. Warshaw is grounded in actual election results, and these metrics illuminate the extent of partisan bias that occurs in the current (not hypothetical) state of affairs. Third, we do not view the analysis adopted here and by other three-judge panels as leading inexorably to striking down every map in the country. Although we do not\n   explicitly adopt Dr. Warshaw's requirements that must be present to classify a map a partisan gerrymander, we find them instructive. Under that rubric, a map is a partisan gerrymander only if there is one-party control of redistricting, the party in control party is favored by the map, the partisan-bias metrics all point in the same direction and point toward an advantage for the party that controlled the redistricting, and the redistricting plan is an historical outlier in its partisan effects. Courts determining how the evidence in any given case applies to the test that we elaborate and employ today may also consider these factors, which we find important in our ultimate determination. Acknowledging that the partisan-bias metrics offer a range of results, then, is not to say that use of those metrics will necessarily result in courts striking down every challenged map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

We conclude that the map-drawing process was rife with procedural irregularities and suspect behavior on the part of the map drawers, all of which support an inference of predominant partisan intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   There was a severe disconnect between the outward face of the map-drawing process and its true inner workings. Publicly, the House and Senate Subcommittees on Redistricting held regional hearings across Ohio ostensibly to solicit the input of Ohioans on the 2012 map. Yet, no draft maps were presented to the public at these meetings, and the public therefore could not even react to or comment on the drafts. In fact, State Senator Faber, the co-chairman of the Select Committee on\n   Redistricting, testified that \"the Select Committee on Redistricting didn't do much with regard to the actual redistricting.... I'm not even sure we issued a report.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    738\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a procedural irregularity in the fact that \"notwithstanding that the Committee held public hearings and received public input, [the expert who drew the map] never received, much less considered,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of that input in drawing the 2016 plan\" and finding that procedural irregularity probative of intent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   At the same time, in a room at the DoubleTree Hotel in Columbus, Republican map drawers worked on the map but declined to share drafts of it with the public, Democratic legislators, and most members of their own Party. They finally shared the map with other state legislators immediately prior to its introduction in the House. This late notice was in part necessitated by the fact that national Republicans such as Tom Whatman were requesting changes to the map as late as 9:28 PM on Monday, September 12, 2011, the evening before the bill was introduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    739\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was also the result of the map drawers' strategic decision to \"[h]old it 'in the can' \" until the legislature returned in September.\n   <footnotemark>\n    740\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-487\">\n   The deep involvement of national Republican operatives in the map-drawing process is an additional irregularity that serves as evidence of partisan intent. Ohio Republicans were in contact with national Republican Party operatives well before the map-drawing process began. National Republicans instructed the Ohio map drawers to maintain the plan's secrecy, taught the Ohio map drawers how to use Maptitude, and provided them with additional partisan data and assistance in working with the data they were provided. National Republican operatives repeatedly met with Judy, Mann, and DiRossi, and were in regular communication with them during the map-drawing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-488\">\n   Importantly, the national Republican operatives did not merely play a supporting role in the map drawing. Rather, they generated foundational strategies that played key roles in the map. For example, it was Tom Whatman's and Adam Kincaid's idea to create a new Democratic district in the Columbus area (District 3) in order to solidify Republican seats in Districts 12 and 15. Whatman also made the decision that the Republican incumbents to be paired were Congressmen Turner and Austria because that was \"the right thing for Republicans for the next decade.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    741\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ohio Republican map drawers displayed deference to their national Republican counterparts in their email correspondence. Mann and DiRossi cleared changes to the map with Whatman prior to implementing them. Whatman requested changes to the map on the eve of its introduction, and the Ohio map drawers accommodated his request. The evidence suggests that many of the big ideas for the 2012 map scheme were generated in Washington, D.C., and then communicated to the Republican consultants in the DoubleTree in Columbus. We conclude that the level of control asserted by national Republican operatives in a redistricting delegated to the State of Ohio's General Assembly raises the inference that pro-Republican partisan intent dominated the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-489\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Heavy use of partisan data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-490\">\n   Plaintiffs introduced testimonial evidence that the map drawers relied heavily on partisan data as they drew the 2012 map. We find the evidence of the heavy reliance on partisan data in the map-drawing process highly persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 517-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding partisan intent, noting that \"[r]eliance on the [Democratic Performance Index] in finalizing a map was essential to achieving the specific intent to flip the Sixth District from safely Republican to likely Democratic\");\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 869-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the map drawers' creation of a partisan index and use of it in drawing the districts indicative of partisan intent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   First, partisan data, along with other demographic data, was constantly displayed on the map drawers' computer screens as they did their work on Maptitude. As they drew and altered congressional district lines, the partisan leanings of the resulting districts would automatically update in real time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   Second, the Republican map drawers created various partisan indices through which they could measure the likely partisan outcomes of their draft maps, and the compositions of the indices are themselves proof of the map drawers' partisan intent. The Unified Index, upon which they relied heavily, averaged the results of five races, overall reflecting a partisan landscape more favorable to the Democratic Party than an index that would have included a fuller set of elections from the decade preceding the redistricting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    742\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2008 McCain Index similarly reflected an election in which Democrats had performed very well. Using these indices to predict partisan outcomes of draft maps therefore allowed the map drawers a margin of error-if Republican victories were predicted using the Unified Index and the 2008 McCain Index's Democrat-friendly numbers, they would be likely to withstand Democratic wave years and be sure to elect Republicans in average years. These indices had the added benefit of making draft maps look more competitive than they actually were to the untrained eye. In fact, in public statements defending the competitiveness of the map, Representative Huffman stated that \"11 of the 16 races are competitive if you use the 2008 Presidential Race as a guide.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    743\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   Third, communications between the Ohio map drawers and their national Republican counterparts demonstrate that partisan outcomes were undoubtedly foremost in their minds when making line-drawing decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the fact that one map drawer's \"appraisal of the various draft plans provided by [the map-drawing expert] focused on such plans' likely partisan performance\" probative of partisan intent). For example, DiRossi updated President Niehaus, Senator Faber, and Matt Schuler on his work on the map only days before the introduction of H.B. 319, informing them that the \"Index for Latta fell two one hundreds [sic] of a point to 51.33\" and the \"Index for Jordan rose three one hundredth of a point to 53.26.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    744\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later that morning, DiRossi followed up, stating that due to the change he had earlier implemented \"a good part of Lucas [County] [Latta] is picking up is [R]epublican territory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    745\n   </footnotemark>\n   DiRossi responded again with more partisan information later the same morning, breaking\n   down the partisan leanings of the people in specific sections of Lucas County that DiRossi had just assigned to Latta's new district-\"123,289 from Lucas County suburbs (49.13% 08 pres index) and 110,786 from Toledo wards (36.11% 08 pres index).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    746\n   </footnotemark>\n   This series of emails demonstrates the Republican map drawers' acute awareness of and concern about small impacts that line changes had on the map's partisan score as they tried to finesse the lines to ensure Republican voter majorities for Republican Congressmen Jordan and Latta. They thought it was important to know, for example, that the voters allotted to Latta from the Lucas County suburbs were more Republican leaning, as measured by the 2008 McCain Index than the voters allotted to Latta from the Toledo wards. A related email including \"talking points\" sent by Whatman to President Niehaus further exemplifies the use of this partisan data in decision making. Whatman explained that one incumbent pairing was chosen over another in part because the rejected pairing \"makes it impossible to draw Latta w/ a good index because you can't get enough good to off set [sic] the bad he takes from Lucas County.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    747\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding partisan intent where the consultant hired to draw the map \"prepared district maps using [a political consulting firm's] proprietary [Democratic Performance Index] metric to assess the likelihood that a district would elect a Democratic candidate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   In the days leading up to the introduction of H.B. 319, DiRossi also sent Whatman an update about the effect that changes he had made to Congressman Stivers's district had on partisan scores. He sent Whatman an email in which the entirety of the message read: \"Stivers 08 Pres goes from 52.64 to 53.32; Stivers unified index goes from 55.02 to 55.72; Schmidt 08 Pres goes from 54.62 to 53.99; [Schmidt] unified index goes from 57.64 to 56.96; I can send equivalency file if necessary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    748\n   </footnotemark>\n   The presence of entire emails communicating such minute shifts in partisan index scores in the days leading up to the map's introduction supports the conclusion that partisan outcomes were the predominant concern of those behind the map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   The correspondence between these map drawers is also littered with references to \"good\" and \"bad\" territory as well as \"improve[ments]\" that can be made to certain districts. For example, Whatman wrote to Kincaid, DiRossi, and Mann that one set of changes \"looks good on the surface\" but highlighted that the \"[k]ey is whether we can improve CD1 and CD 14 at the block level.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    749\n   </footnotemark>\n   In another email criticizing changes that Kincaid had made to a map, Tom Hofeller wrote that \"[t]he area Adam has on his version included ... some of the more 'downtown' area, which I took out of the map I sent-as it was 'dog meat' voting territory.\" He later referred to the area he had removed as \"awful-voting territory in the 15th.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    750\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Good\" territory clearly meant Republican-leaning territory, \"bad\" or \"awful\" territory meant Democratic-leaning territory, and \"improv[ing]\" a district meant manipulating boundaries, sometimes \"at the block level,\" to make it more likely to elect a Republican representative. The map drawers defined these basic\n   classifications of geographic areas based on their partisan leanings and the partisan impact that they would have on the map. The fact that mapmakers considered an area \"good\" or \"bad\" based on its partisan composition demonstrates the absolute centrality of partisanship to their map-drawing efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-496\">\n   The Republican map drawers repeatedly emphasized in their testimony that partisan index data was only one category of the many types of demographic data that was displayed in Maptitude as they worked. However, while there is ample evidence that the map drawers were acutely aware of how their mapmaking decisions impacted the partisan leanings of their draft districts, no such evidence suggests that they were nearly as focused on any other type of demographic data. Further, the correspondence includes very little discussion of how contemplated changes would impact core preservation, affect compactness, or minimize county or municipality splits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-497\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Contemporaneous statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-498\">\n   Statements made by the map drawers during and immediately after the map-drawing process also reflect their intent to produce a 2012 map with specific partisan results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering notes prepared for the Senate President's \"remarks to the State House and Senate Democratic Caucuses about the redistricting plan\" as evidence establishing intent). For example, Whatman explained to President Niehaus why certain decisions had to be made about the map: \"In losing two seats and trying to\n   <em>\n    lock down\n   </em>\n   12 Republican seats it is unrealistic to think that southwest Ohio can remain the way it is.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    751\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a direct expression of the Republican map drawers' intent to draw a map that guarantees the election of twelve Republicans by minimizing the competitiveness and responsiveness of the districts. The same email explained that pairing senior rather than freshman Republican incumbents was necessary to avoid \"an overall worse map for republicans in the state\" which was \"not the right thing to do.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    752\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, in Whatman's view, a \"tough decision\" had to be made that was \"the right thing for Republicans for the next decade\"-choosing the incumbents to be paired based on which would allow for a more pro-Republican map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    753\n   </footnotemark>\n   This statement, made days before the introduction of H.B. 319 by a chief architect of the 2012 map, is more direct evidence that the map drawers knowingly prioritized partisan impact over other redistricting concerns, such as incumbent protection, and that they understood and intended the map-drawing decisions they were making to affect the electoral outcomes \"for the next decade.\" They could be sure that the impacts would remain for years to come because they relied on carefully chosen indices to predict partisan scores and monitored changes to those partisan scores down to the second decimal place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding evidence of partisan intent in the map drawers' understandings that the map design would dictate partisan outcomes \"\n   <em>\n    in every subsequent election\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-499\">\n   Kincaid's statements about the Ohio redistricting process following the passage of H.B. 369 provide further proof of the map drawers' partisan intent. In a presentation to the NRCC, he stated his belief that Districts 1, 12, and 15 had been taken \"out of play\"-they were safe Republican seats that had been designed with sufficient\n   partisan insulation from a Democratic challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    754\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kincaid provided the PVI numbers to demonstrate significant pro-Republican partisan shifts that the 2012 map had achieved. This is evidence that Republican map drawers relied heavily on and frequently discussed partisan indices because they were understood as the means of monitoring their goal of designing reliably Republican districts. Kincaid also stated his belief that Districts 6 and 16 were \"Competitive R Seats Improved\"-their designs had been altered to shore up Republican advantage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    755\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kincaid's discussion of the map's achievements emphasized that it should reliably deliver a 12-4 partisan composition, \"eliminat[ed] [Representative] Sutton's seat,\" and \"created a new Democratic seat in Franklin County\"-all commentary focused on the issue that mattered most to the map drawers: partisan outcomes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    756\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-500\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Irregular shape of the districts, lack of compactness, high number of splits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-501\">\n   A map that fails to include compact districts that follow preexisting county and municipal lines raises questions of intent. The choice to split counties and municipalities and to draw noncompact districts must have been motivated by some other intent that was more important to the map drawers than honoring these traditional districting principles. Where no other motivation is offered, or the motivation offered is unconvincing, and other evidence demonstrates that partisan intent was present, irregularly shaped, noncompact districts and seemingly unnecessary county and municipality splits can support an inference of partisan intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   Comparing the 2012 map to Mr. Cooper's hypothetical maps (which dealt with the same incumbent-pairing situation as the map drawers in 2011 did) provides some proof of partisan intent. The 2012 map splits two counties four ways, five counties three ways, and sixteen counties two ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    757\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper's hypothetical maps, in contrast, split no counties four ways, only two counties three ways, and twelve counties in two ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    758\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper's hypothetical maps also have higher Polsby-Popper and Reock scores than the 2012 map, meaning that their districts are more compact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    759\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hypothetical maps also have core retention rates on par with that of the 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    760\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that Mr. Cooper was able to draw two hypothetical maps that comport with traditional redistricting principles as well or better than the 2012 map, pair the same configuration of incumbents, and result in more favorable partisan outcomes for Democratic voters suggests that the 2012 map was selected in order to engineer less favorable partisan outcomes for Democratic voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   Further, it does not take an expert or scientific analysis to see that the 2012 map is littered with oddly-shaped districts. It is true that district lines must be drawn somewhere, but even a cursory glance at the 2012 map shows how non-compact some districts are. When coupled with all of the other evidence regarding intent, we find that the irregularity of the boundaries\n   is further evidence that the districts' boundaries were drawn with a predominantly partisan intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the challenged map's \" 'bizarre' and 'irregular' shapes\" which were \"explicable only by the partisan make-up of the precincts the mapdrawers elected to place within and without the districts\" supported a finding of predominant partisan intent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   <strong>\n    v.

All four partisan-bias metrics he employed supported this conclusion, which held true across different elections that have occurred under the 2012 plan. We conclude that such strong and consistent pro-Republican partisan bias would be highly unlikely to occur without intentional manipulation of the district lines to achieve that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-506\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

Of course, a\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   claim does not have effect as an element. Rather, the harm under a\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   claim is an \"expressive\" harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Richard H. Pildes &amp; Richard H.

In partisan-gerrymandering cases, however, the harm includes partisan effect, and consequently Plaintiffs may rely on statewide evidence to prove that harm. In this case, a predominant partisan intent drove how the entire map was drawn, so it is logical that Plaintiffs should be able to rely on statewide evidence of effect, as well as district-by-district evidence. Just as a predominant partisan intent infected the whole map, the partisan-effect evidence discussed here shows efficient packing and cracking of Democratic voters across the whole map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   Lastly, the evidence discussed in this section could also be used to prove intent.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.C.1.b. In future cases, one would expect map drawers not to express clearly their pure partisan intentions, and there likely would be less clear direct evidence of partisan intent. The social-science metrics and simulated maps would then become even more important considerations, for evidence of sufficiently extreme partisan gerrymanders would support the contention that a state was predominantly motivated by partisanship.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.C.1.b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   Turning now to the evidence, the actual election results show a durable partisan effect across the map and support an inference of packing and cracking districts across the State. Every election has resulted in the election of twelve Republican representatives and four Democratic representatives. Even more alarming is the fact that the Republican candidates have consistently won the exact same districts: Districts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 16; and the Democratic candidates have consistently won the exact same districts: Districts 3, 9, 11, and 13. Thus, in each of these elections, 75% of the representatives elected in the State of Ohio were Republicans-despite fluctuations in the Republican statewide vote share. In the 2012 election, Republicans won only 51% of the statewide vote. In 2014, they won only 59% of the statewide vote. In 2016, they won only 57% of the statewide vote. In 2018, they won only 52% of the statewide vote. From a statewide perspective, then, at least 2012 and 2018 were quite competitive. At the individual district level, however, only four congressional elections-two in 2012 and two in 2018-have been competitive (within a 10% margin of victory, or within 55% to 45%) across the entire decade. Each of those competitive elections was won by Republican candidates; meanwhile, the lowest percentage of the vote that a winning Democratic candidate for Congress received in any election was 61%. Because the scientific evidence shows that such clustering is not the result of natural packing, this strongly suggests that Democratic voters were intentionally packed in large numbers into these four districts. Under the 2002 map, there were several districts that bounced between electing Democratic and Republican representatives-particularly Districts 6, 15, 16, and 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    763\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, the\n   actual statewide vote share in congressional elections does not suggest that Democratic voters should have expected to suffer from such a \"political famine,\" or such a \"political feast\" in the four districts that they have won, and, consequently, this raises suspicions of vote dilution.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Grandy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39646\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/997/#p1017\">\n    512 U.S. at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39646\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/997/#p1017\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"One may suspect vote dilution from political famine\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   Further, an array of social-science metrics demonstrates that the 2012 map's significant partisan bias in favor of Republicans in that the Republicans possess a major advantage in the translation of votes to seats compared to Democrats. This partisan bias is durable across the decade. In the 2012 and 2018 elections, the efficiency gap, declination, and partisan symmetry metrics were each more extreme and more pro-Republican than over 90% of previous elections.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.1. The mean-median difference also displays significant partisan bias, though less so than the other three metrics: in 2012, the mean-median difference was more extreme than \"in 83% of previous elections and more pro-Republican than ... in 92% of previous elections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    764\n   </footnotemark>\n   For 2018, the corresponding percentages were 62% and 81%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    765\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although not as strong, we still give weight to the fact that the mean-median difference jumped from 1.7% in 2010 (a successful Republican year) to 7.8% in 2012 and remained much higher, at 5%, in 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    766\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2014 and 2016, these four metrics do not indicate quite as much partisan bias; however, that makes sense given that Republicans performed better in those years. In fact, that just proves the point-when the statewide congressional vote was nearly split between the two parties, the same results were achieved as when Republicans did markedly better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   The lack of competitive elections compared to what one would expect based on Ohio's natural political geography also indicates that Democratic voters have been packed and cracked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    767\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cho's analysis showed that under the simulated maps, one would expect at least a handful of competitive elections across the State in each election, with Democratic candidates winning some of those elections and Republican candidates winning others.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.2.b.i. Again, the current map had only two competitive elections in the 2012 cycle, and only two competitive elections in the 2018 cycle-all favoring Republicans. The evidence of packing is perhaps the strongest, as every Democratic candidate who has won an election under the current map has garnered over 60% of the vote-a stark contrast in comparison to the simulated maps in which Democratic candidates are projected to run in several competitive elections. Given the continued dearth of competitive elections for both parties, we credit Dr. Cho's conclusion that the margins of victory \"are sufficiently insulating\n   to produce an enduring effect\" in favor of Republicans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    768\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-515\">\n   Moreover, we conclude that the districts are effectively entrenched to favor Republican candidates overall. We thus credit Dr. Warshaw's conclusion that \"Democratic voters in Ohio are efficiently packed and cracked across districts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    769\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusion is supported, in part, by the evidence outlined above. Additionally, Dr. Warshaw's first uniform swing analysis shows that \"Democrats would win only 37.5% of the seats in Ohio's congressional districts [or 6 out of 16 seats] even if they won 55% of the statewide vote.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    770\n   </footnotemark>\n   Incorporating the 2018 election results produced only a slight difference, with Democrats winning half the seats when they achieve 55% of the vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    771\n   </footnotemark>\n   The swing analysis demonstrates entrenchment because it shows that the 2012 map's design is such that the overall Republican advantage will be maintained, absent a rather seismic shift in the statewide vote share in favor of Democratic candidates. This evidence of entrenchment adds more weight to Plaintiffs' vote-dilution claims and strongly shows that the districts are impervious to \"the potential fluidity of American political life.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027224\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/431/#p439\">\n    403 U.S. at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027224\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/431/#p439\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   Critically, the evidence shows that the map enacted in H.B. 369 is an outlier in terms of its partisan effects. Dr. Warshaw's findings on the pro-Republican tilt and extreme nature of the partisan-bias metrics provide considerable weight for this conclusion. Dr. Cho's seat-share analysis bolsters the fact that H.B. 369 is an outlier. In her initial analysis, none of the simulated maps produced the same 12-4 seat share as the current map; using updated data, only 0.046% of the simulated maps (1,445 out of over 3 million) produced the same 12-4 seat share.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.2.b.iii. In this case, we are not confronted with a difficult question about the margins of what constitutes an outlier. By almost every measure, H.B. 369 has produced partisan effects that are more extreme than over 90% of prior elections, and several of the measures show that this map is over 95% more extreme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   Defendants contest the usefulness and appropriateness of Dr. Cho's simulated maps as a comparison to the current map because the simulated maps do not factor in incumbent protection. We find these arguments largely unpersuasive. To begin, the simulated maps incorporate only neutral districting criteria, and thus, they serve as useful non-partisan baselines against which to compare the current map's partisanship. In this case, these non-partisan baselines demonstrate the typical type of maps one would expect based on the State's natural political geography. Second, to the extent that the General Assembly\n   <em>\n    legitimately\n   </em>\n   sought to avoid the pairing of incumbents, we find that Dr. Cho's failure to account for this factor partially reduces the strength of her conclusion that the 12-4 map cannot be explained by legitimate redistricting criteria. Even so, we still find Dr. Cho's simulated maps to support an inference of partisan effect and intent due to the overbreadth of Defendants' incumbent-protection explanation, its shaky evidentiary foundation, and the sheer extremity of the pro-Republican or pro-Democratic leanings of the current districts, as demonstrated by Dr. Cho's comparison analysis. We fully address the incumbent-protection justification for H.B. 369 later in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   As will be explained, we find that Defendants have stretched the incumbent-protection justification too far in this case, and, in some respects, the justification simply does not hold up based on the facts. We observe that Representative Huffman clearly described incumbent protection as \"subservient\" to other criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. J01 (Ohio House Session, Sept. 15, 2011 at 19) (statement of Rep. Huffman). Moreover, Dr. Cho's findings on her simulated maps' partisan outcomes so starkly contrast with the current map that, to the extent incumbent protection explains\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the current map's partisan effect, Dr. Cho's analyses provide support, along with other evidence in this case, that this justification cannot explain the consistent 12-4 seat share of the current map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   We now turn to an analysis of each individual district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. District-by-District analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   In this section, we complement the statewide evidence of intent and effect with evidence specific to each district. We show that each district was drawn with a predominant intent to dilute the votes of Democrats and that each district actually dilutes the votes of Democrats by either packing or cracking Democrats into the district. In doing so, we address and reject herein some of the particular partisan-neutral explanations that Defendants offer for certain districts. In the next section, we explore more fully some of the overarching justifications that Defendants advance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   <strong>\n    i. District 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   District 1 encompasses all of Warren County and irregularly shaped and disjointed portions of Hamilton County, including western portions of the City of Cincinnati. The district wraps strangely around the eastern portion of Cincinnati, surrounding it on three sides.\n   <footnotemark>\n    772\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   As Dr. Niven described, rather than leaving intact the City of Cincinnati, an obvious community of interest that leans Democratic, the map drawers made a deliberate choice to split the city in half in an\n   irregular shape. One half was paired with heavily Republican Warren County to make a Republican District 1. The other half was paired with Republican rural southern Ohio counties to make a Republican District 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    773\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Niven's report demonstrated that the Cincinnati neighborhoods that were split were particularly likely to be Democratic strongholds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    774\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the \"demographic evidence reveals that [the] district's bizarre lines coincide with the historical voting patterns of the precincts included in, or excluded from, the district.\"\n   <em>\n    Rucho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526031\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/777/#p827\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore conclude that District 1's bizarre lines (wrapping around portions of the City of Cincinnati on three sides) and the fact that it vivisects an obvious community of interest, which together split a Democratic city to create two solidly Republican districts, is evidence that partisan intent dominated the drawing of District 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Covington\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2553 (considering \"circumstantial evidence of [the] district's shape and demographics\" as evidence of racial gerrymandering).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-525\">\n   It is true that Hamilton County has a population larger than the ideal equipopulous district and therefore cannot be entirely contained within a single district; the county must be divided to some extent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    775\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, we reject the argument that the need to split Hamilton County is a neutral explanation for District 1 being drawn as was. Even though Hamilton County needed to be split between two congressional districts, it did not have to be split in such an irregular shape and need not have divided the City of Cincinnati, a clear community of interest, in such a dramatic fashion. For example, Mr. Cooper's hypothetical maps, which were designed as viable alternatives that could have been enacted in 2011, and which match or better the enacted map in terms of their compliance with traditional redistricting principles, maintain the City of Cincinnati intact to a far greater degree than the 2012 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    776\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-526\">\n   We can discern no legitimate reason behind the division of the City of Cincinnati other than the desire to crack its Democratic voters, disabling a cohesive center that would likely have elected a Democratic representative and instead facilitating the creation of another Republican district. DiRossi testified that \"[t]he intention [in 2011] was to try to have one whole county in [District 1] somehow.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    777\n   </footnotemark>\n   DiRossi testified that Warren County was selected to be the whole county, and portions of Hamilton County would be drawn in to reach the ideal population.\n   <footnotemark>\n    778\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that the decision to include Warren County \"impact[ed] the shape of the district in Hamilton County ... [b]ecause in order to have most of the west side and Cincinnati in the district, but also connect to Warren County ... you had to come across the northern area of places like Evendale and some of the other Springfield Township northern places to connect them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    779\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-527\">\n   We find this explanation for District 1's shape and the division of the City of Cincinnati entirely unconvincing, false, and indicative of partisan intent. In fact, DiRossi's explanation of the contours of District 1 provokes more questions than it answers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-528\">\n   Why was Warren County, rather than Butler County or Clermont County selected as the county to pair with Hamilton County? Why was the intention to try to have one whole county in District 1? This did not appear to be a pressing concern elsewhere-Districts 13 and 9 are composed entirely of partial counties. Why did the map drawers want to have the\n   <em>\n    west side\n   </em>\n   of Hamilton County in the district, requiring them \"to come across the northern area\"? What was wrong with the east side? Most importantly, DiRossi's explanation of the shape of the district fails to explain why the City of Cincinnati was split as it is and why keeping Warren County whole was more important than preserving the obvious community of interest embodied in the City of Cincinnati.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    429 U.S. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Substantive departures [from normal procedure] may be relevant, particularly if the factors usually considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached.\").

Rather, given the substantial evidence of partisan intent discussed above, we conclude that the more plausible explanation for District 1's configuration was the predominant desire to crack Democratic voters in Cincinnati, a cohesive center that would likely have elected a Democratic representative. Instead, the design of District 1 facilitated the dilution of these Cincinnati Democrats' votes by splitting them between two majority-Republican districts-Districts 1 and 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-529\">\n   Further, we conclude that the 2012 map did crack Democratic voters in Hamilton County in District 1. We first note that District 1 has elected Republican representatives in every election that followed the redistricting. This durability in and of itself is some evidence of cracking in District 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding proof of partisan effect in \"the fact that the Democratic candidate was elected in the three elections following the 2011 redistricting\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   Second, the partisan effects of District 1 were durable because the district was drawn in a way to ensure the election of a Republican representative. Evidence proves that entrenchment resulted in this case. In 2012, Republican Representative Steve Chabot was elected with 57.73% of the vote. In 2014, he won with 63.22% of the vote. In 2016, he won with 59.19% of the vote. In 2018, he won with 51.32% of the vote. Thus, only one of these elections was competitive-the last, which occurred during a significant Democratic swing election year. Democratic candidate Aftab Pureval challenged Representative Chabot in District 1 in 2018. Pureval spent $ 4,059,690.53 on his campaign while Representative Chabot only spent $ 2,991,573.88.\n   <footnotemark>\n    780\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even under those conditions, however, the composition of the district allowed Representative Chabot to hold off his Democratic challenger. District 1's election results under the 2012 map are evidence of its lack of competitiveness and responsiveness (i.e., entrenchment), achieved through cracking. Indeed, Kincaid stated that he understood District 1 would result in entrenchment. Immediately after the redistricting, Kincaid expressed his belief that District 1 had moved seven PVI points in favor of Republicans and had thus been taken \"out of play.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    781\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mapmaking that takes a district \"out of play\" certainly has\n   partisan effects-it converts a district that could previously be won by a candidate from either party into one that will consistently elect a member of the favored party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding partisan effect where the design of the district resulted in a large swing in PVI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   District 1's consistent election of a Republican Congressman under the 2012 plan stands in stark contrast to former District 1's status as a swing district under the 2002 plan. In 2006, District 1 elected Republican Representative Chabot, who won with 52.25% of the vote. In 2008, District 1 elected Democratic Representative Steve Driehaus with 52.47% of the vote. In 2010, District 1 flipped back to elect Republican Representative Chabot, this time winning by an even narrower margin with 51.49% of the vote. The 2012 map redrew District 1 in a fashion that diluted Democratic support by cracking the Democratic City of Cincinnati and paired those portions of Cincinnati with rural Republican strongholds, thereby eliminating the threat that District 1 would flip Democratic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding partisan effect where \"Republican voters in the new Sixth District were, in\n   <em>\n    relative\n   </em>\n   terms, much less likely to elect their preferred candidate than before the 2011 redistricting, and, in\n   <em>\n    absolute\n   </em>\n   terms, they had no real chance of doing so\").

We conclude that the unnecessary and irregular splitting of Hamilton County and the Democratic City of Cincinnati provides ample proof of a predominant partisan intent to crack District 2. This evidence is supplemented by the general evidence of partisan intent in crafting the 2012 map, discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-536\">\n   We also conclude that the 2012 map had the effect of cracking Democratic voters from the Cincinnati area in District 2.

In 2018, he won with 57.55% of the vote. None of these elections was competitive because the design of District 2 tempered Democratic support from the Cincinnati area with sufficient Republican territory to ensure a Republican victory. The consistent election of a Republican representative by \"safe\" margins is evidence of cracking in District 2.

Under the pre-2012 map, District 2 had been solidly Republican, with only 40.60% of voters supporting President Obama in the 2008 election. Had the same election occurred with District 2 as it is currently composed, 44.98% of voters would have supported President Obama.\n   <footnotemark>\n    787\n   </footnotemark>\n   This evidence demonstrates that the redistricting decreased the district's considerable partisan margin as\n   Democratic voters from the Cincinnati area were absorbed by the new District 2.

This is an example of efficient cracking at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-538\">\n   Dr. Cho's simulated maps provide additional evidence of the cracking effect in District 2. 99.87% of Dr. Cho's non-partisan maps would have placed Plaintiff Burks, who lives in current District 2, in a district that would have had a better chance of electing a Democrat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    788\n   </footnotemark>\n   This evidence further suggests that the design of District 2 under the 2012 map is at least partially responsible for Democratic voters' difficulty electing a Democratic representative in that district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-539\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Related evidence demonstrates that national Republican\n   consultants used descriptors such as \"awful\" or \"dog meat\" voting territory to describe \"downtown\" areas that they wanted carved out of District 15 and placed into District 3, which further supports our finding that partisan intent predominated in the design of District 3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 518-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding invidious partisan intent where \"the State intentionally moved Republican voters out of the Sixth District en masse, based on precinct-level data\"). Third, national Republicans Whatman and Kincaid testified that they conceived of the idea to create the new, Democratic District 3. Their primary role in its creation is further proof that the predominant reason for the district's design was to facilitate Republican advantage. Fourth, since the 2012 map was enacted, District 3 has consistently elected the Democratic candidate by large margins-64.06-73.61% of the vote. Meanwhile, adjacent Districts 12 and 15 have consistently elected Republican representatives, despite Democratic swing years such as 2018. The consistency and durability of the partisan results in this constellation of districts and the lack of competitiveness in District 3 are strong evidence that District 3 was designed to pack Democrats and waste significant numbers of Democratic votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-542\">\n   We evaluate other explanations of the district put forth by Defendants and conclude that while each of these considerations may have played a role in the shaping of District 3, none was the primary force behind its creation. Rather, all other considerations were secondary to the predominant aim of packing Democratic voters into a highly saturated new Democratic district, thus allowing map drawers to shore up Republican advantage in Districts 12 and 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-543\">\n   Defendants argue first that they created the new District 3 because of Columbus's growing population. It is true that Ohio's population was shifting and that the Columbus area was one of the few areas in the State that was experiencing population growth. On the one hand, without more, there is nothing inherently suspect or partisan about creating a new congressional district to encompass a coherent community of interest (the City of Columbus) in a growing population center. On the other hand, population growth in a metropolitan area does not necessitate the drawing of a new district around that area. We conclude, based on the evidence discussed above, that the reason the Republican map drawers chose to allocate Columbus's growing population to the new District 3 was because of the partisan advantage that strategy conferred to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-544\">\n   Defendants next argue that District 3 \"was drawn the way it was\" because Speaker Batchelder's \"relationship with Congresswoman Beatty and her husband Otto Beatty led him to have a priority to create a central district in Franklin County encompassing Columbus and having representation specifically for Congressman [sic] Joyce Beatty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    793\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that although Republican map drawers drew District 3 with Joyce Beatty (a former member of the Ohio House of Representatives who had never served in Congress at the time of the map drawing) in mind, supporting her prospects as a candidate was only a secondary consideration. Once Kincaid and Whatman decided to draw a new Democratic seat to pack Democratic votes in Franklin County, that Democratic seat would have to be filled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    794\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-545\">\n   The fact that Batchelder's relationship with the Beattys eventually led Republican map drawers to draw District 3 with Joyce Beatty in mind does not disturb our finding that partisan intent predominated in its creation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   Defendants also argue that District 3 was drawn to create a minority-opportunity district, but we do not find that this aim played a significant role in the creation of District 3. The Republican map drawers were simultaneously seriously considering an alternative plan to split Franklin County and Columbus into four congressional districts. Had Franklin County been split in four ways, the African-American voter population would have been split rather than included in a coherent minority-opportunity district. Despite now professing the creation of a minority-opportunity district as a motivation behind District 3's design, the evidence shows that the map drawers seriously considered adopting an alternative plan which would have undermined that very goal. We accordingly question the sincerity and veracity of this proffered justification. We further analyze this justification in conjunction with a similar justification offered for District 11 below, after considering each individual district.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iii. We note now, however, that a district could still have been drawn with a nearly identical BVAP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    795\n   </footnotemark>\n   but with a more regular shape, fewer county splits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    796\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a considerably less severe partisan bias.\n   <footnotemark>\n    797\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was not, and we infer from the fact that the chosen design contributes to the partisan bias of the map that its creators intended it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   Defendants argue that national Republicans advanced the idea for the four-way split of Columbus and that Ohio Republicans, who had different goals and intentions, firmly rejected that idea. That portrayal contradicts the evidence of the collaborative relationship between the national and state-level Republicans as well as the content of specific communications discussing the reason the four-way split, which would have resulted in 13-3 map, was rejected. It was the desire to \"put the most number of seats in the safety zone given the political geography of the state, our media markets, and how best to allocate caucus resources\" that led to the rejection of the four-way split idea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    798\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore conclude that the four-way split was rejected not because it conflicted with state-level Republicans' goals for the map, but rather because the Republican seat advantage that it would have conferred would have been too tenuous. The reasons for the rejection of the proposed four-way split of Franklin County is additional proof supporting our conclusion that partisan intent was the predominant factor in drawing District 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   In sum, even accepting all of Defendants' proffered justifications for drawing District 3, we conclude that they were secondary to the map drawers' predominant intent: conferring Republican advantage\n   by packing District 3 and facilitating the cracking of Districts 12 and 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   We also conclude that District 3 actually packed Democratic voters. The historical election results provide proof of the packing effect-a Democratic candidate has won every election under the 2012 map.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding proof of partisan effect in \"the fact that the Democratic candidate was elected in the three elections following the 2011 redistricting\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   The margin by which that candidate has won shows that Democratic voters are packed into the district in a way that renders the district noncompetitive. In 2012, Democratic candidate Joyce Beatty was elected to Congress with 68.29% of the vote. In 2014, she won with 64.06% of the vote. In 2016, she won with 68.57% of the vote. In 2018, she won with 73.61% of the vote. None of these elections were even close to competitive; they were all landslide victories for Beatty. Beatty's consistent election also demonstrates the durability of the 2012 map's partisan effect in District 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-551\">\n   Dr. Niven also demonstrated a stark difference in the political leanings of voters within Franklin County who were placed in District 3 and voters within Franklin County who were placed in Districts 12 and 15. Franklin County voters within District 3 had pro-Democratic partisan index score of .3268. Meanwhile, Franklin County voters within Districts 12 and 15 had pro-Republican partisan index scores of 0.5105 and 0.5237, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    799\n   </footnotemark>\n   This demonstrates both the intent to pack voters and the effect of concentrating the most Democratic sections of Franklin County within District 3 while allotting the less Democratic sections to Districts 12 and 15 to facilitate their overall Republican compositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   Finally, Dr. Cho's simulated maps also provide proof of the packing effect in District 3. Zero percent of Dr. Cho's simulated maps would place Plaintiff Inskeep, a current resident of District 3, in a district where she would have a better chance of electing a Democratic representative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    800\n   </footnotemark>\n   The map drawers managed to draw a map that maximized the concentration of Democratic voters in Plaintiff Inskeep's area-a highly efficient packing job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-553\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. District 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-554\">\n   District 4 encompasses all of Allen, Auglaize, Shelby, Logan, Union, Champaign, Crawford, Seneca, and Sandusky Counties. It makes a small intrusion into Mercer County that is a part of a three-way split of Mercer County. Additionally, it is involved in the three-way split of Lorain County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    801\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also includes parts of Marion, Huron, and Erie Counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-555\">\n   The statewide evidence of partisan intent in the map-drawing process, discussed above, supports a finding of predominant partisan intent to pack District 4. We also conclude that the 2012 map actually cracked Democratic voters in District 4. First, historical election results support this finding as District 4 has been won by a Republican in every election under the 2012 map.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding proof of partisan effect in \"the fact that the Democratic candidate was elected in the three elections following the 2011 redistricting\"). Second, the wide margins by which the Republican candidate won each election under the 2012 map show its entrenchment effect, a biproduct of efficient cracking. The map entrenched Republicans in power by drawing District 4 as a \"safe\" Republican seat. None of these elections that have occurred in District 4 since the enactment of the 2012 map have been competitive.

Its narrow, long footprint has earned it the nickname \"the Snake on the Lake.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    809\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district includes portions of\n   Lucas, Ottawa, Erie, Lorain, and Cuyahoga Counties; it does not include a single county in its entirety.

We agree with Mr. Cooper's analysis that District 9 severed communities of interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    811\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite all the territory in District 9 being adjacent to Lake Erie, in order to create District 9 \"you've got to split about five counties which in and of themselves are communities of interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    812\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper's hypothetical maps demonstrate that it is possible to draw a far more coherent District 9 that respects county boundaries while still complying with all traditional redistricting principles and pairing the same amount of incumbents from the same political parties as the 2012 map did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    813\n   </footnotemark>\n   The presence of such an alternative and the map drawers' decision instead to split counties and draw a bizarrely shaped district support our conclusion that partisan intent predominated in drawing of District 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-580\">\n   In concluding that the predominant intent behind the design of District 9 was partisan packing of Democratic voters, we reject Defendants' argument that bipartisan incumbent protection efforts and Democratic desires dictated its shape. There is no admissible record evidence suggesting that Democratic leaders desired the pairing of Representatives Kaptur and Kucinich. Representative Kaptur testified that she did not discover that she was being paired with Representative Kucinich until very close to the legislative introduction of the bill. She learned of the map's design from a newspaper and was \"astonished\" by the shape of her new district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    814\n   </footnotemark>\n   She did not request to be paired with Representative Kucinich and, in fact, was outraged at the prospect because she believed that the new district \"hack[ed] towns apart\" and showed \"no respect for counties\" and \"no respect for communities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    815\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kaptur's involvement in shaping the district began only after the Ohio General Assembly passed the initial H.B. 319. She then attempted to negotiate so that the Republican map drawers would make some alterations to the district in which she was paired with Kucinich. The heart of the plan for District 9, however, remained the same. Representative Kaptur's ability to secure minor concessions following the\n   passage of H.B. 319 does not amount to her designing the district and does not overcome the partisan intent that motivated the drawing of District 9 in the first place. We therefore reject as unsupported by admissible evidence the Defendants' contention that District 9 was the result of the Democratic desire that Representatives Kaptur and Kucinich be paired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-581\">\n   To the extent that Defendants claim that the shape of District 9 was preordained by the cluster of Democratic incumbent residences in northern Ohio, their argument is undermined by the evidence. Mr. Cooper, a redistricting expert, stated that \"it made no sense to create a Snake on the Lake just to pair [Kaptur and Kucinich]. It just baffles me as to why that was done.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    816\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cooper demonstrated that this pairing was unnecessary by drawing two hypothetical maps that could have been drawn in 2011 that avoided drawing the elongated District 9 either by pairing Representatives Kucinich and Fudge or pairing Kucinich and Sutton, all while honoring the other traditional districting principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    817\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both of these hypothetical maps would actually have facilitated the avoidance of one incumbent pairing because they leave a version of District 10 in western Cuyahoga County and Lorain County with no Democratic incumbent-Representative Kucinich could have avoided his pairing with either Representative Sutton or Representative Fudge by running in that district instead.\n   <footnotemark>\n    818\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument therefore does not disturb our conclusion that the predominant intent was securing Republican partisan advantage in the creation of the long, snaking District 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-582\">\n   We also conclude that the 2012 map had the effect of packing Democratic voters in District 9.

In 2018, she won with 67.79% of the vote. None of these elections were even close to competitive; Representative Kaptur consistently won with 15-20% of the vote more than necessary to carry the district.

In 2018, he won with 55.92% of the vote. None of these elections, even that occurring during the 2018 Democratic swing year, were competitive.

District 11 was designed to absorb Democratic voters who were formerly Representative Sutton's constituents so that the new District 16 could be weighted to produce the victory of Republican Representative Renacci.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530865\" index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/867/#p933\">\n    373 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   945 n.39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201856625\">\n    2019 WL 1856625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *57 n.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   The decision to depart from District 11's historical territory and to drop down into Summit County and pick up additional Democratic voters from the City of Akron under the 2012 map is strong proof of the intent to pack District 11 and facilitate the cracking of District 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    823\n   </footnotemark>\n   The historical boundaries of District 11, contained entirely within Cuyahoga County, make the decision to extend the district into Summit County suspect. Mr. Cooper's hypothetical plans contain District 11 entirely within Cuyahoga, in line with its historical location, while respecting other traditional redistricting concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    824\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that it was possible to draw District 11 fully within Cuyahoga is some evidence that the jaunt downward into Summit County was drawn for partisan reasons. We conclude that the predominant reason that District 11 ventured for the first time out of Cuyahoga County in the 2012 map was as a result of the map drawers' partisan intent to pack voters in District 11 and crack voters in District 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-593\">\n   The historical election results in the years that followed the redistricting are proof of the map drawers' intent. Representative Fudge in the packed District 11 has won each election by huge margins. Her\n   <em>\n    lowest\n   </em>\n   portion of the vote in an election since the redistricting has been 79.45%. Meanwhile, in District 16, incumbent Republican Representative Renacci narrowly defeated incumbent Democratic\n   Representative Sutton in 2012. Once he had vanquished the opposing incumbent, Renacci proceeded to win his successive elections by large margins.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.c.xvi. (discussing District 16). It was no coincidence that District 16 went Republican; the packing of District 11 facilitated the result. The day after the introduction of H.B. 319 in committee, Mann sent an email to Renacci informing him that, under the proposed bill, 16.98% of Representative Sutton's former district would be included within the new District 11, while only 25.79% of her former district would carry over into the new District 16, in which she was expected to run.\n   <footnotemark>\n    825\n   </footnotemark>\n   This evidence supports our conclusion that partisan intent predominated in the drawing of District 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-594\">\n   In concluding the intent to pack District 11 to dilute Democratic voting power predominated in crafting District 11, we reject or find secondary several alternative explanations for its shape. First, Defendants claim that District 11 was drawn by Republican map drawers with the intention of creating a majority-minority district. They argue that even if their implementation of this goal was flawed, so long as the map drawers honestly believed that the way in which they drew the district would aid minority electoral opportunity, they cannot be found at fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252 (Defs.' &amp; Intervenors' Post-Trial Br. at 21-22) (citing employment discrimination cases). There was no proof that such an extension of the District was made for any legitimate reason, and we reject Defendants' assertion that uninformed guesswork about VRA compliance is sufficient to justify the packing of African-American voters into a Democratic district.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iii. (discussing compliance with the VRA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-595\">\n   Second, no admissible evidence supports Defendants' assertion that Democratic leaders in the African-American community approved of and desired District 11's current shape. Defendants offered Judy, DiRossi, and Speaker Batchelder's testimony about conversations that allegedly occurred with African-American Democratic leaders solely for the effect that those conversations purportedly had on the map drawers. However, in the next breath, they offer the testimony about those conversations for their truth-to prove their assertion that the design of District 11 and its concentration of African-American voters and Democratic voters was a shared bipartisan goal. But this assertion relies on the truth of out-of-court statements of since deceased Democrats from Northern Ohio. The hearsay rules prevent us from taking Judy, DiRossi, and Speaker Batchelder's word for what those individuals actually wanted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-596\">\n   Third, we conclude that any input that Representative Fudge herself had on the shape of her district occurred well after the unveiling and passage of H.B. 319, in the scramble to secure Democratic support for a new bill that occurred in the shadow of the referendum. This input amounted to securing small tweaks and concessions, but the overarching contours of the map were already fixed and did not change. Fudge stated that she had no input in the drawing of her district's lines prior to the legislative unveiling and that she was quite displeased with the shape of the district and the way that it reached down into Summit County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    826\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-597\">\n   Finally, we do not find that Defendants' argument that declining population in Northeastern Ohio necessitated stretching District 11 southward adequately explains the shape of District 11. There were myriad ways that these population constraints could have been handled. It is no coincidence that the way chosen by Republican map drawers resulted in packing Democratic voters in District 11 and cracking Democratic support for Representative Sutton in the new District 16. Mr. Cooper's alternative hypothetical maps also dealt with the population shifts in Ohio but managed to produce two different equipopulous versions of District 11 that do not extend the district south into Summit County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    827\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having considered Defendants' alternative explanations for the shape of District 11, we conclude that the predominant intent that motivated the drawing of the district in its current form was the desire to pack Democratic voters in District 11 and crack Democratic voters elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-598\">\n   We also conclude that the 2012 map had the effect of packing Democratic voters into District 11 in a dramatic fashion. Historical election results provide some proof of this packing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding proof of partisan effect in \"the fact that the Democratic candidate was elected in the three elections following the 2011 redistricting\").

None of these elections were even close to competitive-Representative Fudge, when challenged, consistently won with around 30% more of the vote than would have been actually needed to carry the district. The extreme margins by which Fudge won her seat provide some evidence of packing in District 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-599\">\n   Dr. Niven's report helps illustrate why the addition of portions of Summit County to District 11 facilitated its packing.

Allotting these Democratic Summit County voters to District 11, which was already destined to deliver a Democratic representative, meant that there were fewer Democratic voters in the area of Summit County that could potentially be assigned to neighboring Districts such as District 16, which were intended to deliver Republican victories. The subsequent election results, in which Representative Fudge repeatedly won District 11 by a landslide and Republican candidates consistently won District 16, are clear evidence of a packing effect in District 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-600\">\n   Finally, Dr. Cho's simulated maps provide further evidence of packing in District 11.

That was the Democrats' worst year in congressional elections in the prior decade. Even taking note of the strong Republican performance that year, the argument that allocating 25% of the congressional seats to Democrats fairly allocates political power in accordance with that Party's voting strength falls apart. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   is far from dispositive, and we find it completely distinguishable from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-636\">\n   In fact, even despite their argument that\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   is dispositive, Defendants also admit that the State \"focused on preserving the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   incumbency-constituent relationship rather than on creating the 'proportional representation' sought in\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252 (Defs.' &amp; Intervenors' Post-Trial Br. at 6). First, this argument seems to contradict their initial argument about\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   . Second, Defendants basically admit that their goal was a 12-4 map.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"Because of the pre-reapportionment 13-5 partisan split, divvying up the lost seats [after the census] fairly meant a 12-4 split.\").

For the reasons articulated above, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-637\">\n   At bottom, Defendants' arguments on this score are aimed at trying to justify entrenchment and incumbent\n   <em>\n    insulation\n   </em>\n   from political challenges, not incumbent protection as understood by Supreme Court precedent.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases in which the Supreme Court has been skeptical of the argument of preserving the status quo for incumbents). Finally, we note that this present line of defense-that the primary goal of the map was to preserve the status quo for all incumbents-contradicts statements made by the redistricting plan's sponsor in the Ohio State House. Representative Huffman clearly described incumbent protection as \"a subservient [goal] to the other ones that [he] listed\" and further explained\n   that, \"[n]obody has a district.... There's nobody that owns a piece of land in Congress.

Defendants' argument goes like this: the 2010 congressional election left Ohio with 13 Republican representatives and 5 Democratic Representatives. The decision to pair one set of Republican incumbents and one set of Democratic incumbents, a politically fair decision, would lead to a 12-4 map. The enacted map is a 12-4 map; ergo the redistricting process was fair. But this argument obscures complexities and nuances that significantly undermine Defendants' version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-639\">\n   First, to say that the redistricting process simply transformed a 13-5 map into a 12-4 map ignores two key considerations, which are intimately related with one another: competitiveness and responsiveness. Yes, the pre-redistricting map was a 13-5 map in that 13 Republican representatives and 5 Democratic representatives had been elected under it in 2010. But it had not consistently been a 13-5 map over the course of its life. It contained competitive districts and was responsive to shifts in voter preference and turnout over the years. In contrast, the 12-4 map created in the redistricting process is a 12-4 map through and through. It minimized competitive districts and responsiveness to changes in voter preferences. It is no coincidence that correspondence between the insiders crafting the map refer to \"lock[ing] in\" the 12-4 division and ensuring \"safe seats.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528577\" index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/348/493/#p514\">\n    348 F.Supp.3d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering where \"Democratic officials ... worked to craft a map that would specifically transform the Sixth District into one that would\n   <em>\n    predictably\n   </em>\n   elect a Democrat by removing Republicans from the District and adding Democrats in their place\"). The redistricting meant that the parties suffered an equal reduction in seats between the 2010 election and the 2012 election, as Defendants emphasize. However, Defendants minimize the fact that the redistricting also effectively guaranteed that the most seats that Democratic voters could secure for their party in any future election under that map was four, and the fewest seats that Republican voters could secure for their party in any future election was twelve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-640\">\n   Second, the map drawers paired more sets of incumbents than Ohio's population stagnation required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    852\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not only did the map drawers pair a set of Republican incumbents and a set of Democratic incumbents, they also paired an extra set: one Democratic incumbent, Betty Sutton, against one Republican incumbent, Jim Renacci. They then drew the district in\n   which Sutton and Renacci were paired, the new District 16, to include far more of Renacci's former constituents than Sutton's, which gave him a considerable advantage in the race that ensued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    853\n   </footnotemark>\n   This undermines Defendants' claim that a bipartisan desire for incumbent protection dominated the map-drawing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-641\">\n   Third, Defendants repeatedly emphasize that the reason that incumbent protection is a legitimate motivation in redistricting is because incumbents, particularly those with considerable experience serving in their elected office, wield that seniority for the benefit of their constituents. Yet, the map drawers chose to pair two senior Republican incumbents, Representatives Turner and Austria, after considering and rejecting the possibility of pairing two freshmen Republican incumbents, Representatives Gibbs and Johnson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    854\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evidence demonstrates that partisan intent motivated that decision. In \"talking points\" that Whatman sent to President Niehaus, Whatman wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-642\">\n   A Gibbs/Johnson map results in 3 districts with a base Republican vote under 50 percent. A Turner/Austria map only has one district under 50.... Putting two members together in another region of the state merely because they are freshmen that results in an overall worse map for republicans in the state is simply not the right thing to do. Boehner is not happy about this but it is the tough decision that is the right thing for Republicans for the next decade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    855\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-643\">\n   This correspondence demonstrates that when the map-drawing process pitted the competing concerns of incumbent-advantage protection against partisan-advantage protection, partisan-advantage protection dominated. The decision to pair senior Republican incumbents thus undermines the credibility of Defendants' assertion that incumbent protection was the primary consideration in the redistricting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-644\">\n   Fourth, Ohio Republican map drawers themselves claimed at the time that incumbent protection was not their primary concern. When presenting the bill in the Ohio House of Representatives, Representative Huffman detailed the competing concerns that the creators of the bill had considered when drafting the H.B. 319 map. He characterized equipopulation as \"the lodestone,\" called VRA compliance an \"important precept[ ],\" and then listed \"several other traditional redistricting principles ...: compactness, contiguity, preservation of political subdivisions, preservation of communities of interest, preservation of cores of prior districts, and protection of incumbents.\" He then made a point of stating that protection of incumbents was \"subservient ... to the other ones that I\n   listed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    856\n   </footnotemark>\n   Representative Huffman went on:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-645\">\n   You know, we talked-a year ago someone came up to me and said, \"Are we going to get rid of Kucinich's district?\" And I said, \"Look, Kucinich doesn't have a district. Nobody has a district. Every two years, there's an election, and that's how it works. That's how the system works. There's nobody that owns a piece of land in Congress. People elected them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    857\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-646\">\n   We acknowledge that politicians may make representations on the floor of the House that diverge from the true account of their priorities in creating a bill. We must, however, note the tension between the post-hoc justification that Defendants offer for the bill-incumbent protection as the primary motivation-and Representative Huffman's express minimization of the incumbent-protection concern on the floor of the House.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-647\">\n   Additionally, Defendants' portrayal of the incumbent-protection goal as bipartisan mischaracterizes the facts. Only hazy, inadmissible multi-level hearsay testimony was offered to support their claim that Democratic leaders wanted Kucinich and Kaptur to be the paired Democratic incumbents. The evidence indicates that the Republican and Democratic Caucuses did their map drawing entirely separately, particularly in the early stages when major decisions such as the pairing of incumbents were being made. Both Congresswoman Kaptur and Congresswoman Fudge insisted that they had no say whatsoever in the design of the map prior to its introduction as H.B. 319, and the incumbent pairings were not altered between H.B. 319 and the passage of H.B. 369.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-648\">\n   Finally, we reject what seems to be Defendants' argument that because the Supreme Court has sanctioned incumbent protection as a legitimate concern in the redistricting process in some instances, any kind of incumbent-protecting behavior is legitimate and may be used to justify the drawing of district lines. The Supreme Court has expressed its acceptance of districting \"that minimizes the number of contests between present incumbents,\" which in its view \"does not in and of itself establish invidiousness.\"\n   <em>\n    Burns v.

The map drawers drew one more incumbent pairing than the bare minimum in a state that had its congressional delegation reduced by two. But the majority of its line-drawing decisions were motivated not by the legitimate incumbent-protection goal of \"avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives,\" but rather by the goal of avoiding contests between Democrats and Republicans in general. The Republican map drawers drew noncompetitive, nonresponsive districts by grouping bodies of voters who would elect a Democrat-any Democrat-or a Republican-any Republican. This is not the incumbent protection that the Supreme Court has endorsed. In fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly cast aspersions on this type of incumbent insulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Randall v.

The map drawers contemplated packing Democratic voters into three districts and cracking them among the remaining thirteen. The map drawers, however, did not feel that that strategy would guarantee sufficiently predictable pro-Republican outcomes; it allowed for too much competition and responsiveness. They decided twelve Republican seats in the hand was better than thirteen in the bush, and so four Democratic districts were born.

None of these concessions meaningfully impacted the central intent of H.B. 319-the enactment of a map that was nearly certain to allow for the election of twelve Republican congressional representatives and four Democratic congressional representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    858\n   </footnotemark>\n   Speaker Batchelder himself testified that while some negotiations occurred, there was never a chance that the Republicans in the majority would permit a map that altered the partisan balance of H.B. 369.\n   <footnotemark>\n    859\n   </footnotemark>\n   The testimony offered by Defendants' witnesses to prove that that Democratic leaders themselves actually wanted particular map designs was vague, speculative, not credible, and most importantly, hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-655\">\n   Next, Defendants assert that partisan intent to discriminate against Democratic voters could not have motivated the enactment of the 2012 map because Democratic members of the Ohio House of Representatives and State Senate voted in support of it. The argument is that Democratic legislators would not intend to electorally disadvantage their own party, and a bill enacted with their partial support could therefore not have been motivated by invidious partisan intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-656\">\n   We do not find this argument convincing as it fails to acknowledge the reality of\n   legislative politics. The Republicans commanded majorities in the Ohio House of Representatives and the State Senate, and they held the governorship. They could force through a bill that Democratic legislators did not support. Speaker Batchelder himself acknowledged this, commenting that the Republicans \"could have simply done what [they] wanted to,\" in the redistricting process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    860\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that some Democratic legislators voted in support of H.B. 369, perhaps to secure the small concessions that were made between H.B. 319 and H.B. 369 or to avoid the costly split primary, therefore is not evidence of a lack of partisan intent behind the enacted map. Of course, this does not mean that proof that one party controlled both legislative houses and the governorship is sufficient to demonstrate partisan intent. However, we are unconvinced by the Defendants' argument that some Democratic votes neutralize pro-Republican partisan intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-657\">\n   Finally, Defendants' argument that the Republican map drawers could have drawn a 13-3 map but did not, and therefore that they did not have a partisan intent is unconvincing. Drawing a 13-3 map would have been a riskier choice because it would have required Republican support to be spread more thinly throughout the Republican-leaning districts. Such a map would have been more vulnerable in Democratic swing years; more seats could have potentially fallen into Democratic hands. The map drawers prioritized maximizing safe seats for their candidates throughout the decade over maximizing the number of seats in a single election, some of which would have then been vulnerable in Democratic swing years. Thus, rather than cut against partisan intent, this strategic choice is further evidence of the predominantly partisan intent.

Dr. Handley's finding that a 45% BVAP would be sufficient to elect the Black-preferred candidate by a comfortable margin is merely additional evidence to support the conclusion that District 11 did not need to be drawn as a majority-minority district. (Dr. Handley even suggests a 40% BVAP may be sufficient, though the elections would be tighter.) We need not, however, rely on Dr. Handley. The real problem for the State is, again, that it drew District 11 based on a pure misinterpretation of the VRA.

In the context of District 11, the argument essentially amounts to: The State can draw a majority-minority district if it wants, even if the State was mistaken in its belief that the VRA required such a district. Accepting such a justification could be constitutionally problematic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    556 U.S. at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"525\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our holding also should not be interpreted to entrench majority-minority districts by statutory command, for that, too, could pose constitutional concerns.\").

In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that the appellants in that case did not show that the districts \"result[ed] from the predominance of ... illegitimate factors ....\" 136 S.Ct. at 1310. The opposite is true here. As discussed above, the reason for dropping District 11 down into Summit County was to carve voting territory away from then-Representative Betty Sutton to disadvantage her in her race against Representative Renacci-a partisan motivation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530865\" index=\"526\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/867/#p933\">\n    373 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   945 n.39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"527\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201856625\">\n    2019 WL 1856625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *57 n.39. To the extent that the State legitimately wanted to maintain District 11 as a majority-minority district, it sought to accomplish that goal in a way that would achieve an ultimately partisan aim-to lock in a 12-4 map. That is, even if the goal of advancing minority interests in District 11 was a secondary goal, it was just that: secondary. At bottom, partisanship was the predominant and controlling intent behind the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-675\">\n   The argument for District 3 is slightly different, but the difference is important. In District 3, the argument goes, the State sought to advance minority electoral prospects in Franklin County. Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's statement about \"the permissibility of [crossover districts that enhance a minority's electoral opportunities] as a matter of legislative choice or discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"528\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    556 U.S. at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"529\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the next sentence, the Supreme Court explained that \"[a]ssuming a majority-minority district with a substantial minority population, a legislative determination, based on proper factors, to create two crossover districts may serve to diminish the significance and influence of race by encouraging minority and majority voters to work together toward a common goal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"530\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no evidence to suggest that this specific situation applied to Franklin County-i.e., that it contained a possible majority-minority district that could be split into two minority-influence or crossover districts. The Court continued that \"States can-and in proper cases should-defend against alleged \u00a7 2 violations by pointing to crossover voting patterns and to effective crossover districts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"532\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This scenario is also not at play in this case. In other words, Defendants place too much weight on\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . That said, we will accept that a state\n   may, as a matter of legislative discretion, rely on creating minority-opportunity or crossover districts as a legitimate justification. The problem for this justification here is that there is a competing narrative for District 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-676\">\n   The competing narrative, and the one that we consider more credible, is that Franklin County served as the center piece to help secure a 12-4 map in that Democratic voters could be packed into District 3 in order to shore up other neighboring districts for Republicans. Although some feedback throughout the map-drawing process included a desire for a minority-opportunity district in Franklin County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    868\n   </footnotemark>\n   the actual map-drawing process focused on only partisan factors and political data. As we detailed previously, for example, the map drawers considered splitting Franklin County into four districts, but then they realized that split would result in more competitive elections for Republican candidates; only then did the map drawers decide to draw what is now District 3. That the Democratic voters in this district were referred to by Hofeller as \"dog meat\" and that downtown Columbus was referred to as \"awful voting territory\" for Republicans (and thus needed to be removed from District 15) bolsters this finding. Therefore, disentangling the purported racial considerations from the political ones, we find that political considerations predominantly motivated the drawing of District 3. As explained, when partisanship predominates, partisan considerations are not a legitimate redistricting factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-677\">\n   We also note that District 3 could still have been drawn with a nearly identical BVAP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    869\n   </footnotemark>\n   but with a more regular shape, fewer county splits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    870\n   </footnotemark>\n   and with considerably less partisan bias.\n   <footnotemark>\n    871\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was not, and consequently we infer that the map drawers intended District 3's design to result in the partisan bias we have seen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-678\">\n   Finally, although District 1 in Hamilton County is not central to the dispute of whether the map drawers were motivated by an intent to advance minority electoral opportunity in Districts 3 and 11, we find the treatment of that district instructive in evaluating claims about the map drawers' commitment to advancing minority representation. In evaluating a justification, we may look to see \"the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects [that] interest[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Karcher\n   </em>\n   , 462 U.S. at 740-41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193706\" index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/725/#p728\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court has also instructed that in determining whether invidious intent was present \"[s]ubstantive departures [from normal procedure] may be relevant, particularly if the factors [purportedly] considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached.\"\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    429 U.S. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we find that the motivation offered for the shape of Districts 3 and 11 was dishonored in the creation of Districts 1 and 2, which work together to crack the City of Cincinnati. Cincinnati in Hamilton County also has a considerable African-American population. The map drawers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-679\">\n   decision to carve the City of Cincinnati in two resulted in a District 1 with a 21.30% BVAP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    872\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, when Mr. Cooper left Cincinnati intact in his Proposed Remedial Plan, it maintained a BVAP of 26.74%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    873\n   </footnotemark>\n   When he did so in his hypothetical maps, drawn to demonstrate the possibilities when contemplating the incumbents in 2011, he maintained this same higher BVAP in each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    874\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Cincinnati could be cracked, the map drawers' asserted concern for advancing minority voting interests seems to have fallen to the wayside. This gives us further reason to doubt the veracity of their assertion that this concern drove the creation of Districts 3 and 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-680\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Natural political geography\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-681\">\n   Defendants also argue that some of the partisan effects that have resulted under the 2012 map are due to natural political geography-the way that the supporters of the two parties are distributed and clustered throughout the State. While we acknowledge that some credible evidence was presented at trial of partisan clustering in Ohio and a natural political geography that gives a slight advantage to the Republican Party, we find that Ohio's natural political geography in no way accounts for the extreme Republican advantage observed in the 2012 map. We therefore conclude that this justification fails as a neutral explanation for the 2012 map's partisan effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-682\">\n   Dr. Hood's report and analysis demonstrated that in Ohio Democratic voters tend to cluster near other Democratic voters, and Republican voters tend to cluster near other Republican voters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    875\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, it did not show that Democratic voters do so at higher rates than Republican voters-the key comparison that might help explain why the 2012 map favors the election of Republican representatives over Democratic representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    876\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-683\">\n   Dr. Hood's analysis also showed that in Ohio Democratic voters are more likely to be located in urban areas than Republican voters are.\n   <footnotemark>\n    877\n   </footnotemark>\n   The concentration of Democratic voters in cities could support a finding of natural packing in those cities if the boundaries of those cities were respected and they were allowed to remain intact within districts. That is not the case here. Under the 2012 plan, Democratic cities were routinely split in order to facilitate the packing and cracking of districts. For example, Cincinnati in Hamilton County was dramatically and nonsensically divided to produce Republican Districts 1 and 2, Akron was divided to facilitate the packing of District 11 and the cracking of District 16, and Toledo was divided between Districts 5 and 9. We cannot take seriously the argument that Democratic voters' tendency to cluster in cities supports a finding of natural packing when under this map those cities were often cracked rather than packed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-684\">\n   Evidence presented at trial demonstrated that Ohio's natural political geography slightly favors the election of Republican representatives. Dr. Warshaw stated that \"[p]artisan bias usually is caused by gerrymandering, but it could be caused by other\n   factors as well.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    878\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Dr. Warshaw's analysis of the partisan-bias metrics of the Proposed Remedial Plan indicated that that plan, which was drawn by Mr. Cooper with no partisan intent, had a\n   <em>\n    slight\n   </em>\n   bias toward Republicans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    879\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, Dr. Cho's simulated maps, which were all drawn in accordance with only traditional redistricting principles and no partisan intent, also showed a natural\n   <em>\n    slight\n   </em>\n   Republican advantage, most often resulting in a 9-7 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    880\n   </footnotemark>\n   At least a handful of the races under the simulated maps are competitive, with each party winning some of those competitive races-this data is in stark contrast with elections under the current map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    881\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, when only natural political geography serves as the baseline, we find that H.B. 369 significantly deviates from that baseline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-685\">\n   Dr. Warshaw expressed considerable doubt that the partisan bias observed in the 2012 map was the result of natural political geography or non-political factors, however. First, \"the sharpness of the change in the efficiency gap between 2010 and 2012 makes it unlikely to have been caused by geographic changes or non-political factors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    882\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to believe that the strong partisan bias observed under the 2012 map was caused by natural political geography, we would need some evidence to explain why that same natural political geography did not cause such extreme partisan bias figures under the previous plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    883\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sudden uptick in partisan bias after the implementation of the 2012 map belies the claim that Ohio's natural political geography accounts for the pro-Republican results, particularly without any proof that the political geography changed between 2010 and 2012. The independent variable was the map; the dependent variable was the partisan effect. This analysis supports the conclusion that Ohio's natural political geography is not responsible for the considerable partisan effect observed since the implementation of the 2012 map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-686\">\n   Although Dr. Cho did not consider incumbent protection, Mr. Cooper created hypothetical alternative maps that did, and those maps score better on various traditional redistricting principles and result in a more responsive and competitive map. Mr. Cooper's hypothetical alternative maps pair the same number of incumbents as the current map, score higher on compactness, are equal to the current map on core retention, and split fewer municipalities and counties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    884\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, these hypothetical alternative maps also satisfy the equal-population requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    885\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for advancing minority opportunity, these maps contain a District 11 with a BVAP of over 47%, a district in Franklin County with a BVAP of just above 30%, and a Cincinnati-based district with a BVAP of 26.74%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    886\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, these maps take into account Ohio's natural political geography as well as all of Defendants' purported main goals in redistricting, and they still produce more responsive and\n   competitive elections than H.B. 369. This is strong evidence that Ohio's natural political geography does not explain the extreme partisan effects of the 2012 map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-687\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-688\">\n   In sum, we conclude that (1) partisan discrimination against Democratic voters was the predominant intent in the creation of each congressional district in the 2012 map as well as the map as a whole, (2) the partisan effect of this discrimination was a dilution of Democratic votes, impinging on Democratic voters' Fourteenth Amendment rights, and (3) no legitimate justification offered by Defendants to explain either the intent behind the map or its partisan effects undermines our conclusion that invidious partisanship dominated the process and the result. We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs have proved their Fourteenth Amendment vote-dilution claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-689\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As detailed previously, by almost any measure, H.B. 369 is more extremely partisan and more pro-Republican than over 90% (and under several metrics over 95%) of previous comparable elections throughout the country. This was true in 2012, the first election held under the current map, and in the most recent 2018 election cycle. Indeed, these findings should not be surprising given the fact that, although the Republican statewide vote share in congressional elections has fluctuated between 51% and 59%, Republican candidates have nonetheless won the same twelve seats (75% of the seats) in every election. The Democratic vote share in that same time has ranged from 41% to 47%, but Democratic candidates have won the same four seats in every election-and by considerably large margins (again, in the closest election for the four seats, the Democratic candidate still won 61% of the vote). The data support Dr. Warshaw's conclusion that \"Ohio's 2011 redistricting plan had one of the largest pro-Republican biases in history.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    887\n   </footnotemark>\n   The simulated maps, which integrate only neutral redistricting criteria, reveal what the typical outcomes would be based on the natural political geography of the State. Over the course of this decade, by far the most expected outcome would be a 9-7 map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    888\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a whole, this evidence shows that the current redistricting plan contains a substantial amount of bias against Democratic voters as compared to a neutral baseline (or, in fact, millions of neutral\n   baselines) based on natural political geography, as well as historical baselines. Indeed, we can comfortably say that the current redistricting plan is an outlier. But this evidence is only part of the story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-717\">\n   The lack of competitive elections supports the conclusion that Democratic voters' electoral opportunities are unfairly burdened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"646\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p793\">\n    460 U.S. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"647\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p793\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The simulated maps typically produced at least a handful of competitive races.

The logical conclusion is that the map drawers fenced in Democratic voters in significant numbers into four districts and, conversely, fenced out Democratic voters from the other districts in order to \"freeze[ ] the status quo\" from the 2010 elections, which favored Republicans.\n   <em>\n    Jenness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027224\" index=\"648\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/431/#p439\">\n    403 U.S. at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027224\" index=\"649\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/431/#p439\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The result is a burden on Democratic voters' overall electoral opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-718\">\n   Of course, this is not to say that competitive elections must be maximized at the expense of other legitimate goals. The point is that the evidence indicates that in a State as competitive as Ohio, and considering its natural political geography, one would expect more competitive elections-some won by Democratic candidates, and others won by Republican candidates. The absence of competitive elections raises concerns that the dominant party in government, through partisan manipulation, is seeking to \"dictate electoral outcomes\" and \"disfavor a class of candidates\" and the voters who support them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340237\" index=\"650\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/779/#p833\">\n    514 U.S. at 833-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340237\" index=\"651\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/779/#p833\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Importantly, according\n   to talking points in an email from Heather Mann to Michael Lenzo, the 12-4 map \"put the most number of seats in the safety zone given the political geography of the state, [the] media markets, and how to best allocate caucus resources.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    891\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the Republicans' own admission, then, the number of safe seats, and thus the number of competitive elections, influence how the parties and campaigns expend their resources.

Here, that critical juncture is the general election. In his report and trial testimony, Dr. Niven spoke to the political science literature that shows how the splitting of neighborhoods, cities, and counties makes campaigning more difficult in those areas and therefore results in a demobilizing effect.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3. As we explained previously, he found that splits of localities affected Democratic voters more than Republican voters. Dr. Niven also elaborated on how Democratic voters were shuffled between districts and how that shuffling would have altered the political makeup of districts and the outcomes of prior elections in those districts.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3. Of course, the lines must be drawn somewhere, but it is suspect when considering the findings that the divisions affected Democratic voters more than Republicans alongside the findings of the extreme partisan effects exhibited in this map.

Dr. Niven also found that in Franklin County, the lines even caused problems for the professional election administrators keeping track of which voters should be assigned to which districts.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3.c. These mobilization difficulties are consistent with the social-science data outlined above that demonstrate an asymmetric burden in translating votes into seats. The actual election results compared to the statewide congressional vote share, the partisan-bias metrics, and the simulated maps all support a reasonable inference that Democratic voters and organizations, such as Plaintiffs in this case, would feel that they do not have a real chance at similar electoral success, even if their Party received a higher percentage of the vote. Even when the Democratic Party as a whole did better, the Republican advantage remained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    892\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current redistricting plan distributes voters in such a way that, even though the Democratic and Republican Parties are running in the same races, Democratic candidates must run a significantly longer distance to get to the same finish line. Thus, Democratic voters and supporters are burdened by this demobilizing effect and are limited in their opportunities to translate their efforts in the electorate into \"political power in the community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tashjian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"665\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    479 U.S. at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"666\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    107 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-723\">\n   The remaining question is how much more successful the Democratic Party would need to be to turn the electoral tides in their favor. Again, Dr. Warshaw's initial findings were that, even with 55% of the statewide vote, Democratic candidates would win only 6 out of 16 seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    893\n   </footnotemark>\n   Updating his analysis with the 2018 data slightly modified this finding; Democratic candidates would win half the seats with 55% of the vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    894\n   </footnotemark>\n   The asymmetry is stark. Republican candidates comfortably won twelve seats with a similar percentage of the vote, and at 51% of the vote, they still comfortably won twelve seats. Again, this bears out what the map drawers themselves recognized: the way that they drew the map allowed for the best allocation of Republican resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    895\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, Democratic campaigners and organizations need to expend more resources to garner more votes, but even if they were successful in that effort, Democratic candidates still win fewer elections. Such use of State \"power to starve political opposition\" is generally disfavored in First Amendment jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"667\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p356\">\n    427 U.S. at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"668\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p356\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kang,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 376-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-724\">\n   The ultimate result of this substantial asymmetry is that Plaintiffs are hindered in their ability to mobilize effectively, win elections, and accomplish their policy objectives. These results come with representational costs. Dr. Warshaw's analysis demonstrates the growing polarization among Ohio's Republican and Democratic\n   Members of Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    896\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, given the large asymmetry in elections and polarization in Congress, it is less likely that the Ohio congressional delegation fairly reflects voters in congressional elections across the State.

The former is a legitimate interest, and the latter is not. The insulation of incumbents from political competition raises entrenchment concerns. As detailed above, we find that the current map's purpose and effect was to entrench the 12-4 Republican majority and subordinate disfavored Democratic voters. For example, the decisions to split Franklin County three ways instead of four (thus creating the \"Franklin County Sinkhole\") and the general checking of political indices when various changes were proposed were all done with an eye toward putting as many Republican incumbents in the safety zone as possible.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sections I.A.4, V.A.2.a.ii.

Second, for the reasons we articulated before,\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   is entirely distinguishable, mainly because there is no serious argument that H.B. 369 fairly \"allocate[s] political power to the parties in accordance with their voting strength ....\"\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   , 412 U.S. at 754,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175416\" index=\"701\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/735/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-733\">\n   Even if we viewed this incumbent-protection argument in the light most favorable to the State-that the State truly needed to draw the map the way it did to avoid contests between existing incumbents-we would not conclude that this justification holds up to scrutiny. Again, the sponsor of the initial H.B. 319 (to which H.B. 369 is materially identical) clearly described incumbent protection as \"subservient\" to other redistricting\n   goals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    898\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the instance in which incumbent protection was not pursued, i.e., the pairing of Representative Renacci with Representative Sutton, the map drawers drew the district to advantage the incumbent Republican over the Democratic incumbent. Lastly, if incumbent protection, properly understood, is meant to maintain Representative-constituent relationships and seniority in Congress, it makes little sense to pair the most senior member of the State's congressional delegation against another incumbent, as was done in H.B. 369. As one of Mr. Cooper's hypothetical alternative maps demonstrates, Representative Kaptur did not need to be paired; instead, Representatives Sutton and Kucinich (who were each paired anyway) could have been drawn against one another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    899\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-734\">\n   The argument that the current map resulted from bipartisan input and negotiations, which at times blends with Defendants' arguments about incumbent protection and\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   , is also unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.ii. The partisan outcomes of this map were locked in once the General Assembly passed H.B. 319, which was the work product of only Republicans. The General Assembly incorporated some minor Democratic requests into H.B. 369; however, Speaker Batchelder himself acknowledged that the partisan balance of the map was non-negotiable.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.ii. Although Democratic legislators secured some small geographic concessions, the Republicans also secured their large 12-4 partisan advantage in H.B. 369. The material terms of negotiation were ultimately dictated by the fact that the Republican Party controlled both the General Assembly and the governorship.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 230-3 (Batchelder Dep. at 25) (stating that the Republicans \"could have simply done what [they] wanted to\" in the redistricting process). As a practical matter, Democratic legislators could not alter the expected partisan outcomes of this map, and, therefore, this justification does not cure the substantial burdens on Plaintiffs' rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-735\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Voting Rights Act compliance and advancing representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-736\">\n   We accept that compliance with the VRA is a compelling State interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bethune-Hill\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 801. If the State properly considered the VRA, then this interest may well justify the drawing of District 11. A proper consideration of the VRA would involve having some basis in evidence or good reasons to believe that \u00a7 2 requires a particular district. Statements from legislators that the VRA was an important consideration, without more, will not suffice-especially when the State is mistaken on the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-737\">\n   The problem with this justification in this case is that the State had no basis in evidence to believe that District 11 needed to be drawn as it was.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iii. Instead, Ohio's belief that it was compelled to draw District 11 as a majority-minority district rested \"on a pure error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1472. Furthermore, the State's argument that it can draw a majority-minority district, even if it mistakenly interpreted the VRA, could be problematic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"702\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    556 U.S. at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653583\" index=\"703\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/1/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, no evidence suggests that the State conducted any analysis that the VRA required the current District 11 to have a nearly identical BVAP as the prior District 11. We therefore cannot say that the State had \"good reason to believe that \u00a7 2 requires drawing a majority-minority district.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1470. In fact, based on the prior success of African-American candidates in District 11 (none of whom faced a competitive election in the prior decade), nothing supports this belief.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iii. Moreover, even if the State wanted to advance minority electoral opportunities in District 11, we nonetheless find that such a goal was secondary to the predominant and controlling partisan intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-738\">\n   Again, Defendants' asserted interest for District 3 is slightly distinct. For the sake of argument, we accept that the State may, as a matter of legislative discretion, rely on creating minority-opportunity or crossover districts as a legitimate justification. As explained previously, however, based on the evidence in this case, we credit the competing narrative for District 3: map drawers carefully packed Franklin County Democrats into District 3, facilitating the creation of two solidly Republican seats in Districts 12 and 15. This constellation of districts was key in their efforts to lock in a 12-4 map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-739\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Natural political geography\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-740\">\n   Finally, we also accept that a state's natural political geography could potentially explain partisan effects, but again, this justification does not hold up against the evidence in this case.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iv. Although Plaintiffs' experts acknowledge that Ohio's political geography provides a\n   <em>\n    slight\n   </em>\n   advantage to Republicans, the advantage is far from 12-4. First, the same geography did not cause such extreme bias under the prior redistricting plan, and under that plan, the State's congressional delegation majority shifted between Democrats and Republicans.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iv. Second, as mentioned above, the simulated maps provide a baseline to compare maps that incorporate only neutral districting criteria to H.B. 369. Dr. Cho's seat-share analysis demonstrates that a 9-7 map in favor of Republicans is the most common outcome, and one would expect at least a handful of competitive races. The current map has produced a combined total of only four competitive races across all four election cycles. When Dr. Cho incorporated 2018 data into her analysis, only 0.046% of over 3-million simulated maps produced a 12-4 outcome. If someone stated that they were flipping a fair coin but then that coin turned up tails in only 0.046% of 100,000 coin tosses, one would start to suspect that the coin was not, in fact, fair-here we have over 3 million coin tosses. Either the Republicans were exceedingly lucky, or their map drawers made exceedingly expert use of political data to manipulate district lines to secure the most seats and the least amount of competition possible. The evidence in this case points to the latter conclusion. Third, Mr. Cooper's hypothetical alternative maps pair the same number of incumbents as the current map, score higher on compactness, are equal to the current map on core retention, split fewer municipalities and counties, and produce more responsive and competitive elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    900\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we outlined previously, these maps also satisfy the equal-population requirement, and they advance minority electoral opportunities more than H.B. 369.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.A.2.d.iv.

Consequently, we conclude that Plaintiffs were reasonable in waiting three election cycles before bringing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-757\">\n   Further, one clear concern in these cases is that judges should not undertake the \"unwelcome obligation\" of overseeing the redrawing of district lines unless it is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565\" index=\"749\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/407/#p415\">\n    431 U.S. at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565\" index=\"750\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/407/#p415\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When confronted with an extreme partisan gerrymander, it becomes necessary. As we have explained, factors such as whether the plan is an outlier, whether the plan is a durable gerrymander that persists\n   <em>\n    across election cycles\n   </em>\n   , and whether districts have frozen the status quo despite\n   <em>\n    fluctuating vote totals\n   </em>\n   between the parties help us to make this determination. If we had to make this determination after just one election, then we would essentially be \"adopting a constitutional standard that invalidates a map based on unfair results that would occur in a hypothetical state of affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LULAC\n   </em>\n   , 548 U.S. at 420,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"751\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Kennedy, J.). In this case, more data, which reveals durability and entrenchment despite fluctuating vote totals across election cycles, give us greater confidence in our findings. We are not suggesting a bright-line rule for how many elections are necessary; the point is that allowing for a few elections could reveal that a plan does not, in fact, place significant burdens on a supposedly disfavored party. In a similar vein, we cannot say that there has been an unreasonable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-758\">\n   Defendants also rely on\n   <em>\n    Benisek v.

Although\n   <em>\n    Benisek v. Lamone\n   </em>\n   may be instructive, it ultimately does not militate in favor of Defendants. The Supreme Court first noted that the plaintiffs filed their complaint in 2013 but \"fail[ed] to plead the claims giving rise to their request for preliminary injunctive relief until 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612343\" index=\"754\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1942/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612343\" index=\"754\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1942/\">\n    at 1944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, Plaintiffs before us sought injunctive relief with the filing of their initial complaint. Dkt. 1 (First Compl. at 41-42).

As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.\"). In\n   <em>\n    Benisek v. Lamone\n   </em>\n   , the\n   plaintiffs \"represented to the District Court that any injunctive relief would have to be granted by August 18, 2017, to ensure the timely completion of a new districting scheme in advance of the 2018 election season,\" but \"that date had 'already come and gone' by the time the court ruled on plaintiffs' motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Benisek v. Lamone\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1945 (citation omitted). That is not this case. In their motion to stay the trial in this case, Defendants represented to this Court that a new congressional map would need to be submitted by September 20, 2019 \"to fulfill the administrative duties and obligations associated with preparing for the 2020 congressional election.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 185-1 (Wolfe Decl. at 2). That deadline is over four months away. Accordingly, there is enough time to implement a remedy on Defendants' own timetable, hence negating the risk of voter confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-759\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Plaintiffs' delay in this case was not unjustified or unreasonable. This alone disposes of Defendants' laches defense. Also important, the concerns present in\n   <em>\n    Benisek v. Lamone\n   </em>\n   are not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-760\">\n   We will nonetheless address Defendants' remaining arguments on prejudice, none of which we find persuasive. First, the \"[u]navailability of important witnesses, dulling of memories of witnesses, and loss or destruction of relevant evidence all constitute prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nartron Corp. v.

Defendants point to several potential fact witnesses who have since died, and these witnesses primarily go to the purported \"bipartisan negotiations\" that Defendants say justify the map.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252 (Defs.' &amp; Intervenors' Post-Trial Br. at 73). We have already explained the problems with this justification; in brief, even if there were negotiations, the desire to achieve a 12-4 map was not negotiable. Additionally, none of the deceased individuals were members of the Ohio General Assembly at the time the current plan was enacted and many of the main map drawers were still witnesses in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-761\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that \"[v]oters are acclimated to the 2011 plan, and members of Congress have invested deeply in their districts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74. The first point is unpersuasive because the map also imposes serious burdens on individuals' rights to vote and to associate. Similarly, for the second point, congressional representatives may have invested deeply in their districts, but they have no right to choose their voters, and representatives' interests are not implicated in this case-representatives answer to the voters, whose interests are implicated in this case. Thus, the fact that they have invested deeply in their districts is not a reason to find that laches applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-762\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that the State has been forced \"to litigate on an accelerated basis near the end of a redistricting cycle,\" which runs afoul of the \"heavy presumption against last-minute changes to the electoral system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants again cite\n   <em>\n    Benisek v.

In\n   <em>\n    SEIU Local 1\n   </em>\n   , however, the Sixth Circuit addressed a motion for preliminary injunction filed in the district court on October 17, 2012, just three weeks out from the November 6, 2012 election.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629068\" index=\"761\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/341/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629068\" index=\"761\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/341/\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No impending election is imminent in this case. Furthermore, Defendants have represented to this Court that a new congressional districting plan would need to be adopted by September 20, 2019 \"to fulfill the administrative duties and obligations associated with preparing for the 2020 congressional election.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 185-1 (Wolfe Decl. at 2). We are committed to working with that timeline for establishing a remedial plan. We also observe that former Governor Kasich signed H.B. 319 into law on September 26, 2011, and then he signed H.B. 369, the actual plan that was used in the 2012 elections, into law on December 15, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 234 (Final Pretrial Order at App. A., 2-4). Even though the current plan was enacted in December, the State still prepared\n   adequately for the 2012 congressional elections on that slightly shorter timeline. Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     we hereby enjoin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the State from conducting any elections using the plan enacted in H.B. 369 in any future congressional elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-768\">\n   The parties have not yet fully briefed the issue of a remedial plan. As a general rule, however, when a federal court declares a redistricting plan unconstitutional, \"it is ... appropriate, whenever practicable, to afford a reasonable opportunity for the legislature to meet constitutional requirements by adopting a substitute measure rather than for the federal court to devise and order into effect its own plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wise v.

The Court also notes that Plaintiffs object to the admissibility of Exhibit I-072 on the basis that DiRossi lacked foundation to testify about the exhibit because he did not create it. The Court summarily overrules that objection because DiRossi, as one of the primary map drawers, was intimately familiar with the changes from H.B. 319 to H.B. 369. DiRossi provided sufficient testimony to establish his personal knowledge of the changes and indicated that Exhibit I-072 was a fair and accurate rendering of the changes.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Dkt 243 (DiRossi Trial Test. at 191).

They contend that her algorithm has not been adequately peer reviewed, her results have not been tested or verified, she fails to offer an error rate or confidence level for her results, and her methodology has not been generally accepted by the scientific community. The Court rejects these arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-1161\">\n    First, the algorithm has been sufficiently peer reviewed. The algorithm was the subject of a paper titled \"A Massively Parallel Evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm for Sampling Complicated Multimodal State Spaces,\" which was published as part of a peer-reviewed conference. Trial Ex. P086 (Cho CV at 2); Dkt.242 (Cho Trial Test. at 154); Dkt. 243 (Cho Trial Test. at 86-87). The idea behind the algorithm was peer-reviewed, which is the standard practice in computer science. Dkt. 243 (Cho Trial Test. at 86-88, 96-98, 126-27). Second, the lack of an error rate or confidence level is to be expected for an algorithm designed to draw a random sample from a complex, multimodal, unknown distribution. The entire point of the algorithm is to draw a sample from an unknown distribution, and if the distribution is unknown, logically, one cannot calculate an error rate or confidence level of the randomness of the sample.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 243 (Cho Trial Test. at 93-94). The same answer applies to the argument that the algorithm is untested by other scientists in the community. It appears that the algorithm's accuracy could not be tested on unknown distributions (the very type of distributions from which it is meant to sample); the point is that the theory behind the algorithm's ability to sample from such distributions has passed peer review. Nonetheless, Dr. Cho tested the algorithm on a non-trivial data set with a known distribution and confirmed that the algorithm uniformly sampled that space (although she did not provide the results of that test).\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 93-95, 101. She also testified that other computer scientists could write their own code to implement her algorithm to test it on a known distribution.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 96-97. Defendants offered no evidence that any of their experts tested her algorithm against a known distribution and found it flawed. Finally, there is no evidence that the pertinent scientific community does not accept the use of algorithms to solve sampling problems. Indeed, Dr. Cho's innovative algorithm is meant to meld two established types of algorithms-MCMCs and evolutionary algorithms-to permit optimizations heuristics to guide the movements of the Markov chains, resulting in a more efficient draw of a random sample from a complex, multimodal, unknown distribution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 55, 88, 151-52; Trial Ex. P087 (Cho Rep. at 6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-1162\">\n    Finally, the reliability of Dr. Cho's methodology is bolstered by the fact that she developed this algorithm independently of her work in this case. The fact that she developed the algorithm and submitted it for peer review before tailoring it to and running it in this case shows that she did not develop her methodology solely for litigation purposes.\n    <em>\n     Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318509\" index=\"834\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/1311/#p1317\">\n     43 F.3d 1311\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1317 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"That the testimony proffered by an expert is based directly on legitimate, preexisting research unrelated to the litigation provides the most persuasive basis for concluding that the opinions [s]he expresses were 'derived by the scientific method.' \"). Because Dr. Cho used the algorithm developed in the course of her work in reaching her opinions in this case, the Court is convinced that she \"employ[ed] in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\"\n    <em>\n     Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v.

The Court discusses\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    their more specific objection that Dr. Cho's conclusions are entitled to no weight because she erred in setting the redistricting parameters for the algorithm in this particular case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"366\">\n   <p id=\"p-1164\">\n    Trial Ex.

For the simulated maps to achieve perfect equality would require moving, at most, 3,500 people in any given district, not all of whom would be voters; and even if all 3,500 people were voters, all of them would need to vote for the same party in order to have any possibility of swinging an election. That is unlikely. Dkt. 242 (Cho Trial Test. at 167-68).

Dkt. 242 (Cho Trial Test. at 196-97); Trial Ex. P087 (Cho Rep. at 36). Dr. Cho employed this metric only after creating the maps, i.e., competitiveness was not a factor in how the simulated maps were drawn. Dkt. 242 (Cho Trial Test. at 196-98). Under this metric, competitiveness scores range from zero to one, and at zero, \"competitiveness is maximized because 1) the number of Republican votes and the number of Democratic votes is the same and 2) the number of districts where Republicans dominate and the number of districts where the Democrats dominate is identical.\" Trial Ex. P087 (Cho Rep. at 36). Figure 23 in Dr. Cho's initial report shows that the current map is less competitive compared to the simulated maps; whereas most of the simulated maps score between 0.09 and 0.11, the current map scores 0.16 under this competitiveness metric.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 37, fig. 23.

Intervenors filed a Motion to Exclude the Expert Report and Testimony of Dr. Handley prior to trial and maintained their objections at trial. Dkt. 152-1 (Intervenors' Mot. to Exclude Handley); Dkt. 240 (Handley Trial Test. at 136). Intervenors argued that Dr. Handley's report and testimony were irrelevant because the case at bar is a partisan-gerrymandering case, not a VRA case. They also argued that her report and testimony were improper because they relied on data post-dating the drawing of the 2012 plan and failed to include a confidence interval. Dkt. 152-1 (Intervenors' Mot. to Exclude Handley at 1-2). We address each argument in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-1283\">\n    First, we reject Intervenors' argument that the Section 2 analysis is irrelevant. It is true that Plaintiffs have challenged the 2012 map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, not as a violation of Section 2 of the VRA. However, Defendants have made Section 2's requirements relevant to this case. They have argued that District 11 was drawn in its present shape in part to ensure that African-American voters were able to elect their preferred candidate in that district. Plaintiffs therefore offer Dr. Handley's testimony to challenge that justification and demonstrate that there was no need to extend District 11 south into Summit County to pick up additional African-American voters to comply with the VRA. We discuss the interaction of the VRA, Defendants' minority electoral opportunity justification, and Dr. Handley's analysis further in Sections V.A.2.d.iii., V.C.2.b.ii., where we scrutinize each of Defendants' proffered legitimate legislative justifications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-1284\">\n    Second, while Dr. Handley's report and analysis do rely in part on data that post-dated the 2011 redistricting and therefore was unavailable to the map drawers at the time, they also rely on data that predates the redistricting. Dkt. 240 (Handley Trial Test. at 150). The pattern of District 11 electing Black-preferred candidates by sizable margins does not differ between the pre-2011 and post-2011 elections that Dr. Handley considered.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 151. Any issues that Dr. Handley's reliance on data that was not available to the map drawers in 2011 presents will go to the weight that we give Dr. Handley's testimony, not its admissibility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-1285\">\n    Third, we conclude that Dr. Handley adequately explained why she did not provide confidence intervals for her ecological-inference analysis, and we overrule Intervenors' objection on that basis. Dr. Handley provided standard errors for each of her ecological-inference estimates.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 143. However, she explained that she did not use the standard errors to produce confidence intervals because that would require a normal distribution, and the ecological-inference analysis does not produce a normal distribution.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 143-44. She testified that she \"routinely\" submits expert reports involving ecological-inference estimates without confidence intervals, and that these reports have been accepted.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 144.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"484\">\n   <p id=\"p-1286\">\n    Trial Ex.
