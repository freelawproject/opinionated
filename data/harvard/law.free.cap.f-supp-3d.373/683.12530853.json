Cissone (\"Plaintiff\") brings this federal securities class action individually and on behalf of former shareholders of InterOil stock against Defendants for violations of \u00a7 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77l(a)(2). Plaintiff challenges disclosures made by Defendant InterOil Corporation (\"InterOil\") in an Information Circular distributed to InterOil shareholders. The Information Circular was issued to solicit InterOil shareholders' votes in favor of a proposed acquisition of InterOil by Defendant Exxon Mobil Corporation (\"Exxon\" and collectively with InterOil, the \"Corporate Defendants\"). After a competitive auction process involving bids from multiple parties, the Corporate Defendants entered into an amended and restated acquisition agreement (the \"Arrangement Agreement\"), pursuant to which Exxon would acquire InterOil (the \"Arrangement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   InterOil shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the Arrangement Agreement, and the Supreme Court of Yukon approved the Arrangement as fair and reasonable. Plaintiff, however, alleges that the Information Circular contained numerous false statements and omissions that prevented InterOil shareholders from casting an informed vote. As a result, Plaintiff avers that InterOil shareholders suffered substantial harm because the consideration they received from the Arrangement grossly undervalued their InterOil shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue in this case is whether Plaintiff can now turn to this Court for relief after failing to exercise her right to appear before the Canadian court to challenge the Arrangement and the disclosures in the Information Circular. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims should not be relitigated, and that the Court should exercise its discretion and dismiss her claims on international comity grounds. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees that comity requires deference to the prior Canadian court proceeding, and therefore grants the Corporate Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 35 ] and dismisses Plaintiff's Amended Complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Per Special Order 3-319, this case was transferred from the docket of Judge Ed Kinkeade to the docket of this Court on March 12, 2018. The parties through their counsel appeared before the Court for oral argument on the pending motions on January 15, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. InterOil\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to its acquisition by Exxon, InterOil was a publicly-traded oil and gas company listed on the New York Stock\n   Exchange (\"NYSE\") engaged in the exploration, appraisal, and development of hydrocarbon resources. Am. Compl. \u00b6 7. InterOil was incorporated in Yukon Territory, Canada, and headquartered in Singapore, with additional offices in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (\"PNG\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time of the Arrangement, InterOil's two primary assets were: (1) a 36.5 percent interest in petroleum retention license 15 (\"PRL 15\") in the Gulf Province of PNG, and (2) a right to receive future payments from French oil and gas supermajor TOTAL, S.A. (\"Total\"), arising from Total's 2014 purchase from InterOil of a 40.19 percent license interest in the PRL 15 (the \"Total Payments\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 44. PRL 15 covers an area of 763 square kilometers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The Elk-Antelope Fields are located within PRL 15.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Total assumed operations of PRL 15 on August 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.1. The value of both assets is directly tied to the amount of resources in the Elk-Antelope Fields and/or estimates of such resources.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. InterOil did not expect commercialization of the PRL 15 fields until approximately 2023. Defs.' App. 174-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the Total Payments, InterOil shareholders would potentially receive three contingent payments based primarily on certified resource estimates for the Elk-Antelope Fields. Am. Compl. \u00b6 45. The first payment would be based on the Interim Resource Certification, which was a process to certify the size of the resources in the Elk-Antelope Fields carried out by two independent resource certifiers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   InterOil engaged GLJ Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. (\"GLJ\"), an independent, third-party evaluator, to prepare annual contingent resource estimates for the Elk-Antelope Fields since at least 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Acquisition by Exxon\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2015, the InterOil board of directors (the \"Board\") decided to explore the sale of minority interests in some of InterOil's assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. In late 2015, the Board approached a select group of four oil and gas companies about a possible transaction: Exxon, Oil Search Limited (\"Oil Search\"), \"Party B\" (as referred to in the Information Circular), and a party that declined to participate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 1, 2016, InterOil signed a confidentiality agreement with Exxon concerning a possible whole-company acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. On March 11 and March 14, 2016, respectively, both Party B and Oil Search submitted non-binding indicative proposals to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of InterOil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. With three proposals on the table, the Board authorized management and InterOil's advisors to continue discussions with Exxon, Party B, and Oil Search, and appointed the Transaction Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ultimately, Party B decided not to revise its offer, but both Oil Search and Exxon submitted revised, non-binding proposals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. On May 20, 2016, InterOil announced that it had entered into an agreement with Oil Search for Oil Search to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of InterOil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 23, 2016, InterOil received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Exxon to acquire InterOil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. In light of the topping bid from Exxon and Oil Search's failure to revise its offer, InterOil terminated the Oil Search transaction, paid a $ 60 million termination fee to Oil Search, and entered into an acquisition agreement with Exxon (the \"Original Arrangement Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the terms of the Original Arrangement Agreement, Exxon would acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of InterOil for (i) $ 45.00 per InterOil share payable in Exxon shares, and (ii) a contingent resource payment (\"CRP\") for $ 7.07 per InterOil share for each trillion cubic feet equivalent (\"tcfe\") of PRL 2C Resources above 6.2 tcfe, up to a maximum of 10 tcfe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. No additional payment would be made for PRL 2C Resources in excess of 10 tcfe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Original Arrangement Agreement provided that the InterOil shares would be acquired pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement under Yukon Law (the \"Original Arrangement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. For closing to occur, the Supreme Court of Yukon was required to find that the Original Arrangement was \"fair and reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 21, 2016, InterOil's financial advisor provided its opinion to the Board that the consideration offered was fair from a financial standpoint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. That same day, the Board approved the Original Arrangement, and InterOil and Exxon entered into the Original Arrangement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board issued an information circular to InterOil shareholders, and recommended that shareholders approve the Original Arrangement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' App. 366. On September 21, 2016, InterOil shareholders voted in favor of the of the Original Arrangement Agreement. Am. Compl. \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the fairness hearing before the Supreme Court of Yukon on September 27, 2016, Phil Mulacek, founder and former Chairman of InterOil, challenged the fairness and reasonableness of the Original Arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court of Yukon approved the Original Arrangement as fair and reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' App. 374. Mulacek appealed. Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. On November 4, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Yukon overturned the Supreme Court of Yukon's decision that the Original Arrangement was \"fair and reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Among the red flags noted by the Court of Appeal of Yukon was the absence of a fairness opinion from an independent expert and the failure of InterOil's financial advisor to assess the value of the CRP as compared with the value InterOil shareholders would receive by retaining their shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeal's ruling terminated the Original Arrangement and required Exxon and InterOil to agree on a new plan, subject to approval by both InterOil's shareholders and the Supreme Court of Yukon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the Court of Appeal's decision, the Board reconvened the Transaction Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. The Transaction Committee retained its own independent counsel and retained BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. (\"BMO\") as InterOil's financial advisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Transaction Committee also requested that GLJ prepare an updated contingent resource report for the Elk-Antelope Fields.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. On November 30, 2016, GLJ provided the updated report, which indicated that GLJ's estimate of the PRL 15 2C Resources was now only 7.80 tcfe, down 23.5 percent from its previous 2C estimate of 10.18 tcfe as of December 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. GLJ attributed its new lower estimate primarily to data collected from the Antelope-6 appraisal well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   GLJ's 2015 contingent resource report did not include results from Antelope-6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ultimately, in a revised agreement with Exxon, Exxon agreed to pay $ 45.00 for each InterOil share, payable in Exxon\n   stock, and increased the total potential CRP by raising the cap on the payment from 10 tcfe to 11 tcfe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 42. On December 15, 2016, the Board unanimously voted in favor of the Arrangement under the amended statutory plan of arrangement and entered into the Arrangement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. On or around January 13, 2017, InterOil distributed the Information Circular to InterOil shareholders to solicit proxies from its shareholders to vote in favor of the Arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. The Information Circular advised InterOil shareholders of their right to oppose the transaction at the fairness hearing, as well as their right to dissent and have the Yukon court determine the fair value of their shares. Defs.' App. 77, 103-05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 14, 2017, InterOil shareholders approved the Arrangement Agreement. Am. Compl. \u00b6 42. The Supreme Court of Yukon approved the Arrangement pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement on February 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Arrangement closed on February 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast to the hearing on the Original Arrangement, no InterOil shareholders appeared at the hearing to oppose the transaction in any respect.

App. 460. In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court of Yukon considered these submissions, which included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (a) a long-form fairness opinion from BMO that stated the consideration to be received pursuant to the Arrangement is fair from a financial point of view to the shareholders; (b) the Transaction\n   Committee and the Board unanimously recommended the Arrangement Agreement; (c) the Information Circular fully disclosed the nature and details of the Arrangement; (d) at the meeting, 91.24 percent of InterOil shareholders voted in favor of the Arrangement Agreement; and (e) two leading proxy firms recommended that the shareholders vote in favor of the Arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the last element, the Supreme Court of Yukon issued a final written judgment on March 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 459-63. The Canadian court held, \"I have approved the plan of arrangement as being procedurally and substantively fair to Inter[O]il and its shareholders[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459. The Court concluded that \"Inter[O]il provided the shareholders with considerable information on the value of the new Arrangement and the value of the contingent resources.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The principle of comity directs deference to a foreign court of competent jurisdiction (in this case, Canada), so long as the laws and public policy of the forum state (Texas) and the rights of the forum's residents are not violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Fleeger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5724758\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/86/388/#p393\">\n    86 F.R.D. at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff challenges dismissal on the basis of international comity on several grounds. First, Plaintiff asserts that deference to the Canadian courts is not appropriate because the period within which she would have had to make her submission to the Canadian court was shorter than the applicable statute of limitations for \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims. Pl.'s Resp. 30. The Court finds this argument unavailing. Plaintiff does not argue that she could not have challenged the disclosures as part of the Canadian court proceedings. In fact, Plaintiff concedes that her disclosure claims are based on information that was publicly available prior to that proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. The necessary information relating to Plaintiff's disclosure claim in this action existed at the time the Supreme Court of Yukon held the final fairness hearing, and any InterOil shareholder could have appeared at the hearing to raise challenges to the Arrangement and Information Circular. Plaintiff's failure to appear in the Canadian court does not validate her decision to file a lawsuit ten months later in this Court. \"Plaintiff voluntarily purchased shares in a Canadian corporation which put [her] on notice that [her] rights as a shareholder would be construed according to Canadian law.\"\n   <em>\n    Fleeger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5724758\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/86/388/#p393\">\n    86 F.R.D. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, Plaintiff makes a statutory and policy-based argument that Congress did not intend for fairness determinations made by foreign courts to \"preempt\" \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims or prevent access to U.S. courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. 28, 30. But the question is whether this Court should exercise its discretion and defer to the Canadian proceedings, not whether those proceedings preclude or preempt plaintiff's claim. Given the prior ruling from the Supreme Court of Yukon and the ongoing dissenters' rights proceeding, it is appropriate for this Court to exercise its discretion and defer to the Canadian court as a matter of international comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff also makes an argument against international comity\n   relying on issue preclusion and a Second Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Dougherty v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that agency approval of a bank conversion does not preclude a federal district court from adjudicating securities fraud claims premised on alleged misstatements and omissions in the bank's offering circular distributed in connection with the conversion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854704\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/613/\">\n    112 F.3d at 614-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit noted that \"[c]ourts are generally reluctant to give preclusive weight to factual determinations made by administrative agencies\" because the agency's approval of the transaction was \"made in a non-judicial capacity-the regulations made no provision for an evidentiary hearing or any other opportunity to present witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854704\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/613/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854704\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/613/\">\n    at 616-17, 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds Plaintiff's collateral estoppel argument and reliance on\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive.

Second,\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable to the case at hand. Unlike approval from an agency, the Canadian proceeding was adversarial and provided InterOil shareholders with an opportunity to challenge the Arrangement and the Information Circular.

Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Dougherty\n   </em>\n   does not address international comity.
