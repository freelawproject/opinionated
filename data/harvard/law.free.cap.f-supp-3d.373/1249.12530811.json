Nos. 48, 50, 66\n </docketnumber>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   William H. Orrick, United States District Judge\n   Kevin Poulsen seeks documents regarding electronic surveillance of President Donald J. Trump or any of his advisors during the 2016 election campaign through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Poulsen contends that the government has waived any the right to issue a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response - refusing to confirm or deny the existence of responsive documents - because of a number of statements by members of the government regarding allegations of, and in one limited instance confirmation of, electronic surveillance conducted during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After reviewing the government agencies' justifications for their continued assertion of\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   in the publicly filed declarations from each agency and two classified submissions, I find that the government has demonstrated substantial grounds to maintain the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses to everything except the documents necessarily covered by the limited public acknowledgment of the electronic surveillance of Carter Page. Reviewing the justifications for redacting and withholding with respect to that limited set of acknowledged documents, the government has adequately justified its redactions and withholdings. Accordingly, ODNI and NSA's cross-motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, Poulsen's motion for summary judgment as to ODNI and NSA is DENIED, and the motion for summary judgment by NSD, OLC, and the FBI is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FOIA REQUESTS AND INITIAL RESPONSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 4, 2017, Poulsen submitted a series of similar FOIA requests to various agencies of the federal government (\"Requests\"), seeking release of records concerning the United States' electronic surveillance of President Donald J. Trump or any of his advisors during the 2016 election campaign. The Requests were submitted to the FOIA offices of: (i) the National Security Agency (NSA, a component of the Department of Defense); (ii) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI); (iii) the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI, a component of the Department of Justice (DOJ) ); (iv) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC, a component of the DOJ); and (v) the National Security Division (NSD, a component of the DOJ) (collectively \"Agencies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Requests sought \"records concerning the United States' alleged electronic surveillance of Donald J. Trump during the 2016 election campaign,\" and as background identified a series of comments President Trump made through the social media platform Twitter on March 4, 2017, discussing that purported electronic surveillance. Although Poulsen used slightly different terms for some of the Agency Requests, he generally requested release of the following categories of records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   1.

That same day, Poulsen appealed the NSA's denial of the Request.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    On April 25, 2017, the NSA denied Poulsen's appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Declaration of David Sherman (Dkt. No. 31-8), at ECF pgs. 23-25, 29-30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <em>\n     ODNI Response\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    On March 15, 2017, the ODNI granted Poulsen's request for a fee waiver and denied his request for expedited processing. On March 27, 2017, Poulsen appealed the ODNI's denial of expedited processing and on April 13, 2017, the ODNI reversed its decision to deny expedited processing of the Request. However, as of June 19, 2017 - the date the Complaint was filed - the ODNI had not made any determination concerning the Request, processed the Request, or produced any records.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Declaration of Patricia Gaviria (Dkt.

FILING AND PROCEDUAL POSTURE OF THIS CASE\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Poulsen, contending the Agencies' responses were either untimely or legally deficient, filed this suit on June 19, 2017. In November 2017, the government moved for summary judgment to confirm the adequacy of each Agency's response. Dkt. No. 31. In support of that motion, each of the Agencies either affirmed or stated in the first instance that they would rely on\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    However, due to subsequent disclosures by governmental individuals regarding part of the subject matter covered by Poulsen's Requests, the government moved to withdraw the motion for summary judgment so that each Agency could determine whether the disclosures \"impacted\" their response and whether documents responsive to the request could be acknowledged or produced. Dkt. No. 42. Poulsen objected, but I granted the government's request due to concerns of efficiency and orderly adjudication. However, NSA and ODNI represented that their FOIA responses were\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    impacted by the disclosures, and they intended to stick with their full\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    responses. Therefore, I directed the parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment on the FOIA responses by NSA and ODNI, while the other Agencies were given time to finish their consideration of the impact of the public disclosures. Dkt. No. 46. The cross-motions with respect to NSA and ODNI were filed and have been pending since September 5, 2018.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    On November 11, 2018, the remaining agencies - NSD, OLC, and the FBI - filed their motion for summary judgment. Poulsen responded on December 7, 2018. In that motion, the government admits that there were two \"public acknowledgements\" relevant to Poulsen's FOIA Requests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The first acknowledgement was in the March 20, 2017 Congressional testimony of then-FBI Director James B. Comey, where Comey confirmed that the FBI had (in July 2016) opened an investigation of \"the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 Presidential election[.]\" Third Declaration of David M. Hardy (3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    Hardy Decl., Dkt. No. 66-1) \u00b6 12 &amp; n.2. As part of his testimony, and the \"public acknowledgment\" that the FBI admits narrowly waived part of its initial\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    defense, Comey admitted that the FBI had no records of alleged wiretapping of then-candidate Trump in Trump Tower by the Obama Administration prior to the 2016 presidential election (as referenced in\n    President Trump's Twitter post on March 4, 2017).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203605\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203605\">\n     \u00b6 8\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The second acknowledgement resulted from the President's declassification of a memorandum prepared by staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (\"HPSCI,\" the \"Nunes Memo\") and the subsequent release of a different memorandum prepared by certain HPSCI members (the \"Schiff Memo\"). In light of the declassification and release, the government acknowledged the existence of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") applications and orders to conduct surveillance of Carter Page. 3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-23.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Because of those official acknowledgments, the DOJ does not maintain a\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response for the existence of the Carter Page FISA applications or orders. The FBI and NSD admit that they maintain some records related to the acknowledged FISA applications and orders; OLC confirmed that it has located no records related to the acknowledged FISA applications and orders. 3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    Hardy Decl. \u00b6 29; Declaration of Patrick N.

They assert a partial\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    refusing to \"confirm or deny the existence of specific subcategories\" of the request as they \"relate to Carter Page\" because that would disclose the existence or nonexistence of specific types of surveillance results withheld under Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E). 3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 160-163.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Finally, the FBI, NSD, and OLC assert\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    in regards to confirming or denying the existence of non-Carter Page documents (for any other FISA applications, orders, or other electronic surveillance).

Thus, the statements do not match the information withheld by ODNI or NSA.\" NSA/ODNI Oppo. (Dkt. No. 50) at 19.

There is no disclosure establishing that any of the specific documents sought by Poulsen\n    <em>\n     exists\n    </em>\n    , much less a match between the disclosures and the specific electronic surveillance information sought by Poulsen. The very specific information sought by Poulsen (records regarding electronic surveillance conducted during a specific time and aimed at specific targets) does not match the very general acknowledgments that there is an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, that the investigation has included some people associated with then-candidate Trump's campaign, and that one such associate was the target of FISA applications and orders. The only possibly acknowledged electronic surveillance, therefore, is of Page. The confirmation of the existence of any other type of surveillance or any other targets simply does not meet the specificity or matching requirements of\n    <em>\n     Fitzgibbon.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    As to the Nunes Memo (and the responsive Schiff Memo) and the declassification by the President of the Nunes Memo, the ODNI and NSA argue:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    The declassification determination did not, explicitly or implicitly, declassify all arguably related classified information or other intelligence sources and methods. The President therefore declassified the existence of certain specific FBI FISA materials related to Carter Page; DOJ is currently processing those documents to determine whether DOJ will disclose additional information. But the existence or non-existence of surveillance materials related to Carter Page in the possession of ODNI or NSA is a distinct fact that has not been officially acknowledged, the disclosure of which could cause distinct harms. Gaviria Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-21; Thompson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    ODNI/NSA Oppo. (Dkt. No. 50) at 20. At most, Poulsen attempts to connect the fact that there was FISA-approved surveillance of Page with the fact that the investigation concerns foreign influence in the 2016 election to mean that - given the authority and roles of ODNI and NSA in coordinating or collecting foreign intelligence - there must be responsive records in those agencies' possession. But as those agencies point out, just because they have the authority to do something does not mean that they did. The Congressional testimony did not disclose anything ODNI and NSA did during the specific timeframe.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The FBI and NSD, because of the acknowledgments and processing of the Carter Page FISA materials, assert they have accounted for the scope of these Congressional disclosures. They argue, and I agree, that neither the contents of the declassified Nunes Memo nor the acknowledged existence of the national security investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election creates any official acknowledgment or \"inescapable inference\" that there was electronic surveillance\n    <em>\n     beyond\n    </em>\n    the acknowledged Carter Page FISA materials.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The Agencies'\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    responses are not undermined by the Carter Page FISA disclosures. Simply because there was some very limited disclosure and acknowledgment of the use of electronic surveillance on one target - that was responsive to Poulsen's FOIA Requests - does not mean a\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response is unavailable to the agencies as to\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    undisclosed forms of electronic surveillance and undisclosed targets of electronic surveillance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    As to the DOJ's general acknowledgement of the investigation into links between Russia and the Trump campaign through Comey's testimony and the disclosure of the investigation being handled by Special Counsel Mueller, those disclosures do not match the information sought (records of electronic surveillance held by specific agencies, regarding specific targets, created during a limited timeframe) and are not specific enough to cover Poulsen's FOIA Requests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Finally, Poulsen's reliance on facts the government has alleged or admitted in court filings in connection with the prosecutions of Flynn and Papadopoulos are no more helpful. Poulsen does not identify the significance of specific facts disclosed in those filings other than supporting what is otherwise known, that the Special Counsel has investigated members of the Trump campaign for a link to or coordination with the Russian government. Those general disclosures in no way match the specific information regarding electronic surveillance sought by Poulsen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Viewed together, the statements and disclosures identified by Poulsen do not create an official acknowledgment (other than for the acknowledged Carter Page FISA materials that have been processed). This conclusion - and a strict adherence to the specificity and matching requirements - is particularly important in this case because the disclosed investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election\n    <em>\n     is ongoing.\n    </em>\n    The best Poulsen can do is make unsupported assertions that because electronic surveillance was approved for Page under FISA there\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    be other targets. And because electronic surveillance of Page was approved there\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    be recordings and metadata produced from that surveillance. Those assertions are based, at best, on assumptions. A party's assumptions cannot be used to preclude a\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    This conclusion would not change if I consider whether the disclosures identified by Poulsen created an \"inescapable inference\" that documents other than the Page materials exist. Poulsen's Oppo. at 12-13 (arguing inescapable inference as to responsive records to items 3-5 of the FBI Request). Poulsen repeatedly relies on the\n    <em>\n     ACLU\n    </em>\n    case from the D.C. Circuit to argue that there is an \"inescapable inference\" that some of these agencies must have some responsive records given what has been disclosed generally (beyond the disclosed Carter Page FISA materials and \"related to\" but withheld documents). Even if the question of \"inescapable inference\" is relevant to the \"official acknowledgment\" prong of the\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    challenge,\n    the facts of the\n    <em>\n     ACLU\n    </em>\n    case show its application here does not change the outcome. In\n    <em>\n     ACLU\n    </em>\n    , the President and other members of the Executive disclosed the use of drones by the government generally, and the agency defendant (the CIA) itself repeatedly publicly disclosed its \"interest\" in using drones for intelligence purposes.

The President's comments and Congressional disclosures, including the Presidential declassification of information in the Nunes Memo, have likewise been addressed and responded to by the Agencies. The very specific nature of Poulsen's FOIA Requests for electronic surveillance records for specific targets for specific dates, overlapping with an acknowledged and ongoing investigation by the intelligence community, distinguishes this case from\n    <em>\n     ACLU.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The very general official acknowledgments regarding the ongoing investigation, the one specific acknowledgment of surveillance of Carter Page, and the Special Counsel's prosecutions do not preclude the Agencies from asserting\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    to protect disclosure of whether and how they are each involved in that investigation, and whether their participation in that investigation has used specific types of surveillance and produced specific types of intelligence.

Harm\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    In his cross-motion to ODNI and NSA's blanket assertion of\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    , Poulsen argues that even if there has not been a waiver through official acknowledgment, his motion should nonetheless be granted because NSA and ODNI have not demonstrated that cognizable harm could result under Exemptions 1 or 3. He asserts that President Trump has already declassified some of the information he requested and that the United States has already revealed the intelligence sources and methods (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , electronic surveillance) as well as the targets (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , candidate-Trump and his advisors).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Poulsen does not make this argument in his Opposition to the FBI, NSD, and OLC's motion for summary judgment. Instead,\n    he relies exclusively on the \"official acknowledgment\" prong and then - in response to the redactions and withholdings from the Carter Page FISA records processed by these agencies - contends that the Agency declarations are \"so deficient\" and vague that he cannot effectively contest their assertions of harm and the related justifications for the redactions and withholdings.

But, as noted above, other than pointing generally to \"facts\" disclosed in the Flynn and Papadopoulos filings, Poulsen does not identify any specific facts that logically and plausibly show that ODNI or NSA\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    have documents responsive to Poulsen's very specific FOIA Requests to those agencies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Recognizing the court's \"limited institutional expertise on intelligence matters,\" I accord substantial weight to the Gaviria and Thompson declarations.

He is correct that they must show harm in the\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    context from disclosure of the existence of non-existence of records, but I find that they have shown that harm. The harms, plausible and detailed by the Gaviria and Thompson declarations, would be the same as those identified with respect to Exemption 1 above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    In sum, with respect to all of the Agencies, Poulsen has not met the test for an official acknowledgment sufficient to waive ODNI and NSA's ability to assert a full\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response and the FBI, NSD, and OLC's ability to assert partial\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    responses to his Requests. The Agencies have shown - particularly in respect to the acknowledged existence of an ongoing investigation - that harms that would result from requiring them to provide any substantive response and that those harms are protected against by both Exemptions 1 and 3. Poulsen's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against ODNI and NSA (Dkt. No.48) is DENIED and ODNI and NSA's Cross-Motion is GRANTED. Dkt. No. 50.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    <strong>\n     II. ADEQUACY OF SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSES FROM FBI, NSD, AND OLC\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Poulsen argues that that little or no deference should be given to the declarations in support of the substantive responses of the FBI, NSD, and OLC (the \"DOJ Agencies\") because they are not sufficiently detailed to justify the scope of their searches or their redactions and withholdings based on asserted harms, and that there is evidence of bad faith on the part of the government. I disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Carter Page FISA Application Materials\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Search\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    As noted, the FBI, NSD and OLC searches were functionally limited to the two disclosed topics.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Poulsen contends that the searches, primarily by the FBI but also NSD, were deficient. First, Poulsen attacks the DOJ Agencies' decisions to limit their searches to records\n    created before November 8, 2016. November 8, 2016 was used by Poulsen as the cutoff date for \"recordings and metadata\" in his Request, but he contends that his Request also covers legal analyses and other documents that had no similar limiting date and logically would have been created after that time but regarding the same period of surveillance. However, as the government points out, the request sought records\n    <em>\n     related\n    </em>\n    to surveillance\n    <em>\n     during\n    </em>\n    the campaign; only documents created during the campaign are responsive and the government's use of a November 8, 2016 cutoff was reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Second, Poulsen argues that the search was inadequate because it did not include a search for the names of Trump's campaign advisors and, in addition, the FBI should have searched under the names Flynn and Papadopoulos based on the disclosures made in the court filings by the Special Counsel. Any such documents - if they existed - would fall outside the limited\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    waiver. There is no duty on an agency to \"search\" for records about which it properly asserts a\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response. For the same reasons, Poulsen's third challenge to the DOJ Agencies' search - that they impermissibly failed to search for documents responsive to Categories 3-5 of his Requests - fails because the Agencies' assertion of\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    to those categories is, as noted above, proper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Poulsen's arguments concerning the adequacy of the searches by the responding Agencies fail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Redactions and Full Withholdings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    As to the processed and withheld or redacted documents, Poulsen concedes that various categories of information were appropriately withheld. Poulsen's Oppo. at 2 n.1 (listing uncontested categories of withheld information). Poulsen also does not mention or otherwise challenge the Agencies' withholding of information under Exemptions 3, 6, or 7(C).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Instead, as to the categories of withheld information Poulsen continues to seek, he argues that the declarations from the FBI, NSD, and OLC are \"deficient\" and evidence bad faith, precluding my reliance on them. Poulsen's specific arguments are: the declarations from the three responding Agencies are conclusory and should therefore be rejected outright; because many portions of the 3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    Hardy Declaration (where he justifies both the withholdings and the partial\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response) are classified, Poulsen is unable to adequately challenge Hardy's assertions including the assertions under Exemption 7(E) (which allows for disclosure of \"known\" investigatory techniques), Poulsen's Oppo. at 18; there is ample evidence of bad faith by the declarants, given that because the President characterized the DOJ's redactions to the released Carter Page materials as \"ridiculous\" and overbroad and that any damage to Russian relations has already been done and cannot be further damaged by more specific disclosures. Therefore, he argues that there is both a genuine dispute of material fact as to the necessity of the DOJ Agencies' redactions and withholdings and sufficient evidence of bad faith that I cannot give credence and weight to the declarants' statements of harms.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19-20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    As to the specificity of the declarations, I have reviewed each one. Each is adequately detailed and as specific as possible, given the national security and law enforcement operations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    As to the classified materials, I realize that Poulsen has not seen them. I have. Hardy's classified explanations and the second classified submission provide specific, plausible, and significant reasons supporting the declarants' assertions that harms that would flow if the withheld materials were disclosed and the DOJ Agencies' partial\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    responses not allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    As to bad faith, Poulsen contends there is ample evidence of \"bad faith\" obviating any deference to the declarants. He points to six facts. First, and primarily, he highlights the President's characterization of the redactions to the released Carter Page materials as \"ridiculously heavily redacted.\" Poulsen's Oppo. at 17 n. 8. Second, in September 2018 the President directed ODNI and DOJ to declassify additional pages of the June 2017 FISA application and FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all of the Page FISA applications, yet the FBI never addresses why this information will be declassified yet still withheld from the FOIA response. Third, the declarants do not explain why the Carter Page FISA materials could be declassified and still the FBI can assert that total secrecy must cover all other materials. Fourth, Christopher Steele was disclosed as a confidential source but the government provides no explanation of why it now cannot disclose additional CIs. Fifth, there can be no assertion of 7(E) in\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    context because the question is not whether something is \"well-known\" but whether it is known at all and the law enforcement techniques used in these sorts of investigations are known. Sixth, the disclosures as well as the information disclosed in the court filings (as a result of the Special Counsel's investigation) have already \"clearly sent the message\" to Trump campaign advisors that they are being investigated. Because the targets know this, Hardy's assertion that further disclosure could \"tip off\" other targets or suspects is made in bad faith.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    None of these arguments demonstrate bad faith or otherwise undermine the assertions of harm proffered by the declarants. After a close review of the Hardy Declarations, nothing in the President's unexplained comment about the redactions from the Carter Page materials undermines my conclusions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    The President's September 2018 \"declassification\" directive was not an \"order\" from the President covering this material, just a statement from the White House asking the executive agencies to undertake a review and further justify the redactions. Agencies' Reply (Dkt. No. 70) at 6-8. Finally, that the President declassified some very limited information and that some investigative techniques are known to the public does not mean the FBI or other Agencies cannot withhold other information that is classified, information about other confidential sources, or information indicating whether particular techniques (while known) may\n    have been employed. There is simply no persuasive weight to the argument that because X was released without apparent (or known) incident, Y should be released.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Poulsen's final complaints - that Hardy's assertions of harm from disclosure to the ongoing investigation and foreign relations are in bad faith because the present investigation into allegations of foreign interference in a Presidential election is an \"extraordinarily unique\" set of circumstances and any harm to U.S./Russian relations has already been caused by the prior disclosures of the contours of the investigation - are wholly unpersuasive. Poulsen's speculation does not undermine the detailed and specific justifications provided by Hardy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The detailed and plausible DOJ Agency justifications are not undermined by bad faith.
