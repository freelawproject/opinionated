Trump issued two Executive Orders temporarily\n   banning the entry into the United States, with some exceptions, of nationals of multiple predominantly Muslim nations. These orders were followed by a Presidential Proclamation which extended the ban indefinitely as to immigrants and certain categories of nonimmigrants from a substantially similar set of Muslim-majority countries. Plaintiffs in these three consolidated cases, International Refugee Assistance Project (\"IRAP\"), HIAS, Inc., Middle East Studies Association (\"MESA\"), Arab-American Association of New York, Yemeni-American Merchants Association (\"YAMA\"), Doe Plaintiffs 1-5, Muhammed Meteab, Mohamad Mashta, Grannaz Amirjamshidi, Fakhri Ziaolhagh, Shapour Shirani, and Afsaneh Khazaeli (collectively, \"the IRAP Plaintiffs\"); Iranian Alliances Across Borders (\"IAAB\"), Doe Plaintiffs 1, 3, 5 and 6, and Iranian Students' Foundation (collectively, \"the IAAB Plaintiffs\"); and Eblal Zakzok, Fahed Muqbil, and Doe Plaintiffs 1 and 2 (collectively, \"the Zakzok Plaintiffs\"), challenge the Proclamation on the grounds that it violates several provisions of the United States Constitution and that the agencies implementing it have not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 559, 701 - 706 (2012). After the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction entered by this Court to prevent the implementation of the Proclamation on the grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the United States Supreme Court reversed a similar preliminary injunction that had been entered in a parallel case, held that the plaintiffs in that case were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims, including under the Establishment Clause, and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The consolidated cases have now been remanded to this Court following the Supreme Court's decision.

For example, on December 7, 2015, then-presidential candidate Trump posted a statement on his campaign website in which he \"call[ed] for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our representatives can figure out what is going on.\" IRAP 2d Am.

On March 9, 2016 during a televised interview, he stated: \"I think Islam hates us\" and \"We can't allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States ... and [of] people that are not Muslim.\" IRAP 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 60; IAAB 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 32; Zakzok Am. Compl. \u00b6 20. On July 25, 2016, President Trump clarified that he would accomplish his Muslim ban by barring entry from certain \"territories\" because \"people don't want me to say Muslim.\" IRAP 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 76; IAAB 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 34-35; Zakzok Am. Compl. \u00b6 27. Shortly after President Trump signed EO-1 on January 27, 2017, Rudolph Giuliani, an advisor to President Trump, stated that it was the product of an effort directed by President Trump to put the \"Muslim ban\" into effect \"legally\" by using territory as a proxy for religion.

Compl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After EO-1 was rescinded and EO-2 went into effect, President Trump called EO-2 a \"watered down\" version of EO-1. IRAP 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 186, 190; IAAB 2d Am. Compl. 154; Zakzok Am. Compl. \u00b6 33. Even after EO-2 was enjoined by courts, President Trump expressed his intent to issue a third travel ban for the same purpose by stating on June 5, 2017 that the Justice Department \"should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version\" and that there should be a \"much tougher version.\" IRAP 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 190. On September 24, 2017, President Trump issued the Proclamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Proclamation states that \"absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States\" of nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen (the \"Designated Countries\") \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" Procl. pmbl. Specifically, the Proclamation suspends the entry of all immigrants from seven of the eight Designated Countries, excepting only Venezuela. The ban on entry by nonimmigrants is \"more tailored,\" with a narrower ban imposed on countries with mitigating circumstances such as a willingness to play a substantial role in combating terrorism.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265824\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/570/#p583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(h)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As justification for the ban, the Proclamation references a July 9, 2017 report by the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, issued pursuant to the requirements of EO-2, describing a \"worldwide review\" conducted in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In that review, these officials selected baseline criteria for assessing the sufficiency of the information provided by foreign governments to permit the United States to confirm the identities of individuals seeking to enter the country and make a security assessment about them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265824\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/570/#p583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(c);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IRAP I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265824\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/570/#p583\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d at 590-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the Proclamation, pursuant to the process set forth in EO-2, nearly 200 countries were evaluated based on the criteria. Of those, 16 nations were found to be \"inadequate\" and 31 were found to be at risk of becoming so. In accordance with Section 2(d) of EO-2, those nations were given 50 days to bring their information-sharing practices into compliance with the United States's expectations. At the end of that 50-day period, eight countries were determined to have continued inadequate information-sharing practices: Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. In a September 15, 2017 report to the President (\"the DHS Report\"), the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security recommended that entry restrictions be imposed on all of those countries with the exception of Iraq. Although Somalia's information-sharing practices were found to be adequate, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security recommended that Somalia also be subjected to entry restrictions. Venezuela is the only designated country for which entry of immigrants is not suspended. Limitations on the entry of Venezuelan nationals are confined to barring entry of specific government officials and their immediate family members, who are suspended from traveling to the United States on B-1, B-2, and B-1/B-2 visas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to providing exceptions for lawful permanent residents, dual nationals if traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country, and foreign nationals who have been granted asylum status or who have been already admitted to the United States as refugees, the Proclamation provides for waivers, to be granted on a case-by-case basis by either a State Department consular officer or an official of United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), based on criteria to be developed by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Proclamation expressly provides that waivers may be granted only upon a showing that (1) denying entry would cause the foreign national undue hardship; (2) allowing entry would not pose a national security or public safety threat; and (3) entry would be in the national interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Proclamation went into effect when it was published as to foreign nationals then barred by EO-2. For all other covered foreign nationals, it became effective on October 18, 2017. On April 10, 2018, Chad was removed from the list of Designated Countries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2017, the IRAP Plaintiffs, later joined by the IAAB and Zakzok Plaintiffs, moved for preliminary injunctive relief from the Proclamation. On October 17, 2017, the Court granted a preliminary injunction primarily on the grounds that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Proclamation violates the Establishment Clause.\n   <em>\n    IRAP I\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp. at 629. The preliminary injunction barred the enforcement of most provisions in Section 2 of the Proclamation, which directed the suspension of entry of nationals of the Designated Countries, except with respect to those individuals who lack a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 633.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the same day, the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii also enjoined enforcement of the Proclamation in a separate case, on the grounds that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Proclamation exceeded the scope of the President's statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), specifically the authority contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and 1185, and violated a separate provision of the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), which bars discrimination on the basis of nationality in\n   the issuance of immigrant visas.\n   <em>\n    Hawaii v.

On November 2, 2018, this Court granted the IAAB Plaintiffs and the Zakzok Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaints. Across the three Complaints, Plaintiffs collectively have named the following Defendants: President Trump, the U.S. Department of State (\"State Department\"), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the Office of the Director of National\n   Intelligence, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   All Plaintiffs bring claims under the APA alleging that the Proclamation and the actions taken by the implementing agencies do not comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of the APA (the \"APA Claims\"). Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the issuance and implementation of the Proclamation was arbitrary and capricious, or an abuse of discretion, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A), and that it was issued \"without observance of procedure required by law,\" including the following of rulemaking procedures, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(D) and 553.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   All Plaintiffs also continue to assert that the Proclamation violates the Establishment Clause. The IRAP and IAAB Plaintiffs further assert claims that the Proclamation violates the equal protection and procedural due process components of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Finally, the IAAB Plaintiffs assert that the Proclamation also violates the First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association. Together, these claims will be referred to as the \"Constitutional Claims.\" All Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In support of their claims, Plaintiffs describe in great detail President Trump's statements expressing his intent to institute a Muslim ban by barring entry of individuals from predominantly Muslim territories and his \"explicitly bigoted statements about Muslims and Islam,\" including statements surrounding the implementation of EO-1, EO-2, and the Proclamation. Zakzok Am. Compl. \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IRAP I\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 585-86, 589-90. Plaintiffs allege that the Proclamation bears no rational relationship to the national security interests it purports to further and identify features of the Proclamation's design, its exceptions, its failure to justify itself, and the waiver process in support of their theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, Plaintiffs argue that the design of the Proclamation provides proof that it does not further its supposed national security purposes. The Zakzok Plaintiffs allege that a nationality-based ban will not reduce terrorism risks, because DHS has concluded that country of citizenship is not a reliable predictor of the risk of terrorist activity and no Americans have died from a terrorist attack in the last 40 years based on the actions of citizens of five of the eight Designated Countries. The IAAB Plaintiffs allege that the use of the INA's Visa Waiver Program, 8 U.S.C. S1187, to evaluate which countries to include in the ban is an irrational baseline because the purposes of and concerns underlying the Visa Waiver Program and the Proclamation are divergent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to the IAAB and Zakzok Plaintiffs, the Proclamation's departures from the purported results of the baseline test, by including or exempting certain countries from the list of Designated Countries even if they failed or passed the baseline test, evidence that the Proclamation furthers not national security interests, but other unidentified concerns. Similarly, Plaintiffs assert that the exceptions to the visa suspensions are not rationally related to any national security measure. The Zakzok Plaintiffs contend that because the Proclamation allows foreign nationals from the Designated Countries to enter the United States on some nonimmigrant visas, for which they receive less vetting, it does not actually accomplish increased information sharing between the Designated Countries and the United States. The IRAP and IAAB Plaintiffs allege that the\n   Proclamation's exceptions for certain foreign nationals and certain countries react to \"legal challenges and public condemnation\" originating with EO-1 and EO-2 and thus are not founded in any national security policy. IRAP 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs assert that the Proclamation's duplication of other programs under the INA and its failure to explain why its measures are necessary demonstrate that it is not related to national security concerns. Plaintiffs emphasize that the Proclamation does not explain what specific \"visa vetting failures\" or other factors led DHS to recommend suspending immigration from the Designated Countries or suspending only certain types of visas from certain countries, when it admits that other, unidentified countries could have been included under the terms of DHS's review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 213. The IAAB and Zakzok Plaintiffs add to this allegation that the Proclamation does not explain why the suspension of immigrants is required to supplement or supersede the INA's current method for processing visa applicants from countries with deficient information sharing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs assert that other features of the Proclamation demonstrate its discriminatory purpose. Plaintiffs claim that North Korea and Venezuela, two non-Muslim-majority countries, were included among the list of affected countries for the first time to cover up the discrimination against Muslims, because the Proclamation has a negligible practical effect on foreign nationals from those countries. The IAAB and Zakzok Plaintiffs allege in detail that the waiver process, which would exempt individuals from the terms of the Proclamation on a case-by-case basis, masks the Proclamation's discrimination against Muslims. They note that the waiver criteria, \"if applied in good faith,\" would allow the entry of those foreign nationals who do not trigger the national security concerns referenced in the Proclamation. Zakzok Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. However, the waiver criteria are either \"wholly unrelated to national security\" or were considered in the visa vetting process that was in place before the Proclamation was issued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. They assert that the State Department and DHS have established no process to apply for waivers, informed applicants that legal services can play no role in facilitating the waiver process, and published no guidance implementing the waiver proceedings, as required by the Proclamation. They further state that as of April 30, 2018, only two percent of applicants had been cleared for waivers, many applicants who met the requirements set out in the Proclamation have been denied waivers, and the State Department has not made information available showing how many waivers have actually been granted. They allege that consular officials have been instructed to find applicants ineligible for waivers, and if they are considering a waiver, that they must refer the application to other officials in Washington, D.C. who will decide if a waiver should issue. These allegations, they argue, establish that the waiver process is a \"sham\" and simply acts to \"paper over\" the discriminatory animus against Muslims in, and the lack of national security justification for, the Proclamation.

As threshold matters, the Government, while conceding that at least one of the IAAB Plaintiffs has constitutional standing to pursue the asserted claims, takes the position that the IRAP and Zakzok Plaintiffs lack standing. The Government also broadly argues that any statutory claims are not subject to judicial\n   review under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability and related principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As to the APA Claims, the Government argues that the Proclamation is not subject to APA review because (1) presidential action is not reviewable under the APA; (2) Plaintiffs have not identified a \"final\" agency action to be reviewed,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) the action here was \"committed to agency discretion by law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 701(a)(2); and (4) Plaintiffs do not meet statutory standing requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 702. The Government further argues that the APA claim that the Proclamation was \"arbitrary and capricious\" is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's finding in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   that the Proclamation satisfies constitutional rational basis review, and that the separate APA claim that the Proclamation and its implementation violated the procedural requirements of the APA fails because the foreign affairs exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking applies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 553(a)(1). As to the Constitutional Claims, the Government argues that all claims must be dismissed in light of\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   , which held that the Proclamation satisfies rational basis review, that Plaintiffs do not have a cognizable liberty or property interest upon which to base their due process claim, and that Plaintiffs have not alleged a violation of their own rights for the purposes of their Establishment Clause and equal protection claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Justiciability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In broadly asserting that Plaintiffs' claims are not justiciable, the Government largely recycles arguments it made in opposing the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction that were rejected by this Court. Although the Government allows that at least one IAAB Plaintiff has standing, it states in a footnote that it does not agree that the IRAP and Zakzok Plaintiffs have standing. To the extent that these cases remain distinct, this Court has previously held, in ruling on the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, that several IRAP Plaintiffs, including several individuals and the organizations IRAP, MESA, and YAMA, had standing to assert statutory claims and that likewise certain individual IRAP Plaintiffs had standing to assert an Establishment\n   Clause claim.\n   <em>\n    IRAP I\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 595-600. The Court also found that several Zakzok Plaintiffs had standing, including Zakzok and Jane Doe No.2, both of whom had standing to assert constitutional and statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 596, 601. Zakzok and Jane Doe NO.2 remain as Defendants in the Zakzok Amended Complaint with substantially similar allegations relating to their basis for standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While the Supreme Court vacated the parallel injunction issued in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   on the merits, its opinion does not provide a basis to revisit or alter this Court's prior standing analysis. Rather, the Supreme Court explicitly found standing to assert an Establishment Clause claim, holding that \"a person's interest in being united with his relatives is sufficiently concrete and particularized to form the basis of an Article III injury in fact\" and stating that \"an American individual who has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country ... can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2416.

For example, Plaintiffs assert that while the baseline criteria were established to identify nations that lacked sufficient vetting or information sharing, the Proclamation deviates from those standards: Somalia, a majority-Muslim nation that was not deemed \"inadequate\" under the baseline criteria, was included in the travel ban. One of the seven nations deemed to be \"inadequate,\" Venezuela, is not majority-Muslim and received much less severe travel restrictions, limited only to government officials responsible for the inadequacies. The Proclamation also acknowledges that a total of 16 countries were identified as \"inadequate\" but provides no explanation for the failure to include them other than that they generally had \"improve[d] their performance\" following engagement with their governments, without stating whether such improvements resulted in full compliance with the baseline criteria. Procl. \u00a7 1(e), (f); IRAP 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 215. When viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, these allegations of uneven application of purportedly neutral criteria undermine the national security rationale for the Proclamation's travel ban against majority-Muslim nations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cleburne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/\">\n    473 U.S. at 448-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no rational basis for the denial of a permit to a group home for the mentally challenged in part because stated factors for the decision such as location on a flood plain, doubts regarding legal responsibility, traffic congestion, the size of the building, and the number of occupants applied equally to other types of group homes not subject to the same requirement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs have specifically alleged that the waiver process has not been applied in a manner consistent with the stated national security purposes of the Proclamation. Although the Supreme Court found that the Proclamation's waiver process was persuasive evidence of its national security purpose,\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2422-23, Plaintiffs have asserted that the waiver process is a \"pretext for excluding Muslims from the United States\" and is not \"tailored to address national security risks.\" Zakzok Am. Compl. \u00b6 52. Although the \"Proclamation directed the State Department and DHS to issue guidance on implementing the waiver process,\" the agencies \"have largely failed to do so,\" such that \"in practice there is no procedure to apply for these waivers.\" IAAB 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. Plaintiffs further assert that waivers have been granted at a rate of only approximately two percent, that \"thousands\" of \"individuals who clearly\n   meet the Proclamation's criteria have repeatedly been denied a waiver,\" and that individuals, such as the mother-in-law of one of the IAAB Plaintiffs, have been denied waivers before they even applied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 84-85. They also allege, based on statements by former consular officials, that the waiver process is a \"fraud,\" that consular officials were directed \"to determine at all possible cost\" that an applicant \"was not eligible to even apply for the waiver,\" and that \"even if an applicant satisfies the criteria for a waiver, consular officials are not allowed to ... grant a waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. The allegations of a systematic refusal to grant waivers to individuals who meet stated criteria, including that they do \"not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States,\" Proc.\u00a7 3(c), further support the inference that the Proclamation is not rationally related to the stated national security interests, but is instead a pretext for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Among Plaintiffs' other relevant allegations are that because DHS previously determined that a person's country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity, the Proclamation's nationality-based suspensions do not further the national security purpose. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that the travel ban does not rationally advance national security because there already exists legal authority to exclude any potential national security threat, including that individual applicants are required to submit a detailed application and undergo an in-person interview as part of the visa process. 8 U.S.C.

Since that time, no formal waiver guidance has been issued, and no application process or other procedure has been established for individuals to seek a waiver. The lack of such guidance extended for four months after the Supreme Court's ruling until the filing of the Amended Complaints in October 2018 and apparently has now extended another six months during this Court's consideration of the pending Motion. As asserted by the IAAB Plaintiffs, applicants and their attorneys have been informed that there is no role for legal services to facilitate the waiver process. Even after discussion at the hearing on the Motion, it is unclear whether, as required by the Proclamation, DHS and other departments and agencies have devised a process to assess whether the Proclamation's restrictions should continue or be terminated, and whether the required periodic reports on this issue have, in fact, been produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Procl. \u00a7 4.

Indeed, two Justices, including one in the\n   majority, identified the possibility that constitutional claims would proceed. Justice Kennedy stated that \"(w]hether judicial proceedings may properly continue in this case in light of the substantial deference that is and must be accorded to the Executive in the conduct of foreign affairs, and in light of today's decision, is a matter to be addressed in the first instance on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2424 (Kennedy, J., concurring).

Where this Court has already concluded that the Proclamation could be found to have injured Plaintiffs whose family members were excluded from the United States because of the Proclamation's alleged targeting of Muslims, and the Supreme Court largely validated that conclusion, the Court finds that such Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim that their constitutional rights under the Establishment Clause and the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause were violated by the Proclamation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawaii II\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2416 ;\n   <em>\n    IRAP I\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 599-602;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IRAP II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516071\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/233/\">\n    883 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   258-60 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/#p2141\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring) (assuming without deciding that a U.S. citizen has a due process interest in the denial of a visa to her spouse).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Government's Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 265, is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   PART.
