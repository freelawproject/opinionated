Opp. at 2. So recognizing, Dart has disavowed its notice of removal and filed a motion for leave to file an amended notice of removal. ECF No. 16. Dart asserts that its putative amended of notice of removal \"corrects the reason why the Notice of Removal is timely.\" Opp. at 2. The putative amended notice of removal states that the notice is timely \"because it was filed before either of the two thirty-day periods under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and (b)(3) had been triggered.\" ECF No. 16-2, Ex. E at \u00b6 5. The putative amended notice of removal further states that neither thirty-day period had been triggered because \"the Complaint was indeterminate and it was not until November 29, 2018 that Dart investigated and determined from its business records that there were grounds for removal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Dart recognizes that on its face, Dart's original notice of removal relies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the 30-day period after service of Plaintiff's complaint as the grounds for timely removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even though Dart's operative notice of removal never mentions that Plaintiff's complaint was indeterminate, and instead expressly relies on a different timeliness ground, Dart asserts that the Court should still deny Plaintiff's motion to remand because Plaintiff's complaint was indeterminate. Dart's argument would render \u00a7 1446(a) -which requires a defendant's notice of removal to \"contain[ ] a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal\"-a nullity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If Dart were correct, a defendant could state one timeliness ground in its notice of removal and then, once challenged, later attempt to rely on an entirely different basis for removal.\n   <em>\n    But\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Halloran v. Univ. of Wash.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538252\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/1375/#p1381\">\n    856 F.2d 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1381 (9th Cir. 1988) (reiterating that \"the defendant must state the basis for removal jurisdiction in the petition\"). Dart cites no authority for its position that the Court can simply disregard the \"short and plain statement of the grounds for removal\" in Dart's notice of removal. The Court concludes that because \"[r]emoval statutes are to be strictly construed against removal jurisdiction,\" Dart's removal was untimely, and Plaintiff's motion should be granted.\n   <em>\n    Nevada v. Bank of Am. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736899\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/661/#p667\">\n    672 F.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 667 (9th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As discussed above, Dart recognizes that its notice of removal is defective, and so has filed a motion for leave to file an amended notice of removal. Ninth Circuit law does not support Dart's argument. After the 30-day removal period has run, \"the removal petition cannot be thereafter amended to add allegations of substance but solely to clarify 'defective' allegations of jurisdiction previously made.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrow Dev.

However, the Court disagrees with Plaintiff's assertion that Dart's removal was objectively unreasonable. Importantly, Plaintiff does not dispute that this Court has CAFA jurisdiction. Dart's only failure is that its removal was untimely. Therefore, it was not objectively unreasonable for Defendant to remove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maniar v.
