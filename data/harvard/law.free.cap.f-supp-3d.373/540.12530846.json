MetaSource is Plaintiff's former employer, and Brodecki his former supervisor. In separate motions, Defendants each move to compel arbitration pursuant to an agreement signed by Plaintiff near the outset of his employment. For the reasons set forth below, the motions shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 20, 2017, Plaintiff began working for MetaSource. On March 2, 2017, he received several text messages from Brodecki, soliciting Plaintiff to come to Brodecki's home over lunch. Plaintiff agreed, believing that Brodecki wanted to discuss work related matters. However, when Plaintiff arrived, Brodecki began making sexual advances and ultimately performed unwanted oral sex on Plaintiff. Plaintiff forced Brodecki to stop and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Afterwards, attempting to grapple with the situation, Plaintiff alleges that he asked another supervisor for a copy of the employee handbook, but the supervisor was not able to provide Plaintiff with a copy. Brodecki continued to contact Plaintiff, asking him to meet outside the office. On March 27, 2017, Plaintiff alleges that he was constructively terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently brought this suit, which Defendants move to dismiss and compel arbitration. In support of their motion, Defendants point to the employee handbook, which Plaintiff signed near the outset of his employment. In addition to setting forth various office policies, the final page of the handbook contains an \"Acknowledgement and Agreement,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   which Plaintiff signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The page is numbered 39, in continuation from the pagination in the remaining portions of the handbook. At the top of the page, the agreement provides that the \"Employee Handbook ... sets forth the terms and conditions of ... employment,\" and that MetaSource may terminate the employee \"at any time for any reason, with or without cause or notice.\" In the next paragraph, the agreement states that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [E]xcept for the policy of at-will employment, the Company reserves the right to revise, delete, and add to the provisions of this Employee Handbook. All such revisions, deletions, or additions must be in writing and must be signed by the President of the Company.... [E]xcept for the policy of at-will employment, terms and conditions of employment with the Company may be modified at the sole discretion of the Company with or without cause or notice at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the bolded headline \"\n   <strong>\n    MetaSource Alternative Dispute Resolution Program\n   </strong>\n   ,\" the final paragraph of the page provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [I]n the event employment disputes arise between [the signatory] and the Company, [the signatory] will be bound by the MetaSource Alternative Dispute Resolution Program which provides for final and binding arbitration for disputes relating to termination of employment, unlawful discrimination, and alleged sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment, as defined in the MetaSource Alternative Dispute Resolution Program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Below this paragraph, there is a space for the employee to sign and date. On Friday, February 24, 2017, Plaintiff signed a copy of this agreement. Plaintiff alleges that he began working on Monday, February 20, 2017-thus, Plaintiff signed the agreement after about a week of employment. At some point, Brodecki signed a copy as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The terms of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Program are set out in a separate document which provides that the American Arbitration Association would administer any arbitration. There are no signatures on this document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL POSTURE AND APPLICABLE STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A motion to compel arbitration may be evaluated under either the motion to dismiss standard of Rule 12(b)(6) or the summary judgment standard of Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guidotti v.

There, an employee handbook included an arbitration provision, where the employee acknowledged and agreed to submit disputes to arbitration. The employer also reserved the right to modify the terms of the handbook through written amendments.

Though there is some squabbling about the effect of the particulars of the arbitration program being set out in a\n   separate document, MetaSource agrees that the arbitration provision on the final page of the employee handbook contains MetaSource's promise to arbitrate. That page also provides that MetaSource may only makes changes to the employee handbook in writing-a fact which cuts in favor of finding the agreement not to be illusory. The remaining factors, however, cut in the opposite direction. The agreement page specifically states that MetaSource need not give \"notice at any time\" of any modifications. Nor is there any term providing for the employee's acceptance of modifications. Nor is there any statement limiting the effect of any modifications to future incidents. Thus, the agreement permits MetaSource to change any of its obligations (other than at-will employment) at any time, simply by putting its desired changes in writing-without so much as telling its employees of these changes. In other words, MetaSource has the \"unfettered discretion,\" to modify its arbitration obligations,\n   <em>\n    Blair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9510647\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/595/#p603\">\n    283 F.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and has \"committed [it]self to nothing,\"\n   <em>\n    SCF Consulting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419830\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/273/#p278\">\n    175 A.3d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dougherty, J., concurring) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Geisinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"909409\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/414/85/\">\n    606 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   512 ).

Specifically, they assert that the arbitration provision is separate and distinct from the remainder of the employee handbook, and thus MetaSource has not reserved the right to modify its arbitration obligations. Effectively, they claim that there are two entirely separate agreements: first, the employee handbook, which MetaSource may modify at any time without notice, and, second, the arbitration provision, which it may not. MetaSource notes that the arbitration provision is in a separate paragraph, under its own heading, and includes the language that the signatory \"\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   \" acknowledges and agrees to arbitration. Defendants argue that this visual and linguistic separation means that MetaSource's ability to modify the employee handbook, as provided for at the top of the page, simply does not extend to the arbitration agreement at the bottom of the page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This argument is unavailing. The arbitration provision appears on the last page of the employee handbook, which is numbered page 39 as part of the continuous pagination throughout the handbook. The very top of page 39 contains the words \"\n   <strong>\n    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n   ,\" which are bolded, in capital letters, centered on the page, and set above the rest of the text. There is no other heading which could be read to distinguish between portions of the page: the heading applies to the full page, including the arbitration agreement.

In\n   <em>\n    Cheek v.

Plaintiff had already been working at MetaSource for about a week when he signed the employee handbook with the arbitration provision (he began work on a Monday and signed the handbook that Friday). Thus MetaSource had already offered, and Plaintiff had already accepted, an at-will employment relationship. The employee handbook, with the arbitration provision, did not impose any new obligations on MetaSource-it provided that MetaSource could change anything in the employee handbook, and thus any term or condition of Plaintiff's employment, other than the at-will nature of Plaintiff's employment. Accordingly, MetaSource did not provide any \"new\" consideration to Plaintiff.
