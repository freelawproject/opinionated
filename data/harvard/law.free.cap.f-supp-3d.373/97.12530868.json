KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Michael Flaherty, Captain Alan Hastbacka, and the Ocean River Institute filed their initial complaint in 2011. They sued the Secretary of Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (\"the Service\"), alleging that Defendants violated the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the Administrative Procedure Act in amending a federal fishery management plan covering the Atlantic herring fishery in the northeastern United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Over the course of the litigation, including multiple rulings from this Court, Plaintiffs have several times amended or supplemented their complaint, updating their challenges to reflect Defendants' subsequent amendments to the plan. Perhaps frustrated with what they perceived as an inability to compel the specific changes to the plan they seek, Plaintiffs most recently amended their complaint to include two claims. They assert those claims-Count II and Count III-directly against the New England Fishery Management Council (\"the Council\"), the body that developed the plan at issue and proposed it to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But Plaintiffs face an ultimately fatal obstacle: the Council is not an \"agency\" as that term is defined under the Administrative Procedure Act. And Defendants, along with the Sustainable Fisheries Coalition (\"Defendant-Intervenor\"), which intervened as a defendant, have filed motions to dismiss Counts II and III on that basis, among others. Because the Court holds that the Council is not an \"agency\" as defined under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims against it and Counts II and III must be dismissed. Accordingly, and for the reasons explained below, the motions will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Act establishes a \"national program for the conservation and management of\" those resources with the aim to \"prevent overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, to insure conservation, to facilitate long-term protection of essential fish habitats, and to realize the full potential of the Nation's fishery resources.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1801(a)(6).

They point out that \u00a7 1854(h) provides that the Secretary may not \"repeal or revoke\" an FMP unless the relevant Fishery Management Council approves of the repeal or revocation by a three-quarters majority vote. Given the Secretary's general duty to carry out the MSA's objectives, the Court struggles to see how the ability to repeal an FMP, provided it were necessary under the Act, differs in practice from the ability to amend FMPs in pursuit of those same objectives. More importantly, however, the Council's ability to prevent one type of action by the Secretary does not, on its\n   own, confer agency status on it, particularly given the Council's powerlessness otherwise to take any binding\n   <em>\n    affirmative\n   </em>\n   action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707586,910774\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/877/\">\n    125 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   882 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lombardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3812622\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/397/792/#p794\">\n    397 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   794 ). That limited veto power, upon consideration of the Council's otherwise non-binding activities and function within the broader scheme of the MSA, is insufficient for the Court to conclude that the Council possesses the degree of \"substantial independent authority\" necessary to elevate the Council to the status of \"agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ultimately, the Court, echoing the Circuit, recognizes that the APA's definition of \"agency\" does not lend itself to bright-line rules. But that has not prevented the Circuit from highlighting some tell-tale features pertinent here. Given those instructions, and upon consideration of the structure and function of the Council within the context of the MSA, the Court does not find that the Council exercises \"substantial independent authority\" such that it qualifies as an \"agency\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court concludes that Congress, through the APA, has not waived the federal government's sovereign immunity as applied to the Council. Thus, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims against it. As a result, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counts II and III, ECF No. 164, and Defendant-Intervenor's Motion to Dismiss in Part, ECF No. 166, will be granted, and the Council will be dismissed as a Defendant.
