LEON HOLMES, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is about the Little Rock P.F. Chang's payment practices with respect to its servers. Jacqueline Esry and several opt-in plaintiffs worked as servers for P.F. Chang's in Little Rock, where they received a tipped rate of $ 2.63 an hour from P.F. Chang's as well as tips. The plaintiffs claim the restaurant wrongly paid them the tipped rate for time that they should have been paid minimum wage. They argue that P.F. Chang's required servers to spend substantial time on work that by itself does not generate tips, such as rolling silverware or cleaning tables after customers have finished dining. By doing so P.F. Chang's violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act, they say, and they seek among other things backpay and liquidated damages under both statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   P.F. Chang's contends that it did nothing wrong by paying Esry and other servers the tipped rate for all their hours worked. It points out that P.F. Chang's undisputed practice was to ensure the servers received at least the applicable minium wage if, in a given workweek, that server did not earn sufficient tips to cover the tip credit. The servers therefore undisputably effectively received at least the hourly minimum wage, in accordance with the FLSA. P.F. Chang's moves for summary judgment on Esry's claims. For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The FLSA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires employers to pay employees a minimum hourly wage, which is currently $ 7.25 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C).

For example, the core tasks currently listed in O*NET for waiters and waitresses (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   the O*NET Summary Report for waiters and waitresses) include: cleaning tables or counters after patrons have finished dining; preparing tables for meals, which encompasses setting up items such as linens, silverware, and glassware; and stocking service areas with supplies such as coffee, food, tableware, and linens. In addition, O*NET lists garnishing and decorating dishes in preparation for serving as a supplemental task for waiters and waitresses.

Chang's argues that it paid servers lawfully under the FLSA's plain language, ending the Court's inquiry. It further argues that it paid servers lawfully under the dual jobs regulation. P.F. Chang's attacks the plaintiff's reliance on the former Handbook and the\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   case, arguing that the regulation is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference because the Department of Labor's guidance on the dual jobs regulation has changed substantially over time, and arguing that\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   's approval of the twenty-percent rule is no longer valid now that the Handbook has been revised. Even if the Department's view as articulated in the current Handbook should receive deference, P.F. Chang's argues, the plaintiffs' claims fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Esry counters that\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   controls because the court there interpreted the precise statutory and regulatory language at issue - and it did so in her favor. She argues that the Department's new view is not entitled to deference; rather, \"[t]he Eighth Circuit's binding textual analysis of the longstanding law and regulations is the reasonable interpretation of these relevant regulations.\" Document # 53 at 1. Esry says there is no basis for the Court to follow the Department's new position, and that the twenty-percent rule - as articulated in the former Handbook to which the\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   court deferred - should still govern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As both parties urge, the Court will not defer to the Department of Labor's new guidance in the revised Handbook. First, it is true that the Department's guidance on the dual jobs regulation has changed substantially over time. The Department previously articulated a reasonable method of determining when a person is engaged in dual jobs based on limiting the time spent on duties that do not directly produce tips. Under that guidance an employer could not take a tip credit for time a server spent on related tasks if the tasks occupied more than twenty percent of her time. Recently the Department concluded the opposite: that an employer may take a tip\n   credit for\n   <em>\n    any amount of time\n   </em>\n   that an employee like Esry spends on related, non-tipped duties. This about-face is not dispositive but it weighs against deferring to the revised Handbook.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christopher v.

But as the plain language shows, and as the\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   court held, the dual jobs regulation does suggest a temporal limit by including the terms \"part of [the] time\" and \"occasionally.\" With these terms, the regulation implies that if a server spends\n   <em>\n    more than\n   </em>\n   \"part of her time\" performing or\n   <em>\n    more than\n   </em>\n   \"occasionally\" performs related duties that are not directed toward producing tips, she is in fact employed in \"dual jobs,\" and must be paid accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The new Handbook says there is no limit on the amount of related duties a server can perform and be paid the tipped rate, so long as the duties are performed contemporaneously with tip-producing duties or for a reasonable time immediately before or after.

The Department's new interpretation is not persuasive. This is so in part because the revised Handbook \"purport[s] to change the DOL's interpretation after years of consistently construing the Dual Jobs Regulation as limited by the 80/20 rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   , 354 F.Supp.3d at 986. But most importantly the guidance is unpersuasive because, as discussed above, it contradicts the regulation as it plainly reads and as\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   interpreted it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, P.F. Chang's substantive argument against Esry's claim under the dual jobs regulation was that the regulation \"by its terms does not establish limits on side work.\" Document # 51 at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. The Court has concluded to the contrary and in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   that the regulation does establish limits - although imprecise limits - on side work, or work that does not directly produce tips. P.F. Chang's motion for summary judgment, or for partial summary judgment, must therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The question of law remains: when does a server go from spending \"part of her time\" performing or \"occasionally\" performing related work to effectively being employed in dual jobs? For example, if a server waits only one table in a shift, and prepares salads or washes dishes the rest of the time, is she engaged in a tipped occupation the entire time or is she somehow employed in dual jobs? The twenty-percent rule under\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   - although almost certainly burdensome to apply in practice - had the benefit of clearly answering this question: when related duties exceeded twenty percent of her time.\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   's approval of the twenty-percent rule does not bind this Court because it was based largely on the Department's former Handbook, which has been replaced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the Court agrees with the\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   court that the twenty-percent rule approved of in\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   is a reasonable interpretation of the regulation. Unless and until\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   is overruled or the Department of Labor issues new guidance, this Court will follow\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   and apply the twenty-percent rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
