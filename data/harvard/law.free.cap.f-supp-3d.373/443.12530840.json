The revisions fell into two categories. First, NYSDEC proposed revising the designated uses for both Class I and Class SD saline surface waters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Under the revisions, Class I waters would additionally be suitable for \"primary contact recreation\" and Class SD waters would additionally be suitable for \"primary and secondary contact recreation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both designated-use revisions were qualified by the language, \"although other factors may limit the use for these purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, NYSDEC proposed certain revisions to the \"total coliform standard\" and the \"fecal coliform standard\" for Class I and Class SD waters (collectively, the \"Water Quality Standards\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 9, 2016, the EPA responded with a letter (\"2016 Letter\") notifying NYSDEC that it was approving the designate-use revisions and \"not taking action\" on the Water Quality Standards.

There is no evidence in the record that NYSDEC adopted the 2012\n   RWQC or any other standards that the EPA has found to be scientifically defensible.

These congressional goals simply cannot be satisfied when neither the EPA nor the state has promulgated a water quality standard that complies with federal law.

In this situation, Congress has stated that the [EPA]-and nobody else-must promptly prepare and promulgate an acceptable water quality standard. Congress could have solved this problem by permitting the [EPA], in her discretion, to either prepare the regulations or permit a state reg-neg process to do so. But Congress placed the burden on the [EPA] to achieve the goals of the [CWA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Raymond Proffitt Foundation v.
