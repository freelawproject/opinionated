Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201383\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This matter has been referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge to prepare a report and recommended disposition pursuant to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons expressed herein, we have found that the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, it is recommended that the final decision of the Commissioner denying Myers's claims for benefits be\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   , and that Myers's request for a new hearing or award of benefits be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Myers is an adult individual, born on January 7, 1979. Myers was thirty-five years of age at the time of his alleged onset of disability-August 11, 2014. (Tr. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Myers's age at the onset date places him in a category of a \"younger person\" under the Commissioner's regulations whose age generally does not affect his ability to adjust to other work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 29, 2015, Myers protectively filed his application for benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. In both applications, he alleged that he became disabled on August 11, 2014. (Tr.13). Myers's alleged impairment is a back issue. (Tr. 94). His claims were initially denied on October 1, 2015. On November 18, 2015, Myers filed a written request for an administrative hearing. That request was granted. On June 1, 2017, Myers appeared and testified at a hearing before Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Michele Stolls in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Plaintiff was represented by counsel, Blake Griffin, at the hearing. Additionally, Vocational Expert (\"VE\") Gerald W. Keating also appeared and testified. (Tr. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 5, 2017, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision in which she concluded that, considering Myers's age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there are jobs that he can perform that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. Myers then filed a timely complaint on March 16, 2018, in this court. (Doc. 1). In his complaint, Myers alleges that the final decision of the Commissioner is not supported by substantial evidence and is contrary to law and regulation. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 23, 2018, the Commissioner filed her answer in which she maintains that the ALJ's decision was made in accordance with the law and regulations and the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. (Doc. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This matter has been fully briefed by the parties and is ripe for decision. (Docs. 12, 15, and 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff was born on January 7, 1979. (Tr. 94). He completed a high school education. (Tr. 190). Myers previously worked as a radiator repairman, countertop assembler and coupler. Myers stated he stopped working because it is difficult for him to function on an everyday basis with the pain. (Tr. 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Myers lives with his parents in a home in Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania, which is in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. (Tr. 34-35). Myers stated that he is able to prepare meals and take care of his personal needs. (Tr. 40, 170). He stated he is unable to help with chores around the house because of the necessity to bend, squat, and twist. (Tr. 40-41). He stated he is able to sit on the back porch. (Tr. 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Myers stated that besides taking medication, he is careful what he does and tries not to overdo anything in order to manage his pain. (Tr. 41). He stated he is not in any one position all day, he is usually up and down. (Tr. 41). He stated that he has bad days and worse days. He stated that he has difficulty sleeping at night, and the level of difficulty sleeping has a direct correlation to his pain the next day. (Tr. 42). He stated that from Sunday to Sunday, on average, he has two good days. (Tr. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Myers stated that when he travelled to Florida, he had difficulty with sitting on the flights and difficulty handling his luggage. (Tr. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Myers stated that he has pain in his entire lower back. (Tr. 43). He stated he is able to lift approximately 8 to 10 pounds without pain (e.g., a case of water/soda).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Tr. 174). He stated that he is able to follow written and spoken instructions and gets along with authority figures. (Tr. 174-75). He is able to handle stress and changes in routine. (Tr. 175).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

(Tr. 15). At step one, the ALJ found that Myers had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since August 11, 2014, his alleged onset date. (Tr. 15). At step two, the ALJ found that Myers had the following medically determinable severe impairment: degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with radiculopathy, status post-surgery. (Tr. 15). Additionally, the record disclosed a remote history of right shoulder surgery, but this condition was found to cause no more than minimal limitations on Myers's ability to perform basic work-related activities and therefore was found to be non-severe. At step three, the ALJ found that Myers did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R.

(Tr. 17). The ALJ considered Myers's degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and his status-post lumbar laminectomy when assessing his RFC. (Tr. 18). The ALJ also considered treatment records and evidence of Myers's activities when assessing the RFC and limited Myers to sedentary work, with additional limitations due to Myers's physical complaints.

She considered that Myers testified that he cannot work due to the pain he has everyday. (Tr. 36). The ALJ noted that Myers had undergone back surgery and alleges that he is unable to sit, stand, lay or walk for prolonged periods of time and that he needs to change positions often. (Tr. 170). She noted that he can take care of his personal needs and he is able to mow the grass with breaks. (Tr. 171).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The ALJ also took into consideration a statement submitted by Myers's sister, Michelle Harman, who stated that Myers's pain is hard to witness and that he seemed worse since the surgery. (Tr. 235).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The ALJ reviewed the treatment records of Rodwan K. Rajjoub, M.D. and considered that Myers's treatment included physical therapy following surgery. Records note that in July 2014, Dr. Rajjoub felt that Myers was doing well with some residual soreness and was able to return to regular work duty. (Tr. 348). Upon returning to work after his laminectomy, Myers reinjured his back while\n   climbing a ladder and carrying a five gallon bucket of tools. (Tr. 398, 334). He was seen by Dr. Rajjoub on September 8, 2014, who indicated that Myers would need to be off work for two weeks. He recommended physical therapy and prescribed Flexeril. (Tr. 354). Myers followed up with physical therapy. (Tr. 406-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The ALJ reviewed the records of Sonia Reich, CRNP, and noted that Myers was seen on June 18, 2015 for completion of forms and medication refills. Ms. Reich's notes indicate that Myers's low back pain, back stiffness, and lower extremity pain were stable. (Tr. 476-77). His physical examinations in the records show negative straight leg raising, normal gait and that Myers's pain improved with medications. (Tr. 467, 470, 472, 474). The ALJ noted that the record shows that Ms. Reich completed an RFC assessment in October 2015 in which she noted that Myers is seen every 3 to 4 months for lumbar radiculopathy and degenerative disc disease of the spine. She felt that Myers could walk two blocks, sit for 30 minutes at a time, up to 3-hours in an 8-hour day and stand/walk for 15 minutes at a time, up to 2-hours in an 8-hour day. Myers would need to reposition every 30-45 minutes and could lift and carry 10 pounds occasionally, but would be absent from work 1-2 days per month. (Tr. 447-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ms. Reich completed a physical assessment in March 2017, where she noted that Myers had no side effects from his medications and that Myers could walk one city block, sit for 4-hours in an 8-hour day and stand/walk for 4 hours in an 8-hour day. She felt Myers would need unscheduled breaks and could lift and carry 10 pounds. She felt Myers would miss 3-4 days of work per month. (Tr. 461-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After careful consideration of the record, the ALJ gave little weight to the opinion of Ms. Reich, not only because she is not an acceptable medical source, but also because her findings were not supported by the objective medical evidence including her own records. (Tr. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The ALJ then reviewed the records of Myers's chiropractor, David Watto, D.C., whose records showed post-laminectomy syndrome, intervertebral disc disorder and lumbago with sciatica. Dr. Watto felt Myers was unable to work since his back surgery. (Tr. 477). The ALJ noted that in Dr. Watto's physical assessment, he found that Myers could walk 1 city block, sit for 1 hour in an 8-hour day and stand/walk for 30 minutes in an 8-hour day, could lift and carry 10 pounds, and would be absent from work up to 4 days per month. (Tr. 464-65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As for the assessment of Dr. Watto, the ALJ again gave little weight because his findings are not supported by the record and he is not an acceptable medical source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As noted by the ALJ, Dr. Watto and Ms. Reich are not \"acceptable medical sources\" as defined by the Social Security regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.902.

These factors include: how long the source has known or seen the claimant; how consistent the opinion is with other evidence; the degree to which the source presents relevant evidence to support the opinion; how well the source explains the opinion; whether the source has a specialty\n   or area of expertise related to the claimant's impairment; and any other relevant factors that tend to support or refute the opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927; Soc.

(Tr. 17, 19, 37, 171, 173). Myers also went on a vacation to Florida for a month in January 2016 and was shoveling snow in March 2017. (Tr. 467). The ALJ found that considering all of this, the record supported the finding that Myers was capable of a limited range of sedentary work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The record simply does not support Myers's alleged level of complaints. Myers's argument on this issue is without merit. Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding and the ALJ sufficiently discussed and analyzed the evidence of record and specifically found that Myers's allegations were inconsistent with the record and not supported by substantial evidence. (Tr. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, Myers argues that the ALJ relied on her own \"lay opinion\" as the basis for the RFC finding. In this case, it does not appear that the RFC assessment was based on the ALJ's own \"lay opinion.\" Although the ALJ does not give significant weight to Ms. Reich or Mr. Watto, the ALJ based her decision on the findings of the entire medical/evidence of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Myers's argument is contrary to the controlling regulations and pertinent Third Circuit precedent. Nothing in the Social Security Act or governing regulations requires the ALJ to obtain matching \"opinion\" evidence in order to fashion a claimant's RFC. The controlling regulations are explicit that the formulation of a claimant's RFC from the broad record before him is an administrative responsibility for the ALJ, not a treating or other physician. \"[T]he ALJ is responsible for making an RFC determination ... and he is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to seek a separate expert medical opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Mays\n   </em>\n   , 78 Fed.

Pa. Sept. 30, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, it was the ALJ's job to review the evidence of record and assess a proper RFC. The ALJ found that neither Ms. Reich or Mr. Watto's opinions were supported by the objective medical evidence. (Tr. 19). The records simply do not support the findings of Ms. Reich and Mr. Watto's extreme limitations. In making her finding, the ALJ's RFC assessment included simple, routine, repetitive work with no more than a SVP of 2 and accounted for Myers's pain to the extent that it may affect his attention and concentration. (Tr. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, Myers asserts that the record was not fully developed. Although the ALJ has the duty to assist a claimant in developing a full and fair record,\n   <em>\n    Ventura v.

Furthermore, because Myers was represented by counsel at the administrative level, the ALJ is entitled to assume that the claimant is making the strongest case possible for benefits.\n   <em>\n    Glenn v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1684365\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/814/387/#p391\">\n    814 F.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (7th Cir. 1987). In this case, the ALJ complied with her duty to ensure that the record was fully developed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In fact, Myers's counsel did not request assistance from the ALJ in obtaining any additional records nor did counsel request further examinations. Myers asserts that the ALJ should have obtained a consultative examination. Beyond what was produced at the hearing, no further evidence was needed for the ALJ to decide Myers case. Before the ALJ issued her decision denying benefits, Myers's counsel could have requested the ALJ to order a consultative evaluation, but made no such request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The record shows that Myers was referred to a consultative examiner at the initial level because there was an absence of post-operative evidence. (Tr. 214). Myers attempted to attend the consultative examination, but left the medical office because of the long wait time and he felt uncomfortable around the other patients.
