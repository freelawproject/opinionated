Thus, given the defendant's failure to follow its own administrative process, the Court cannot conclude that any failure by the plaintiffs to reasonably describe the records sought supports the defendant's position that it is entitled to summary judgment as to the adequacy of its search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruotolo v.

As an initial matter, although the defendant asserts that it \"used over eighty terms,\" Def.'s Mem. at 7, the defendant's declarations reflect that approximately two-thirds of the defendant's custodians searched using only the terms \"CARI\" or \"Criminal Alien Removal Initiative,\" Pls.' Cross-Mot., Ex. 15 (Chart of ICE's Searches by Custodian, Storage System, and Search Terms Summarizing Declarations of Paula Harrington and Fernando Pineiro (\"Custodian Chart\") ) (demonstrating that, of the 153 custodians who searched for responsive records, 59 searched using only \"CARI\" and an additional 43 searched using only \"CARI\" and \"Criminal Alien Removal Initiative\"). Additionally, many of the remaining custodians effectively searched using only these terms, as they used terms containing, and thus, duplicative of, the term \"CARI,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Harrington Decl. \u00b6 13 (representing that thirty-eight of the eighty search terms used contained the term \"CARI\"), or terms that quoted language in the Request verbatim and, thus, were likely too narrow to yield any meaningful results,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Harrington Decl. \u00b6 13 (representing that the custodians' search terms included the following: \"Total number of individuals fingerprinted using ICE's mobile fingerprinting units,\" \"What the federal government is saying about CARI,\" \"What ICE is saying re: CARI,\" and \"Race or ethnicity of each individual arrested and/or fingerprinted\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coffey I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274260\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/488/#p498\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting as unreasonable search terms \"tailor[ed] ... to the request in [a] literal manner\" absent explanation as to \"why the [ ] format [ ] used would be likely to turn up responsive records\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, the defendant fails to adequately explain why these two terms alone were adequate to uncover all responsive documents. Its assertion that these terms are sufficient because \"every topic [of requested records] is connected to CARI,\" Harrington Decl. \u00b6 14, falls short for several reasons. First, the plaintiffs' Request seeks records not necessarily linked to CARI,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pineiro Decl., Ex. 1 (Request) at 11 (seeking \"[t]otal number of ICE arrests per week in [ ] designated jurisdiction[s]\" in New Orleans, the \"[t]otal\n   number of individuals fingerprinted using ICE's mobile fingerprinting units and/or other technological tools per week,\" and the \"[r]ace or ethnicity of each individual arrested and/or fingerprinted\" in those categories), and, thus, the Court finds it difficult to conclude that such terms are reasonably tailored to uncover such records. Additionally, evidence in the record suggests that the terms \"CARI\" and \"Criminal Alien Removal Initiative\" may not be sufficient to uncover responsive records specific to CARI either. For example, documents produced by the defendant suggest that CARI activities may be referred to using other terms, such as \"Fugitive Operations,\" Pls.'

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the defendant has in many respects failed to demonstrate that its search for records responsive to the plaintiffs' Request was reasonably calculated to uncover all responsive documents. Specifically, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that it searched all locations reasonably likely to contain responsive records because it failed to search the six additional offices identified by the plaintiffs, failed to search its databases for CARI-related data, and failed to produce responsive email attachments. However, the Court lacks sufficient information to determine whether the defendant conducted an adequate search of its other record systems or employed reasonably tailored search terms. Accordingly, the Court will deny the defendant's motion for summary judgment without prejudice, grant in part and deny without prejudice in part the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to the adequacy of the defendant's search, and order the defendant to conduct additional searches or provide additional affidavits in accordance with this Memorandum Opinion. Additionally, the Court concludes that the defendant has failed to provide sufficient information to allow the Court to evaluate the propriety of its withholdings under Exemptions 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E). Accordingly, the Court will deny the parties' motions for summary judgment without prejudice as to the applicability of these exemptions and require the defendant to supplement its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices or submit additional affidavits that address the Court's concerns as indicated in this Memorandum Opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 4th day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s Facts\"); (2) the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Mem.\"); (3) the Declaration of Fernando Pineiro in Support of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pineiro Decl.\"); (4) the Declaration of Paula Harrington in Support of the United States Immigration and Enforcement Agency's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Harrington Decl.\"); (5) the Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pls.'
