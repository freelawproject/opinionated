The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE ORIGIN OF THE MOTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from HSBC Mortgage's attempts to collect a debt (the \"Debt\") from Plaintiff George Carlos Caban after Caban filed for bankruptcy. According to Caban's First Amended Complaint, the Debt was secured by a lien on Caban's former home (the \"Property\"). Pl.'s First Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. Caban listed the Debt in his bankruptcy petition as \"surrender\" and later vacated the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The bankruptcy court entered an order staying the recovery of any pre-petition claims against Caban during the pendency of his petition (the \"Automatic Stay\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Then, the bankruptcy court entered an order discharging Caban from any liability for creditors' pre-petition claims (the \"Discharge Order\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The Discharge Order enjoined creditors from attempting to collect on prepetition claims against Caban, specifically providing that \"a creditor is not permitted to contact a debtor by mail, phone, or otherwise ... or take any other action to collect a discharged debt from the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Caban alleges that HSBC Mortgage received notice of both the Automatic Stay and the Discharge Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. After the bankruptcy court entered the Discharge Order, HSBC Mortgage foreclosed on the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Caban asserts that HSBC Mortgage engaged in illegal debt collection activities both during the pendency of his bankruptcy petition and after the bankruptcy court entered the Discharge Order. Caban alleges that HSBC Mortgage made multiple collection calls to his cell phone during the pendency of his petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Caban also alleges that HSBC Mortgage sent him billing statements and letters demanding payment of the Debt after the bankruptcy court entered the Discharge Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Caban alleges that HSBC Mortgage accessed and reviewed his consumer credit report with Equifax at least twelve times after the bankruptcy court entered the Discharge Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Caban maintains that, in order to access his Equifax report, HSBC Mortgage represented that it had a permissible purpose, such as to insure or monitor its account with Caban or to complete a credit application from Caban. Caban alleges that these representations were false.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Caban says that HSBC Mortgage's collection activities caused him monetary loss, mental anguish, and emotional distress, including \"a substantial amount of anxiety, distress, insomnia, fear, nervousness, frustration, anger and stress which has reached a level that has physically harmed him, evidence for\n   which will be presented to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his First Amended Complaint, Caban brings claims against HSBC Mortgage for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), violation of the Texas Debt Collection Act (\"TDCA\"), invasion of privacy under Texas common law, and contempt for violation of the Automatic Stay and Discharge Order. HSBC Mortgage now moves to dismiss Caban's First Amended Complaint. Caban opposes the motion and, in the alternative, seeks leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

THE COURT GRANTS THE MOTION TO DISMISS IN PART\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon review of the First Amended Complaint and the relevant legal authorities, the Court determines that Caban has stated plausible claims for violation of the FCRA, violation of the TDCA, and invasion of privacy. However, Caban lacks a private right of action to seek a holding of contempt based on HSBC Mortgage's alleged violation of the Discharge Order. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to dismiss in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Violation of the FCRA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   HSBC Mortgage moves to dismiss the FCRA claim on the grounds that Caban has not pled any actual damages or willful conduct. The FCRA prohibits a person from using or obtaining a consumer report without a permissible purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f). If a person negligently violates this provision, the consumer is entitled to recover actual damages and attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (a). But if a person willfully violates the statute, the consumer is entitled to actual damages or $ 1,000, whichever is greater, plus attorney's fees and punitive damages, as the court may allow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Caban has adequately pled actual damages. Under the FCRA, damages for mental anguish and emotional distress are recoverable as actual damages under section 1681\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.

Here, Caban maintains that HSBC Mortgage's violation of his privacy caused him \"a substantial amount of anxiety, distress, insomnia, fear, nervousness, frustration, anger and stress which has reached a level that has physically harmed him, evidence for which will be presented to the jury.\" First Am. Compl. \u00b6 64. Caban has sufficiently alleged that he suffered mental anguish and emotional distress as a result of HSBC Mortgage's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, Caban's claim that HSBC Mortgage's credit pulls resulted in \"past and future monetary loss,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510608\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/288/#p296\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , is not facially plausible. Caban does not explain the nature of this loss or how HSBC Mortgage's conduct caused it. Indeed, Exhibit C to the First Amended Complaint shows that HSBC Mortgage's credit pulls did not impact Caban's credit score, and that only Caban could view the inquiries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510608\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/288/#p296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C [13-3]. Because Caban has not pled sufficient facts to show monetary loss, his recoverable actual damages are limited to damages for mental anguish and emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Caban has adequately pled a willful violation of the FCRA. To establish a willful violation, Caban must show that HSBC Mortgage, either knowingly or recklessly, obtained Caban's credit report without a permissible purpose.\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins.

Here, Caban alleges that HSBC Mortgage knew: (1) the bankruptcy court had discharged Caban's personal liability for the Debt, (2) there was no open account between the parties post-discharge, (3) Caban did not seek credit from HSBC Mortgage post-discharge, and (4) the Discharge Order prohibited Caban from seeking to collect the Debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28. These allegations are sufficient to show HSBC either knowingly or recklessly requested Caban's credit reports without a permissible purpose.

Violation of the TDCA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   HSBC Mortgage argues that Caban has failed to state a claim for violation of the TDCA because Caban has not pled actual damages or any misrepresentation. The TDCA prohibits certain debt collection methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FIN. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 392.301 -02, 392.304. Caban brings claims under section 392.301, which prohibits the use of threats or coercion; section 392.302, which holds that debt collectors may not oppress, harass, or abuse debtors; and section 392.304, which generally prohibits the use of fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading representations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As discussed above, Caban has sufficiently alleged that HSBC Mortgage's conduct caused him mental anguish and emotional distress.

Accordingly, the Court denies HSBC Mortgage's motion to dismiss Caban's TDCA claims under sections 392.301 and 392.302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As for Caban's claims under section 392.304, the Court determines that Caban has adequately pled that HSBC Mortgage made a misrepresentation to Caban, but not to Equifax. Caban asserts that HSBC Mortgage violated both section 392.304(a)(8) and section 392.304(a)(19) of the TDCA. Section 392.304(a)(8) provides that \"in debt collection or obtaining information concerning a consumer,\" a debt collector may not \"misrepresent[ ] the character, extent, or amount of a consumer debt, or misrepresent[ ] the consumer debt's status in a judicial or governmental proceeding.\" TEX. FIN. CODE \u00a7 392.304(a)(8). Section 392.304(a)(19) similarly prohibits debt collectors from \"using any other false representation or deceptive means to collect a debt or obtain information concerning a consumer.\" TEX. FIN. CODE \u00a7 392.304(a)(19). Caban alleges that HSBC Mortgage \"misrepresented to [Caban] he was liable for the subject debt post-discharge\" and \"misrepresented to Equifax it had a permissible purpose to access [Caban's] consumer report,\" such as to monitor, insure, or collect its account with Caban. First Am.

However, the Court is unable to discern from the face of the pleadings what misrepresentation HSBC Mortgage made to Equifax. Accordingly, the Court finds that Caban has stated a plausible claim for relief under section 392.304 of the TDCA based on HSBC Mortgage's representations to Caban, but not Equifax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Caban alleges that HSBC Mortgage invaded his privacy when it made impermissible pulls on his credit report, placed collection calls during the pendency of his bankruptcy petition, and sent him billing statements and demand letters post-discharge.

The Court interprets section 105 as providing bankruptcy courts with the means and authority to carry out these carefully circumscribed\n   remedies, but not to create new ones. As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , \"private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress,\" not federal courts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    532 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To hold HSBC Mortgage in contempt for violation of the Discharge Order, Caban must bring a motion for contempt or declaratory judgment in bankruptcy court.

Caban has already amended his complaint once as a matter of course, and he did so after reviewing HSBC Mortgage's first motion to dismiss [9]. HSBC Mortgage challenged most of these deficiencies in the first motion to dismiss. Caban has not explained how he might remedy these faults in a second amended complaint. Moreover, Caban's claim for contempt based on HSBC Mortgage's alleged violation of the Discharge Order fails as a matter of law because he lacks a private right of action. The Court denies Caban leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court grants HSBC Mortgage's motion to dismiss Caban's claims for monetary losses under the FCRA, for misrepresentations to Equifax in violation of the TDCA, and for a holding of contempt based on HSBC Mortgage's alleged violation of the Discharge Order.
