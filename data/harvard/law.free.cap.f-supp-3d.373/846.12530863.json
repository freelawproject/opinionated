LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner Christopher Dibble challenges his convictions of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct in a habeas corpus petition filed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The convictions involved the petitioner's live-in girlfriend's teenage daughter, who was thirteen years old when the sexual abuse occurred. He contends that the admission of \"bad acts\" evidence deprived him of a fair trial, and the application of Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 768.27a to his case - a statute that permits the admission of propensity evidence in certain sexual assault cases - violated the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. The State argues that the petition should be dismissed as deficient because it is unsigned and undated, it is barred by the one-year statute of limitations, the petitioner's first claim is not cognizable on habeas corpus review, and\n   that the petitioner's\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   claim lacks merit. Because no meritorious grounds for habeas corpus relief are presented in the petition, the Court will deny it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The incidents allegedly occurred between March 2005 and January 2006. The complainant was sixteen years old when she testified at the petitioner's trial in 2008. She said that in 2003 or 2004, her mother was taking pain medication for degenerative disc disease. The medication made her mother forgetful, and it caused her to sleep much of the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   One night in 2005, the petitioner penetrated her vagina while she was in bed. She did not say anything to him or tell him to stop what he was doing because she was afraid and did not know what was happening or would happen if she objected. Her mother was home at the time but was sleeping. On subsequent occasions, the petitioner would penetrate her vagina with his finger, rub or lick her breasts, or touch her vaginal area. The sexual activity occurred at least ten times when she was thirteen years of age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioner also became very controlling and argumentative. The complainant's school grades declined, and she became less independent. The abuse eventually stopped, and in 2007, she informed her mother about it. The two of them later reported the matter to the police. The petitioner moved out after the police showed up. The complainant never asked her mother to break up with the petitioner. Instead, she thought that it would have been better if her mother was not taking the medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complainant's mother testified that in 2005, her relationship with the petitioner was strained, and she slept a lot because she was taking pain killers for her back. On a few occasions, however, she had to get up in the middle of the night and she saw the petitioner come out of the complainant's bedroom. When she would ask him what the problem was, he would say that the complainant was having a nightmare. She could tell that the complainant was afraid of the petitioner, but the complainant would not talk about the nightmares or what had happened. In October of 2007, the complainant finally told her what had happened without providing any details about the incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The complainant's grandmother testified that beginning in October 2006, the petitioner, the complainant, and the complainant's mother lived with her for six months. The petitioner was very possessive of the complainant, but not the other children in the family. He would pull the complainant on his lap and kiss her on the lips almost every day even though the complainant was afraid of the petitioner and did not like him kissing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kimberly Crissman, a relative of the complainant's mother, testified that in 2005 and 2006, the petitioner tried to control the complainant and would kiss the complainant on the lips. She thought that the kissing was inappropriate, but she did not talk to the petitioner about it because he was unapproachable, and she was afraid that she would not be permitted to visit the family if she said anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over previous objection, the petitioner's ex-wife testified that she was married to the petitioner from 1985 to 1998, and on more than ten occasions between 1991 and 1998, the petitioner would come home drunk and force her to have sex with him. On June 6, 1998, he slapped and choked her until she gave in to his demands for oral sex. She reported that incident to the police and decided to leave the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The son of the petitioner's ex-wife, thirty-one years old when he testified at the petitioner's trial, said - over defense objection - that in 1988 and 1989 when he was eleven years old, the petitioner would make him massage, wash, or suck the petitioner's penis. This occurred over thirty times. He eventually informed his mother and reported the abuse to the police. He changed his story at the request of his mother and the petitioner so that the petitioner would not go to jail. They promised him that the petitioner would get help and that it would never happen again. He did not disclose the abuse to anyone else because it was embarrassing and nobody's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Anticipating a defense of non-access, Karin Nyenhuis testified that the petitioner worked the night shift (from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) at Forest Hills Foods from March 21 to September 2, 2005. His regular days off were Friday and Saturday, but there were other days when he did not work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The petitioner presented two witnesses, and he testified on his own behalf. The petitioner's sister, Angelea Gillett-Waite, testified for the defense that she never saw anything out of the ordinary take place between the petitioner and the complainant. The complainant was a \"clingy\" child and would often put her hands on the petitioner's shoulders, rub his arm, or give him hugs. They kissed on the lips, but their whole family did that. In 2005, the complainant's mother was taking a lot of medication and frequently fought with the petitioner, who was trying to work and take care of the complainant and her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The complainant's biological father testified that his parenting time with the complainant was every other weekend, every other holiday, and two weeks in the summer. However, the schedule was flexible because he was a truck driver at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner testified that in 2005, he worked nights most of the time. His relationship with the complainant's mother was terrible at the time because she was abusing her medication and would argue or complain about minor things. She threatened to turn him in for \"CSC\" if he did not leave, but he felt sorry for her and tried to help her as much as he could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The petitioner maintained that his relationship with the complainant was good and that their kissing was her idea. He denied touching the complainant on her breasts or vagina or in an inappropriate manner. He also denied raping his ex-wife or inappropriately touching his ex-wife's son, but he admitted that he pleaded guilty to fourth-degree child abuse as a result of allegations that he had sexually molested the boy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 31, 2008, the jury found the petitioner guilty as charged of one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750\">\n    Mich.

He raised the same two claims that were rejected by Michigan's appellate courts - improper admission of\n   other-act evidence and the unconstitutional application of Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 768.27a to his case - and he moved for a stay of the federal proceeding while he pursued additional state remedies for one or more claims of newly-discovered evidence. The district court dismissed the petition without prejudice because the petitioner had failed to exhaust available state-court remedies for the newly-discovered claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dibble v. Berghuis\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13-cv-292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201423282\">\n    2013 WL 1423282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Mich. Apr. 8, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 10, 2013, the petitioner filed a motion for relief from judgment in the state court, alleging that he had newly discovered evidence, the prosecution allowed the trial court to admit inadmissible evidence without first applying a balancing test, the admission of similar-acts evidence deprived him of due process, and his trial and appellate attorneys were ineffective. The trial court denied the petitioner's motion,\n   <em>\n    People v. Dibble\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-M-13837-FC (Ionia Cty. Cir. Ct. May 9, 2014), and the appellate court denied leave to appeal,\n   <em>\n    People v. Dibble\n   </em>\n   , No. 322740 (Mich. Ct. App. Nov. 7, 2014). The petitioner attempted to appeal that decision further, but the Michigan Supreme Court rejected his application because it was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Meanwhile, the petitioner moved to amend the judgment of sentence on the issue of fines, costs, and assessments, and on November 2, 2015, he moved for re-sentencing on the ground that the trial court had departed from the sentencing guidelines and imposed a fine without statutory authority. The trial court determined that the motion for re-sentencing was a second motion for relief from judgment. It affirmed its initial sentence but set aside the fine.\n   <em>\n    People v. Dibble\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-M-13837-FC (Ionia Cty. Cir. Ct. Mar. 25, 2016). The Michigan Court of Appeals dismissed the petitioner's subsequent application for leave to appeal because the petitioner was not permitted to appeal the denial of a successive motion for relief from judgment,\n   <em>\n    People v. Dibble\n   </em>\n   , No. 332961 (Mich. Ct. App. May 26, 2016), and the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal,\n   <em>\n    People v.

Although he did not sign or date it, or fill out the sections describing the grounds for relief, he attached his appellate attorney's appeal brief and appears to be raising the same two claims of error asserted on direct appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I. The petitioner was denied his right to a fair trial when the prosecutor was allowed to introduce evidence of the prior incidents of misconduct involving his ex-wife and son-in-law [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   stepson] when the evidence was offered for an improper purpose and the unfair prejudice outweighed its probative value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   II. Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 768.27a is an unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   law because it allowed the state to convict the petitioner of criminal sexual conduct on less or different evidence than the Michigan Rules of Evidence required at the time of the alleged offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State maintains that the petition is deficient and subject to dismissal because it is unsigned, undated, and time-barred.

Mich. Apr. 20, 2016) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   If section 768.27a (or 768.27b) allowed the petitioner to be convicted of the charged crimes\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   he had committed the prior acts, the result might be different. But that is not what happened here. The trial court reminded the jurors that the petitioner was not on trial for domestic violence involving his ex-wife, for improper sexual conduct with his former stepson, or for improper sexual conduct beyond the three charges involving the complainant. Trial Tr. Vol. III at 59-61. The court then explained that, if the jurors believed the testimony of the petitioner's ex-wife and former stepson, they could consider the evidence only to decide whether it showed that the petitioner had a reason to commit the crime, intended to commit the crime for which he was charged, acted purposely and not by accident or mistake or because he misjudged the situation, and whether he had a plan, system, or characteristic scheme that he used before or after the crimes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court also said that if the jurors believed the testimony about the uncharged acts against the complainant, they could use the evidence only for the limited purpose of judging the believability of the testimony on the acts for which the petitioner was on trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61. And as to all the prior acts, the court charged the jurors not to consider the evidence for the purpose of deciding whether it showed the petitioner was a bad person or likely to commit the crimes, even though section 768.27a would have allowed that inference. The court also said that the jurors should not convict the petitioner because they thought he was guilty of other bad conduct.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because juries are presumed to follow a trial court's instructions to them,\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.
