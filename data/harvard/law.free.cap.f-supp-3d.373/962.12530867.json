The PPO required that Mr. Rayfield refrain from approaching or confronting Ms. Nancy Sawinski-Mr. Rayfield's neighbor in a two-unit residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Rayfield brought this \u00a7 1983 action on September 28, 2017 alleging that his arrest was made without probable cause; that he was detained too long without a hearing; and that these events ultimately led to his forcible eviction from his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss. (ECF Nos. 25 and 27). The Court heard argument on the motions on June 25, 2018, and took the matter under advisement. (ECF No. 38 ). For the reasons detailed below, the individual named defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, and the claims against the remaining defendants fail for several procedural or substantive reasons. Therefore, the two motions to dismiss are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Mr. Rayfield Begins a Relationship with Ms. Smith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Rayfield describes himself as an accomplished artist, author, designer, and business consultant. (ECF No. 14, PageID.65). He is also a repeat participant in ArtPrize, an annual art competition in the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Several years before the events in question, Mr. Rayfield met non-party Susan Smith while at ArtPrize, and both a business and a romantic relationship between the two developed. Mr. Rayfield moved into one of Ms. Smith's rental properties located on Kendalwood Street in the city of Grand Rapids, and Ms. Smith resided with Mr. Rayfield off and on during their relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.66). The rental unit was one of two units in a detached residence (one upper and one lower unit). The occupant of the upper unit was non-party Nancy Sawinski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mr. Rayfield's Relationship with Ms. Smith Ends and Ms. Smith and Ms. Sawinski seek to Evict Mr. Rayfield from his Rental Unit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By the summer of 2014, the relationship between Mr. Rayfield and Ms. Smith came to an end, and Ms. Smith sought to evict Mr. Rayfield from the Kendalwood address. Mr. Rayfield resisted the eviction because he believed that he was entitled to stay as compensation due for certain renovation work he had done. Ms. Smith initiated formal eviction proceedings by filing a complaint against Mr. Rayfield in the 63rd state district court on September 17, 2014. Mr. Rayfield was served with the complaint on September 29, 2014, and a hearing on the matter was set for October 2, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.67-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Rayfield contends that while these formal proceedings were pending, Ms. Sawinski decided to help Ms. Smith evict him from the Kendalwood address through informal, and illegal, means. So, according to Mr. Rayfield, during ArtPrize 2014 Ms. Sawinski illegally removed artwork, tools, and supplies from a shared garage space. Then Ms. Sawinski took out a PPO against Mr. Rayfield. This too, Mr. Rayfield contends, was done in order to push him out of the rental unit. In fact, Mr. Rayfield claims that an August 2014 police report establishes that Ms. Sawinski admitted this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.67). Mr. Rayfield also says that the PPO was difficult to enforce, as a practical matter, and that the Grand Rapids Police had previously acknowledged this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mr. Rayfield is Arrested for Violating the PPO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The day before the scheduled hearing on the eviction proceedings, on October 1, 2014, Defendants Hornbacher and Glowney were called to the Kendalwood address over a dispute between Mr. Rayfield and Ms. Sawinski. Mr. Rayfield says the October 1, 2014 call was initiated by Ms. Sawinski and stemmed from an altercation between the two that pertained to the common space in the Kendalwood address's garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that when the defendant officers arrived, Mr. Rayfield explained to the officers that he had gone to court to get the PPO lifted. He also told the officers he had videotaped the incident that led to the call, and he\n   explained to them that the tape would show that Ms. Sawinski was the aggressor in the altercation and that he had not violated the PPO. (ECF No. 14, PageID.68). Mr. Rayfield avers the officers refused to view the video and proceeded to arrest him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Mr. Rayfield is Transferred to the Custody of Kent County and Misses his Court Date on Eviction Proceedings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, \"[a]t some point after [Mr. Rayfield's] arrest,\" his custody was transferred from the Grand Rapids Police Department to Defendant Kent County under the terms of an agreement between the two municipalities. (ECF No. 14, PageID.69). Mr. Rayfield says that in total he was detained for approximately three days, until October 3, 2014, before he was released from custody. The length of his detention exceeded the 24 hours that Mr. Rayfield contends was the maximum time he could be detained under Michigan law before he would have to be brought before a court for a hearing on bond. The exact timing that Mr. Rayfield alleges he was in the custody of each municipality is not clear in the complaint. But regardless of who held him at any particular moment, Mr. Rayfield contends that both the city and the county are responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result of his allegedly unlawful detention, Mr. Rayfield contends he missed the scheduled hearing on the eviction proceedings, leading to entry of a default judgment against him. He then sought to have the default set aside, but was unsuccessful in his attempts. Ultimately he was forcibly evicted from the Kendalwood rental unit, which Mr. Rayfield contends resulted in the loss of significant amounts of his personal property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Rayfield originally filed this action against Defendants City of Grand Rapids, the Grand Rapids Police Department, and the individual officers Hornbacher and Glowney on September 28, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also named \"John Doe\" defendants, but never updated them with any real persons. Mr. Rayfield filed an Amendment Complaint that for the first time added Kent County as a defendant on January 11, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   All defendants move to dismiss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Detailed factual allegations are not necessary. The Federal Rules provide that a cause of action may be dismissed for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

However, a court may consider exhibits attached to the complaint, public records, items appearing in the record of the case, and exhibits attached to defendant's motion to dismiss, so long as they are referred to in the complaint and are central to the claims contained therein, without converting the motion to one for summary judgment\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Gavitt v.

According to Mr. Rayfield's Amended Complaint, Ms. Sawinski called the police regarding an altercation between her and Mr. Rayfield in the residence's common area. Before departing to the scene, the officers verified that the PPO was still in place. The PPO, among other things, prohibited Mr. Rayfield from approaching or confronting Ms. Sawinski in a public place or on private property. (ECF No. 26-1, PageID.152). Mr. Rayfield admits in his Amended Complaint there was an altercation between Ms. Sawinski and himself. The difference between altercation and confrontation here are mere semantics. Furthermore, the officers knew that Mr. Rayfield, and Ms. Sawinski, had a history of confronting and\n   aggravating each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, after Mr. Rayfield informed the officers that he had gone to court to get the PPO lifted, the officers confirmed that the PPO was valid before arresting Mr. Rayfield for violating the PPO. This was sufficient to confer probable cause to make a warrantless arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Rayfield's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, he makes several arguments that share a common underlying theme that the PPO should never have been entered in the first place, or should be lifted or modified to deal with the practical realities. At different points Mr. Rayfield argues that the PPO was invalid because Ms. Sawinski admitted she took out the PPO for an improper purpose, that the officers knew the PPO was impossible to enforce, and that the officers knew Mr. Rayfield had gone to court to dissolve the PPO. Mr. Rayfield cannot spin a plausible claim out of these allegations because the undeniable fact is that a PPO was in effect at the time he and Ms. Sawinski had their altercation. Moreover, the officers checked to verify this. The excerpts of the police report in the Amended Complaint make clear the officers checked the validity of the PPO-twice-before arresting him. And even assuming as true that Ms. Sawinski took out the PPO for an improper purpose, Mr. Rayfield cites no authority that would show this somehow undermines the validity of an arrest based on the PPO. Moreover, while he argues this was information known to the Grand Rapids Police Department, he does not allege the defendant officers knew anything about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, Mr. Rayfield argues the arresting officers did not have probable cause to make an arrest because they did not look at a video that he told them would exonerate him. The video at issue (now part of the record) is at best neutral and certainly not exonerating. In fact, it does not even appear to be made on the date in question. But Mr. Rayfield responds that the contents of the video at this stage of the case is actually irrelevant. What matters, according to him, is that the officers failed to view the alleged exculpatory evidence, which in Mr. Rayfield's view, automatically defeats probable cause. Mr. Rayfield likens his case to that of\n   <em>\n    Harrington v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-11946,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204360026\">\n    2011 WL 4360026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Sept. 19, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive. Probable cause is a practical determination based on the totality of the circumstances. Officers cannot turn a blind eye to obviously exculpatory information, but this does not mean they have to wait to execute an arrest otherwise supported by probable cause to consider every shred of information a suspect proffers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A suspect's satisfactory explanation of suspicious behavior is certainly a factor which law enforcement officers are entitled to take into consideration in making the determination whether probable cause to arrest exists. A policeman, however, is under no obligation to give any credence to a suspect's story nor should a plausible explanation in any sense require the officer to forego arrest pending further investigation if the facts as initially discovered provide probable cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Mr. Rayfield brought this action on September 28, 2017, just inside the three-year window. But when Mr. Rayfield first filed this suit, he did not name Kent County as a defendant. Rather, on November 21, 2017, Mr. Rayfield filed a stipulation stating he \"anticipate[d]\n   <em>\n    adding\n   </em>\n   an additional Defendant, the County of Kent who, per records provided by the Defendants' counsel, may have had custody over Plaintiff at times relevant to the Complaint.\" (ECF No. 8, PageID.29). On January 9, 2018, Mr. Rayfield filed a document entitled \"Motion to Add Party\" to add Kent County under Rule 21. (ECF No. 11 ). The Court granted the \"motion to add a party\" on January 11. (ECF No. 13 ). The Amended Complaint was filed the same day. (ECF No. 14 ). Mr. Rayfield does not dispute that he added Kent County after the three year statute of limitations had expired, but he contends that the January 11th amendment relates back to the date of his original complaint under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Federal Procedure. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Rule 15 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Relation Back of Amendments.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     When an Amendment Relates Back.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    (A)\n   </strong>\n   the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    (B)\n   </strong>\n   the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-or attempted to be set out-in the original pleading; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    (C)\n   </strong>\n   the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n   </strong>\n   knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   FED.

He did not find out until later, he says, that he had been transferred to Kent County's custody. Mr. Rayfield says the delay is due to a FOIA dispute with the city that prevented him from finding out that Kent County held him until after the statute of limitations had run.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 35, PageID.255-256). Defendant Kent County argues that Mr. Rayfield is seeking to add a party, rather than substitute a party due to a mistake, and that the Sixth Circuit has held that an addition such as this does not relate back under Rule 15 to the time of the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The case reaffirmed earlier decisions that held \"Sixth Circuit precedent clearly holds that new parties may not be added after the statute of limitations has run, and that such amendments do not satisfy the 'mistaken identity' requirement of Rule 15(c)(3)(B).\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

Here, Mr. Rayfield seeks to do exactly what the Sixth Circuit holds he cannot do under Rule 15-add a new party to the case and have it relate back to the time of the original complaint. The repeated references to \"add\" Kent County, puts this case squarely within\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Mr. Rayfield insists that he is not seeking to \"add\" a party, but rather he was mistaken over the identity of the party that held him between October 1 and October 3, 2014, and that this case should be controlled by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Krupski v. Costa Crociere S.p.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    560 U.S. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). As the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court explained it, in\n   <em>\n    Krupski\n   </em>\n   , \"the plaintiff knew of two potential parties when she filed the lawsuit, but she sued the wrong party and corrected the mistake only after the statute of limitations had expired.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742142\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/476/67/\">\n    476 F. App'x 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court found that the subsequent amendment related back under Rule 15(c). This case, however, is distinguishable. Mr. Rayfield did not sue the wrong party and then later seek to correct the mistake. Rule 15(c)(1)(C) anticipates a \"change\" of party, and the Court finds this word to be instructive. Mr. Rayfield is not seeking to\n   <em>\n    change\n   </em>\n   the party by substituting a new party in place of the originally named defendant. Rather, he is seeking to add an additional party-the County-along with the party he originally sued-the City. That is not the type of mistake that was discussed in\n   <em>\n    Krupski\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, the addition of Kent County as a named defendant in the Amended Complaint does not relate back and Mr. Rayfield's claims against Kent County are untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the same reason, the claims\n   against the John Doe defendants are also untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742142\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/476/67/\">\n    476 F.

First, it is not enough to raise a claim under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   that the municipalities failed to properly train employees regarding the requirements of state law.

Thus, to the extent Mr. Rayfield depends on the alleged failure of the City and County to train officers on the requirements of state law, Mr. Rayfield fails to state a claim under\n   <em>\n    Monell.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Any failure to train claim must rest on the Fourth Amendment and the 48 hour safe harbor rule as laid out in\n   <em>\n    Cherrington\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    County of Riverside\n   </em>\n   , discussed above. But those cases are silent on what happens when two separate municipalities share responsibility, as Mr. Rayfield contends. Mr. Rayfield suggests a sort of tacking argument, or non-delegable duty on the part of the City to make sure that the County did not violate constitutional rights. But Mr. Rayfield cites no law to support the theory. Moreover, Mr. Rayfield's allegations include nothing that concretely identifies training failures of any kind, or that attempts to link any such alleged failures to what happened here.

Moreover, the allegations of the Amended Complaint fail to state\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   plausible\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the County and City in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Defense Motions to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim (ECF Nos. 25 and 27) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent as detailed in this Opinion and Order.

Consistent with Plaintiff's present preference, however, the Court will refer to Plaintiff as Mr. Rayfield.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The parties disagree on some of the background circumstances in this case. Here, the Court recites and accepts as true Mr. Rayfield's version of the background facts solely for the purpose of the motion to dismiss. The Court makes no findings of fact in this Opinion and Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In a separate action not before this Court, Mr. Rayfield has brought a series of claims relating to his eventual eviction from the Kendalwood address against Ms. Smith and her son.\n    <em>\n     Rayfield v.

(ECF No. 14, PageID.68). That does not change the fact, however, that on the date in question there was still a valid PPO against Mr. Rayfield.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Moreover, actually viewing the video would have changed nothing because it is not the smoking gun of exoneration that Mr. Rayfield supposes it to be. For one thing, the video appears to be of an earlier interaction, not the altercation at issue on October 1, 2014. The time stamp on the video is dated in August 2014, and the clothing worn by the individuals in the video, as well as the observable weather, is certainly more consistent with August in West Michigan than October. Moreover, the video plainly begins in the middle of the dispute, thus it does not show what led to the dispute, or who began it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Plaintiff also brings this count against the John Doe defendants. Plaintiff's claims against these defendants will be discussed in a later section.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Mr. Rayfield appears to have made this statement for purposes of explanation, and does not appear to argue for equitable tolling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    As an alternative basis, Kent County argues that Mr. Rayfield's claims fail as a matter of law under\n    <em>\n     Twombly\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Iqbal\n    </em>\n    because they are supported only by his unsubstantiated beliefs, that is, by \"information and reasonable belief.\" The Court is not persuaded by this alternative argument. \" 'Although there is no express authorization in the federal rules for pleading on information and belief, allegations in this form have been held to be permissible, even after the\n    <em>\n     Twombly\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Iqbal\n    </em>\n    decisions.' \"\n    <em>\n     Cassidy v.
