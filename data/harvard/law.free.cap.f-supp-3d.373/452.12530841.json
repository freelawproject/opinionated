PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge\n   Defendants Chuck Connors Person (\"Person\") and Rashan Michel (\"Michel\") are charged in a six-count Superseding Indictment with a number of crimes in connection with an alleged agreement to direct college basketball players to certain service providers when the players turned professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss the Superseding Indictment as both legally insufficient and constitutionally infirm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

On April 30, 2018, the Government replied in a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' motions to dismiss. ( (\"Gov. Br.\") [dkt. 60].) On May 31, 2018, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment that dropped the wire fraud conspiracy count against Michel and reformulated its theory of the wire fraud charge against Person. (Superseding Indictment (\"Sup. Ind.\"), dated May 31, 2018 [dkt. 71.].) On July 27, 2018, Defendants submitted Reply Memoranda of Law. ( (\"Michel Rep.\") [dkt. 89]; (\"Person Rep.\") [dkt. 84].) On August 24, 2018, the Government submitted a sur-reply in opposition. ( (\"Gov. Sur. Rep.\") [dkt. 95].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motions to dismiss the Superseding Indictment are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. The National Collegiate Athletic Association\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The National Collegiate Athletic Association (the \"NCAA\") is a non-profit organization that regulates the athletics of over 1,000 colleges and universities. (Sup. Ind. \u00b6 9.) NCAA member schools are organized into three separate divisions: Division I, II, and III. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Division I schools typically are the largest, have the biggest budgets, and offer the most athletic scholarships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Auburn University (the \"University\") has a Division I basketball program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Division I schools are governed by the NCAA Division I Manual, which contains the NCAA Constitution and operating bylaws (the \"Bylaws\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) The Bylaws govern a wide range of behavior. For example, they prohibit the use of tobacco products by all game personnel during practice and competition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    2018-19 Division I Manual\n   </em>\n   , NATL. COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOC. (July 2018), http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D119.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The NCAA says that one of its core principles is that of amateurism and that student-athletes \"should be protected from exploitation by professional and commercial enterprises.\" (Sup. Ind. at \u00b6 12.) The NCAA effects this stated principle by prohibiting student-athletes from receiving financial assistance from anyone other than the university or the student-athlete's family, unless the NCAA authorizes such payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Student-athletes are also prohibited from accepting any benefits from a financial advisor or an agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition, coaches are prohibited from \"representing[ing], directly or indirectly,\n   any individual in the marketing of his or her athletics ability or reputation to an agent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) Coaches are also prohibited from arranging or facilitating a meeting between a student-athlete and an agent, financial advisor, or someone representing an agent or financial advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Student-athletes, coaches, and staff members are required to complete annual certifications regarding their knowledge of NCAA rules violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) It is a violation of the Bylaws knowingly to furnish or influence others to furnish the NCAA or the individual's institution false or misleading information about rules violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Violations of the Bylaws could lead to penalties, including, but not limited to, limitations on a university's \"participation in postseason play in the involved sport,\" \"requirements that an institution pay a fine, return revenue received from a specific athletics event or series of events, or ... reduction[s] in or elimination of monetary distribution by\" the NCAA, \"limitations on the number of financial aid awards that may be provided\" by the university to student-athletes, and \"recruiting restrictions including on the ability to conduct off-campus recruiting activities or to communicate by telephone or letter with prospective student-athletes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. The Alleged Scheme\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants are charged in a six-count Superseding Indictment alleging that Person, a coach for the University's basketball team, solicited and was paid bribes facilitated by Michel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sup. Ind. \u00b6 1.) In exchange for these bribes, Person is alleged to have agreed to exert his influence over student-athletes to guide them to retain the services of the payors once the athletes turned professional. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) These payments were made in violation of the NCAA's rules. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) These actions are alleged to have exposed the University to the risk of \"significant fines and penalties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) Payment of Person's salary is alleged to have been made under false pretenses and material misrepresentations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 23-26.) Defendants are alleged to have defrauded the University of the right to control its assets, namely a limited number of coaching positions.

The Superseding Indictment includes a detailed account of the conduct that forms the basis of the alleged conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , transactions where money was given in exchange for Person's use of influence over the student-athletes. There is not a mere recapitulation of the language of the statute, but instead there are detailed allegations of Person and Michel's acts and omissions, including alleged false statements made and the alleged harm cause by those statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The facts in the Superseding Indictment are sufficient to inform Defendants of the crimes charged and allow them to prepare a defense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The first is with respect to the federal bribery and honest services fraud charges where Defendants argue Person was not acting as an agent or fiduciary of the University. (Person Br. at 2.) The second is with respect to the wire fraud charge against Person alone and whether the crime was properly alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   i. Agency and Fiduciary Duty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On the question of agency with respect to the federal bribery statute, the statute requires a defendant be an \"agent\" of the organization receiving federal funds.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Defendants argue that the Superseding Indictment's allegation that Person agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for \"using his official position at Auburn University to steer students\" is the sole allegation and it relies on too broad a conception of agency. (Person Br. at 11). Defendants argue that the Superseding Indictment \"fails to allege that Mr. Person was acting within the scope of his agency\" when he is alleged to have to have impermissibly exerted his influence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Section 666's statutory definition of agency is broader than its common law meaning.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (\"[T]he term 'agent' means a person authorized to act on behalf of another person or a government and, in the case of an organization or government, includes a servant or employee, and a partner, director, officer, manager, and representative\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY \u00a7 1.01 (2006) (\"Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a 'principal') manifests assent to another person (an 'agent') that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Section 666 explicitly includes employees as agents of an organization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). The Superseding Indictment alleges that under the statute, Person was an employee and therefore an agent of an organization receiving federal funds. (Sup. Ind. at \u00b6 5, 6). This is enough to meet Rule 7's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants argue the Travel Act conspiracy charges should be dismissed because the Alabama statute underlying the conspiracy has a similar element to Section 666 and suffers from the same constitutional vagueness concerns. (Michel Br. at 34). They argue that the Alabama statute is even more vague and broad than Section 666 and that \"an ordinary person could not be expected to discern whether Auburn University's 'affairs' would include the decision of an individual Auburn student to enter into an agreement with a financial advisor in the event that the student pursues a professional basketball career after leaving Auburn University.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The state statute requires \"an agreement or understanding that the benefit will improperly influence [the bribe payee's] conduct in relation to his employer's or principal's affairs.\" ALABAMA CRIMINAL CODE 13-A-11-121 (2017). The Superseding Indictment alleges that Person used his official position at the University to influence student-athletes improperly. (Sup. Ind. \u00b6 27.) This allegation, which must be taken as true, sufficiently alleges that Person's actions were taken in relation to the University's affairs. Thus, the Court rejects Defendants' challenge to the Travel Act conspiracy count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On the fiduciary duty question for the honest services fraud charge, the Supreme Court has said that the \"solid core\" of honest services wire fraud cases \"involv[e] offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes.\"\n   <em>\n    Skilling v.

Defendants argue that \"it is far from clear that Mr. Person was a fiduciary to Auburn,\" and that, even if he was, \"the Indictment fails to allege facts supporting the theory that Mr. Person was acting within the scope of that duty when he recommended financial advisors to the players.\" (Person Br. at 14-15.) In so arguing, Defendant Person cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. deVegter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654244\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1324/\">\n    198 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1999), where the Eleventh Circuit held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [F]or a private sector defendant to have violated the victim's right to honest services, it is not enough to prove the defendant's breach of loyalty alone. Rather, as is always true in a breach of loyalty by a public official, the breach of loyalty by a private sector defendant must in each case contravene-by inherently harming-the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of the parties' relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654244\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1324/\">\n    198 F.3d at 1328-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Government correctly points out that while it is true the University is not in the business of making professional service recommendations, \"it is certainly in the business of running an NCAA compliant athletics program.\" (Gov. Br. at 16.) Assistance in running an NCAA-complaint program was a purpose of defendant Person's employment with the University, and this purpose would be contravened when a student-athlete\n   was \"rendered 'ineligible' to participate in Division I sports if the athlete was recruited by a university or any 'representative of its athletics interest' in violation of NCAA rules.\" (Sup. Ind. at \u00b6 15.) It is a factual question whether this duty to help run an NCAA-compliant athletics program was breached, and thus that issue is not an appropriate basis for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants also rely on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rybicki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294064\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/124/\">\n    354 F.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2003), for the proposition that honest services fraud requires a \"business relationship between the bribor and the employer.\" (Person Br. at 19.) Defendants point out that the alleged bribor in this case was not seeking to obtain any benefit from a relationship between himself and the employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) In\n   <em>\n    Rybicki\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals was not, however, announcing a new requirement for honest services fraud when it discussed \"the bribery and kickback cases;\" the court was simply referring to a series of applicable cases.\n   <em>\n    Rybicki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294064\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/124/\">\n    354 F.3d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because no requirement was articulated, as a matter of law, Defendants' argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant Person makes a similar argument with respect to Section 666. He argues that he was not acting \"in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions\" of the University.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This Court rejects this argument for similar reasons as above, namely, that running an NCAA-compliant program was a business of the University, and Person's alleged scheme was in connection with this business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   ii. Person Wire Fraud Charge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Count Five of the Superseding Indictment charges Person with wire fraud under Section 1343. (Sup. Ind. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) In the original Indictment, both Person and Michel were charged with wire fraud on the theory that the University was deprived of scholarship money and the right to control the use of its assets. (Ind. \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Superseding Indictment charges Person alone with wire fraud on a new theory. (Sup. Ind. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) The new theory is that Person made material misrepresentations to the University constituting a scheme to defraud. Person is alleged to have deprived the University of the right to control the use of its assets, including how to allocate a limited number of coaching positions, as well as exposing the University to economic harm, including penalties from the NCAA.

Dec. 7, 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was a subcontractor charged with wire fraud after making misrepresentations with respect to his compliance with the Port Authority's minority-owned\n   and woman-owned business enterprise guidelines and policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.

Davis\n   </em>\n   , No. 13 Cr. 923, dkt. no. 88 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2016). Person asserts that the alleged harm to the University was, at most, an \"inadvertent consequence\" of the charged scheme. (Person Rep. at 3 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Regan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7397250\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/713/629/#p637\">\n    713 F.Supp. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 637 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) ).) He argues that the specific purpose of the alleged scheme was not to secure employment or a salary but rather to retain new clients when student-athletes became professional athletes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, Person argues that a breach of contract does not, in and of itself, constitute wire fraud. (Person Rep. at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, he argues that such a broad definition of wire fraud with respect to employment agreements would violate due process by turning every undisclosed NCAA rules violation into a potential federal crime - the aforementioned \"Handbook horrible\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Government responds that the misrepresentations were not incidental but necessary to ensure Person's continued employment with the University. (Gov. Sur. Rep. at 3.) It argues that Person's activities exposed the University to multiple forms of harm \"depriving [it] of the right to control the use of its assets, including, but not limited to, the decision of how to allocate a limited number of coaching staff positions, and further exposing [it] to tangible economic harm, including monetary and other penalties imposed by the NCAA.\" (Sup. Ind. at \u00b6 54.) The Government argues that these are factual questions for a jury, not to be decided on a motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Government responds to the \"Handbook horrible\" by pointing out there is a materiality and intent requirement that must be established by the Government. The Government \"would be hard-pressed to convince a grand jury, let alone prove at trial\" that a violation of the NCAA's prohibition on tobacco usage during practice and competition, for instance, had intentionally deprived the University of information that would expose it to economic harm. (Gov. Sur. Rep. at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The motion to dismiss the wire fraud charge is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The alleged misrepresentation in this instance went directly to the essence of the bargain that the University had with Person -- his contract with the University to\n   run a NCAA-compliant basketball program. That makes this case distinct from\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   in numerous ways. For one, there were misrepresentations made by Person as to the nature of the service that he was providing - he omitted informing the University of his additional service of providing financial and sartorial service provider recommendations through the use of his influence - a disclosure that would have put the University out of compliance with NCAA rules and made the recipient players ineligible to play.\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CR-923 (LAP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203328240\">\n    2017 WL 3328240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017),\n   <em>\n    appeal withdrawn\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-3190,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206803303\">\n    2017 WL 6803303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. Dec. 7, 2017). These misrepresentations went to an essential element of Person's employment with the University - running an NCAA-compliant program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   There is also an alleged exposure of the University to potential economic harm from Person's misrepresentations, including NCAA penalties and fines. In contrast, the misrepresentation in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   went to an element of the contract that the general manager of the Office of Business Diversity and Civil Rights at the Port Authority said was only \"aspirational.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   There are also tangible economic harms alleged by the Government and subject to proof at trial. That distinguishes this case from both\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   , both relied on by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Walters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878744\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/1219/#p1225\">\n    997 F.2d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1225 (7th Cir. 1993), the Seventh Circuit reversed a mail fraud conviction of a defendant who signed contracts with student-athletes, violating the NCAA's rules. The Government's theory did not hinge on the fines in that case but rather on the opportunity cost of scholarship money that could have been directed elsewhere had the fraud not been perpetrated.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878744\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/1219/#p1225\">\n    997 F.2d at 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals described\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   as holding \"without a showing of the defendant's intent to obtain money or property from the universities or the NCAA, the necessary connection between his actions and his victims' property was too attenuated to establish mail fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Males\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644401\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/154/#p159\">\n    459 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (2d Cir. 2006). This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   because there was a direct relationship between Person and the University, and his actions are alleged to have directly exposed the University to economic harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The instant case is also distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   and Defendants' concern over a similar \"standardless sweep.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike that case, the alleged behavior in question actually violates a contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    at 2365-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , the behavior,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a politician's responding to constituents, was protected by the First Amendment and was outside the bounds of an \"official act\" as defined by the statute as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Here, the Defendants' alleged breaches of duty and material misrepresentations are not constitutionally protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In response to the \"Handbook horrible\", the Court of Appeals has said that materiality is a requirement of the misrepresentation in wire fraud cases.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Weaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276152\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/90/#p94\">\n    860 F.3d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (2d Cir. 2017). Therefore it is not prosecutorial discretion alone that is relied on to avoid making any random bylaw violation a federal felony. This question of materiality becomes a factual question for the jury not to be determined at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For the above reasons, the motion to dismiss the wire fraud count against Person is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, Rule 7's pleading requirements are\n   satisfied, and the Superseding Indictment is facially valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   B. The Statute and the Allegations in the Superseding Indictment are not Unconstitutionally Vague\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants argue that the honest services fraud statute and federal bribery statute are unconstitutional both facially and as-applied in this case. (Michel Br. at 6-18, Person Br. at 16-20.) They rely primarily on\n   <em>\n    McDonnell v. United States\n   </em>\n   , which narrowed the \"official act\" requirement in a separate federal bribery statute, Section 201.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2367-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals have held that the honest services statute is not unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2375 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
