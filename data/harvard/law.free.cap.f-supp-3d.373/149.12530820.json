DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Some decades or further ago, health care entities developed a practice of \"peer review,\" whereby, for example, medical professionals exchange information to gauge the qualifications of prospective colleagues and monitor the performance of current colleagues.\n   <em>\n    See generally, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 41 C.J.S. Hospitals \u00a7 16 (2019). Although this process has taken various forms, it is safe to say that the permutations share a common goal: to ensure a well-functioning medical system that ultimately inures to the benefit of patient care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An effective peer review process requires candor on the part of those providing sensitive assessments of their colleagues. The\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   for that frankness is the assurance that recipients will treat the information as confidential. But the assessor supplying the information wants something more: Immunity from liability in the event that the assessee or someone else is unhappy with the sharing-or perhaps the candor thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The pending Joint Motion generally concerns the availability of this immunity; it is to this facet of peer review protections that the Court shall refer with the term, \"peer review privilege.\" Only one narrow issue is dispositive here: Whether the specific recipients of the sensitive information in this case qualify as \"peer review bodies\" under the statute establishing the privilege in this jurisdiction, the District of Columbia's Health Care Peer Review Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2044-801\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 44-801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons that follow, that answer is no. As a result, those who furnished the sensitive information cannot rely on the peer review privilege in their own defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties' briefing was of limited assistance in reaching this conclusion. For one thing, Defendants tried to bootstrap the nature of the information exchanged to support rather thin attempts to show that certain U.S. Air Force entities satisfy the definition of peer review bodies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Mem. at 11-14. Moreover, the case law construing the Health Care Peer Review Act is scant. The parties have not identified any cases, nor has the Court found any, that address the scope of the District of Columbia's peer review privilege in more than cursory fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oguntoye v.

It cannot be a qualifying \"committee, board, hearing panel or officer, reviewing panel or officer or governing board\" if the entity of which it is part-AFMS-does not qualify as \"a health-care facility or agency, group practice or health professional association.\" Accordingly, Defendants must be able to establish that the Physician Education Branch stands on its own as a Category 2 entity, or that its chief is a Category 3 individual. Defendants cannot do either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Perhaps the best chance for the Physician Education Branch to qualify as a Category 2 entity would be the \"group practice\" subcategory. But Col. Grau's testimony suggests that the Physician Education Branch consisted of only one physician.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem., Ex. 3, ECF No. 86-5 (Dep. of Col. Thomas C. Grau at 18:17-19:1). Although his testimony raises the possibility that other physicians joined the office later, the parties have not pointed to, nor has the Court independently come across, any evidence in the record of other physicians simultaneously in the office. Even if there were such other physicians at some relevant time, they still would need to qualify as health professionals within the statutory definition, which the record does not support either. Accordingly, the Physician Education Branch is not a collection of health professionals that could constitute a group practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nowhere do Defendants claim that the Physician Education Branch is a \"hospital,\" or that it should qualify as some variant of this or another Section 44-501 entity. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Physician Education Branch is not a \"health-care facility or agency.\" Nor, for that matter, would it be plausible on this record to find that the Physician Education Branch is a \"health professional association.\" The Physician Education Branch does not satisfy Category 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Where the Physician Education Branch does not meet the definition of a Category 2 entity, its chief cannot qualify as a Category 3 individual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ervin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701748\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/445/23/\">\n    445 F.Supp.2d at 26, 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing officials \"of such an entity\" in Section 44-801(6) to refer to Category 2 entity).

AFMS is not a Category 2 entity, so AFCCVO cannot be a Category 1 entity. Although Defendants refer to the efforts of Col. Tankersley and a subordinate to advance AFCCVO's information gathering, Defs.' Mem. at 14, Defendants do not specifically claim that an individual person within AFCCVO satisfies Category 3.

Defendants have not shown that AFCCVO is either a collection of health professionals constituting a group practice; a hospital, recognized variant thereof, or other entity qualifying as a health-care facility or agency; or a health professional association.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Reply at 7 n.7 (arguing that AFCCVO \"serves as a clearinghouse for hospitals\n   and other Medical Treatment Facilities which rely upon it as their one-stop source for reviewing the 'primary source verification' for the credentials of any military physician (including Plaintiff) who applies for privileges to treat patients\"). There is no evidence in the record that AFCCVO is a Category 2 entity, and consequently, it does not qualify as a peer review body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because Defendants have not established that any of the relevant U.S. Air Force entities qualifies as a peer review body under Section 44-801(6), Defendants are not entitled to immunity under the peer review privilege of Section 44-802. Because the peer review privilege does not apply, the Court need not reach Defendants' argument about the burden Plaintiff must discharge to prove her intentional defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.'
