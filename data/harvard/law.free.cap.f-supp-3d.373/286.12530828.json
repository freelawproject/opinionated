Appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Grant asserts that the 2015 Final Order did not sufficiently weigh his proffered explanations for the incidents leading to his removal against Treasury's reasons for discharge. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin, sued in his official capacity, moves for summary judgment; Mr. Grant opposes. The Court has fully considered the record and conducted a telephone conference call with the parties, as requested by Mr. Grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Aaron Darnell Grant worked as a Special Agent conducting criminal investigations for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Agency), an agency within the Department of the Treasury. He was discharged for various forms of misconduct in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/28/17 Mem. Op. [Dkt. 29]. Mr. Grant was reinstated to the IRS on September 4, 2012, after the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) found errors in the Agency's handling of his discharge but without reaching the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4190-91.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On his first day back at work after his reinstatement in 2012, Mr. Grant met with his first- and second-line supervisors, Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) Troy Burrus and Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) Rick Raven, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   SAIC Raven,\n   who had had no role in any of the relevant prior events, told Mr. Grant that he would review the whole matter and, upon doing so, might re-propose Mr. Grant's removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 9, 2012, Mr. Grant filed an EEO complaint, alleging discrimination based on his alleged disability (alcohol dependence) and retaliation for his successful appeal to the MSPB; he did not allege that his race or sex was a basis for any allegedly discriminatory actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 30, Pl.'s Formal EEO Compl., AR 185-88. This November 2012 EEO complaint is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/28/17 Mem. Op.

Notice, Ex. 18, Second Proposal to Remove (Second Proposal), AR 217-18. The Second Proposal set forth several \"specifications\" in support of each reason. Each specification detailed at least one alleged violation of outstanding instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Reason 1:\n   </strong>\n   You were not candid in a matter of official business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Specification 1:\n   </strong>\n   On April 30, 2010, [Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) ] investigators asked you whether you had ever been in a car accident in your Government-Owned Vehicle (GOV). Your response, under oath, was \"no.\" On May 3, 2010, while under oath, you told TIGTA investigators that on January 24, 2009, you were involved in a car accident while driving your GOV. In your affidavit dated May 3, 2010, you also stated that you were in an accident while driving your GOV. You were not candid in your response to TIGTA's official inquiry on April 30, 2010, regarding a matter of official business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Specification 2:\n   </strong>\n   On April 30, 2010, TIGTA investigators asked you whether you had ever lost your credentials. Your response, under oath, was \"no.\" On May 3, 2010, while under oath, you told TIGTA investigators that you had briefly lost your credentials while addressing a car accident. In your affidavit dated May 3, 2010, you also state that you briefly lost your credentials. You were not candid in your response to TIGTA's official inquiry on April 30, 2010, regarding a matter of official business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Reason 2:\n   </strong>\n   You failed to follow established procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Specification 1:\n   </strong>\n   On or around January 24, 2009, you were involved in a car accident while driving your GOV. Agency procedures required you to immediately report any accident with your GOV to your supervisor. You did not do so. Therefore, you failed to follow established procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Specification 2:\n   </strong>\n   On or around January 24, 2009, you were texting while driving your GOV which resulted in a car accident. You are responsible for exercising accident prevention and safe driving while operating a GOV. You failed to do so. Therefore, you failed to follow established procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Specification 3: In or around January 24, 2009, while on duty, driving your GOV, and wearing your Service-issued\n   firearm, you stopped for lunch. During lunch, you consumed two to five Long Island Iced Teas, an alcoholic beverage. When you finished lunch, you re-entered your GOV and drove it to another destination. As a special agent, you are prohibited from consuming intoxicants at any time during the workday, including mealtimes, periods of leave when you intend to return to duty that day, and any time that you are operating a GOV or carrying a firearm. Your consumption of alcohol while on duty and while wearing your Service-issued firearm constituted a failure to follow established procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Specification 4:\n   </strong>\n   On or around March 31, 2010, you consumed three to four Long Island Iced Teas, an alcoholic beverage, while attending a coworkers [sic] birthday party after hours. You left the party at approximately 9 p.m. and walked back to the office. You left the office at approximately 12 midnight driving your GOV. You are responsible for exercising accident prevention and safe driving while operating a GOV. You are also required to be able to respond in a safe and timely manner 24 hours a day. Your operation of your GOV after consuming alcohol constituted a failure to follow established procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Reason 3:\n   </strong>\n   You failed to cooperate in an official investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Specification 1:\n   </strong>\n   On May 3, 2010, while under oath, you told the TIGTA investigator that you no longer had the contact information for the other motorist involved in a car accident you had with your GOV. You told the TIGTA investigator that you would try to find the contact information. On May 14, 2010, the TIGTA agent telephoned you to see if you had located the requested contact information. You informed the agent that you would allow TIGTA to see the information but would not allow TIGTA to keep it and then you ended the telephone call. On May 17, 2010, you telephoned the TIGTA agent and asked how providing the requested contact information would help your case. The TIGTA agent advised you that the information was needed as part of the investigation. You never provided TIGTA with the requested contact information, which constituted a failure to cooperate in an official investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400457\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/278/1280/#p1284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Second Proposal also recited the materials the Agency relied upon in proposing Mr. Grant's removal, notified Mr. Grant of his right to review those materials, and provided the contact information for the Agency's Human Resources Specialist to whom he should address his request for the materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 219-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 21, 2012, the Agency notified Mr. Grant that additional documents would be considered in support of the Second Proposal and provided him with copies of those documents. Notice, Ex. 19, Agency Letter re Additional Documents, AR 223. On January 17, 2013, Mr. Grant submitted his written response to the Second Proposal Letter, contesting each reason set forth in support of his proposed removal. Notice, Ex. 28, Pl.'s Reply to Second Proposal, AR 206-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to the lack of candor charge, Mr. Grant contended that his collision with another vehicle while in his government-owned vehicle was a \"near miss,\" not an accident, and that he had temporarily misplaced rather than \"lost\" his official credentials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206-07;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Issues in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ.

[Dkt 23] \u00b6 5 (\"Plaintiff's government-owned vehicle\n   (GOV) came in contact with another vehicle.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to the charge of failure to follow established procedures, Mr. Grant contested specifications one, two, and four, and admitted the third, that he had consumed alcohol while wearing his Service-issued firearm. He argued that: (1) since he was not in a car \"accident,\" he was not required under Agency policy to report the event,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Opp'n) [Dkt. 46-1] at 5-6; (2) the Agency had no specific policy prohibiting texting while driving and the practice had not been banned by an Executive Order at the time of the incident in January 2009,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) the Agency failed to introduce objective evidence to prove that he was intoxicated to a specific legal standard when he drove home on the night in question. 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to the charge of failure to cooperate in an official investigation, Mr. Grant believed that he was not required to provide the TIGTA investigator with contact information for the other motorist involved in the January 24, 2009 accident because it would have violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 30, 2013, the Agency notified Mr. Grant that it had sustained all reasons and specifications in the Second Proposal and that his removal was effective as of that day. Notice, Ex. 29, 1/30/13 Decision Sustaining Second Proposed Removal, AR 202-05. The Deciding Official for the proposed removal was Sean P. Sowards, Deputy Director, Criminal Investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On December 11, 2013, Mr. Grant filed an appeal with the MSPB from the Agency's Decision on his second removal; he also alleged that discrimination and retaliation caused his discharge, based on his disability and prior protected activity. Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4162. On July 17, 2014, MSPB Administrative Judge Andrew Niedrick issued an Initial Decision upholding the Agency's findings on all charges and specifications that were asserted for Mr. Grant's second removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 4158-213. Mr. Grant filed a timely Petition for Review by the MSPB. Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4471. The two sitting members of the MSPB affirmed the Administrative Judge's decision on May 27, 2015, modifying it only to \"clarify the administrative judge's analysis that [Plaintiff] failed to prove his due process claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Grant filed his Complaint in this Court on June 26, 2015, and subsequently filed an Amended Complaint [Dkt. 7] on November 11, 2015 and the operative Second Amended Complaint [Dkt. 23] on August 19, 2016. He alleged violations of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehab Act),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   On the government's motion for partial summary judgment, this Court reviewed Mr. Grant's discrimination claims under Title VII and Rehab Act\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

Op. [Dkt. 29]; 9/28/17 Order [Dkt. 30]. The Court experienced an extended illness and several extensions of briefing deadlines were granted so the immediate motion for summary judgment did not become ripe for decision until January 31, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Almost immediately thereafter, on February 5, 2019, Mr. Grant filed an \"Emergency Motion for Telephonic Conference.\" Mot. for Telephonic Conference (Mot. for\n   Tel. Conf.) [Dkt. 50]. In that motion, he asserted\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that the 2010 TIGTA Report of Investigation used in the removal proceedings was \"fraudulent,\" and \"tampered with by agency officials to hide their misconduct before/during/after the TIGTA investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The government filed an Opposition and Mr. Grant filed a Reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for a Telephonic Conference (Opp'n to Tel. Conf.) [Dkt. 51]; Pl.'s Reply to Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for a Telephonic Conference (Reply re Tel. Conf.) [Dkt. 52]. The Court conducted a telephone conference with the parties on March 28, 2019.

The Administrative Judge concluded that Mr. Grant had demonstrated a lack of candor in his oral testimony, and credited the notes of the TIGTA Special Agents, their Memoranda of Interview, Mr. Grant's May 3 Affidavit, and Mr. Grant's own July 22 accident report. In upholding his decision, the 2015 MSPB Final Order noted that the Administrative Judge made \"detailed findings of fact and credibility determinations\" and \"explicitly relied on the demeanor of witnesses in assessing credibility.\" Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4473.

Its conclusion was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    2. Failure to follow established procedures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. Grant asserts that the Board's finding that the IRS proved he had failed to follow established procedures is plainly incorrect. The failure to follow established procedures charge comprised four specifications: (1) failure to report an accident in a government vehicle in a timely manner ( IRM 1.14.7.2.8.4 ); (2) failure to engage in safe driving ( IRM 1.14.7.2.8.3 ); (3) consumption of alcohol while wearing a Service-issued firearm ( IRM 9.1.4.8 ); and (4) driving a government-owned vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Notice, Ex. 18, Second Proposal, AR 217-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   a. Specification 1: Failure to Report Accident\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Grant argues here, as he has before, that he was not in an accident, as defined by agency guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 5; Notice, Ex. 28, Pl.'s Reply to Second Proposal, AR 206-09; Notice, Ex. 17, Mem. of Activity: Motor Vehicle Accident Report, AR 423-28. In support, he relies upon\n   the IRM, which defines an \"accident\" as \"an unexpected and undesirable event, especially one resulting in damage or harm.\" Notice, Ex. 28, Pl.'s Reply to Second Proposal, AR 206 (citing IRM 1.14.5 -1). Essentially, Mr. Grant argues that the incident on January 24, 2009 did not constitute an \"accident\" for reporting purposes under the IRM because there was no resulting damage or injury. In rejecting this contention, the Administrative Judge found that Mr. Grant and the TIGTA investigators \"had a common understanding of the word 'accident' \" and that Mr. Grant knew he had an obligation to report the January 2009 incident based on the record evidence. Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4178. The Board affirmed this finding. Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4475-76 (\"Regardless of whether there was observable damage to either vehicle in this collision, the appellant admitted that he was in an accident and his later denial of being in an accident on April 30 lacked candor, as do his assertions about a 'near miss' in his petition for review.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This Court concludes that the 2015 MSPB Final Decision finding that Mr. Grant failed to report an accident is supported by substantial evidence in the record and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   b. Specification 2: Failure to Engage in Safe Driving\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Grant contends that he did not violate Agency policy when he was texting and driving (which he admits caused him to rear-end another car),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 5 (\"Plaintiff's government-owned vehicle (GOV) came into contact with another vehicle.\"), because the Accident Prevention and Responsibility policy did not specifically prohibit texting, and because Executive Order No. 13513 had not yet prohibited texting while operating a government vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 Initial MSPB Decision, AR 4180; Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4477. Mr. Grant told the MSPB that he was \"driving safely while texting\" because he could \"text and still see the road.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4477. It is inarguably evident that Mr. Grant was not driving safely while texting, presuming that such a thing is possible, because he came in contact with the rear end of another vehicle while doing so. As the Administrative Judge noted, the relevant IRS policy provision requires employees to exercise accident prevention and safe operation of government vehicles. Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4180 (citing Notice, Ex. 21, Internal Revenue Manual, AR 260-62 (excerpt of IRM Policy 1.14.7.2.8.3, Real Estate and Facilities Management, Motor Vehicle Management) ). That policy provides specific examples of common driving errors, including \"[i]nattentiveness ... using cell phone\" and \"[d]istractions inside the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Administrative Judge Niedrick found, and the MSPB affirmed, that Mr. Grant's argument attempted to ignore the plain language of the policy, \"which specifically identifies cell phone usage and other distraction as a driving error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 4181;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4477. Because the policy language directly addresses cell phone usage, and Mr. Grant admitted to texting while driving, the existence (or not) of an Executive Order prohibiting texting at the time of the accident is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court concludes that MSPB had substantial evidence in the record as a whole, and was neither arbitrary nor capricious when it concluded that the Agency had proved that Mr. Grant failed to comply with Agency policy on safe driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   c. Specification 3: Consumption of Alcohol-Lunch Incident\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Grant admitted to TIGTA agents that he consumed several alcoholic\n   beverages on a lunch break during work hours in March 2009 while wearing his Service-issued firearm.

Mr. Grant does not address this specification in his opposition to summary judgment and it is deemed conceded. The Court examines the allegations further only because Mr. Grant is no longer represented by counsel and proceeds on his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Complaint alleges that MSPB erred because Special Agent Davis, his On-The-Job Instructor, was with him while he was drinking on duty, had a \"responsibility to intervene\" because she was \"constructively aware\" that Mr. Grant had an undiagnosed \"alcohol dependence disability,\" and should have prevented him from driving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-93. Mr. Grant has presented no evidence that his colleague knew or had reason to know that Mr. Grant had a drinking problem. To the contrary, he himself later told investigators during an April 30, 2010 interview that \"he did not and has never had a drinking problem.\" Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4167;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 7, 4/30/10 Grant Interview, AR 380. While the nature of a dependence disorder may often entail a lack of candor about it, there is no basis to infer knowledge or a duty to act by Special Agent Davis due to Mr. Grant's disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court finds that MSPB had substantial evidence to support its finding on Specification 3, which Mr. Grant no longer contests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4476.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   d. Specification 4: Consumption of Alcohol-Birthday Celebration Incident\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This specification stems from a birthday celebration for Mr. Grant's colleague Special Agent Reed, which Mr. Grant attended on March 31, 2010 and at which he admitted he consumed several alcoholic beverages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4478;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 7 (\"Plaintiff consumed alcohol while at party.\"). In his April 30 interview with TIGTA, Mr. Grant candidly acknowledged that he \"consumed three or four Long Island ice [sic] teas\" at the birthday party in the District of Columbia and drove his government vehicle home several hours later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 7, 4/30/10 Grant Interview, AR 380. His deposition testimony prior to the 2014 MSPB hearing was consistent with his interview statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q: And then you were drunk when you drove home in your GOV that night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A: No, not drunk, but just under the influence. Like I said, for me as I described to the TIGTA Agent in my affidavit, I can consume a lot of alcohol without, you know, falling over. I'm not sure what your definition of drunk is. If you say, well, you feel light in the face or warm on the inside, then I'll say if you consider that\n   drunk then I'll say that's drunk. But for me, I don't consider that drunk, I just feel that's me loosening up to things that I wouldn't normally be able to do if I wasn't under the influence of alcohol. That's pretty much it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4182.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Grant argues that there is no evidence regarding his level of intoxication on that occasion but the argument does not render the 2015 MSPB Final Order incorrect. Agency policy requires no proof of intoxication to any standard; it flatly prohibits employees from consuming intoxicants \"when the agent intends to return to duty that day. This includes ... any time while operating a GOV or carrying a firearm.\" Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4477 (citing Notice, Ex. 22, IRM 9.1.4, AR 279). Mr. Grant has admitted that he violated this policy by operating his government vehicle after consuming multiple alcoholic beverages. His own deposition testimony from years later, without regard to TIGTA investigators, proves his violation of Agency policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4477-78\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There was substantial evidence in the record for the MSPB to uphold Specification 4 and it was neither arbitrary nor capricious in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    3. Failure to cooperate in an official investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The third reason the Agency relied upon in removing Mr. Grant for the second time was his refusal, after multiple overtures, to provide contact information to TIGTA investigators for the driver of the automobile he had rear-ended in January 2009. During their May 3, 2010 interview of Mr. Grant, TIGTA investigators asked him for contact information for the other motorist. Notice, Ex. 32, 2014 MSPB Initial Decision, AR 4183. At that time, Mr. Grant responded that he no longer had that information but would look for it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 9, 5/3/10 Grant Interview, AR 389 (\"Grant described the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident as a black male and said that he no longer had his contact information.\"). None of the following events, which led to Mr. Grant's failure to provide the requested information, is disputed. TIGTA agents called Mr. Grant on May 14, 2010 to ask again for the contact information; by that time he had apparently located the contact information but would not send it to the agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, Ex. 12, 5/14/10 Mem. of Interview of Aaron Grant, AR 410 (\"Grant advised that he would allow this special agent to see the documents but would not allow this special agent to keep the documents. Grant ended the phone call.\"). Three days later, Mr. Grant called TIGTA to ask how providing contact information for the other motorist would \"help his case.\" Notice, Ex. 13, 5/17/10 Mem. of Interview of Aaron Grant, AR 411. As far as the record reveals, Mr. Grant never provided the requested contact information to TIGTA. He does not contest this fact on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Instead, Mr. Grant argues that he was privileged by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to refuse to provide contact information for the other driver because it might have criminally incriminated him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board considered this defense but found that a federal employee has a Fifth Amendment privilege not to answer questions during an administrative investigation only if he reasonably believes that\n   his statements could be used against him in a criminal proceeding, which did not apply to the TIGTA civil investigation as of April 30, 2010. Notice, Ex. 33, 2015 MSPB Final Order, AR 4479;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weston v. U.S. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1920021\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/724/943/#p947\">\n    724 F.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 947-48 (Fed.

USAO declined to accept the case for prosecution on July 14, 2010.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The MSPB considered all of Mr. Grant's arguments and defenses concerning his alleged failure to cooperate with an official investigation. Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the MSPB's finding that he, in fact, failed to cooperate. To that point, Mr. Grant does not contest the facts but only the legal setting. Having considered his defenses and rejected them in a reasoned opinion, the Court finds that MSPB was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion for Telephonic Conference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mr. Grant asked for an emergency telephone conference because he believes the TIGTA Report of Investigation (ROI) is fraudulent and wanted to raise a number of other grievances regarding the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply re Tel. Conf. at 6. The Court heard from the parties by phone on March 28, 2019, limiting the discussion to the TIGTA ROI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Grant explained that, in November 2018, he had remembered and recovered from an old phone photographs of the Special Agents' office configuration, as it had been in April 2010. Looking at those photos, he observed that the desk arrangement made it almost physically impossible for him to have pulled the pony tail of Special Agent Reed, pushed her against a wall, and kissed her without consent on March 31, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   That observation led him to reconsider other parts of this long saga since 2010 and to the belief that his former colleagues had altered the ROI. He complains that at least the date in the ROI is wrong as to when the TIGTA investigation started (either April 8 or 9, 2010) and that one or more pages was mis-punched. Defendant responds that neither DOJ nor Treasury personnel have any reason to believe that the ROI is fraudulent or was tampered with by agency officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Tel. Conf. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After the teleconference and at the Court's request, the government reviewed Bates Labeled Page 40 of the ROI, which Mr. Grant highlighted as different between the certified copy of the ROI (Certified ROI) the government sent to Mr. Grant and page 40 of the ROI in the administrative record (Record ROI), and filed a Notice with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Notice Regarding TIGTA Report (Notice re TIGTA ROI) [Dkt. 55]. Mr. Grant filed his opposition to the notice the following day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Notification Regarding TIGTA Report (Resp.) [Dkt. 56]. The\n   March 28 Notice from the government states, as relevant, that page 40 of the Record ROI and the Certified ROI both show a single photograph of the front, driver-side door of the government vehicle driven by Mr. Grant, with two differences: (1) the photograph in the Record ROI is a \"poor photocopy of the photograph\" while it is \"a much clearer image\" in the Certified ROI, Notice re TIGTA ROI \u00b6 4; and (2) \"the orientation of the image in page 40 of the Certified ROI is rotated 180 degrees, ... [so that] the image reflecting the front of the vehicle is at the top of the page [in the Record ROI and] ... at the bottom of the page\" in the Certified ROI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Counsel attests that \"[n]either the holes punched at the top of the document nor the difference in orientation change or obscure the information conveyed in the depictions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court appreciates the strong advocacy with which Mr. Grant has pursued his case since his counsel withdrew. The errors he alleges in the ROI do not support his allegations of fraud and are not material to the Court's review of the 2015 MSPB Final Order. A fact is \"material\" if it is capable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this context, \"material\" means of sufficient importance to cause a change in the Court's opinion on review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022 Whether the TIGTA Investigation began at 6:26 PM on April 8, 2010 as Mr. Grant states, Pl.'s SOF at 1, or the next day on April 9, 2010 is not important. Perhaps the investigation was assigned on April 8 and work begun on April 9. In any event, the difference makes no difference to events and does not rise to the level of materiality or \"fraud.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 The difference between a \"poor photocopy\" of the 2010 photograph on which the MSPB relied in 2015 and \"a much clearer image\" sent to Mr. Grant in 2018 is also not sufficiently \"different\" to be material on review of the 2015 MSPB Final Order. It could be that the \"poor photocopy\" was too poor to be copied again and so a \"much clearer\" image was sent to Mr. Grant, allowing him to see it. Critically, identical photographs are depicted on Page 40 of both Record ROI and the Certified ROI, without material difference between them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 The change in orientation of the photograph from the Record to Certified ROI does not reduce its reliability as a photo of the government-issued vehicle driven by Mr. Grant in 2009 and he does not make that argument. The orientation does not have any material impact on what the photo depicts. The Court cannot infer \"fraud\" because of such a change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 The furniture layout in the Special Agents' office in March 2010, as shown by Mr. Grant's recently-rediscovered photos, is not entirely \"new\" information because Mr. Grant has already argued that SA Reed's cubicle contained a U-shaped desk, suggesting that he could not, therefore, have pushed her against a wall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. While Mr. Grant wants to rebut the idea that he so pushed SA Reed, nothing in the exhibit he cites states that such an allegation was made. Finally, the\n   <em>\n    entirety\n   </em>\n   of the EEO complaint against Mr. Grant is irrelevant to his second discharge as the Agency did not rely upon it to support his removal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Grant's Response asserts that he \"is one hundred percent (100%) certain\" that the TIGTA ROI in the Administrative Record \"is false and fraudulent with the intent to mislead.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Resp. at 1. The Court has read and considered his Response and its attachments and does not agree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 The Response further contends that Mr. Grant's colleagues, both black and white, conspired to lie about him because he is black.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. He asserts that \"MSPB bought what Defendant was selling\" only because Mr. Grant is black.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Grant is firmly convinced that \"[t]his case is no more than a 'high-tech' lynching of a black man ... only because he had consensual sexual relations with two of his female coworkers 15 months apart.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such allegations are not only scandalous but highly speculative and without support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 Most critically, Mr. Grant fails and refuses to appreciate how much his own statements formed the basis for his Second Removal. Those statements are worlds apart from the angry diatribe in the Response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court heard from Mr. Grant directly after he sought an emergency telephone conference because he alleged fraud and appears without counsel; the Court has also considered his Response to the government's March 28 Notice. Having granted his motion, heard his arguments, asked government counsel to compare directly the page upon which Mr. Grant particularly focused, and considered the materiality of his claims to the issues on review under the CSRA, the Court finds no reason to pursue the allegations further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the reasons stated above, this Court finds that the 2015 MSPB Final Order concerning Mr. Grant's discharge is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, is not arbitrary or capricious, and is otherwise in accord with law.
