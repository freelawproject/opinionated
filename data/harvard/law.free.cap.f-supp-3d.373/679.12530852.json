Genusa allegedly was exposed to asbestos throughout his career while working for various shipment and transportation companies at the Port of Baton Rouge in Port Allen, Louisiana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Genusa's last injurious exposure to asbestos allegedly occurred while he was working for Baton Rouge Marine Contractors, Inc. (\"BRMC\").

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). On November 11, 2014, Genusa's wife filed a claim for death benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (\"LHWCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20901\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , against BRMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action on September 18, 2015, against thirteen defendants that allegedly \"designed, tested, evaluated, manufactured, packaged, furnished, stored, handled, transported, installed, supplied and/or sold [the] asbestos-containing products\" that were the proximate cause of Genusa's injuries.

Plaintiffs state causes of action for negligence, strict liability, breach of express or implied warranty, and unjust enrichment.

Genusa testified that he worked with asbestos cargo in the holds of the vessels, on the dock, in the warehouse, and while loading asbestos onto trucks. (Doc. 14-2 at p. 25, ll. 9-20). On average, vessels transporting asbestos docked once every two months. (Doc. 20-1 at p. 101. ll. 17-21). When a vessel was docked, Genusa would either work on the vessel-unloading asbestos from the holds of the vessel-or on the dock-hauling the asbestos to the warehouse.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20, ll. 9-15). Once a vessel was unloaded, Genusa's duties were entirely confined to land-based operations until another vessel docked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Genusa occasionally went aboard vessels to unload asbestos cargo, his duties were predominantly land-based.

In\n    <em>\n     Cabasug\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff worked as a pipefitter and nuclear engineer at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, where he spent seventy-five percent of his time on vessels in dry-dock.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822660\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/956/1178/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822660\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/956/1178/\">\n     at 1180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The district court concluded that the plaintiff was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    a predominantly land-based worker because he spent seventy-five percent of his time\n    <em>\n     aboard\n    </em>\n    vessels. The district court further found that the asbestos exposure in that case stemmed from products that were manufactured for use on vessels, thereby bearing a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822660\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/956/1178/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1190 (citing\n    <em>\n     Conner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5913249\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/799/455/#p466\">\n     799 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    469 ). Here, there is no evidence that Genusa spent a majority of his time\n    <em>\n     aboard\n    </em>\n    vessels, and there is no evidence that the asbestos to which he was exposed was manufactured for use\n    <em>\n     on\n    </em>\n    vessels. Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the facts here do not closely resemble the facts in\n    <em>\n     Cabasug\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
