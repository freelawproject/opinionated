Here, it is uncontested that the broad meaning and a narrower meaning tied to employment existed at the time the Constitution was ratified, and this expansive modifier, which as plaintiffs point out is used nowhere else in the Constitution, logically serves to ensure that the acceptance of any foreign Emolument, however defined, is prohibited without congressional consent.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   , 315 F.Supp.3d at 888 (\"If there were any doubt as to the limits of the Foreign Clause, the Framers used the word 'any' twice, ensuring a broad and expansive reach.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The President's argument that the use of \"Emolument\" in the Incompatibility Clause and the Domestic Emoluments Clause supports his narrow definition is similarly unconvincing. In the former, \"Emolument\" specifically refers to an office, indicating that when the Founders intended for an Emolument to refer to an official's salary or payment associated with their office, they said so explicitly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

Thus, rather than \"Emolument\" having different meanings the three times it is used in the Constitution, more logically, the broader meaning is modified in each Clause according to the purpose of the Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567361\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/148/503/#p519\">\n    148 U.S. at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567361\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/148/503/#p519\">\n    13 S.Ct. 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   , 315 F.Supp.3d at 888 (\"If '[E]molument' were always to be read as a synonym for salary or payment for official services rendered, th[e] modifier in the Incompatibility Clause would have been unnecessary.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Also unconvincing is the President's argument that adopting plaintiffs' definition of \"Emolument\" to mean \"profit,\" \"gain,\" or \"advantage\" would render the term \"present\" redundant.

As Judge Messitte observed, defining an \"Emolument\" as a \"profit,\" \"gain,\" or \"advantage\" \"ensure[s] that the Clause covered all types of financial transactions-solicited or unsolicited, reciprocated or unreciprocated, official or private\"-even if \"Emolument\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"present.\"\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   , 315 F.Supp.3d at 889.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Furthermore, Judge Messitte points out that the President's narrow definition \"would seem to create its own concerning redundancies within the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As the President explained, a practical example of his definition would be when \"a federal official would receive an [E]molument if he or she was paid by a foreign government to take certain official actions.\" Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 15-1 at 35. Judge Messitte persuasively states that this example\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   is tantamount to defining the transaction as nothing less than one of federal bribery, a crime which prohibits a federal public official from, directly or indirectly, receiving or accepting \"anything of value\" in return for \"being influenced in the performance of any official act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Given that Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution already addresses the crime of bribery, making it an impeachable offense, there would have been little need to include two additional and distinct Emoluments Clauses prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign or state governments for official services rendered. Moreover, it seems highly unlikely that the Framers would have intended bribery to be both an impeachable offense and, at the same time, an activity Congress could consent to when a foreign government donor is involved.

Pls.' Opp'n, ECF No. 17 at 52-54. The President complains that if plaintiffs' interpretation of the Clause is correct, an injunction requiring his \"compliance with the Clause would impose significant burdens\" on him. Reply, ECF No. 28 at 32. The President also disputes that compliance with the Clause can be characterized as ministerial because of the \"judgment\" and \"planning\" needed to ensure compliance, but that even if it was so properly characterized, \"this Court should still exercise utmost restraint in deciding whether to enjoin a sitting President.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court agrees that restraint is appropriate.

However, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.D.1, the correct inquiry is not whether injunctive relief requiring the President to comply with the Constitution would burden him, but rather whether allowing this case to go forward would interfere with his ability to ensure that the laws be faithfully executed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652833\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/681/#p718\">\n    520 U.S. at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652833\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/681/#p718\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment).
