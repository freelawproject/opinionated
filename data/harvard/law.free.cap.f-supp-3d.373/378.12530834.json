Cassem and Thomas F. Owens (\"Defendants\"), concerning two retirement accounts held by the late Rev. Edwin H. \"Ned\" Cassem (\"Fr. Cassem\"). Before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count One of the Amended Complaint, which seeks \"declaratory judgment that the original beneficiary designations remain enforceable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2202\" on the grounds that \"[a]s a result of his vows, Fr. Cassem did not own the funds in the TIAA-CREF Accounts and thus, did not have the authority to designate a beneficiary in place of the province.\" [Dkt. 44 (Amended Complaint) at 8-9]. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claim is preempted by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and that ERISA's anti-alienation provision prohibits Plaintiff from asserting a contractual right to Fr. Cassem's retirement accounts. [Dkt. 58 (Motion to Dismiss) ].

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2]. The Province is one of several geographical subgroups of the Society of Jesus (the \"Society\"), commonly known as the \"Jesuits.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant Audrey V. Cassem (\"A. Cassem\") is the widow of Fr. Cassem's deceased brother, John M. Cassem. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3]. Defendant Thomas M. Owens, II (\"Owens\") is the son of A. Cassem from a marriage that predated her marriage to John M. Cassem. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fr. Cassem was a lifelong Jesuit and member of the Province. [Dkt. 44, \u00b6 11]. He died on July 4, 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1]. He entered the society in 1953, at the age of eighteen. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12]. He was ordained on June 4, 1970, and pronounced his \"final vows of perpetual poverty, chastity, and obedience on December 26, 1985.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14]. While a member of the Society, Fr. Cassem obtained an undergraduate degree in psychology and a medical degree in psychiatry. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his graduation from Harvard Medical School, Fr. Cassem began what would become a long and distinguished career as a psychiatrist in Boston, Massachusetts at Massachusetts General Hospital (\"MGH\") and Harvard Medical School (\"HMS\"). [Dkt. 44, \u00b6 16]. He founded the Optimum Care Committee at MGH in 1973 and chaired it until 2009. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17]. He served as Chief of Psychiatry at MGH from 1989 to 2000. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Fr. Cassem conducted research on the relationship between depression and heart disease and worked in palliative and end-of-life care. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Throughout Fr. Cassem's career, he \"tendered his income, as he earned it, to the Province, and the Province, in turn, provided for his lifelong wants and needs. [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6 15]. This was in fulfillment of his vows, which included \"a renunciation of his right to own property.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff alleges that the vow of poverty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Enables each Jesuit to live simply and promotes a feeling of empathy for the poor. Jesuit priests share possessions communally. Accordingly, a Jesuit turns over all after-acquired property to his province after taking his vows, and the province, in turn, provides for his wants and needs ... Each member of the community relinquished title to personal property and monies, turned over money and property for their common benefit, and, in return, received a living sustenance in the form of food, shelter, health insurance premiums, car payments and car insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14 n. 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In connection with his positions at MGH and HMS, Fr. Cassem accumulated two retirement accounts with TIAA-CREF (the \"Accounts\"). [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6 20]. As of September 30, 2017, the value of the funds in the Accounts was $ 1,258,530.07 in \"TIAA-A741815-3\" and $ 253,656.04 in CREF-P741815-0. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23]. In 1976, Fr. Cassem executed beneficiary designation forms with TIAA-CREF naming the Province as the beneficiary for the TIAA-CREF accounts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Beginning in roughly 2010, Fr. Cassem \"began to display symptoms of dementia, which symptoms became significantly worse over time.\" [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6 24]. In or around December 2010, Fr. Cassem moved into A. Cassem's home in West Hartford. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25]. In or around December 2010, Fr. Cassem \"was taken to a local attorney, previously unknown to him, and executed a Durable Power of Attorney in favor of Owens.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On or about January 11, 2011, \"TIAA-CREF received a form purportedly executed by Fr. Cassem\" that changed the beneficiary of the Accounts from the Province to A. Cassem, as primary beneficiary, and Owens, as contingent beneficiary. [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6 22]. At this time, Fr. Cassem was seventy-five years old, residing alone with A. Cassem, and \"living hundreds of miles away from any blood relatives and hours away from his friends and colleagues at the Society.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27]. Fr. Cassem continued to live with A. Cassem until his death in 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 1, 2017, the Province brought this action against Audrey Cassem, Thomas Owens II, TIAA-CREF, and\n   Neil Kraner in his capacity as Temporary Administrator of the Estate of Edwin H. Cassem. [Dkt. 1]. Defendant TIAA-CREF filed a Counterclaim for interpleader on November 13, 2017, asking the Court to order that Plaintiff and Defendants A. Cassem, Thomas Owens, and Neil Kraner interplead their respective claims amongst themselves. [Dkt. 22 (Answer to Complaint and Counterclaim for Interpleader), at 8]. Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint on June 7, 2018. [Dkt. 44]. TIAA-CREF filed a renewed counterclaim for interpleader on July 4, 2018. [Dkt. 51]. Defendants A. Cassem and Thomas Owens filed this Motion to Dismiss on August 20, 2018.

Cassem's vows prevented him from legally acquiring personal property and, therefore, he never owned the Accounts. Plaintiff alleges that \"Fr. Cassem's final vows constitute an enforceable contract among and between the Province and Fr. Cassem, through which Fr. Cassem fully and finally renounced and assigned any and all property then owned or later acquired to the Province.\" [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6 33]. The Province argues that because Fr. Cassem was not entitled to retain or direct property for the benefit of any party other than the Province, the original designation of the Province as the beneficiary of the Accounts remains valid and enforceable. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant argues that Fr. Cassem's contractual obligation to tender property to the Province is pre-empted and legally barred by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). [Dkt. 58-1 (Memo. of Support of Defendant's\n   Motion to Dismiss), at 2-3]. Specifically, Defendant invokes \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA, which states that the Act pre-empts \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,\" with exceptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 58-1, at 8] (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Furthermore, Defendants argue that Fr. Cassem's rights to designate a beneficiary could not be alienated due to the ERISA provision stating that \"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 58-1, at 16] (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether Fr. Cassem's Vows are Enforceable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff argues in briefing that the Province has a right to the accounts because Fr. Cassem's vows are enforceable under federal common law. [Dkt. 64, at 4-10]. Although Plaintiff cites precedent for the proposition that a cause of action exists at federal common law, the courts in Plaintiff's cases all say they are interpreting the enforceability or validity of a contract. It is axiomatic that contract formation is governed by state law in the United States. The Amended Complaint even characterizes the vows as an \"enforceable contract.\" [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34]. Therefore, the Court construes Count One as alleging a contractual right. Formation of a contract generally requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent and a consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (II) of Contracts, \u00a7 17;\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knauss v.

Conn. 2007). Plaintiff pleads facts supporting the inference that Fr. Cassem and the Province formed a contract in which Fr. Cassem provided all of his income and property to the Province, and in return the Province paid for his undergraduate and medical studies and his living expenses throughout his life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 14 n. 3, 15, 19, 21, 32-34].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The case principally relied on by Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    Order of St. Benedict v.

This statement mischaracterizes the opinion. In\n   <em>\n    Steinhauser\n   </em>\n   , Augustin Wirth - a member of the religious Order of St. Benedict - took a similar vow to that allegedly taken by Fr.

[Dkt. 73, at 6-7]. The existence of the EBSA is beside the point. This action involves no attempt to implement or enforce ERISA. The EBSA could not conceivably be a plaintiff or a defendant in this lawsuit. In\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   the Court examined whether RFRA could be asserted as a\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   by a church in a lawsuit attempting to enforce the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037239\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/96/#p114\">\n    441 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the RFRA's decisions are directly on point, and allow parties who, like appellees, claim that a federal statute, like the ADEA, substantially burdens the exercise of their religion to assert the RFRA\n   <em>\n    as a defense to any action\n   </em>\n   asserting a claim based on the ADEA\") (emphasis added). It was not the holding in\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   that RFRA should be applied in all actions between private parties under any circumstance in which a federal law is incidentally implicated and provisions of that law can be enforced by a federal agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To the extent that binding precedent supports an interpretation of RFRA as applying to cases between private parties, the statute only applies when used as a defense to an attempt to enforce a federal statute (as in\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   ) or as a cause of action to challenge a statute (as in\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby\n   </em>\n   .) In contrast, whether or not the statute can apply to cases between private parties, RFRA certainly cannot be used as a procedural mechanism to legitimize a cause of action that contravenes federal law for a plaintiff that is contesting dismissal. Such a broad scope would allow almost any natural person, closely held corporation, or religious organization to invoke RFRA as a sword in litigation when the outcome of a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment could disfavor the RFRA-invoking party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Substantial Burden\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In any event, even if RFRA is applicable in the present case, it does not preclude ERISA preemption because ERISA does not impose a \"substantial burden\" on Plaintiff's free exercise of religion. Plaintiff argues that the burden is substantial because \"Defendants would use ERISA to deprive the Province of its freedom to advance the purposes and intents of Jesuit religious practices, namely, to have its members renounce their worldly possessions for all time so as to enable their members to fully devote themselves to others.\" [Dkt. 64, at 18]. The Court disagrees. Any burden on the Province's exercise of religion is not imposed by ERISA, it is imposed by Fr. Cassem's designation of Defendants as beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 44, at \u00b6 22]. ERISA's provisions do not prevent the Province from requiring vows of its members, using its members' resources to further its charitable purpose, distributing property on behalf of its members, accepting property from its members, or expelling members who do not honor their vows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In this context, ERISA does not create the burden on the Province's exercise of religion - the statute merely fails to provide a vehicle for the Province to address potential nonconformity with its vows. A useful analogy is the circumstance that would exist if the Accounts were promissory notes rather than ERISA accounts. If Fr. Cassem had sold promissory notes to a \"holder in due course\" as defined in UCC \u00a7 3-302(1), the holder in due course would be entitled to payment from the maker and guarantor of the notes, regardless of any claims the Province would have against Fr. Cassem based on a prior contractual relationship.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A. I. Trade Finance, Inc. v. Laminaciones de Lesaca, S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410802\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/830/\">\n    41 F.3d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1994). Surely it could not be said, in that scenario, that the UCC is a\n   \"substantial burden\" on Plaintiff's exercise of religion. Conversely, in the case at bar the dispute is between the Province and Defendants. ERISA is only incidentally implicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Province essentially asks the Court for specific performance of Jesuit vows; it asks the ERISA plan administrator to disregard plan documents and distribute plan assets to the Province instead of to the designated beneficiary, as if Fr. Cassem had himself maintained the Province's designation in accordance with his alleged contract. Holding that such a claim to employee benefits is preempted by ERISA does not substantially burden the Province's exercise of religion. The only avenue unavailable to the Province is declaratory judgment based on the underlying contract. If Fr. Cassem violated the terms of the contract when he changed the beneficiary designation, the Province is free to pursue claims for damages related to that contract, either against the estate or against Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.
