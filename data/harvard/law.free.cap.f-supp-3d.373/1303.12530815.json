INTRODUCTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This is a statutory interpleader action initiated by Cachet Financial Services (\"Cachet\") against eighty-two defendants to resolve conflicting claims to $ 1,886,546.73 (the \"Interpleaded Funds\"), which Cachet deposited with this Court. Cachet moves for summary judgment or in the alternative partial summary judgment. At issue in the motion is whether Cachet is entitled to recoup $ 835,748.83 of the Interpleaded Funds. Defendants and Counterclaimants Pacific Diversified Insurance Services, Inc. (\"Pacific\") and Robert Talbott, Inc. (\"Talbott\") (collectively \"Defendants\") oppose the motion. The following parties join in Defendants' opposition to the motion: Defendant and Counterclaimant Pinnacle Manufacturing Corporation (Dkt. No. 205); Intervenor Gavin De Becker &amp; Associates LP (Dkt. No. 206); and Defendant San Juan Oaks, LLC (Dkt. No. 207). The Court finds it appropriate to take the motion under submission for decision without oral argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b). Based upon all pleadings filed to date, Cachet's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cachet is an electronic Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") third party service provider that processes a variety of electronic funds transfers (\"EFT\") in the form of payroll ACH transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The transfers commonly take the form of direct\n   deposit payroll and electronic payment processing. The Interpleaded Funds came into Cachet's possession as a result of its contractual relationship with defendant Pinnacle Workforce Solutions (\"Pinnacle\"), a company that provides payroll processing services to employers. The remaining eighty-one defendants/counterclaimants are Pinnacle's employer clients who entered into payroll processing agreements with Pinnacle (Higham Decl. Exs. 1-3) and have asserted claims to the Interpleaded Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March of 2007, Cachet and Pinnacle entered into a \"Remarketer Agreement\" pursuant to which Cachet provided ACH transaction services for Pinnacle. Succar Decl. Ex 1, Dkt. No. 194-1. Pinnacle provided instructions directing Cachet to debit funds from the accounts of Pinnacle's clients, the employers; to aggregate their funds within a general clearing account maintained for Pinnacle by Cachet (\"clearing account\"); and to credit specific accounts for the purpose of making ACH payroll payments to the employees of Pinnacle's employer clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at CFS00018. The \"Pricing, Billing and Funding\" section of the Remarketer Agreement provided in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   CACHET shall deposit funds in [Pinnacle] account(s) for Client trust funds, [Pinnacle] fees, and other settlements authorized by Client to be made to [Pinnacle] within forty-eight (48) hours following receipt of collected funds from Client.... [Pinnacle] understands and acknowledges that Cachet is not a bank but that Cachet has requested and received regulatory permission to process EFT transactions through the FRB. [Pinnacle] additionally understands that the FRB requires banks and financial institutions to maintain a ten (10) percent reserve with the FRB to guarantee the EFT transactions processed. [Pinnacle] agrees to make these required funds available and to maintain the required reserve at Cachet for the sole purpose of meeting the required FRB reserve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"Liability\" section of the Remarketer Agreement included the following provision: \"[Pinnacle] shall fund any NSF return or other returned item until the item in question has been fully resolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at CFS00019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 27, 2016, Pinnacle's clearing account with Cachet was overdrawn in the amount of $ 1,395,748.83. Cachet's Separate Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts (\"SSUF\") No. 7. Cachet immediately contacted Pinnacle to advise it that its account had been suspended pending complete funding of its existing account overdraft. Succar Decl. \u00b6 8. Pinnacle promised to resolve the overdraft by providing a prompt wire transfer payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cachet advised Pinnacle that two conditions had to be met for Cachet to reinstate service: (1) Pinnacle must resolve the overdraft by providing the wire transfer; and (2) \"the ACH collection for the direct deposits be settled within Cachet's clearing account for Pinnacle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Cachet further advised that \"[o]nce Pinnacle satisfied its account overdraft, Cachet would then release the collected funds for the direct deposit payments from the clearing account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pinnacle agreed to these terms without notifying any of its employer clients and Cachet processed Pinnacle's collection instructions onto the ACH Network.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Pinnacle, however, did not meet its obligation to resolve the overdraft; Pinnacle wired $ 560,000 instead of the full $ 1,395,748.83 and the account remained overdrawn by $ 835,748.83.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Cachet immediately contacted Pinnacle regarding the overdraft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pinnacle's staff told Cachet that it did not have access to funds and that the only person who did, Mr. McEwan, was incapacitated due to\n   a medical emergency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Pinnacle's staff assured Cachet that the outstanding balance would be resolved by the next day, September 28, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 28, 2016, Cachet had a net sum of $ 2,608,226.41 in the clearing account after processing Pinnacle's collection instructions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Pinnacle's instructions directed the transfer of $ 459,127.04 into Pinnacle's tax clearing account for the benefit of Christopher Ranch LLC, which left $ 2,149,099.37 in the clearing account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cachet did not receive any further wire transfers from Pinnacle and accordingly re-suspended Pinnacle's account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On or before October 18, 2016, a number of banks acting on behalf of Pinnacle's clients executed ACH returns totaling $ 262,552.64, which left a balance of $ 1,886,546.73 in the clearing account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cachet set off Pinnacle's clearing account to recover the $ 835,748.83 (the overdrawn balance that had existed on September 27, 2016), filed the instant interpleader action in November of 2016 (Dkt. No. 1), and deposited the remaining funds from the clearing account with the court (Dkt. No. 138). Cachet characterizes the setoff as a \"routine internal accounting balance.\" Cachet's Mot. for Summary Judg. 15, Dkt. No. 194. Later Cachet filed a motion for discharge, which the court denied. Dkt. No. 179. The court also ordered Cachet to deposit the $ 835,748.83 that Cachet had kept (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) and Cachet complied (Dkt. No. 181).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Three Defendants, Pacific, Talbott and Pinnacle Manufacturing Corp. have filed counterclaims against Cachet seeking to recover the amounts Cachet debited from their respective accounts. Dkt. Nos. 140, 149, 150. These three Defendants allege that at the time Cachet debited their accounts Cachet had no intention of crediting their employees' accounts with Defendants' funds. Litigation of the counterclaims is stayed pending completion of the Special Master's claim determination process and submission of the Special Master's final report on distribution of the Interpleaded Funds. Dkt. No. 147.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    III.

Cachet's Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Cachet contends that it is entitled to recover $ 835,748.83 of the Interpleaded Funds as a setoff for Pinnacle's overdraft balance either on a priority or a\n   <em>\n    pro-rata\n   </em>\n   basis. Cachet reasons that California law upholds the practice of a depository institution recouping overdraft balances resulting from NSF transactions. In support of this position, Cachet cites to\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Bank of America\n   </em>\n   , (\"\n   <em>\n    Miller I\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896486\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/46/630/#p638\">\n    46 Cal.4th 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2031\">\n    94 Cal.Rptr.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20P.3d%20531\">\n    207 P.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) ;\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Cal. 2009). None of these cases establish Cachet's right to a setoff under the particular facts of this case. In\n   <em>\n    Miller I\n   </em>\n   , account holders who deposited Social Security or other public benefit funds into checking or savings accounts and then overdrew those accounts brought suit to challenge defendant Bank of America's (\"Bank\") practice of recouping overdrafts and insufficient fund fees from the public benefit funds. The California Supreme Court held that the Bank's practice did not run afoul of the Court's earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    Kruger v. Wells Fargo Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2302299\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/11/352/\">\n    11 Cal.3d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20449\">\n    113 Cal.Rptr. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20P.2d%20441\">\n    521 P.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) (analyzing bank's right to a setoff pursuant to California Civil Code section 3054, the banker's lien act, and holding that bank may not exercise its right of set off against deposits derived from unemployment and disability benefits, which are protected from the claims of creditors), and that the practice was permissible under California Financial Code section 864 (hereinafter \" section 864\"), which prescribed the manner in which banks may set off debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unlike the Bank in\n   <em>\n    Miller I\n   </em>\n   , Cachet is not a bank but an electronic ACH seeking a setoff for an overdraft balance. The \"Remarketer Agreement\" expressly states that Cachet \"is not a bank but that Cachet has requested and received regulatory permission to process EFT transactions through the FRB.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at CFS00018. Section 864 applies to banks, not to ACHs. Moreover, section 864 was repealed in 2011. Cachet has cited no authority and has not put forth a compelling reason why\n   an ACH, especially an ACH like Cachet who contractually agreed to process EFTs for Pinnacle's clients' payroll, should be able to exercise the right to set off in a manner similar to a bank. Therefore, the court finds that\n   <em>\n    Miller I\n   </em>\n   does not provide legal authority for Cachet to set off in this case. The\n   <em>\n    Miller II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    DeBartolo\n   </em>\n   cases similarly raise challenges to a bank's practice of balancing customers' accounts by applying account credits against account debits.\n   <em>\n    Miller II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262926\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/213/1/\">\n    213 Cal.

The lender in\n   <em>\n    Lonely Maiden\n   </em>\n   had a perfected security interest in Axium's general deposit accounts. Here, there is no evidence that Cachet has a perfected security interest in the $ 835,748.83 in the clearing account. To the contrary, Cachet has admitted that it did not have a security interest at all in the funds that it withdrew from Defendants' bank accounts in September of 2016. Cachet's Resp. to Talbott's First Req. for Admis. No. 12 (Dkt. No. 204-4); Cachet's Resp. to Pacific's First Req. for Admis. No. 13 (Dkt. No. 204-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although somewhat unclear, Cachet's next argument appears to assert that because there was an overdraft, Cachet was a creditor and became a \"secured\" creditor by operation of California Commercial Code section 9312(b)(3). Cachet's Rep. 1, 4. Section 9312(b)(3) provides that \"[a] security interest in money may be perfected only by the secured party's taking possession under Section 9313.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209312\">\n    Cal. Com. Code \u00a7 9312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Cachet's argument has no merit. As discussed previously, Cachet has not presented evidence that it had a security interest in the $ 835,748.83. Moreover, section 9312(b)(3) does not create a security interest in money; instead it explains\n   how to perfect a security interest in money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Cachet next contends that\n   <em>\n    Lonely Maiden\n   </em>\n   supports its right of setoff, at least in principle, because the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"It is a firmly established principle that if a recipient of funds is not prohibited from using them as his own and commingling them with his own monies, a debtor-creditor, not a trust, relationship exists\". In the absence of a trust, Axium and the film clients had no more than a debtor-creditor relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Lonely Maiden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243610\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/201/368/#p386\">\n    201 Cal.

Applying the principle above, Cachet contends that it collected funds in accordance with Pinnacle's ACH transaction instructions and with the express permission of the employers; that there was no trust relationship created; and that Cachet had a right to seize and apply the monies in its possession after Pinnacle defaulted on its contract with Cachet. Cachet, however, has not presented undisputed evidence that it had a right to use the funds collected from Pinnacle's clients as its own. In the absence of such evidence, the principle cited, which was premised on receipt of funds being \"not prohibited from using them as his own,\" is inapplicable. Moreover, the Remarketer Agreement includes provisions that support Defendants' contention that Cachet's authorization to debit Pinnacle's employers' accounts was limited to the sole purpose of funding payroll and tax obligations.

Defendants' Counterclaims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Cachet contends that all of the counterclaims are moot and should be dismissed. Cachet's Mot. 19, Dkt. No. 200. Cachet also contends that the counterclaimants lack standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2069\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The counterclaims are stayed (Dkt.
