No. [2] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their Motion, Plaintiffs state that they seek emergency relief to allow them to exercise their First Amendment rights in the public areas of Capitol Square property, which includes the State Capitol Building. Doc. No. [2-1], p. 1. Specifically, Plaintiffs wish to wear a pink button that states: \"Don't Fuck With Us[,] Don't Fuck Without Us.\" Doc. No. [2-1], p. 2. The language in the button is also followed by\n   a logo associated with the organization, Planned Parenthood. Plaintiffs state that: \"[t]he first part of the message is intended to convey anger and urge lawmakers not to harm women by banning abortion. The second part of the message is a health advisory that, in a humorous but serious manner, reminds people not to have sexual intercourse without birth control or protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In support of their motion, Plaintiffs included declarations in which they state that on March 7, 2019, they were wearing the above-described pink buttons in the public areas of the State Capitol Building and were told to remove the buttons by Capitol Police. Doc. Nos. [4], [5]. Plaintiffs state that they were not doing anything disruptive at the time that they were asked to remove the buttons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State Capitol Police Officer Defendants (hereinafter \"Defendants\") filed a response brief on March 13, 2019. In their affidavits and supporting materials, Defendants assert that individuals wearing the pink buttons at issue were asked to remove them because the language on the buttons was considered \"obscene, vulgar, or profane, was worn in the presence of minors, and was threatening an immediate breach of the peace as prohibited by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-11-39(a)(4).\" Doc. No. [11-1], p. 4, \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the motion on March 14, 2019.
