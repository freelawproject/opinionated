BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 30, 2017, Cleanup North Brooklyn, a grassroots community group that seeks to restore the health of North Brooklyn, and its individual members filed suit in New York State Supreme Court, Kings County, against defendants. The complaint alleged public nuisance, private nuisance, and nuisance\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   under New York State common law based on defendants' operation of a solid waste transfer station located at 105-115 Thames Street in Brooklyn. Defendants timely removed this matter to the Eastern District of New York and plaintiffs moved to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although plaintiffs' complaint did not assert any federal claims, defendants argued that removal was appropriate because plaintiffs' claims necessarily raised federal questions under the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206962\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and its implementing regulatory scheme. Contemporaneously with their motion to remand, plaintiffs moved pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) to recover costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred in challenging the removal of this action and seeking remand. On April 27, 2018, I granted plaintiffs' motion to remand, finding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ...issues of federal question jurisdiction can be complicated, but this case presents straightforward common law nuisance claims, and the inappropriateness of a federal forum is readily apparent from the face of the Complaint. Moreover, defendants' erratic and ever-shifting arguments overcomplicated an otherwise unremarkable motion to remand, forcing the plaintiffs to expend unnecessary time and money on research and briefing. Costs, including attorneys' fees, are amply warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Cleanup N. Brooklyn v.

Apr. 27, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs are represented by counsel from Schindler Cohen &amp; Hochman and New York Lawyers for the Public Interest (\"NYLPI\"). Plaintiffs' counsel from Schindler Cohen &amp; Hochman represent plaintiffs in this action on a\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   basis, while NYLPI is a not-for-profit law firm that represents clients free of charge. Plaintiffs seek $ 128,141.25 in attorneys' fees and $ 9,426.24 in costs, for a total of $ 137,567.49 for 351.35 hours challenging the removal of this matter and seeking remand between September 26, 2017 and December 22, 2017. In response, defendants argue that \u00a7 1447(c) permits only \"actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal,\" and, because plaintiffs are represented by\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel, plaintiffs are unable to recover fees. Defendants further argue that plaintiffs \"are not representing different parties\" and therefore, according to defendants, they \"are patently double billing for representation of the same client.\" Finally, defendants ask the court to reduce any award for overstaffing and excessive billing, as a paying client \"would clearly not reasonably ever agree to pay\" such a high figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West). Defendants argue that, under this section, where plaintiffs are represented by counsel on a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    bono\n   </em>\n   basis, the client does not actually incur any obligation to pay fees and, therefore, no fees should be awarded. The text of the statute does not require this reading. Another reading of the text more consistent with the purpose of the statute as discussed below is that, while it requires that fees be\n   <em>\n    incurred\n   </em>\n   , it does not require that those fees be billed to the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has not addressed this issue, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has expressly rejected defendants' reading of the statute.

This very case, in which the inappropriateness of a federal forum was readily apparent from the face of the complaint, provides a good example of the need for fee-shifting. Defendants' reading of the statute would encourage unreasonable removal by defendants in cases represented on a\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   basis and/or disincentivize motions to remand to the proper jurisdiction by\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel. One district judge has opined that \"[i]f \u00a7 1447(c) were read so as not to authorize awards in such cases, then it would not apply to most cases of improper removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Keesling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%201921812\">\n    2003 WL 1921812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Simply put, if I were to adopt defendants' reading of the statute, the intent of Congress-which includes deterring improper removals-would be severely undermined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p140\">\n    546 U.S. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p140\">\n    126 S.Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p140\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Indeed, I am not aware of a single decision that has supported defendants' reading of \u00a7 1447(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In sum, I hold that \u00a7 1447(c) permits the recovery of attorneys' fees by parties represented on a\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I also reject defendants' argument that plaintiffs are \"double billing\" for their work on this matter simply because two separate firms represent the same client. Whether the firms representing plaintiffs\n   overstaffed the case or billed excessively in specific instances is discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . I do not find, however, that the mere representation of plaintiffs by one\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   firm and one not-for-profit firm amounts to double-billing in itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Calculation of Legal Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To calculate attorney fees, the district court must first determine the lodestar-the product of a reasonable hourly rate and the reasonable number of hours required by the case-which creates a presumptively reasonable fee.\n   <em>\n    Stanczyk v. City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309353\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/273/#p284\">\n    752 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (2d Cir. 2014). Such a method applies even in matters involving\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   representation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. Narragansett Bay Ins.

He is described as having less than one year of experience. His requested rate is beyond the highest range typically awarded, and plaintiffs have proffered no reason why a paralegal of his experience would be otherwise entitled to such a rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Annunzio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205308094\">\n    2015 WL 5308094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ($ 70 to $ 100 reasonable rate for paralegals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I find that Mr. Schindler is entitled to $ 425 an hour, Ms. Steel is entitled to $ 325 an hour, Mr. Otazu is entitled to $ 200 an hour, Ms. Wong is entitled to $ 250 an hour,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mr. Johnson is entitled to $ 70 an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Counsel from NYLPI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Katie Rosenfeld was the Legal Director for NYPLI during the relevant period and claims 15 years of litigation experience in commercial and civil rights matters. Rachel Spector is the Director of the Environmental Justice Program at NYPLI with over 10 years of civil rights, environment, and employment law experience. Ms. Spector has been a Visiting Clinical Assistant Professor at Fordham University School of Law, though she has not indicated what course(s) she has taught. Melissa Iachan is a Senior Staff Attorney at NYPLI, who has practiced commercial, bankruptcy, and environmental law for over 12 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   NYLPI argues that it \"commonly seeks award of attorneys' fees in civil rights cases,\" and bases its rates in those cases, as in this one, on reasonable rates awarded to civil rights attorneys of similar experience and skill. As a result, NYLPI seeks between $ 425 and $ 450 an hour for their attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As discussed above, NYLPI's requested rates of $ 425 to $ 450 per hour are beyond the highest end of the range typically awarded for attorneys with their years of experience. Defendants acknowledge that, if fees were to be awarded, Ms. Rosenfeld would be entitled to $ 350 an hour and that an appropriate rate for Ms. Spector and Ms. Iachan would be in the $ 200 to $ 325 an hour range. Based on these considerations, I find that Ms. Rosenfeld is entitled to $ 350 an hour, Ms. Spector is entitled to $ 325 an hour,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Ms. Iachan is entitled to $ 325 an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Number of Hours Expended by Plaintiffs' Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In connection with the motion to remand, Schindler Cohen &amp; Hochman and NYPLI identify the following hours expended:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-48\"><strong>Schindler Cohen &amp; Hochman</strong> <strong>NYPLI</strong> <strong>Staff Member</strong> <strong>Hours Billed</strong> <strong>Staff Member</strong> <strong>Hours Billed</strong> Mr. Schindler 18.5 Ms. Rosenfeld 0.8 Ms. Steel 176.6 Ms. Spector 11.5 Mr. Otazu 61.2 Ms. Iachan 37.1<sup>5</sup> Ms. Wong 24.2 Mr. Johnson 21.45</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue that the legal and factual issues in this litigation were not complex, and thus plaintiffs overstaffed this matter by employing an inordinate number of attorneys who billed over 350 hours. I agree that this matter was not inherently complex, but it became so because of defendants' changing legal theories, all of which were eventually rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nonetheless, I agree that plaintiffs' billing was excessive. To begin with, defendants challenge plaintiffs' time entries by arguing that they improperly used block-billing and vague entries. Related to the claim of block-billing is an argument by defendants that Ms. Steel and Ms. Iachan billed at attorney rates for acts that should instead have been performed by paralegal staff, such as filing and serving motion papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the most part, plaintiffs' time records provide sufficient detail for this court to determine whether the amount of time spent by counsel on a given task was reasonable. Ms. Iachan's and Ms. Steel's records, however, do contain examples of block-billing. One such example is the November 17, 2017 entry by Ms. Steel, where she billed 9 hours to \"finalize and serve [a] brief.\" Another example is the December 22, 2017 entry by Ms. Steel where she billed 7.3 hours to \"[f]inalize and file reply brief in further support of remand.\" On reply, Ms. Steel asserts that these entries \"clearly do not describe the actual clerical tasks, but the preparation of trial documents prior to filing and service.\" A review of the docket shows that the December 22, 2017 filing was extensive, and required eight separate filings, one of which included 16 exhibits. Accordingly, someone from plaintiffs' legal team was no doubt required to spend a significant amount of time filing those separate entries. Surprisingly, however, there are no billing entries by any paralegal relating to filing or service on November 17, 2017 or December 22, 2017, whereas in other instances, Mr. Johnson, the paralegal, billed 3.4 hours on October 4, 2017 to file three notices of appearance and a letter motion, and 0.4 hours on November 2, 2017 to draft and file a notice of withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Similarly, Ms. Iachan billed one hour on October 4, 2017 for \"Drafting Notice of Appearance, setting up ECF, and getting NOA filed in coordination with co-counsel filing pro-motion letter\" and billed 0.8 hours on October 6, 2017 to \"Review draft\n   letter to MJ Reyes; internal correspondence re Judge's Order, filing letter and calendaring conference.\" As above, no paralegal billed time for filing or calendaring on October 6, 2017. Because Ms. Steel and Ms. Iachan block-billed, I am unable to determine how many of their hours on each day were spent doing administrative tasks for which they cannot recover fees, and how many hours were spent on legal work. I therefore decline to award Ms. Steel 16.3 hours and Ms. Iachan 1.8 hours related to block-billing entries that appear to show an experienced attorney seeking compensation at her full hourly rate for work including administrative tasks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Struthers v. City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205407221\">\n    2013 WL 5407221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Turning to the remaining entries, although there is no impropriety in two groups of lawyers representing a single client, where there are two groups, they must confer to decide who is in charge and how the labor will be allocated. Plaintiffs' counsel here have not explained how they divided the labor and have presented the court with two separate hierarchies without any indication of the roles of each firm or attorney in the litigation of this case. Implicit in their application, however, is a structure in which Ms. Steel completed the bulk of the work, while nearly all other counsel researched, reviewed, and edited substantially the same matters. I infer from this that there was uncompensable duplication of effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Specifically, I find that the request for compensation for approximately 23 hours to draft a three-page pre-motion conference letter, 25 hours to prepare for the pre-motion conference, and 180 hours spent on the moving and reply briefs, even in a case such as this with a changing legal landscape, is excessive and above what a reasonable client would be willing to pay. It is likely that these figures are so high because between five and seven attorneys edited each filing and four attorneys attended the pre-motion conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, plaintiffs \"cannot have it both ways\" by seeking fees at or above the highest range for this district based on their claimed skill and experience, while also spending an inordinate amount of time researching and editing briefs that more experienced counsel could complete more quickly.\n   <em>\n    Harty v.

Feb. 16, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, in reviewing a fee application, \"trial courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants,\" and \"may take into account their overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney's time.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs also request $ 9,426.24 for the costs they incurred in connection with removal and remand of this action. Defendants, aside from arguing that plaintiffs' counsel are not entitled to costs because they worked\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   , do not dispute any of plaintiffs' specific request for costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   My review of plaintiffs' costs relating to Pacer account charges, photocopying, a transcript charge, and local transportation finds them to be both reasonable and the type of out of pocket disbursements which are ordinarily charged to clients.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc-Sternberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"268465\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/143/748/#p763\">\n    143 F.3d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I therefore award plaintiffs their requested $ 222.39 for these costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The remaining $ 9,203.85 are fees charged by Westlaw for conducting online legal research. The Second Circuit has held that \"computer research is merely a substitute for an attorney's time that is compensable under an application for attorneys' fees and is not a separately taxable cost.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. for Use &amp; Benefit of Evergreen Pipeline Const.

However, where such expenses are usually billed to clients in addition to the attorney's hourly rate, \"in the context of a fee-shifting provision, the charges for such online research may properly be included in a fee award.\"\n   <em>\n    Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass'n v.

Based on the separate billing statements divided by client provided in plaintiffs' moving papers, I construe plaintiffs' request for Westlaw electronic research charges as a representation that those charges are not subsumed in Schindler Cohen &amp; Hochman's hourly rates and are fees that would typically be passed on to paying clients. As with the application for fees, however, I find that the amount spent on electronic research is excessive and, therefore, reduce the award of Westlaw charges to $ 5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
