INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This diversity action arises from a business arrangement between an architectural/engineering design management company, Defendant Jacobs Engineering Group (\"Jacobs\"), and a manufacturer which specializes in the custom design and fabrication of hangar doors, Plaintiff Fleming Steel Company (\"Fleming\"), involving the procurement of two Navy projects for the construction of an aircraft hangar at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. After the Navy failed to approve Fleming as the sole source for the manufacture of a component part-the blast-rated hangar doors, Fleming initiated this action against Jacobs seeking damages and restitution on various claims. At this juncture, the only remaining claims consist of breach of an oral contract, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. Currently pending before the Court is Jacobs' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 75 ) as to the remaining claims. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant Jacobs' motion in part, and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if, drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). Summary judgment may be granted against a party who fails to adduce facts sufficient to establish the existence of any element essential to that party's case, and for which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2010, the United States Naval Facilities Engineering Command (\"NAVFAC\") awarded Jacobs/Burns &amp; McDonnell (the \"Joint Venture\" or \"Jacobs\") an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (\"IDIQ\") contract to provide Architectural/Engineering (\"A/E\") services for the construction of aviation facilities within the U.S. Pacific Command Area of Responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Cody Hoff (Hoff Dep.) at 12-13, Def.'s App. Ex. 1 (ECF No. 75-2 )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; IDIQ contract,\n   Pl.'s App. Ex. A (ECF No. 87-1 ). In February 2011, NAVFAC-Marianas (a branch of NAVFAC within NAVFAC Pacific Command) awarded the Joint Venture a task order for Project AJJY123010, Guam Fuel Systems Maintenance Hangar (\"Project 3010\") to provide A/E services in connection with the design of a hangar at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 to Hoff Dep. (ECF No. 75-2 at 52-54 ). Project 3010 is what is known as a \"design-bid-build\" project; in design-bid-build projects, the A/E first prepares a full set of design plans and the project specifications, and the government then releases the plans and specifications to the public so that potential contractors may submit bids for the project construction. Hoff Dep. at 25; Dep. of John DeVenecia (\"DeVenecia Dep.\") at 25-26, Pl.'s App. Ex. CC (ECF No. 87-29 ). The contractor is just being asked to build the facility and not do any design work for it. DeVenecia Dep. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Project 3010 hangar required, among other components, blast-hardened hangar doors. Dep. of Chris Surles (\"Surles Dep.\") at 20, 36, Def.'s App. Ex. 2 (ECF No. 75-3 ). Those doors were a \"performance specification\" item: the doors had to meet certain operational criteria, but the means of meeting the required criteria are left up to the subcontractor who ultimately builds the doors. Hoff Dep. at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jacobs reached out to potential hangar door manufacturers to assist it with the design of the blast-hardened hangar doors. Hoff Dep. at 21. Jacobs contacted Fleming Steel Company (\"Fleming\") for design-assist type conceptual work because Fleming had designed hangar doors previously. Surles Dep. at 21-22. Manufacturers have an incentive to assist A/E firms such as Jacobs in this regard because in doing so, they will obtain cost and other information which will give them an advantage in bidding on the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cody Hoff, who was employed by Jacobs, was the project manager for Project 3010, and later for Project 3027. Hoff Dep. at 7, 10. Chris Surles, who was also employed by Jacobs Engineering Group, was the architectural intern for Project 3010 and the project architect for Project 3017. Surles Dep. at 6, 8. John DeVenecia was the NAVFAC's Design Manager for Project 3010 from August 2010 until July 2012, and Mr. Hoff's principal point of contact on Project 3010. DeVenecia Dep. at 9-10. Clarence Lagutang was NAVFAC Marianas CI, Capitol Improvement Project Manager on Project 3010. Dep. of Clarence Lagutang (\"Lagutang Dep.\") at 7 (ECF No. 75-5 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fleming has over 90 years of experience custom designing and fabricating specialized and unique aircraft hangar door systems for the United States Military (including Air Force One). Second Am. Compl., \u00b6 1 (ECF No. 34 ). Seth Kohn is the president and owner of Fleming. Dep. of Seth Kohn (\"Kohn Dep.\") at 9. Mr. Kohn was Jacobs' principal point of contact at Fleming on the issue of sole sourcing for the Projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Mr. Kohn has been employed at Fleming since 1967.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May of 2011, Jacobs contacted Fleming about assisting in the development of the hangar door design concept for Project 3010. Hoff Dep. at 41-42. Jacobs and its blast consultant, ARA, with whom the Joint Venture had a subcontract for Project 3010, had already come up with a design concept for the hanger doors-Option 1-which was not an optimal solution at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36, 38-40. On May 9,\n   2011, Bernie Klein from Jacobs emailed Mr. Kohn attaching Option 1 and asked Mr. Kohn to email him some details that they discussed so that Mr. Klein could develop Option 2. Ex. P 3 to Hoff Dep., Pl.'s App. Ex. J (ECF No. 87-10 ). Shortly thereafter, a telephone conference took place in which Mr. Hoff, his architects and the blast consultant discussed with Mr. Kohn the initial concepts of the project, and generally talked about the design details of the hanger doors, particularly the bottom rail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hoff Dep. at 42-44, Pl.'s App. Ex. FF (ECF No. 87-32 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During May, June, and July of 2011, Jacobs and Fleming collaborated to develop hanger door concept designs, including designs for the hangar door head. Dep. of John Gavroy (\"Gavroy Dep.\") at 31-35; Various Emails between Gavroy and Surles, Exs. 6-9 to Gavroy Dep., Def.'s App. Ex. 7 (ECF No. 75-8 at 23-43 ). Mr. Kohn testified that during the May to July 2011 timeframe, Fleming provided significant design services to Jacobs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q: Okay. So during this time frame, based on the e-mails we looked at before the lunch break, what did this -- my math indicates that there are 609.5 hours reflected on page 1 of Exhibit 43. What did those 609.5 hours consist of?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A: Well, there was engineering and -- and -- there was a variety of things that were discussed and done. Part of it was design. Part of it was specifications. Part of it was concept. Part of it was debunking what they had already started with. I spent a tremendous amount of time when they first contacted me looking at what they thought was going to be workable. There's no way possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   So there's a lot that goes into it. It's not all concentrated. A lot of it is interrelated. There was a lot of time spent with the structural engineer on the interface between the door head and the sill. A lot of time spent with the blast engineer. A lot of time spent with Jacobs about how to pull all this together. So there -- there was a considerable amount of work done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kohn Dep. at 139-140, Pl.'s Ex. GG (ECF No. 87-33 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Jacobs received plans from Fleming and utilized this information when preparing the plans for the Navy's Request for Proposals (\"RFP\"). Hoff Dep. at 34-35, Pl.'s App. Ex. FF (ECF No. 87-32 ). Fleming's work also included preparation of fabrication drawings for the hangar doors. Kohn Dep. at 38. Mr. Hoff testified that the plans and specifications included in the solicitation for the Navy projects incorporated \"useful\" and \"valuable\" input from Fleming. Hoff Dep. at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the end of July 2011, Mr. Kohn informed Jacobs that Fleming could no longer support Jacobs without compensation. In this regard, Mr. Hoff testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: Okay. Now, in this E-mail [from Jim Brokaw of ARA dated 7/22/11], you say that Fleming has reached the end of the financial donation to the project. They asked if we could discuss a sole source to them from the government due to this being the first door of its kind and the sensitive nature of the load data. Jacobs support this stance, unless you feel we can write the performance spec based on the current concept that could be competitively bid, which would have to include the load data. Now, when you said that Fleming has reached the end of the financial donation to the project, what do you mean by that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: It was we were informed by Mr. Kohn that they could no longer support us without being compensated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: And do you think Mr. Kohn was being reasonable when he said that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: And why so?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: Because he - he had helped us and we understood there would be a limit to what they can do as part of the standard door assist, like we discussed previously in this deposition. And we knew at some point, that they would not be able to assist any further.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: Okay. And here it says that Fleming was asking whether or not they could be considered a sole source from the government, given that, you know, they were reaching the financial end for donation to the project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: Were you supportive of that concept?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Yes. And as I stated - as I stated here, and to - that they would be. And I wanted to get with - to Jim to make sure he agreed with that as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: And did he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: Yes, because at that time, the key point to all of this was the load data. But by that time, we were told that load data was classified, we couldn't put it out in a public spec. So we really couldn't - we couldn't put out a performance spec and not tell the hangar door designers what they had to - loads they could design to. It would be impossible to design the - for them to design and fabricate a door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q: And it's also fair to say that if you're - Fleming was going to continue to provide its support in the design of the hangar doors, that you would expect them to be compensated in some way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A: No, I would - I would - it would be part of their sole source.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: So when we talk about compensation, one way to receive compensation would be getting that sole source designation in the solicitation correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A: Yes, that would be one way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hoff Dep. at 68-71; Ex. P6 to Hoff Dep. (ECF No. 75-2 at 86 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Hoff further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q: And when Fleming continued to provide design support to Jacobs after this July 22nd, 2011 E-mail, was it your understanding or assumption that Fleming would be sole sourced to contract the hangar doors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A: Based on our discussion, it was the agreement in -- I think it was September when we had our OBR -- onboard review meeting with NAVFAC in Guam -- the agreement in -- was that they all agreed that a sole source was -- was the best path forward. However, additional documentation for a ROM, et cetera, that was requested by NAVFAC from Fleming and the J&amp;A paperwork -- subsequent\n   J&amp;A paperwork would have to be prepared first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q: And so that meeting you referred to was in what month and year?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A: September of 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: And so was Fleming a participant in that September 11th, 2011 meeting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A: No, they did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q: So after that September 2011 meeting, you walked away from that meeting confident that the Navy would allow Fleming to be a sole source supplier of the hangar doors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q: And were you highly confident, or fairly confident?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A: I had no reason to doubt that they would not be allowed to be -- that the J &amp; A would not be approved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q: ... And so when Jacobs told Fleming that the Navy had agreed to sole source the hangar doors to Fleming, that was told to Fleming in order to encourage Fleming to continue to provide design services?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A: No, it was not. It was told to them to be able to help prepare the J &amp; A for their product and the ROM calls that NAVFAC requested. I don't - I don't recall much additional effort required by Fleming at that point after that - after that meeting, besides preparing the J &amp; A, and the ROM call system that they submitted to NAVFAC is to document the Justification and Authorization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Hoff Dep. at 71-73, 153-54 (Pl.'s Ex.

MM (ECF No. 87-39 ). Additionally, Mr. Kohn stated that Fleming provided design services in support of Project 3027 based on Jacobs' representation that the doors would be sole sourced to Fleming for this project as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Mr. Kohn testified that he provided design services under Project 3027 in July 2012. Kohn Dep. at 143-144. Mr. Surles of Jacobs also testified that Fleming provided \"valuable services\" with respect to both Projects 3010 and 3027. Surles Dep. at 71-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In approximately April or May 2014, NAVFAC-Pacific opened the bidding process for construction of Project 3027 by issuing a request for proposals (\"RFP\") from general contractors. Hoff Dep. at 149. The Project 3027 specifications identified Fleming as the sole-source supplier of the hangar doors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138-39.

N.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Shortly after bidding began, NAVFAC received a Request for Information (\"RFI\") from a potential general contractor inquiring whether other hangar door manufacturers could be substituted for Fleming. 5/21/14 NAVFAC Email, Def.'s App. Ex. 15 (ECF No. 75-16 ). This question prompted NAVFAC-Pacific's contracting officer-apparently unaware that the bid documents named Fleming as the sole-source supplier of the hangar doors-to inform Jacobs that NAVFAC could not \"sole-source the door manufacturer at this point\" because \"[s]ole source justification approvals are required prior to advertising the project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In early June 2014, Mr. Hoff spoke with Mr. Lagutang at NAVFAC-Marianas about the sole-source justification for Project 3010, and learned for the first time that the Project 3010 J &amp; A had never been signed by NAVFAC.

Later that same day, Mr. Hoff emailed Mr. Hazama, emphasizing that \"[t]he government direction, established during [Project 3010] was to sole-source the doors [to Fleming].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On June 9, 2014, Mr. Lagutang informed Cody Hoff, \"Hot off the press ... I guess we're going with sole source after all. Can we coordinate this effort along with the AMU Tanker.\" Mr. Lagutang testified that this meant he got the J &amp; A verbiage from NAVAC Pacific, not that the J &amp; A had been completed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57. Mr. Lagutang further testified that as of 6/9/14, sole sourcing the hangar doors to Fleming was not a done deal, and additional steps still needed to be taken on the technical side, and then the J&amp;A had to go through the Navy's acquisition for final approval before it could go up the chain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Hoff continued to press NAVFAC for the Fleming sole-source. 6/10/14 Email from Hoff to Hazama, Def.'s App. Ex. 17. On June 20, 2014, one of Fleming's competitors, Industrial Door, sent a letter to NAVFAC protesting Fleming's designation as the sole-source supplier of the hangar doors in the Project 3027 bid documents. Ex. 9 to Horikawa Dep., Def.'s App. Ex. 18 (ECF No. 75-19 ). Mr. Kohn suspected that Industrial Door was interfering with Fleming's sole-source by challenging it with the Navy. Kohn Dep. at 97. On July 2, 2014, NAVFAC announced that the identification of Fleming in the RFP materials was an \"error\" and that Fleming's name would be removed. Def.'s App. Ex. 19 (ECF No. 75-20 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On September 17, 2014, NAVFAC announced to potential bidders that, due to Fleming's participation in the design of the hangar doors, \"an apparent Organizational Conflict of Interest exists that would likely preclude Fleming's participation in this effort as either a prime or subcontractor.\" Ex. 17 to Horikawa Dep., Def.'s App. Ex. 18. NAVFAC advised in Notice 11, \"[s]hould any [general] contractor wish to submit a proposal utilizing Fleming,\" it must \"address the apparent OCI in [its] proposal, and provide a detailed explanation with supporting documentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No general contractors submitted proposals utilizing Fleming. Horikawa Dep. at 50, 58-60. Ultimately, the successful general contractor selected Norco Manufacturing as its subcontractor to design and manufacture the hangar doors for both Guam hangar projects. 5/29/15 Email from P. McQuiston to J. Rosario at NAVFAC, Def.'s App. Ex. 20 (ECF No. 75-21 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   After failing to receive a subcontract for the hangar doors, in May of 2015, Fleming retained a Washington lobbying firm-O'Brien, Gentry, &amp; Scott (OGS)-to represent it in connection with the hangar door projects. Gentry Dep. at 11-12, Def.'s App. Ex. 21 (ECF No. 75-22 ). For well over a year, OGS corresponded both with the Navy and with Fleming's Congressional representatives requesting, among other things, that the Navy compensate Fleming for its design work on the hangar doors. Kostro Dep. at 9; emails between S. Kostro and C. Bidwell with NAVFAC, Ex. 11 to Kostro Dep. at 5, Def.'s App. Ex. 22 (ECF No. 75-23 ).

Ex. 11 to Kostro Dep. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Subsequently, in June of 2016, Fleming commenced this action against Jacobs. Discovery has ended, and Jacobs has moved for summary judgment on all remaining claims. As the motion has been fully briefed, it is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    A. Breach of Contract Claim (Count I)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Jacobs maintains that Fleming's breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law\n   for four independent reasons. First, Jacobs argues that the record is devoid of any evidence of a purported oral contract between Fleming and Jacobs. Second, even if some oral contract existed, it was too indefinite to be enforceable. Third, the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars Fleming's breach of contract claim because it failed to disclose any such contract in its Chapter 11 Disclosure Statement filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Fourth, the Jacobs' employees with whom Fleming contends agreed to the oral contract lacked the actual or apparent authority to do so. In addition, Jacobs submits that Fleming's breach of contract claim fails as to Project 3027 because that project did not exist at the time the alleged oral contract was formed. The Court will consider each of these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of an Oral Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Jacobs argues that the record is devoid of any documentary evidence that an oral contract existed between Fleming and Jacobs. Jacobs submits that none of the thousands of emails or telephone conference memos produced during discovery mention any contract between Jacobs and Fleming. In addition, Jacobs contends that there are no memoranda memorializing the telephone conversation during which Fleming alleges the oral contract was formed, even though Fleming's regular practice is to memorialize important phone calls. Moreover, Jacobs submits that Fleming's own executives-Mr. Rapp and Mr. Gavroy-were unaware of any purported oral contract between Fleming and Jacobs. Finally, Jacobs argues that Fleming failed to inform any third party that it had a \"multi-million-dollar\" oral contract with Jacobs. Jacobs attempts to discredit Mr. Kohn's deposition testimony, which Jacobs contends is the only possible evidence of an oral agreement, as self-serving, vague and conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In response, Fleming submits that sufficient evidence exists to allow a jury to decide whether the parties entered into an oral agreement. In support, Fleming points to the Court's previous finding, in its Report and Recommendation on Jacobs' motion to dismiss, that Exhibits 3 through 10 attached to the Amended Complaint provide sufficient factual matter to show the existence of the essential elements of a contract. That, combined with the facts gathered through discovery, demonstrate, according to Fleming, the existence of an oral agreement between it and Jacobs. After reviewing the extensive summary judgment record, the Court agrees with Fleming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In order to state a claim for breach of contract under Pennsylvania law, Plaintiff must show \"(1) the existence of a contract, including its essential terms, (2) a breach of a duty imposed by the contract and (3) resultant damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaymark v.

We therefore consider \"teaming agreements,\" as that term is normally understood within the context of government contracting.

The subcontractor would ordinarily provide technical expertise and assist in the prime contractor's bid submission in return for the prime contractor's promise to award the subcontract. Parties to such a teaming agreement benefit from the arrangement not only as a means of sharing resources, but also as a hedge against the many uncertainties involved in government contracting. In many cases, the finalized subcontract between the parties to a teaming agreement will specifically enumerate the scope of obligations for each party contingent upon the prime contractor winning the RFP so that there is usually little need to enforce the teaming arrangement itself. Often, however, the parties may reach an understanding to team, but fail to execute a subcontract as anticipated in the teaming agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858529\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/1030/\">\n    705 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1037 ;\n   <em>\n    Experimental Eng'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1401426\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/614/1244/#p1245\">\n    614 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1245 ;\n   <em>\n    Air Tech.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.E.2d%20538\">\n    199 N.E.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thereafter, as promised, Mr. Hoff contacted Mr. Lagutang at NAVFAC on 7/25/11 via email to request a sole source justification for the hangar doors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoff email dated 7/25/11, Def.'s App. Ex. 8 (ECF No. 75-9 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In addition, several emails were exchanged between Mr. Surles or Mr. Hoff and Mr. Kohn regarding the status of getting Fleming sole-sourced on the hangar doors. In the July 29, 2011 email from Mr. Surles to Mr. Kohn, Mr. Surles states: \"Per our recent conversation, Cody [Hoff] has discussed with [NAVFAC] the possibility of using Fleming as a sole source for the Hangar Doors. [NAVFAC] is in favor of providing this due to the uniqueness of the design, the confidentiality of the blast criteria, and the required finished product compared to competitively bidding the doors. [NAVFAC] is in the process of running this through contracting, so hopefully they can get it approved.\" Pl.'s App. Ex. F (ECF No. 87-6 ). Mr. Rapp, Vice President of Operations for Fleming, testified that this email was consistent with his recollection that the Navy had not yet approved Fleming to be sole sourced as of July 29, 2011, but was leaning heavily in that direction. Rapp Dep. at 17-18, Def.'s App. Ex. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In addition, in the September 12, 2011 email from Surles to Kohn, Mr. Surles states: \"NAVFAC has agreed to the sole sourcing ....\" Pl.'s App. Ex.

Mr. Rapp testified that when he read that email, his understanding was that the \"U.S. Navy had agreed to the sole sourcing and were looking for a rough order of magnitude.\" Rapp Dep. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Jacobs attempts to argue that Mr. Gavroy, Flemings' principal engineer on the hangar doors project, testified that as of 2011 a contract did not exist between Jacobs and Fleming, citing Gavroy Dep. at 50:20-22. However, Mr. Gavroy's actual testimony does not support Jacobs' argument. When the entire testimony is reviewed, it is clear that Mr. Gavroy is referring to the subcontract with the Government for the manufacturing of the hangar doors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Q: And what is your understanding as to why Al Sullivan is suggesting, \"If we could get the Contractor/Navy to buy off, could we work the contract that we go ahead and design the door and fabricate it early\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   A: I think at this point in time, engineering wasn't very busy, so Al is saying, well, if we're going to actually produce this door, why don't we start working on it now.

Moreover, the evidence suggests that neither Mr. Gavroy nor Mr. Rapp would have any knowledge of whether an oral teaming agreement existed between Fleming and Jacobs, since Mr. Kohn was exclusively responsible for contract negotiations with Jacobs. Kohn Decl. \u00b6 9. With regard to his understanding of how Fleming would be compensated for its work on the hangar door design and specifications in 2011, Mr. Gavroy testified that he was under the impression that Fleming was sole-sourced and they were going to be doing all the work and providing the doors. Gavroy Dep. at 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Moreover, the emails and deposition testimony of Jacobs' own employees-Messrs. Klein, Hoff, and Surles-provide evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that an oral teaming agreement existed between Fleming and Jacobs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Klein email dated 5/6/11 to Jim Brokaw with ARA, Pl.'s App. Ex. J (indicating Klein is \"in pursuit with Fleming to develop OPTION 2\"); Klein email dated 5/9/11, Pl.'s Ex. J (requesting Fleming's assistance in developing Option 2); Hoff Dep. at 40, Pl.'s App. Ex. FF (Jacobs was searching for \"the best design solution for our clients as possible ... [and was] turning to Fleming because of Fleming's particular expertise in development of hangar doors.\"); Surles email dated 5/20/11, Pl.'s App. Ex. G (attaching details on the hangar door and thanking Fleming for \"working with us to develop a solution.\"); Gavroy Dep. at 31-35 &amp; various emails between Gavroy &amp; Surles, Exs. 6-9 to Gavroy Dep., Def.'s App. Ex. 7 (Jacobs and Fleming collaborated to develop hanger door concept designs, including designs for the hangar door head, during May, June and July 2011); Hoff Dep. at 69-70 (Hoff supported sole-sourcing to Fleming; it was a means for compensating Fleming for its continued design work on the hangar doors); Hoff's Meeting Notes, Pl.'s App. Ex. S (ECF No. 87-19 ) (noting no permission to use proprietary details in RFP without sole-source). In addition, the fact that Hoff continued to press the NAVFAC to approve sole-sourcing to Fleming, even as late as 2014, raises the inference that Jacobs knew it would be in breach of its teaming agreement to get Fleming sole-sourced if NAVFC did not approve the sole-sourcing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    ATACS Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals found that the parties had entered into an oral teaming agreement, based on various letters exchanged between the parties indicating their intent to team and work exclusively with each other in preparation for the RFP.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703705\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/155/659/#p666\">\n    155 F.3d at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence also showed that the prime contractor represented to the government that the plaintiffs constituted part of the \"team\" that would undertake the project under its auspices as prime contractor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703705\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/155/659/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, the Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiffs met their burden of establishing an intent to be bound by the terms of the teaming agreement during the negotiations for a subcontract to be executed by the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703705\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/155/659/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly here, a reasonable jury could conclude from the parties' discussions and emails, and Jacobs' representations to NAVFAC, that Jacobs needed Fleming's expertise to come up with the design and specifications for the hangar doors and Fleming agreed to help in exchange for Jacobs agreeing to sole source the manufacturing of the hangar doors to Fleming and obtaining NAFVAC's approval of Fleming as the sole source for the\n   hangar doors. As such, a reasonable jury could find that they manifested their mutual assent to be bound by their oral teaming agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The existence of a teaming agreement between Fleming and Jacobs is also supported by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Air Technology Corp. v.

Even though their relationship was not a joint venture, the Court held that the defendant may be held to its contractual responsibilities to plaintiff as a team member. As such, by failing to press for plaintiff's continued participation in the program and offering the work for competitive bid, the Court concluded that defendant had breached its duties to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.E.2d%20538\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.E.2d%20538\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.E.2d%20538\">\n    199 N.E.2d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Despite the evidence cited above suggesting the existence of a teaming agreement, Jacobs argues that after Fleming learned in 2014 that it would not be sole-sourced for the Projects, Fleming never invoiced Jacobs for amounts supposedly due under the alleged oral contract, and that somehow demonstrates that an oral agreement did not exist between them. While it is undisputed that Fleming initially pursued compensation from the Navy over its loss of the sole-sourcing on the hangar doors, when it was unsuccessful, Fleming then sought compensation from Jacobs. Fleming's choice to seek compensation from the Navy first was a legal strategy and does not alone automatically lead to the conclusion that it did not believe it had any legal recourse against Jacobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Jacobs also proffers Mr. Kohn's failure to mention the oral contract between Fleming and Jacobs to third parties, such as Stephanie Kostro of OGS (Washington lobbying firm hired by Fleming), as evidence that the oral agreement did not exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This may be a factor that the jury deems relevant, but there is also evidence contained in the record to suggest otherwise. For example, the following evidence suggests that Ms. Kostro was aware of the teaming arrangement between Fleming and Jacobs. First, the letter from Cindy Readal, with the Department of the Navy, to Congressman Mike Kelly dated September 2, 2016 refers to Ms. Kostro's previous discussions with the Navy regarding the sole-sourcing issue and the use of information provided by the Navy in Fleming's future negotiations with Jacobs to resolve their dispute. Readal Letter dated 9/2/16, Pl.'s App. Ex. E (ECF No. 87-5 ). Second, a series of emails exchanged between Ms. Kostro and various Navy personnel indicates that she was actively negotiating with them as early as June 24, 2015 on Fleming's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s App. Ex. H (ECF No. 87-8 ). In addition, James Gentry, a partner in OCG who supervised Ms.\n   Kostro, testified that at Mr. Kohn's request, he reviewed all of the documents to obtain an understanding of what Fleming's interaction with the Navy and Fleming's interaction with Jacobs was, in order to determine how Fleming may seek some resolution of the situation. Gentry Dep. at 12, Def.'s App. Ex. 21 (ECF No. 75-22 at 13 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In addition to Kostro and Gentry, the evidence shows that Fleming informed two other third parties-Senator Toomey and Congressman Kelly-that it was engaged by Jacobs and the Navy to assist in developing the design for the large Blast Hangar Doors in return for Fleming being designated as the sole source.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fleming's Correspondence to Sen. Toomey dated 6/8/14, Ex. H attached to Kohn's Dep., Def.'s App. Ex. 5 (ECF No. 75-6 at 50-55 ); Readal's Letter, Pl.'s App. Ex. E.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Capital Improvements - Information Paper dated 7/17/14, Pl.'s App. Ex. P (ECF No. 87-16 ). Thus, given this contradictory evidence, the question of whether Mr. Kohn informed third parties of the existence of the alleged oral contract is best resolved by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Finally, Jacobs' assertion that Kohn's deposition testimony, which is the only possible evidence of an oral agreement, is self-serving, vague and conclusory, and is belied by the evidence cited above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Viewing the entire record and giving Fleming the benefit of all favorable inferences, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could find a teaming agreement was formed between Fleming and Jacobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Oral Contract is Too Indefinite to be Enforced\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Jacobs next argues that if an oral agreement was formed, which it disputes, its terms were too indefinite to be enforceable. According to Jacobs, the only evidentiary support for the alleged oral contract is Mr. Kohn's deposition testimony, which falls short of establishing an enforceable contract. Jacobs contends that Mr. Kohn's description of the alleged contract is so vague that its most basic terms are left to speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Fleming counters that the terms of their oral agreement are not vague, but are readily determinable from the contemporaneous evidence. In support of its argument, Fleming points to evidence in the record,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the 5/9/11 Klein email (Pl.'s App. Ex.

From this evidence and other evidence in the record, a reasonable jury could find that as a result of Jacobs' failure to get Fleming sole sourced on the hangar doors, Fleming was deprived of a valuable business opportunity for the manufacture of the hangar doors. Thus, the terms of the teaming agreement are sufficiently definite for enforcement and provide a basis for fashioning a suitable remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Estoppel Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Jacobs argues that the doctrine of judicial estoppel provides another basis for finding that Fleming's breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law. Specifically, Jacobs argues that Fleming is judicially estopped from asserting the existence of an oral contract in this case because it failed to disclose any such contract in its November 2011 Disclosure Statement filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Jacobs submits that the Disclosure Statement required Fleming to list all leases and executory contracts to which Fleming was a party as of that date-November 14, 2011. By failing to do so, Fleming has taken irreconcilably inconsistent positions with its breach of contract claim in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In response, Fleming counters that Jacobs grossly misunderstands bankruptcy law, as only ongoing contracts existing at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed had to be disclosed. Since the oral agreement between Fleming and Jacobs did not exist on April 4, 2011 when the bankruptcy petition was filed, Fleming submits that it was not required to list its oral contract with Jacobs in any of its bankruptcy filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Judicial estoppel was first articulated by the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Scarano v.

Since its decision in\n   <em>\n    Scarano\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals has consistently opined that judicial estoppel should only be applied to avoid a miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343985,9106316\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/314/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The Court of Appeals identified three criteria for determining whether judicial estoppel should be applied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   First, the party to be estopped must have taken two positions that are irreconcilably inconsistent. Second, judicial estoppel is unwarranted unless the party\n   changed his or her position \"\n   <em>\n    in bad faith\n   </em>\n   -i.e., with intent to play fast and loose with the court.\" Finally, a district court may not employ judicial estoppel unless it is \"tailored to address the harm identified\" and no lesser sanction would adequately remedy the damage done by the litigant's misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343985,9106316\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/314/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343985,9106316\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/314/\">\n    at 319-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Montrose Med.

Jacobs cites several non-precedential cases for the proposition that a debtor in bankruptcy has duty to disclose all assets and interests in property, and this duty continues throughout the case, thus requiring the debtor to amend its forms and schedules whenever necessary to insure the accuracy and reliability of the information disclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   These cases are inapposite, however, to the instant matter, because the debtors omitted or failed to adequately disclose assets or claims that\n   <em>\n    existed\n   </em>\n   at the time the bankruptcy case was initiated. In the instant matter, the oral contract did not exist on the date Fleming filed its bankruptcy petition on April 4, 2011. Moreover, none of the cases cited by Jacobs held that a debtor is required to list assets or claims on its disclosure statement that were acquired\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the bankruptcy petition is filed. Nor would the Court expect such a holding, as it is axiomatic that the property of the bankruptcy estate is determined as of the date the petition is filed, with certain exceptions not applicable here.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Retort\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9080546\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/300/411/#p414\">\n    300 B.R. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (Bankr.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not bar Fleming's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Actual/Apparent Authority of Jacobs' Employees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Jacobs submits that another independent basis exists for granting summary judgment in its favor on Fleming's breach of contract claim-neither Cody Hoff nor Chris Surles possessed actual or apparent authority to bind Jacobs to the oral contract alleged by Fleming. In support of this argument, Jacobs argues that the record is devoid of any evidence to establish that Mr. Hoff or Mr. Surles possessed either actual or apparent authority. Before addressing the merits of Jacobs' argument, the Court must consider whether, as Fleming contends, Jacobs has waived this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Fleming submits that Jacobs has waived this argument because it is an affirmative defense that was not raised in either its Answer (ECF No. 35 ) or Amended Answer (ECF No. 51 ) to Plaintiff's Second Amended\n   Complaint (ECF No. 34 ).

In fact, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Clark Resources\n   </em>\n   pleaded the affirmative defense of lack of actual/apparent authority in its answer to the amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ans. &amp; Affirm. Defenses to Am. Compl., Second Affirm. Def., ECF No. 39 at 7, Docket No. 1:10-cv-01119 (M.D. Pa. June 10, 2011). Thus, the issue of whether lack of actual/apparent authority is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded was never raised, argued or decided in\n   <em>\n    Clark Resources\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Moreover, at the time the defendant filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses in\n   <em>\n    Clark Resources\n   </em>\n   , discovery was ongoing and was extended to August 26, 2011. Thus, over two months remained for the plaintiff to conduct discovery on the actual/apparent authority issue. Although the Court in\n   <em>\n    Clark Resources\n   </em>\n   granted summary\n   judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence of actual or apparent authority, the plaintiff had advanced notice of the affirmative defense and an opportunity to obtain evidence during discovery to establish such authority or at least raise questions of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   By contrast here, Fleming had virtually no advance notice or any opportunity to discover evidence to show actual or apparent authority. It appears that the first time Fleming's counsel became aware of Jacobs' defense of lack of actual or apparent authority was during the deposition of Jacobs' employee, Mr. Hoff, six days prior to the end of discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hoff testified that Jacobs has work instructions and global standard operating procedures (\"GSOP\") that sets forth who has what contractual signing authority for Jacobs. Hoff Dep. at 27:14-21. At that point, Plaintiff's counsel requested a copy of the GSOP, to which defense counsel responded that it would not produce the GSOP if it was not responsive to Plaintiff's RFP's-Requests for Production of Documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:22-25. Because Mr. Hoff's deposition was taken six days before discovery ended, there was insufficient time to serve and answer an additional RFP, and defense counsel refused to provide the GSOP without it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27: 25 to 28:1-7. In addition, Fleming was precluded from conducting discovery on the issue of apparent authority, given the lack of \"pragmatically sufficient\" notice by Jacobs. As such, Fleming has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to Jacobs' defense of lack of apparent authority. Accordingly, the Court finds that Jacobs has waived its affirmative defense of actual or apparent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Project 3027\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Finally, Jacobs argues that the breach of contract claim against it must be dismissed as to Project 3027 because that project did not exist at the time the alleged oral contract was formed, and the undisputed facts show that the alleged oral agreement plainly did not contemplate Project 3027. In support, Jacobs points to Mr. Kohn's deposition, in which he testified that the conversations which formed the basis of the oral agreement concerned only Project 3010 (Kohn. Dep. at 116-17). Jacobs also proffers the Navy Task Force Order for Project 3027 which was only issued on October 4, 2012 (Kohn Dep. Ex. 22, attached to Def.'s App. Ex. 5, ECF No. 75-6 at 90-98 ); Mr. Hoff first learned of Project 3027 late in 2012, approximately one month prior to the issuance of the Task Order for that project (Hoff Dep. at 90); and Mr. Hoff first informed Mr. Kohn of Project 3027 via email in January 2013 (Hoff Dep. Ex. 20, attached to Def.'s App. Ex. 1, ECF No. 75-2 at 96 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In response, Fleming counters that prior to October of 2012, Jacobs informed Fleming that Project 3027 was \"coming down the pike, and they were hoping it would be issued.\" Kohn Dep. at 147-48 (Pl.'s App. Ex. GG). Mr. Kohn further testified that prior to October of 2012, Fleming had already provided Jacobs design services for Project 3027, in July of 2012; even\n   though there may not have been any drawings yet relating to Project 3027, Mr. Kohn testified that the \"two jobs got muddled together in some respects\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-44. Fleming also points to the deposition testimony of Mr. Surles, in which he stated that Fleming provided \"valuable assistance\" with respect to both Projects 3010 and 3027. (Surles Dep. at 71-72, Pl.'s App. Ex. II). Thus, Fleming argues that even though the Navy awarded Jacobs a Task Order for Project 3027 after Fleming and Jacobs reached an oral agreement, the parties understood that Fleming would be compensated by way of a sole source for assisting in Project 3027 as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Court concludes that no rational jury would find that the alleged oral agreement formed with regard to Project 3010 included Project 3027. Fleming has failed to identify any relevant evidence to show that Project 3027 was discussed or contemplated during the parties' oral communications which form the basis of their alleged oral agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Court finds that Jacobs is entitled to summary judgment on Fleming's breach of contract claim as to Project 3027.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    B.

As to the Fleming's suggestion that the \"gist-of-the-action\" doctrine is a better fit for non-products liability claims, that argument is nonsensical, as a defendant is not limited to asserting only one of those doctrines as an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mill Run Assocs. v.

Moreover, the legal precedent discussed above holds that the economic loss doctrine applies to negligent misrepresentation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Next, Fleming argues that because Jacobs is disputing the existence of the oral agreement, it is premature to apply the economic loss doctrine to bar its negligent misrepresentation claim at the summary judgment stage, citing in support\n   <em>\n    Covertech Fabricating, Inc. v. TVM Building Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A.

June 11, 2014). Fleming contends it should not be denied the opportunity to seek relief under its negligent misrepresentation claim as an alternative theory of relief, should the jury find that an oral contract did not exist between Fleming and Jacobs. In reply, Jacobs submits that\n   <em>\n    Covertech Fabricating\n   </em>\n   does not support Fleming's argument, as the ruling there was on a motion to dismiss and, unlike the case at bar, the facts were not sufficiently developed for the Court to determine the contours of the parties' alleged agreement or whether they had entered into a binding agreement at all. Jacobs further maintains that it is not seeking to bar the negligent misrepresentation claim because it is duplicative of a contract claim, as the application of the economic loss doctrine does not depend on the status of the alleged oral contract. For support, Jacobs relies on\n   <em>\n    Azur v. Chase Bank, USA, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224818\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/212/#p223\">\n    601 F.3d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223 (3d Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The Court agrees with Jacobs that the application of the economic loss doctrine to Fleming's negligent misrepresentation claim does not depend on whether Fleming is able to establish its breach of contract claim. The Court of Appeals rejected an argument similar to Fleming's in\n   <em>\n    Sovereign Bank\n   </em>\n   , where the Court applied the economic loss doctrine to a card issuer's negligence claim against other financial institutions with which it had no contractual relationship. The Court of Appeals explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   did not hold that the economic loss doctrine may not apply where the plaintiff has no available contract remedy ....

Thus, based on\n   <em>\n    Sovereign Bank\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Azur\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that it may grant summary judgment on Fleming's negligent misrepresentation claim, if warranted, regardless of the disposition of its breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Fleming also argues that the exception to the economic loss doctrine adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   applies to the facts of this case. Fleming maintains that Jacobs, an architectural and engineering company, is exactly the type of party to which Section 552 applies, and its claim for negligent misrepresentation falls squarely within Section 552(1). In support, Fleming submits that Jacobs owed a duty to provide information to Fleming as to what transpired during multiple design meetings that Jacobs attended with the Navy, as Fleming was effectively providing services as an engineering subcontractor under the Navy Delivery Order. Fleming contends that this is evidenced by Jacobs' designation of Fleming as the sole-source in the bid documents disseminated to potential bidders. Fleming further alleges that Jacobs intended Fleming and others to rely upon its representations and bid documents and was meant to ensure that Fleming would supply the design-work necessary for Jacobs to draft the project specifications. In addition, Fleming maintains that Jacobs' representations that the Navy had agreed to sole source the hangar doors to Fleming were false, which Jacobs knew, or should have known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note 5,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Jacobs submits, the economic loss rule does not bar recovery here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Moreover, Fleming argues that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   can be applied to the facts of this case without requiring a change in the law, solely on the premise that Jacobs supplied information in a transaction in which it had a pecuniary interest. According to Fleming, the existence of a pecuniary interest supplies the foreseeability and the duty that is lacking in cases involving tort claims for purely economic loss, and thus obviates the need for the economic loss rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In reply, Jacobs correctly points out that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   \"carved out a narrow exception [to the economic loss doctrine] when losses result from the reliance on advice of professionals\", as stated in\n   <em>\n    Sovereign Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039191\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/162/#p175\">\n    533 F.3d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover,\n   Jacobs argues that since\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Courts have uniformly rejected the application of the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception to those who are not \"in the business of providing information for pecuniary gain,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Excavation Technologies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197101,7292869\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/840/\">\n    985 A.2d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (even though a utility company \"enjoys an economic benefit from providing accurate information\", it does not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception because it is not a \"professional information provider.\"). In addition, Jacobs relies on\n   <em>\n    Whitaker v. Herr Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126372\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/198/476/#p491\">\n    198 F.Supp.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491 (E.D. Pa. 2016), for the proposition that it is not sufficient that a representation is made in the course of the defendant's business for the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception to apply; rather, the representation itself must be a \"professional representation.\" Here, Jacobs submits that its representation to Fleming concerned the status of Fleming's sole-source with the Navy, a question which, in turn, depends on an understanding of the FAR and NAVFAC's sole-source approval procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aguon Dep. at 54, Pl.'s Ex. BB (ECF No. 87-28 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jacobs contends, however, that it is not in the business of providing legal advice, advice about the FAR, or federal procurement advice for compensation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hoff Decl. \u00b6 4 (Def.'s App. Ex. 14), and, as such, its representation to Fleming about the status of the sole source is not its \"professional representation,\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126372\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/198/476/#p491\">\n    198 F.Supp.3d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Jacobs submits that the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception to the economic loss doctrine does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The Court agrees with Jacobs that the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception does not apply here. Jacobs was hired by the Navy for Project 3010 to provide A/E services in connection with the design of a hangar at the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Thus, Jacobs' status as a design professional appears, superficially, to trigger application of\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   . However, the alleged misrepresentation upon which Fleming relied was not made in the design and specifications documents submitted by Jacobs to the Navy. Rather, the alleged misrepresentation, made by Jacobs directly to Fleming, was that the Navy agreed to sole-source the hangar door project to Fleming. The sole-source representation did not convey architectural or engineering design information or specifications regarding the project, but was ancillary to Jacobs' professional services which it was hired to provide by the Navy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126372\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/198/476/#p491\">\n    198 F.Supp.3d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"representations on a product's label made by a manufacturer materially differ from the professional representations made by an accountant, lawyer, or architect for pecuniary gain\"; \"[a]ny information conveyed ... by the products' labels 'was ancillary to' the products' sale.\") (citations omitted). As such, the sole source representation was not a \"professional representation\", i.e., was not rendered in Jacobs' professional capacity as the A/E to the Navy. Therefore, Fleming's negligent misrepresentation claim, which is predicated on the sole source representation, and not on a representation about Jacobs' work product, does not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   This conclusion is further buttressed by the rationale underlying the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   Court's decision to apply Section 552 to architects and design professionals. In this respect, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted that liability under Section 552 flows from the foreseeability of economic losses resulting from the negligent breach of an architect's common law duty of due care in\n   the performance of its contract with the party hiring the architect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9036712,1140674,9036667,1140710\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/270/\">\n    866 A.2d at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=255%20S.E.2d%20580\">\n    255 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   584 ). Here, Fleming has not argued, nor does the evidence show, that Jacobs breached a duty of due care in the performance of its contract\n   <em>\n    with the Navy\n   </em>\n   to provide A/E services in connection with the design of a hangar at the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Thus, the basis for finding Section 552 applicable here-the architect's breach of the duty of due care in the performance of its contract with the project's owner-simply does not exist. Where, as here, there is no evidence that the design professional negligently breached its duty of due care to the Navy, there can be no foreseeable economic loss resulting to a potential subcontractor-Fleming-cognizable under Section 552.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Likewise, the Court rejects Fleming's argument that\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   should be applied because Jacobs supplied information in a transaction in which it had a pecuniary interest. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Excavation Technologies\n   </em>\n   made clear that the information supplied must be a \"professional representation,\" made by a design professional, akin to an architect.\n   <em>\n    Excavation Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197101,7292869\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/840/\">\n    985 A.2d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The mere fact that a supplier of information stands to gain financially from a transaction in which it has a pecuniary interest is not enough to bring the negligent misrepresentation claim within the\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197101,7292869\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/840/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197101,7292869\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/840/\">\n    at 842-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting plaintiff's argument that the utility company should be liable for economic losses under \u00a7 552(1) and (2) because like the architectural firm in\n   <em>\n    Bilt-Rite\n   </em>\n   , the utility company enjoyed an economic benefit from providing accurate information about the location of its underground lines.\").

A cause of action exists in this situation only if the tortious interference was intentional or involved parties in a special relationship to one another.\") (citation omitted). Fleming submits it had a special relationship with Jacobs so as to give rise to a claim for economic loss. In support, Fleming argues that because it had no privity of contract with the Navy and had no direct dealings with the Navy, it relied exclusively on Jacobs to convey information regarding its sole source status, and Jacobs was aware of, and acquiesced to, Fleming's reliance. Thus, Fleming maintains that Jacobs cannot now claim that the loss sustained by Fleming was unforeseeable and not directly a result of the negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In reply, Jacobs argues that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not recognized a \"special relationship\" exception to the economic loss doctrine, and Fleming fails to cite any authority for allowing a plaintiff to recover solely economic damages in a negligence action under a \"special relationship exception.\" Even if such an exception did exist, Jacobs maintains that there is no such special relationship between itself and Fleming. Jacobs submits that Fleming has not shown any \"overmastering influence\" by Jacobs over Fleming, but rather, the parties operated at arms' length. Moreover, based on\n   <em>\n    Rearick v.

Def.'s App. Ex. 26 (ECF No. 75-27 ). In response to interrogatory no. 4, Fleming stated that \"in the event that [it] does not prevail on Counts I [breach of contract] or II [negligent misrepresentation], [it] seeks recovery in quantum meruit for the value of its services for the amounts set forth above.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199300\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/304/424/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The amounts set forth above consisted of unabsorbed overhead (8, 693 shop hours and 3,675 engineering hours times $ 32.35 per hour or $ 400,104.80), and lost profit of 17.25% ($ 881,012.56), on each project; and expenses incurred on Project 3010 ($ 159,106.20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jacobs submits that Fleming's response to Interrogatory No. 4 is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   In response, Fleming argues that at a bare minimum, the value Jacobs received equaled the hourly charges for Fleming's engineers and design professionals who designed the hangar doors. Fleming points out that during the course of discovery, Jacobs spent a considerable amount of time examining Fleming's time records showing which employees performed services on the project and when.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kohn Dep. at 75, 136-39, 142-44, 156-58, 161, 172-73; Ex. 43 to Kohn Dep, Pl.'s App. Ex. KK (ECF No. 87-37 ). Fleming also cites to Mr. Kohn's deposition, where he testified as to the hourly rates of each employee and the involvement by each. Kohn Dep. at 138-40. In addition, Fleming states that at trial, it will offer Mr. Kohn's testimony as to what costs Fleming expended on the project, relying extensively on the records maintained by Fleming and which were produced and discussed during discovery. Lastly, Fleming proffers the Rebuttal Report of its expert witness, David E. Pearson, in which he opined, inter alia, that the information available is sufficient to establish and quantify Fleming's claim for lost overhead, lost profit, and expenses incurred, and that the profit (profit and contingency) asserted by Fleming was reasonable and within industry standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pearson Rebuttal Report, Pl.'s App. Ex. LL (ECF No. 87-38 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Contrary to Jacobs' argument, the record does contain evidence of the value of design services Fleming provided to Jacobs. Mr. Kohn testified that Fleming maintained time records of expenses incurred in designing the hangar doors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kohn Dep. at 136; Pl.'s App. Ex. KK. The time records show that the design work was performed in 2011 through 2014. Pl.'s App. Ex. KK. Mr. Kohn further testified that Fleming incurred over $159,000 in actual costs in designing the hangar doors, exclusive of lost profit and overhead. Kohn Dep. at 161. Certainly, Fleming's time records, kept in the ordinary course of business, showing the actual time spent on designing the hangar doors, are a starting point for determining the reasonable value of the services provided to Jacobs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commw. of Pa.,Governor's Energy Council v.

In particular, Fleming points to Mr. Hoff's testimony that he felt Fleming's ROM was \"fair and reasonable\", and that the total price of $3,984,000 for the hangar doors \"seems fine for a door that's never been built before\". Hoff Dep. at 90-93. However, Fleming's ROM budget quotation provides its anticipated\n   <em>\n    construction\n   </em>\n   costs of the hangar doors. Pl.'s App. Ex. Z. Fleming's ROM does not contain any costs for the design services provided to Jacobs, nor would it because the ROM estimate is being submitted to the Navy with the expectation of obtaining a sole source for the\n   <em>\n    construction\n   </em>\n   of the hangar doors. Thus, the cited testimony of Mr. Hoff regarding Fleming's ROM is insufficient to establish that the value of Fleming's design services\n   was reasonable. However, this is not fatal to Fleming's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The report of Fleming's rebuttal expert appears to provide some basis for determining the reasonable value of Fleming's design services to Jacobs. For example, Mr. Pearson states that he has \"reviewed Fleming's time records related to the Projects at issue and finds that they are typical of the records maintained by companies with which I have worked and am of the opinion that they are more than sufficient to support and quantify Fleming's costs of design services.\" Pearson Report at 15. Although Mr. Pearson does not specifically opine in his report as to whether these costs constitute the \"reasonable value\" of Fleming's services, given his extensive background in the construction industry and experience with government construction projects, he may very well be able to provide an opinion as to the reasonable value of Fleming's technical design and engineering services in the market of government contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Jacobs takes issue with Fleming's reliance on the hourly rates it paid its design professionals and engineers, arguing that those rates represent Fleming's loss, not Jacobs' gain. While it is true that a plaintiff cannot recover\n   <em>\n    lost profits\n   </em>\n   as damages for an unjust enrichment claim, the hourly rates Fleming paid its design professionals and engineers represents Fleming's cost of the benefit it conferred on Jacobs. According to the RESTATEMENT ( THIRD ) OF RESTITUTION , \"when a professional recovers in restitution for the value of services rendered pursuant to an unenforceable contract, there will not necessarily be a meaningful distinction between the value of the services to the recipient, their cost to the claimant, their market value, and a price fixed by the unenforceable agreement.\" RESTATEMENT ( THIRD ) OF RESTITUTION , \u00a7 49 (March 2019). Hence, the only question is whether the time spent by Fleming's design professionals and their hourly rates represent the fair market value for such services in the market of government contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The use of time sheets and expense vouchers was deemed adequate proof of the reasonable value of services rendered as damages for restitution in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Governor's Energy Council v.

Because Fleming has failed to designate an expert on the value of its services, Jacobs contends that\n   Fleming is barred from recovering for such damages, and therefore, summary judgment should be granted on Fleming's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   In response, Fleming argues that expert testimony is not required to present evidence with respect to which of its employees worked on the project, the days they worked, the work performed, and the hourly rate assigned to each. Fleming contends that Mr. Kohn, a lay witness with first hand knowledge of Fleming's business operations, is competent to testify as to these damages without the use of an expert. In support, Fleming cites a number of cases holding that expert opinions are not required to establish lost profits, and may be established through lay testimony alone where the witness possesses a particularized personal knowledge of the business' operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   As this Court has held in prior cases, Fleming will likely be able to establish the value of the design services rendered to Jacobs based on its time sheets and the testimony of Mr. Kohn regarding his particularized knowledge due to his position at the business.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Autoforge, Inc. v.

Jan. 4, 2008) (holding that president of business was authorized to offer lay opinion testimony concerning damages sustained \"based on facts within his particularized knowledge by virtue of his position at Autoforge and to the extent a proper foundation is laid.\"). It is unclear whether Mr. Kohn can testify as to whether the value of its services rendered to Jacobs is reasonable in the government contract market. Nonetheless, Fleming has retained an expert who may be able to testify as to the reasonableness of the value of the design services. Based on\n   <em>\n    ATACS Corp.\n   </em>\n   , it is premature for the Court to conclude at the summary judgment stage that Fleming cannot establish the reasonable value of its design services to Jacobs, either through Mr. Kohn and/or Mr. Pearson.
