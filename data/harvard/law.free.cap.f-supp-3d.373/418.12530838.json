Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Award arises out of a dispute in which three former Wells Fargo financial advisors-Reagan Tucker, Benjamin Dooley, and Marvin Glasgold (collectively \"Respondents\")-claim that Wells Fargo failed to pay them, and a putative class and collective, overtime pay required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\"), Art. 6, \u00a7 190\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Art. 9, \u00a7 650\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Turnbull Decl.

Rule 13204 of the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure for Industry Disputes, however, prohibits FINRA from presiding over class arbitration actions. For that reason, FINRA declined to hear this dispute.

In\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , Judge Caproni, to whom that action was assigned, denied Wells Fargo's application. She held that, under the Agreement, it was for the arbitrator, not a court, to decide whether the Agreement provided for class arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , 195 F.Supp.3d at 553 ; Award at 2. Wells Fargo appealed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 7, 2018, the Second Circuit affirmed. It held that the Agreement \"clearly and unmistakably expresses [the parties'] intent to let an arbitrator decide whether they agreed to authorize class arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Sappington I\n   </em>\n   , 884 F.3d at 394 ; Award at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 28, 2018, the arbitrator assigned to the Tucker arbitration, Edith N.

She construed the Agreement to allow Respondents \"to pursue class claims in this arbitration.\" Award at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 27, 2018, Wells Fargo filed a petition in this Court to vacate the Arbitrator's clause construction award insofar as it construed the Agreement to allow Respondents to permit class arbitration, Dkt. 1, and an accompanying memorandum of law, Pet'r Mem. On August 23, 2018, Respondents filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to vacate. Resp't Mem. On September 6, 2018, Wells Fargo filed a reply.

The Arbitrator considered Respondents' arguments, including that the Agreement's use of the word \"any\" in preface to these terms signified a \"comprehensive and all-encompassing\" obligation to arbitrate that included \"both individual and class-based claims,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, and that the arbitral clause's express exclusion of certain claims, but not representational claims, was to the same effect,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Arbitrator also considered Wells Fargo's competing arguments. These included the following: that the absence of an express reference to class arbitration indicates the lack of mutual assent to such arbitration; that there is a distinction between a class action as a procedural mechanism to resolve \"any dispute, claim or controversy\" and the \"dispute, claim, or controversy itself\"; and that the words \"you\" and \"your\" in Paragraph 14 refer solely to the person who signed the Agreement at issue, therefore limiting the arbitration\n   commitment \"to individual bilateral disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Arbitrator ultimately found Respondents' \"interpretation of the Agreements to be in closer keeping with the properly understood principles of\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   and other governing authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The Arbitrator recited three reasons for this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, the language of the agreement, considered in light of case law applying such provisions, was \"sufficient to conclude that there was implicit consent to assertion of class claims in arbitration even though the word 'class' was not expressly used in the Agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15. Second, \"other factors\" identified as relevant in\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   and ensuing precedents to arbitral clause construction reinforced that there had been an agreement to arbitrate class claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. These included the relative sophistication of the parties, Wells Fargo's authorship of the Agreement, and evidence that the pursuit of class claims in arbitration was \"by no means novel\" at the time Wells Fargo \"required Claimants to sign the Agreement in 2011-2013.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17. Third, the Agreement did not include any mention or warning of a waiver of class claims. Instead, it overtly waived only \"suing in court and having a jury trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (\"Nothing in the Agreements would have reasonably caused someone being asked to sign them to\n   <em>\n    expect\n   </em>\n   the interpretation and result now urged by [Wells Fargo]-namely[,] a total waiver of the right to pursue a claim on behalf of oneself and others similarly situated.\"). The Arbitrator concluded by considering, but not finding dispositive, various decisions cited by Wells Fargo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In now pursuing vacatur of the Award, Wells Fargo makes two broad arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, Wells Fargo contends that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by (1) allowing an agreement to permit class arbitration to be inferred, rather than textually explicit, and, ostensibly, requiring a party seeking to preclude class arbitration to include a provision explicitly waiving class arbitration; (2) in interpreting the Agreement, considering evidence beyond the four corners of the Agreement; and (3) issuing a clause construction award that, ostensibly, binds the absent members of the purported class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Wells Fargo argues that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in reaching her decision, specifically by ignoring holdings of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen.\n   </em>\n   The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Arbitrator Did Not Exceed Her Powers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Arbitrator's Construction of the Agreements Under\n    <em>\n     Stolt-Nielsen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Wells Fargo argues, first, that the Agreements did not provide a contractual basis for the Arbitrator to find that the Agreements implicitly allowed for class arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 6. The Arbitrator, therefore, exceeded her authority, according to Wells Fargo, by \"requiring that the Agreements affirmatively exclude class procedures or else be presumed to include them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Wells Fargo argues that such a requirement conflicts with the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Wells Fargo misreads\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   and, therefore, mischaracterizes the Arbitrator as having exceeded her authority under that decision. Although Wells Fargo correctly observes that\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   \"require[s] that class arbitration procedures only be allowed where there is a contractual basis for doing so,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, it overreaches in reading \"contractual basis\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   to mean only \"expressly allowed.\" Wells Fargo portrays\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   to bar finding an agreement to allow class arbitration except where an explicit statement to that effect appears in an arbitral agreement. However, as the Arbitrator rightly explained,\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   does not say that.\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   does not preclude the possibility that an agreement to permit class arbitration could be found based on implicit evidence of agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 5. The Supreme Court instead held that \"[a]n implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration ... is not a term that the arbitrator may infer\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   from the fact of the parties' agreement to arbitrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , 559 U.S. at 685,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1758/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But that holding, and the Court's analysis, does not preclude inferring such mutual assent from textual cues within the arbitral agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As a result of its misreading of\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   to categorically preclude finding agreements to class arbitration in the absence of explicit language, Wells Fargo depicts the Arbitrator as having flouted a limit on her authority imposed by\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   That is wrong. In fact, the Arbitrator addressed a question not squarely resolved by\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    :\n   </em>\n   Whether assent to class arbitration, in the absence of an explicit textual command, can be inferred from implicit textual cues. The Arbitrator found the answer to be yes, while recognizing the divided lower-court case authority on this point, and she made implicit evidence of such intent in the Agreement's text the primary basis for her construction of Paragraph 14 to permit class arbitration. Award at 11. None of this flouted any restriction imposed by\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   so as to exceed the Arbitrator's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To be sure, Wells Fargo was at liberty before the Arbitrator to argue that the principles of\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   would be most persuasively vindicated were that decision extended to categorically bar courts and arbitrators from ever inferring agreements to class arbitration. But, in the absence of controlling case authority, the Arbitrator was within her authority to take a different view. Far from violating limits imposed by\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , the Arbitrator carefully analyzed that decision (and the ensuing body of law addressing the bases on which to find class arbitration), permissibly arrived at the opposite conclusion (that an agreement as to this point can be express or implied), and found on the facts here an implied agreement to permit class arbitration. Wells Fargo may now rue that the arbitral forum it chose has reached this outcome, and that this Court's review is limited to determining only whether the Arbitrator exceeded her broad authority, not whether she was right or wrong. But that was a risk that Wells Fargo accepted when it selected arbitration as the forum in which it would litigate employment disputes with the respondent financial advisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Relatedly, Wells Fargo misrepresents the manner in which the Arbitrator interpreted the parties' Agreement en route to finding an implicit agreement to permit class arbitration. Wells Fargo casts the Arbitrator as \"impos[ing] upon the parties an obligation to affirmatively disclaim class action procedures,\" Pet'r Mem. at 8, and urges that imposing such an obligation in order to avoid class arbitration would exceed an arbitrator's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Arbitrator, however, did not so hold. She did not require an express waiver of class procedures for Wells Fargo to prevail in defeating an inference of assent to class arbitration. She merely found that where the Agreement did not speak expressly to the subject of class arbitration, including by means of a waiver provision, state and federal law authorized her to analyze holistically the Agreement's text to\n   gauge the parties' intentions as to class arbitration. She explained that \"the FAA and state law principles of contractual interpretation[ ] ... call for the words of the contract to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and for the Agreements to be interpreted as a whole, in accordance with their own terms and the intent of the parties.\" Award at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , 559 U.S. at 682,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1758/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v.

Wells Fargo does not cite any controlling law, including\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   , that precluded this interpretive approach. Quite the contrary, as reflected above, the Arbitrator anchored her approach in substantial case law, including\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the Arbitrator did not require an express waiver to defeat a construction of the Agreement to permit class arbitration, Wells Fargo's claim that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority in so requiring necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Pet'r Mem. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court emphasizes at the outset the narrow scope of its review. The question is not whether the Arbitrator's conclusion was correct. It is whether she exceeded her powers \"by (1) considering issues beyond those the parties have submitted for h[er] consideration, or (2) reaching issues clearly prohibited by law or by the terms of the parties' agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056412\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/621/49/#p51\">\n    621 F. App'x at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither ground for vacatur exists here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To the extent Wells Fargo faults the Arbitrator for considering extrinsic factors, as the Court's earlier summary reflects, the Award itself reflects that it was rooted in the text of the Agreement. The Arbitrator devoted her initial analysis to the text, carefully considering a range of potential inferences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 7-15. She found the text ultimately determinative. In fact, the header of the Award's first point, which contained the Arbitrator's textual analysis, reads: \"The language of the Agreements allows pursuit of class claims in arbitration.\" Award, at 11. To be sure, the Arbitrator went on to note that \"other factors\" supported this conclusion, namely, \"the inequality-in terms of both sophistication and bargaining power-between these employees and their employer\" and the prevalence of class claims in arbitration at the time of the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   15-18. Wells Fargo faults the arbitrator for addressing these matters. Pet'r Mem. at 9. But even assuming that these factors were not properly considered, the Arbitrator discussed them only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she had engaged in a thoroughgoing analysis of the Agreement's text, and announced her conclusion that the text-the four corners of the Agreement-was dispositive and revealed mutual agreement to class arbitration. The Award makes clear that the Arbitrator viewed these \"other factors\" as reinforcing-confirming-her text-based determination, rather than as the source of her substantive ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Wells Fargo's reliance on this aspect of the Arbitrator's discussion is misplaced for other reasons. It is far from clear that it was impermissible for the Arbitrator to consider these other factors. The Arbitrator, in fact, cited\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   itself as\n   authority to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 15 (\"In\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court confirmed that factors concerning how the arbitration contract was formed are relevant to a clause construction determination. 559 U.S. at 684,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1758/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mentioning the sophistication of the parties, the presence [or absence] of a tradition of class arbitration under the applicable body of substantive law, and the identity of the drafter as factors that would have been worthy of that arbitration panel's consideration).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   And it is by no means clear that Missouri law, on which Wells Fargo relies in claiming error by the Arbitrator, precluded consideration of these factors. Judge Caproni thoughtfully analyzed this question in\n   <em>\n    Sappington II, supra.\n   </em>\n   There, Wells Fargo, in a FLSA case brought by other financial advisors, challenged a different arbitrator's construction of the same arbitral provision to imply an agreement to permit class arbitration.

There is, to be sure, contrary case authority, including a 2017 holding by the Missouri Supreme Court that \"[i]f a contract is unambiguous, the parties' intent may be gathered from the terms of the contract alone, and no extrinsic evidence may be introduced to contradict the terms of the contract or to create an ambiguity.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Phipps\n   </em>\n   line is in apparent tension with\n   <em>\n    Greitens\n   </em>\n   , as Judge Caproni observed, the conflict can be resolved in two ways: First, \"extrinsic evidence could permissibly be used to\n   <em>\n    interpret\n   </em>\n   a term without\n   <em>\n    varying\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    contradicting\n   </em>\n   it, which is forbidden.\"\n   <em>\n    Sappington II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526977\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/317/#p322\">\n    328 F.Supp.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, \"the Supreme Court of Missouri in\n   <em>\n    Greitens\n   </em>\n   wrote that intent '\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be gathered from the terms of the contract alone,' not 'must,' which could provide leeway for courts to review extrinsic evidence beyond the terms of a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526977\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/317/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under either of these approaches, the Arbitrator's consideration of extrinsic evidence here would not have been error.

Wells Fargo contends that \"a 'class-based claim' is not a type of substantive claim at all, but a shorthand description for a claim that is brought pursuant to class action procedures.\" Pet'r Mem. at 13. \"In other words,\" Wells Fargo argues, \"while the Agreements are plainly referring to any substantive type of 'dispute, claim, or controversy,' the arbitrator reads this language to cover any\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   of dispute, claim, or controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201079723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Wells Fargo made that argument before the Arbitrator, who, in turn, explicitly considered-and rejected-it, stating that the \"distinction has no bearing on the clause construction question before me.\" Award at 13, n.19. Wells Fargo argues that its textual inference is more persuasive. But that is not an available argument on judicial review of an arbitral ruling construing a contract. Regardless, even if the textual inference Wells Fargo urges were superior to that drawn by the Arbitrator, under settled law, an arbitrator's misapplication of tenets of contractual construction does not justify vacatur.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Willemijn Houdstermaatschappij\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/9/#p13\">\n    103 F.3d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that arbitrators' decision was justifiable even though it was \"based on an erroneous interpretation of the law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, Wells Fargo faults the Arbitrator for concluding that, while the Agreements use the singular pronouns \"you\" and \"your,\" they reflect a commitment \"to arbitrate 'any dispute, claim or controversy' even if the claim may effect more than one employee,\" Award at 13. Wells Fargo faults the Arbitrator for, relatedly, opining that \"[a]n employee's claim against [Wells Fargo] does not cease to be a dispute or controversy related to [his or her] employment simply because the disagreement may also implicate[ ] similarly situated [persons].\" Award at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mork v. Loram Maintenance of Way, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779429\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/950/#p955\">\n    844 F.Supp.2d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 955-56 (D. Minn. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Wells Fargo notes that, \"[a]t the time of Respondents' Agreements in 2011 through 2013, numerous courts held that arbitration agreements incorporating singular pronouns such as 'you' and 'I'-the same terms used in the Agreements-manifest the intent for bilateral arbitration.\" Pet'r Mem. at 10. Wells Fargo's memorandum does not collect these precedents. But, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the weight of case law supported Wells Fargo's construction, that the Arbitrator's contractual construction is arguably inferior to Wells Fargo's would not justify vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Third, the Arbitrator reasoned that by including the AAA as a permissible forum for conducting this arbitration, the parties manifested their intent to allow class arbitration. The Arbitrator cited the AAA's Employment Rule 39(d), which states that the \"arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that would have been available to the parties had the matter\n   been heard in court ... in accordance with applicable law.\" Award at 13. Wells Fargo contends that the Arbitrator errantly viewed class actions as \"a type of remedy or relief,\" when in fact they are procedural mechanism. Pet'r Mem. at 13 (emphasis removed). But the Arbitrator's analysis could also fairly be read to convey that certain remedies and forms of relief protected by the AAA's Employment Rules require the availability of class procedures. The Arbitrator found that the language in the Agreements was similar to the contractual language at issue in the\n   <em>\n    Jock v. Sterling Jewelers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , litigation, in which, in a series of decisions, the Second Circuit has upheld the finding that the \"entitlement to bring class claims was an integral part of what the contract offered the they would otherwise be entitled to seek in court.\" Award at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jock IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415902\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/113/#p122\">\n    646 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   124 ). In any event, the Arbitrator's analysis, grounded as it is in contractual text, case law, and AAA rules referenced in the arbitral Agreement, is also within the ambit of the Arbitrator's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Fourth, Wells Fargo faults the Arbitrator for inferring, based on the Agreement's express exclusion of certain types of claims (e.g., disability and ERISA claims), from the arbitral duty implies that the parties did not intend to similarly exclude class arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 15 (\"[T]hat the important subject of representational claims was not expressly contained in the list of excluded matters points to the conclusion that they were meant to be included.\"). Wells Fargo contends that this logic would force a party seeking to avoid class arbitration to include an express waiver of such procedure, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   's teaching that an agreement to arbitrate class claims cannot be inferred from the bare fact of an arbitral agreement itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 8. But Wells Fargo errantly portrays the Arbitrator's reasoning. The Arbitrator did not hold that a party seeking to avoid class arbitration was required to expressly exclude it. Instead, as one part of her construction of the Agreement, she reasoned that, when the parties have made the affirmative decision to exclude certain areas of litigation from the arbitration obligation, a contrary inference may arise to non-excluded areas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Persuasive or not, this act of construction was well within the Arbitrator's authority and is no basis for vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The broader response to Wells Fargo's critiques of the Arbitrator's construction of the parties' agreement is this: Whether the Arbitrator's construction or Wells Fargo's would prevail on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review is beside the point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benihana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203913599\">\n    2016 WL 3913599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 (\"That the [arbitral] panel exercised that latitude in a manner, or to reach an outcome, different than the Court would have\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , is of no moment\"). Provided that the arbitrator recited a contractual basis, persuasive or not, for the construction she reached, that decision may not be overturned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203913599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Supreme Court has frequently admonished parties that contemplate foregoing conventional litigation for the expedient of arbitration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The potential for [ ] mistakes is the price of agreeing to arbitrate.

The Effect of the Arbitrator's Decision on Absent Class Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Wells Fargo next attacks the Award by arguing that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by \"purporting to issue an award which extends to absentee class members.\" Pet'r Mem. at 6. In support, Wells Fargo cites Judge Rakoff's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Jock v. Sterling Jewelers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522850\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/566/\">\n    284 F.Supp.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Jock VII\n   </em>\n   \"). As portrayed by Wells Fargo,\n   <em>\n    Jock VII\n   </em>\n   \"held that an arbitrator exceeded her authority in purporting to bind absent members of a purported class by certifying a class which included absent members,\" and \"that absent members who have not opted in to an arbitration action could not be bound by decisions issued in that arbitration.\" Pet'r Mem. at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jock VII\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522850\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/566/\">\n    284 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   571 ). The Arbitrator in this case, Wells Fargo contends, \"ignores this caselaw entirely.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522850\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/566/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This argument also fails. As Respondents recognize, Resp't Mem. at 9,\n   <em>\n    Jock VII\n   </em>\n   arose in a far different, and later, procedural posture. The issue there involved the arbitral certification of an opt-out class, such that members of that class who had not affirmatively opted out stood to be bound by the arbitrator's decision. Judge Rakoff held that the arbitrator lacked authority to bind persons other than the named parties and others who chose to opt in to the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Jock VII\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522850\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/566/\">\n    284 F.Supp.3d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Award here does not certify a class at all. On the contrary, the Award is explicit that it does not prejudge whether class certification would be appropriate. Award at 21 n.27. A class may or may not be certified in this action in the future, and if a class is certified, the class may or not be drawn to include opt-out members so as to implicate the concerns raised in\n   <em>\n    Jock VII.\n   </em>\n   At this earlier procedural point, at which the sole issue is whether the parties' Agreement permits class treatment,\n   <em>\n    Jock VII\n   </em>\n   is of no moment. The Court accordingly rejects this line of attack, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Arbitrator Did Not Manifestly Disregard the Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court turns now to Wells Fargo's final argument-that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As reviewed earlier, the Arbitrator identified and discussed the applicable law at the outset of the Award. She explained that two Supreme Court cases (\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Oxford Health Plans\n   </em>\n   ) were centrally important as to the \"legal standard for determining if an arbitration contract allows for class or collective arbitration.\" Award at 4. Parsing those and other decisions, the Arbitrator recognized that the Supreme Court had never held that a clause must explicitly mention that the parties agree to class arbitration \"for a decision-maker to conclude that the parties consented to class arbitration.\" Award at 5 (quotation and internal citations omitted). The Arbitrator further recognized that\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   does not foreclose the possibility that a contract may implicitly reveal the parties' agreement to class arbitration. Award at 6, citing\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , 559 U.S. at 685,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1758/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Arbitrator reasoned, \"omission of the specific\n   words 'class' or 'class action' \" does not resolve the parties' intent whether to authorize class arbitration, and this question must be considered in light of \"the rest of the language used in the arbitration contract.\" Award at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Oxford Health Plans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697060\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/564/\">\n    569 U.S. at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697060\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/564/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As this synopsis and the preceding account reflects, the Arbitrator did not manifestly disregard the law. Instead, she explicitly acknowledged and sought to apply it, and Wells Fargo's claim that she manifestly disregarded the law borders perilously on the frivolous. As in\n   <em>\n    Sappington II\n   </em>\n   , where Judge Caproni rejected a similar argument, Wells Fargo does not offer any \"evidence that the Arbitrator committed more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law, if any error was committed at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Sappington II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526977\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/317/#p322\">\n    328 F.Supp.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although camouflaged to a degree by its briefs, Wells Fargo's grievance is, at bottom, not that clear and explicitly applicable law was ignored, as required to show manifest disregard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duferco Int'l Steel Trading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110223\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/383/#p390\">\n    333 F.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is instead that the law as to what is needed to infer an agreement for class arbitration, in the absence of explicit contractual authorization, remains unsettled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Arbitrator acknowledged the uncertain state of the law in this area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 7 (\"Unfortunately, ... there is currently no definitive Supreme Court guidance as to exactly what is needed to constitute an adequate contractual basis\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   class arbitration.\" (emphasis added) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And she noted that \"the losing side may be able to point to what is-at least apparently or arguably-contrary authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110223\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/383/#p390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.8.

The Arbitrator then endeavored to apply the appropriate precedents to the Agreement at hand, mindful that the lack of definite Supreme Court guidance inevitably meant that a decision in either direction would be subject to some uncertainty. And her decision to treat\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   as leaving open the possibility of an implied agreement accords with Second Circuit law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jock IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415902\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/113/#p122\">\n    646 F.3d at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   does not foreclose the possibility that parties may reach an implicit- rather than express-agreement to authorize class-action arbitration.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Thus, far from manifestly disregarding clearly applicable law, the Arbitrator identified the relevant law, parsed it thoughtfully, and endeavored to apply it with considerable care.
