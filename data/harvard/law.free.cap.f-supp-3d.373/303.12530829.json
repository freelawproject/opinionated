WOODCOCK, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs are four former students who signed enrollment agreements with the defendant, a for-profit college; the enrollment agreements contained arbitration provisions. The students filed a suit against the defendant alleging unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, fraudulent inducement to contract, as well as intentional and negligent misrepresentation. The defendant moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss the lawsuit, and the plaintiffs responded that the defendant was barred from compelling arbitration, raising certain corporate and contract law defenses. Although disquieted by the result, the Court concludes that Supreme Court and First Circuit authority requires the Court to grant the motion to dismiss and compel arbitration in accordance with the enrollment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

InterCoast's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   InterCoast argues that the Enrollment Agreements are covered under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and that the Court should compel arbitration because: (1) there is an enforceable written agreement to arbitrate; (2) the disputed issues between InterCoast and the Plaintiffs fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement; and (3) InterCoast has not waived\n   its right to arbitrate these disputed issues.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Mot.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   InterCoast says that when each Plaintiff reviewed, signed, and initialed the Enrollment Agreement, they \"entered into a contract which contained an agreement to arbitrate 'any dispute arising from enrollment, other than grades and no matter how described, pleaded, or styled.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kelly Michaud Decl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16, 20, 25, 30 and exhibits A-E thereto). InterCoast maintains that courts generally apply basic principles of contract law to arbitration agreements and interpret these agreements as creating \"a presumption of arbitrability which is only overcome if it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Consigli Constr. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850462\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/873/409/#p412\">\n    873 F.Supp.2d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (D. Me. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted) ). InterCoast maintains that \"[t]here is nothing to mandate revocation of the contracts\" because the Enrollment Agreements set forth and explained InterCoast's policies, the arbitration clauses were conspicuous, and Maine law favors the enforcement of arbitration provisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to the second point, InterCoast argues the issues in this case fall within the arbitration agreement since the clause is broadly worded in stating \"[a]ny dispute arising from enrollment at InterCoast Career Institute, other than grades and no matter how described, pleaded, or styled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Because the Complaint asserts claims not relating to grades the Plaintiffs received but alleges unfair trade practices, breach of contract, and torts, InterCoast says their claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

InterCoast argues consequently that because the issues before the Court are arbitrable, the Court should dismiss the case and that dismissal is advantageous on various grounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Boulet v.

Plaintiffs' Opposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After complaining that the arbitration clauses were untitled and in fine print, the Plaintiffs acknowledge that each individual Plaintiff executed an Enrollment Agreement with \"InterCoast Career Institute\" (ICCI), which contained an arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. The Plaintiffs say the issue is not whether they signed the Enrollment Agreements but whether the arbitration clauses within the Enrollment Agreements are enforceable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The Plaintiffs argue the Court should deny InterCoast's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case, because (1) the arbitration clauses are not enforceable as ICCI \"is not a legally organized entity and lacked any capacity to contract with the Plaintiffs;\" and (2) the arbitration clauses are unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At oral argument, the Plaintiffs also asserted InterCoast engaged in fraud and fraudulently induced them to enter their Enrollment Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Plaintiffs claim that the arbitration provisions in their Enrollment Agreements \"are unenforceable under common law principles of corporate and contract law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Specifically, the Plaintiffs aver that the arbitration clauses are not enforceable because \"[t]here is no evidence\n   that either InterCoast Career Institute or the entity for which it claims to have been a d/b/a, InterCoast Colleges [ ] ever has been validly organized as a corporation\" and consequently, InterCoast \"is not a legal entity capable of enforcing rights under a contract it purports to have entered with Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (internal quotations omitted). The Plaintiffs contend that in its Corporate Disclosure Statement (ECF No. 13 ) (\n   <em>\n    Corporate Disclosure I\n   </em>\n   ), InterCoast claims that it is a corporation and that \"its stock is owned by Inter-Coast International Training, Inc.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, the Plaintiffs argue \"[t]his representation is at odds with the corporate disclosure statements that [InterCoast]\" filed previously in this Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

The Plaintiffs contend that in\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   , Geeta Brown, the CEO, Secretary, CFO, and President of Inter-Coast International Training, Inc., made false representations to this Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.8. The Plaintiffs say \"[t]here is no evidence in the public record that InterCoast Colleges or ICCI ever was organized as a corporation in California, as Ms. Brown represents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiffs argue that InterCoast engaged in a \"shell game\" and that it will likely \"have to seek to amend their complaint to name both Inter-Coast International Training, Inc. and Ms. Brown personally as defendants in this action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At oral argument, the Plaintiffs represented that InterCoast had not started using its d/b/a InterCoast Colleges until 2017, years after the Enrollment Agreements were formalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lastly, the Plaintiffs contend that the arbitration clauses are unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Plaintiffs claim \"[t]he issue of whether a valid arbitration agreement exists 'is to be decided with reference to state contract law principles.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg v.

Under Maine law, the Plaintiffs assert, the central issue is whether there was a mutual understanding by both parties to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11584941\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted) (citing\n   <em>\n    Roy v.

The Plaintiffs also argue that the arbitration clauses are not conspicuous, which suggests that InterCoast sought \"to deceive and mislead students into waiving their rights without understanding material terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. According to the Plaintiffs, because InterCoast's \"motion to dismiss the case rests on the fate of its motion to compel,\" which they say the Court should deny, the Court should similarly deny InterCoast's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. InterCoast's Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   InterCoast asserts \"[t]he fact that the Enrollment Agreements were signed under Defendant's trade name [InterCoast Career Institute] instead of its corporate name [Inter-Coast International Training, Inc.] does not render the Enrollment Agreements and their arbitration provisions invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pickering v.

InterCoast contends that the Plaintiffs clearly understood this difference and it points to the fact that the Plaintiffs \"affirmatively allege ... that they each entered into a contract-i.e., their respective Enrollment Agreements-with the InterCoast corporate entity [ ]\" to support this contention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   InterCoast is also unconvinced by the Plaintiffs' unconscionability argument because, as InterCoast sees it, the argument stems from the lack of \"special notice\" in the arbitration clause, but they cite no Maine caselaw to support this requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.
