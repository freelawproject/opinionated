The res judicata statute explains that the \"identity\" element may also be satisfied when \"litigants of the second suit are legal representatives of those who litigated in the preceding suit, or when they are jointly bound with them or by the relations established by the indivisibility of prestations among those having a right to demand them, or the obligation to satisfy the same.\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 31, \u00a7 3343.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here, no such \"perfect\" identity exists and Barreras does not cite any facts or argument that plaintiff is Gables's \"legal representative[ ].\" Plaintiff was specifically excluded from the proceedings that Barreras now claims bar plaintiff's present case. As plaintiff points out, \"Barreras actively advocated that WM Capital not be allowed to participate in any way\" in the eviction and arbitration proceedings, \"arguing that WM Capital would have its day in court once the underlying proceeding was complete.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 26\n   </strong>\n   at 5-6. And, as the arbitrator's decision clearly states, she excluded plaintiff and Scotiabank from participating in the arbitration proceedings because they did not have a claim under the Deed of Lease. The arbitrator explained that her jurisdiction was limited to arbitrating claims arising under the Deed of Lease between the signatories to the lease.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 27-29\n   </strong>\n   at 4;\n   <strong>\n    27-33\n   </strong>\n   at 3. Plaintiff's claim under Article 59(7), as explained by Barreras in its previous filings before this Court, was not ripe until the\n   arbitrator found Gables in breach of the Deed of Lease for failure to timely pay CRIM.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 15-1\n   </strong>\n   at 2-4. Barreras has further asserted that plaintiff's Article 59(7) claim was not ripe until the appeals process over the arbitration award had concluded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Thus, as Barreras is well aware, neither plaintiff nor its Article 59(7) claim were part of the arbitration and state court proceedings. There is not even a general discussion of liens and encumbrances over the Citi Towers Complex in the arbitration decision. Accordingly, the necessary identity of claims and parties is not present to trigger res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Likewise, as presumably understood by Barreras given its opposition to plaintiff's and Scotiabank's participation in the arbitration proceedings, arbitration agreements are generally not binding on parties \"not mentioned in the written agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4 Am.

Barreras claims that although plaintiff was \"a mortgagee with subrogation rights under Art. 59(7),\" plaintiff lost those rights upon the finalization of the arbitration award.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 28. The Court has already rejected this argument. Alternatively, Barreras raises several arguments attempting to undermine the legitimacy of plaintiff's rights as creditor and, presumably, thereby negate the applicability of Article 59(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, Barreras suggests that the Deed of Lease prohibited the lessee from mortgaging the lease and that this prohibition is, in fact, why the arbitrator denied the mortgagees' requests to intervene or attend the arbitration proceedings.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 28-29;\n   <strong>\n    32-2\n   </strong>\n   . The clear language of the arbitrator's decisions refutes this assertion. Barreras also fails to identify where in the Deed of Lease its consent is mandated as a precondition for a tenant to mortgage its leasehold interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Loc. Civ. R. 56(e) (advising that assertions of fact not supported by record citations will be disregarded on summary judgment). And, it is hard to imagine that such an affirmative restriction on mortgaging would exist in the 1960 Deed of Lease where an \"essential condition\" to the agreement was that the lessee invest at least $ 1 million in constructing a commercial building on the parcel.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 27-4\n   </strong>\n   at 9-10. It is also doubtful that any such \"vice of consent\" would necessarily render the mortgages \"null, invalid or ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.R. Ports Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207905196\">\n    2011 WL 7905196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, Barreras suggests that because plaintiff acquired its creditor rights \"at a discounted price\" as a \"litigious credit,\" i.e., already in foreclosure proceedings initiated by Scotiabank, plaintiff's rights as a creditor under Article 59(7) are somehow undermined. Barreras argues that plaintiff's rights are further tarnished by the fact that Scotiabank acquired its rights after the FDIC closed R-G Bank.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 33;\n   <strong>\n    44-1\n   </strong>\n   at 15. Similarly, Barreras argues that because plaintiff is a sophisticated party, it knowingly took a calculated risk in acquiring Gables's mortgages, remarking that the Deed of Lease permits termination of \"its security status\n   as mortgagor\" upon the lessee's breach.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Barreras's reading of the Deed of Lease is unsupported by the plain language of the document and Barreras otherwise offers no legal support for these arguments. Additionally, the plain language of Article 59(7) provides no basis to infer that the means by which a creditor attains its rights are relevant to the statute's applicability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Barreras also cites section 13 of Article 59 as precluding plaintiff's argument.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 27-29, 33. While the parties do not provide a certified translation of the most-current enactment of that provision, Barreras suggests that the prior enactment contains negligible differences and plaintiff does not object.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 28 ;\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 39\n   </strong>\n   at 18. This statute enumerates another property right that is mortgageable under Puerto Rico law: \"[a] building built on another's land but without prejudice to the right of the owner of the land, and with the understanding that only the right that the builder has on the building is subject to such a lien.\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 30, \u00a7 2554(13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Barreras would have the Court believe that this provision renders plaintiff's mortgages over the leasehold and buildings a prejudicial interference with Barreras's title to the buildings.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 28, 33. This reasoning is circular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute is unhelpful to Barreras's position. As plaintiff concisely explained, the statute merely ensures that when \"the building and the land are separated items for recordation purposes,\" a mortgage on the building \"only covers the building and does not extend to the land.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 39\n   </strong>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Barreras next argues that Article 59(7) cannot be applied retroactively because the \"Mortgage Law in place when the lease was executed in 1960, did not allow for the mortgage of a lease agreement.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 44-1\n   </strong>\n   at 10-14.

Moreover, the plain language of Article 59(7) supports a contrary interpretation; for a leasehold to be mortgageable under the statute, it must allow the lessee to \"sell, assign, sublet\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   mortgage his/her right.\" The use of the conjunction \"or\" casts a wide net, suggesting a legislative intent to render mortgageable leaseholds that do not specifically address mortgage rights, such as long-term leases executed before Article 59(7)'s enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Barreras also argues for the first time in its surreply that plaintiff cannot invoke the protections of Article 59(7) because Scotiabank is \"as culpable as Gables in causing the lease to be terminated\" by failing to timely pay the property taxes itself.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 44-1\n   </strong>\n   at 9. This untimely argument is refuted by the plain language of Article 59(7). The statute does not identify the ability of a mortgagee to cure the lessee's default as an exception to subrogation. Rather, the statute requires only that the recorded lease be terminated \"due to causes attributable to the will of the lessee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Last, Barreras requests that the Court exercise its discretion to decline to issue a declaratory judgment.\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 30\n   </strong>\n   at 32.

Barreras does not make any arguments or cite any legal authority in support of abstention. Although this is a judicially-created doctrine of restraint that may be raised sua sponte, the Court notes that abstention \"is not an automatic rule applied whenever a federal court is faced with a doubtful issue of state law; it rather involves a discretionary exercise of a court's equity powers.
