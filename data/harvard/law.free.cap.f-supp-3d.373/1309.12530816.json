WILSON, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Tutor Perini Building Corp. (\"Tutor Perini\") brings this action against Southern California District Council of Laborers (\"SCDCL\") and Plaster Tenderers of Southern California Local Union 1414\n   (\"Local 1414\" and, collectively with SCDCL, \"Laborers\") to vacate an arbitration award. Tutor Perini and Laborers agreed to arbitrate a grievance from Laborers over Tutor Perini's violation of a subcontracting provision in a collective bargaining agreement between the parties. In the arbitration, Tutor Perini agreed to have the arbitrator decide the question of the arbitrator's own jurisdiction to hear Laborers' grievance. The arbitrator determined that he had jurisdiction and ruled in favor of Laborers on the substantive grievance, awarding damages to Laborers for Tutor Perini's subcontracting violation. For the reasons set forth below, the Court must uphold the arbitrator's award under the broad deference afforded to an arbitrator's substantive determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this litigation, Tutor Perini raises additional arguments for why the arbitrator's decision is invalid-namely, that the arbitrator's ruling is inconsistent with a prior proceeding in front of the National Labor Relations Board (the \"NLRB\" or the \"Board\"). As part of this argument, Tutor Perini asserted before the arbitrator and repeats before this Court that it is caught in a quandary between two competing collective bargaining agreements it signed, one with Laborers and one with Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and Local Unions in the Twelve Southern California Counties and Nevada Affiliated with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (\"Carpenters\"). However, as explained below, Tutor Perini's arguments mischaracterize the dilemma it faces regarding its obligations to both Carpenters and Laborers, and Tutor Perini misunderstands the scope of the prior proceedings in front of the Board upon which it relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties have stipulated to the pertinent facts in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21. Tutor Perini is an Arizona corporation and conducts business in California, including Los Angeles County. Tutor Perini served as the general contractor for the Pechanga Hotel Expansion Project (the \"Project\") in Temecula, California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Collective Bargaining Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Tutor Perini entered into collective bargaining agreements with two competing unions covering similar types of work. The first collective bargaining agreement is between Tutor Perini and SCDCL and its affiliated labor unions, including Local 1414 (the \"Laborers CBA\"). The operative document comprising the Laborers CBA and signed by both Tutor Perini and Laborers is the Laborers' Short-Form Agreement for the Construction Industry, Dkt. 21 Ex. 3 (the \"Short-Form Agreement\"), which incorporates by reference the multi-employer Construction Master Labor Agreements for the Eleven Southern California Counties and for San Diego County, including the Southern California Master Labor Agreement between Southern California General Contractors and SCDCL, Dkt. 21 Ex. 4 (the \"MLA\"), and the Plaster Tenders' Master Agreement between Western Wall and Ceiling Contractors Association, Inc., SCDCL and Local 1414, Dkt. 21 Ex. 5 (the \"MPA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Short-Form Agreement states that contractors shall not \"assign work covered by the Master Labor Agreements to employees represented by any other union.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3, Art. II \u00a7 C. The MLA similarly requires a contractor such as Tutor Perini, and its subcontractors, to subcontract work falling under Laborers' jurisdiction only to workers that are a party to a labor agreement with Laborers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4, Art. V \u00a7 C. Subcontractors are defined in the MLA as \"any person (other than an employee\n   covered by this Agreement), firm or corporation\" who agrees to subcontract certain work for a general contractor. Dkt. 21 Ex. 4, Art. V \u00a7 B. Covered work under the MLA includes \"[a]ll work necessary to tend all other building trades craftsmen,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Art. I \u00a7 F.1, and all work performed by plaster tenders,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Art. I \u00a7 I. The term \"Plaster Tenders,\" in turn, is defined in the MPA to mean workers \"serving plasterers in any capacity,\" and plaster tenders are specifically tasked with \"tend[ing] [to] the plasterer in performing all ... fireproofing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5, Art. XV \u00a7 B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Laborers CBA sets forth grievance and arbitration procedures between the parties for all disputes. The Short-Form Agreement, which adjusts the grievance process set forth in the MLA, requires arbitration of all grievances or disputes between Tutor Perini and Laborers, including jurisdictional disputes and misassignments of work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3, Art. III \u00a7 A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Short-Form Agreement gives the arbitrator authority to issue a final and binding decision regarding the dispute, and in the event of a misassignment of work or subcontracting violation, the arbitrator is directed to issue an injunction to prevent continuing or future violations and shall award damages to Laborers equivalent to the lost wages of its members based on the employer's wrongful failure to hire those members for the contracting work at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3, Art. III \u00a7 B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Tutor Perini is also a signatory to a second collective bargaining agreement with Carpenters. The relevant provision of the collective bargaining agreement between Tutor Perini and Carpenters (the \"Carpenters CBA\") governing the scope of covered work is Section 105.1.1, which states that Carpenters members are entitled to perform all drywall work, including \"all work in connection with the installation ... of all materials and component parts of wall and partitions ... including but not limited to ... fireproofing of beams and columns, fire proofing of chase, sound and thermal insulation materials ... and all other necessary or related work in connection therewith.\" Dkt. 21 Ex. G, \u00a7 105.1.1. Per Section 503 of the Carpenters CBA, Tutor Perini, or any of its subcontractors, shall not \"subcontract any work to be done at the site of construction ... coming within the jurisdiction of the Carpenters except to a person, firm or corporation party to an appropriate current labor agreement with the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 503.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the language of each agreement, there is a clear potential for overlap between the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA regarding plaster tendering work-which the Court herein will refer to as \"fireproofing support work.\" On the one hand, the Laborers CBA claims a right to work that \"serves plasterers in any capacity,\" which includes tending to plasterers that perform fireproofing. On the other hand, the Carpenters CBA claims a right to \"all other necessary or related work in connection\" with fireproofing, which plausibly covers the same plaster tendering work in support of the fireproofing craftsmen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The presence of conflict over fireproofing support work presents a significant problem for Tutor Perini. As the general contractor, Tutor Perini is obligated to ensure that it subcontracts work covered by each union's collective bargaining agreement to a signatory with that agreement,\n   so that the respective union's employees are guaranteed to receive the covered work. But when it is unclear which union's agreement should cover disputed work, Tutor Perini could theoretically face scrutiny for its subcontracting decision from whichever union was not assigned the disputed work by the subcontractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nevertheless, Tutor Perini's problem is diminished by the fact that the collective bargaining agreements are not in conflict regarding the actual fireproofing work itself. Carpenters expressly claims jurisdiction over fireproofing, while Laborers only claims work in support of craftsmen and disclaims jurisdiction over the work to be performed by the craftsmen themselves. Thus, the only potential jurisdictional question in this case is which union would perform the ancillary work\n   <em>\n    in support of\n   </em>\n   the fireproofing craftsmen if both the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA were applicable to the same employer. Accordingly, when hiring a fireproofing subcontractor, Tutor Perini is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   obligated under the Carpenters CBA to select a subcontractor that is a signatory to an agreement with Carpenters, so that Carpenters-represented employees are assigned the actual fireproofing work. On the other hand, Tutor Perini will never be required to select a fireproofing subcontractor that is\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   a signatory with Laborers, because Laborers would not be entitled to the actual fireproofing work under the terms of the Laborers CBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Therefore, the essence of Tutor Perini's true dilemma between the two collective bargaining agreements is whether it should (1) hire a fireproofing subcontractor that is only a Carpenters signatory so that the subcontractor assigns the fireproofing support work to Carpenters-represented employees, or (2) hire a fireproofing subcontractor that is both a Carpenters signatory and a Laborers signatory so that the subcontractor may assign the fireproofing support work to Laborers instead. If the two unions make competing claims to the subcontractor for the same fireproofing support work, then the\n   <em>\n    subcontractor\n   </em>\n   , not Tutor Perini, would be the entity responsible for deciding the jurisdictional dispute through the agreements' grievance processes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 21 Ex. 4, Art. 5 \u00a7 F (the Laborers CBA requiring subcontractors to \"accept[ ] and agree[ ] to be bound by the procedures for settling jurisdictional disputes as set forth in\" the agreement);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, \u00a7 506 (the Carpenters CBA requiring the same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Pechanga Hotel Expansion Project Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As general contractor for the Project, Tutor Perini received competing bids for the subcontractor for the fireproofing work. The first bidder, Standard Drywall, Inc. (\"SDI\"), was a signatory to the Carpenters CBA but was not a signatory to the Laborers CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Ex. 9, at 1. The second bidder, KHS &amp; S Contractors (\"KHS &amp; S\"), was a signatory to both the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Ex. 10, at 1. Because KHS &amp; S was a signatory to both unions, Tutor Perini\n   could have satisfied its subcontracting obligations under each respective collecting bargaining agreement by hiring KHS &amp; S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nevertheless, SDI's bid for the fireproofing work was lower than the bid placed by KHS &amp; S, and Tutor Perini selected SDI as the fireproofing subcontractor for the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Exs. 9, 10. Tutor Perini and SDI then entered into a subcontract agreement which was dated June 28, 2016 and fully executed on November 17, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 11. The subcontract agreement covered \"Spray Fireproofing\" throughout the Project and \"Drywall, Insulation &amp; Firestopping\" at the podium, spa, and pool buildings at the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The subcontracting agreement also made SDI \"responsible for jurisdiction disputes and claims by crafts over work included in this subcontract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By hiring SDI, Tutor Perini satisfied its obligations under the Carpenters CBA to select a fireproofing subcontractor signatory to the Carpenters CBA. SDI, in turn, hired its employees represented by Carpenters to perform fireproofing and \"all other necessary or related work in connection therewith.\" Dkt. 21 Ex. G, \u00a7 105.1.1. Accordingly, because SDI was not a signatory to the Laborers CBA, Laborers employees were not assigned the fireproofing support work at the Project, work which they purportedly would have received had a fireproofing subcontractor signatory to the Laborers CBA been hired by Tutor Perini.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Ex. 4, Art. I \u00a7\u00a7 F.1, I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After Tutor Perini hired SDI, on January 18, 2017, Laborers sent a letter to Tutor Perini notifying Tutor Perini that it was lodging a grievance related to Tutor Perini's hiring of SDI, a non-member of Laborers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1. Laborers requested that Tutor Perini remove SDI as the fireproofing subcontractor and instead hire a subcontractor that was a signatory to an agreement with Laborers, along with a payment of wages and fringe benefits for all work performed by SDI on the Project that would have been covered by the Laborers CBA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. If Tutor Perini failed to replace SDI, Laborers stated its intent to seek damages for all work performed by SDI on the Project covered by the Laborers CBA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tutor Perini responded to the letter on January 26, 2017 and requested that Laborers withdraw its grievance, stating that Laborers' grievance is really a competing claim to the same fireproofing support work between Laborers and Carpenters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2. In its letter, Tutor Perini claimed that its decision to hire SDI \"was consistent with precedence set for this work in recent history within this project's jurisdictional boundaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Consistent with the provisions of the Laborers CBA, the parties agreed to submit to arbitration, selected an arbitrator, and participated in an arbitration hearing on July 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 12. On February 6, 2018, the arbitrator issued an award in favor of Laborers (the \"Award\"), finding that Tutor Perini violated the Laborers CBA by failing to award the subcontract to a member of Laborers and enjoining Tutor Perini from continuing or future violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 at 13-14. The arbitrator also awarded damages in the amount of $ 199,214 to Laborers and $ 118,420 to Laborers' trust fund.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Tutor Perini initiated the instant action and filed a motion to vacate the Award pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Tutor Perini appears to raise three independent grounds for vacatur of the Award. First, Tutor Perini characterizes the competing unions' claims to subcontracting under each union's respective collective bargaining agreement with Tutor Perini as a \"jurisdictional dispute\" which can only be heard by the Board pursuant to a proceeding under Section 10(k) of the National\n   Labor Relations Act (the \"NLRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20160\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k). Tutor Perini argues that both Laborers and Carpenters claim a right to the fireproofing support work to be performed by the subcontractor's employees, which makes their dispute one for the Board, and accordingly the arbitrator had no authority to make such a determination. Second, Tutor Perini argues that the Award conflicts with a prior \u00a7 10(k) determination by the Board, which awarded plastering work to employees of SDI represented by Carpenters. Tutor Perini argues that, under the Ninth Circuit's \"supremacy doctrine,\" the Award directly conflicts with the Board's prior ruling, thus rendering the Award void. Lastly, under the same reasoning as the second argument, Tutor Perini seems to argue that the Award violates public policy because it directly conflicts with a prior Board determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Arbitrability of the Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Tutor Perini argues that it was caught in a \"quintessential jurisdictional dispute\" regarding fireproofing support work between the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA, a dispute which requires a \u00a7 10(k) determination by the Board. Dkt. 23 at 1. Tutor Perini asserts that, if Tutor Perini hired a subcontractor other than SDI that was a signatory to the Laborers CBA, Tutor Perini's failure to subcontract to a signatory of an agreement with Carpenters would amount to a violation of the Carpenters CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Ex. G, \u00a7 503. Tutor Perini thus claims that \"no matter to which union's employees [Tutor Perini] chose to subcontract[ ] the work, the other union would have sought relief under its collective bargaining agreement for [Tutor Perini]'s failure to direct that work to its union's employees.\" Dkt. 23 at 1. Tutor Perini raised this argument during the arbitration, asserting that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to decide a dispute that was actually jurisdictional in nature and amounted to an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D), requiring a \u00a7 10(k) determination from the Board. In making this argument, Tutor Perini did not object to the arbitrator's authority to decide this threshold dispute regarding the arbitrator's jurisdiction, and Tutor Perini did not argue the substantive question of whether Tutor Perini breached the Laborers CBA by failing to hire a fireproofing subcontractor signatory to the Laborers CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The scope of arbitration is a matter of contract, and accordingly \"parties may agree to submit even the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator for decision.\"\n   <em>\n    George Day Const.

Accordingly, the Court must give due deference to the arbitrator's determinations on the merits in the Award and reject Tutor Perini's argument that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to decide the arbitrability of the subcontracting dispute, even if the subcontracting grievance could have been brought before the Board under\n   \u00a7 10(k) as a jurisdictional dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Laborers correctly points out that Tutor Perini could have taken one of several steps to preserve independent judicial scrutiny of the arbitrator's jurisdiction to decide the subcontracting dispute. First, Tutor Perini could have refused to arbitrate the matter entirely, which would have required Laborers to compel arbitration under \u00a7 301.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George Day\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10618765\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1471/#p1474\">\n    722 F.2d at 1476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Third, Tutor Perini could have proactively filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief prior to consenting to arbitration, allowing a district court to make an independent determination of the arbitrability of the dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10618765\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1471/#p1474\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10618765\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1471/#p1474\">\n    at 1476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Once Laborers refused to resolve the subcontracting grievance as a jurisdictional dispute, Tutor Perini could have taken any one of the options described above to circumvent a binding arbitration decision regarding the arbitrator's jurisdiction over the subcontracting grievance. Instead of taking any such action, Tutor Perini wholly consented to arbitration and authorized the arbitrator to decide his own jurisdiction. After an unfavorable ruling by the arbitrator, Tutor Perini cannot now seek the Court to review independently the arbitrator's determinations on the merits of the parties' dispute, which-as submitted to the arbitrator-included the question of the arbitrator's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George Day\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10618765\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1471/#p1474\">\n    722 F.2d at 1476-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (deferring to an arbitrator's jurisdictional ruling because \"[t]he parties have delegated that decision to the arbitrator and we may not 'second-guess' him\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    W.R.

Laborers did not claim entitlement to the fireproofing support work once SDI was chosen as the fireproofing subcontractor for the Project. Laborers did not, and does not, threaten to strike if Tutor Perini fails to subcontract any portion of the fireproofing work to Laborers-represented subcontractors. In fact, Laborers did not take any labor action in response to Tutor Perini selecting SDI over KHS &amp; S for the Project. Nor could Laborers have taken any such action against Tutor Perini in response to the subcontracting violation, as the MLA provides that Laborers \"shall not have the right to use strike or any other economic action to enforce any provisions of this Article on subcontracting.\" Dkt. 21 Ex. 4, Art. V \u00a7 E. In the absence of any true claim by Laborers to the fireproofing support work for the Project, the subcontracting dispute was purely a financial one for contract damages, rooted only in the collective bargaining agreement duly executed by Tutor Perini and Laborers. And, as the precedent cited above shows, the Board has consistently taken the position that it has no authority to adjudicate a purely financial subcontracting dispute because the violation of a subcontracting provision in a contract, without adverse economic action by the aggrieved union, does not constitute an \"unfair labor practice\" under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miron Const.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20N.L.R.B.%2099\">\n    320 N.L.R.B. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Local 32\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that the Board's decision awarding work of a subcontractor to one union directly conflicted with an arbitrator's decision awarding time-in-lieu payments against the\n   <em>\n    same employer\n   </em>\n   to the union that lost before the Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local 32\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18334\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/773/1012/#p1016\">\n    773 F.2d at 1014, 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the subcontracting grievance between Tutor Perini and Laborers only affected Tutor Perini as the general contractor and did not result in an award of damages against SDI, the subcontractor, for failing to hire Laborers employees to perform contracting work. In\n   <em>\n    J.F.

It is true that, in the event that a Carpenters-backed subcontractor vies with a Laborers-backed subcontractor for the same fireproofing support work on a project, Tutor Perini may be \"a single employer caught between the conflicting demands of two or more unions\" if it cannot hire a subcontractor that is a signatory to both collective bargaining agreements.\n   <em>\n    Local 701\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10604702\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/529/1395/\">\n    529 F.2d at 1397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that is plainly not the predicament Tutor Perini faces under the two collective bargaining agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As explained above, both Laborers and Carpenters agree that the substantive fireproofing work is covered under the Carpenters CBA but not the Laborers CBA. This means that, per the terms of the Carpenters CBA, Tutor Perini is obligated to hire a fireproofing subcontractor that is a signatory with Carpenters to ensure that Carpenters-represented employees are assigned the substantive fireproofing work. Tutor Perini's hiring of a subcontractor that is not a signatory to an agreement with Carpenters would be a clear violation of the Carpenters CBA solely on the basis that Tutor Perini did not subcontract the\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   fireproofing work to a Carpenters signatory. Such a subcontracting violation\n   would be wholly irrespective of any potential jurisdictional overlap between Carpenters and Laborers over the fireproofing\n   <em>\n    support\n   </em>\n   work. Thus, because Tutor Perini must always hire a Carpenters signatory as a subcontractor for substantive fireproofing work, Tutor Perini's subcontracting decision will necessarily be between a Carpenters-only subcontractor and a Carpenters-and-Laborers subcontractor. Since both bidders are signatories with Carpenters, Tutor Perini complies with the Carpenters CBA no matter who it hires as the subcontractor, and Carpenters would have no occasion to file a subcontracting grievance solely on the basis of jurisdictional overlap regarding the fireproofing support work. As a result, there is no true conflict between the Carpenters CBA and the Laborers CBA regarding Tutor Perini's\n   <em>\n    subcontracting\n   </em>\n   obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The instant case is an example of how the above principles are applied to reveal that Tutor Perini was not between a rock and a hard place when receiving the fireproofing bids for the Project. KHS &amp; S, the other subcontractor that bid on the fireproofing work at issue, indicated on its bid form that it was a signatory to an agreement both with Laborers and with Carpenters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Ex. 10, at 1 (on KHS &amp; S's bid form, under the Union Status header, checking \"Yes\" on the line for \"Signatory\" and writing \"Local Carpenters, Tapers, Laborers\" as the Local #). Even if there are questions regarding jurisdiction over fireproofing support work between the Carpenters CBA and the Laborers CBA, Tutor Perini could have satisfied its subcontracting obligations to both unions by hiring KHS &amp; S, which represented that it was a signatory to both agreements. By hiring KHS &amp; S, Tutor Perini would not have been exposed to a subcontracting grievance from Carpenters, because Tutor Perini would have subcontracted all work covered by the Carpenters CBA to a subcontractor signatory to an agreement with Carpenters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Because the subcontractor is the entity that actually assigns the fireproofing support work, the subcontractor-and not Tutor Perini-is responsible for any disputes between unions over work assignments. The terms of the subcontracting agreement between Tutor Perini and SDI would have required KHS &amp; S, as the subcontractor, to be responsible for any jurisdictional disputes by virtue of being a signatory to both the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21 Ex. 11, at 2 (\"Subcontractor will be responsible for jurisdiction disputes and claims by crafts over work included in this subcontract and shall not employ labor or means in performance of any work that is the subject of this subcontract which may cause strikes, work stoppages or any disturbances by\" the subcontractor's employees). By making the subcontractor responsible for a jurisdictional dispute over fireproofing support work, Tutor Perini would be insulated from involvement in any proceedings to resolve the dispute between the unions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Thus, by hiring KHS &amp; S, Tutor Perini not only would have satisfied its subcontracting obligations to both unions but also could have potentially triggered a\n   <em>\n    true\n   </em>\n   jurisdictional dispute regarding KHS &amp; S's employees over the fireproofing support work, leading to a full resolution between Carpenters and Laborers via arbitration\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   or by the Board in a \u00a7 10(k) proceeding. As noted above, KHS &amp; S as the subcontractor would have had the ability to file charges with the Board for unfair labor practices if any of KHS &amp; S's own employees represented by either Carpenters or Laborers engaged in a strike or withheld work on the basis that those employees should have received the fireproofing support work pursuant to their respective union's collective bargaining agreement. Having hired SDI instead of KHS &amp; S, Tutor Perini gave up that option.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In summary, Tutor Perini's choice between fireproofing subcontractors did not implicate competing claims to the underlying fireproofing support work at the employee level, which is necessary to amount to an unfair labor practice that triggers the Board's jurisdiction. Instead, the decision Tutor Perini faced was simply who it should hire as a subcontractor for fireproofing work, and Tutor Perini's options were constrained by Tutor Perini's voluntary decision to enter into collective bargaining agreements with both Laborers and Carpenters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capitol Drilling Supplies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20N.L.R.B.%20809\">\n    318 N.L.R.B. at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a general contractor's inability to initiate a \u00a7 10(k) proceeding before the Board in regard to a subcontracting grievance \"will encourage general contractors to abide by lawful signatory clauses in agreements into which they have voluntarily entered\"). Laborers' subcontracting dispute merely seeks to hold Tutor Perini responsible for its decision to hire SDI based on Tutor Perini's contractual obligations under the Laborers CBA, without threatening to interrupt the actual fireproofing work to be performed at the project site. Therefore, the subcontracting dispute before the arbitrator was not a jurisdictional dispute that could be resolved by the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Application of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to the Award\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Because the subcontracting dispute at issue in the arbitration was not a jurisdictional dispute for the Board to consider in a \u00a7 10(k) determination, it is clear to the Court that the supremacy doctrine does not apply to void the Award at issue in this case. In the Award, the arbitrator\n   did not order any portion of the fireproofing work at the Project to be assigned to Laborers-represented employees of SDI. Instead, the arbitrator awarded damages to Laborers for Tutor Perini's violation of the subcontracting provisions in the Laborers CBA. The arbitrator did not determine-let alone address the issue in the Award at all-that Laborers had a superior claim to SDI's plastering work. The arbitrator only resolved a\n   <em>\n    contractual\n   </em>\n   dispute between Tutor Perini and Laborers regarding the subcontracting clause, a dispute which was wholly independent from which employees of SDI were entitled to perform the fireproofing work-or even which union was entitled to receive the subcontracting of fireproofing work over the other. Neither did the arbitrator award damages to Laborers on the basis that Laborers-represented employees were not hired by SDI to perform the fireproofing support work, which would have expressly contradicted the Board's decision in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   awarding plastering work to SDI's Carpenters-represented employees. Thus, because the Award did not make any assignments of fireproofing support work and did not award Laborers damages on the ground that its employees were not hired by SDI, the Award does not conflict with\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   in any respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Nevertheless, even if the subcontracting dispute between Tutor Perini and Laborers\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   jurisdictional based on the apparent conflict between the claims to fireproofing support work in the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA, such a jurisdictional conflict would not implicate the Board's prior determination in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The issues in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   pertained only to which labor organization's employees were entitled to perform plastering work for SDI in light of SDI's collective bargaining agreement with Carpenters. Tutor Perini's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   as affirmatively requiring Tutor Perini to select SDI as the fireproofing subcontractor for the Project, at the exclusion of other subcontractors regardless of union affiliation, is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Analogous to\n   <em>\n    Local 701\n   </em>\n   , the Board's determination in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   only pertained to the dispute between labor organizations\n   <em>\n    regarding the subcontractor's employees.\n   </em>\n   The Board explicitly concluded that \"[e]mployees\n   <em>\n    of Standard Drywall, Inc.\n   </em>\n   represented by Southwest Regional Counsel of Carpenters are entitled to perform the work in dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20N.L.R.B.%201250\">\n    348 N.L.R.B. at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

However, the Board's determination applied only to SDI's own employees. SDI was the party filing the charge of unfair labor practices under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) against Local 200, meaning that the Board's determination was limited to which of SDI's employees were required to be assigned plastering work for any work SDI performed on public works projects. As in\n   <em>\n    Local 701\n   </em>\n   , nothing in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   imposed any affirmative obligation on the part of any general contractor, such as Tutor Perini, to hire SDI as a subcontractor for any project not yet assigned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local 701\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10604702\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/529/1395/\">\n    529 F.2d at 1398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nothing in the NLRB decision purports to prevent AGC members from complying with the AGC-Local 701 agreement.\").

The only parties that were bound by the Board's \u00a7 10(k) determinations were SDI, Carpenters, and Local 200, none of which is a party to the instant\n   subcontracting dispute. The Board's \u00a7 10(k) determination in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   only applied to Tutor Perini's decision in the sense that SDI, hired as the fireproofing subcontractor for the Project, was required to assign all plastering work to SDI's employees represented by Carpenters.\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   did not require Tutor Perini to select SDI as the fireproofing subcontractor over other subcontractors; had Tutor Perini chosen a different subcontractor for that work, the Board's determinations regarding SDI's employees would not be implicated at all. Thus, while\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   protects SDI as the employer from challenges to the jurisdiction of SDI's Carpenters-represented employees over plastering work,\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   does not speak to the obligations of general contractors such as Tutor Perini when selecting between SDI or other plastering subcontractors for any particular project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Importantly,\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   also did not purport to resolve the potential overlap between the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA regarding fireproofing support work. SDI, the party filing the unfair labor practice charge, was only a signatory to an agreement with Carpenters and had no written agreement with Local 200. Local 200 argued before the Board that its represented employees of SDI should be entitled to the disputed plastering work \"based on the factors of area and industry practice, and economy and efficiency of operations\" and irrespective of SDI's existing written agreement with Carpenters.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20N.L.R.B.%201250\">\n    348 N.L.R.B. at 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, not only did the Board limit the scope of its ruling to SDI's employees, but it did not even reach the substantive question that Tutor Perini argues was conclusively decided in Carpenters' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, as Laborers points out in its opposition to Tutor Perini's motion to vacate the Award that the Project is not even subject to the broad order in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

The Board's determination in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   was limited in scope only to \"[p]lastering work at the\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   works projects.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20N.L.R.B.%201250\">\n    348 N.L.R.B. at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Court is inclined to believe that, even if\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   did mandate Tutor Perini to hire SDI specifically for public works projects generally, Tutor Perini would not have been obligated to do so for the Project, which is an expansion of a\n   <em>\n    private\n   </em>\n   hotel. The arbitrator did not address this question in the Award, suggesting that the parties did not raise it in the arbitration. Nevertheless, the Court views the scope of the broad order in\n   <em>\n    SDI II\n   </em>\n   as covering only public works projects to be another basis to find that the supremacy doctrine is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In conclusion, Tutor Perini's argument that the Award conflicts with the Board's prior \u00a7 10(k) determination is without merit. The Award resolved a contractual dispute between Tutor Perini and Laborers, separate and apart from a jurisdictional dispute between Laborers and Carpenters over which union should be assigned fireproofing support work.

As analyzed above, the Award does not contradict, directly or indirectly, any prior \u00a7 10(k) determination made by the Board regarding SDI's employees. The subcontracting dispute is wholly independent from any jurisdictional claims from competing unions over which employees of SDI have the right to perform certain plastering work. As in\n   <em>\n    Sea-Land\n   </em>\n   , the Award relies on the same reasoning that the Board has consistently followed regarding the interpretation of a subcontracting grievance, even though the Award reaches the outcome that Tutor Perini violated the Laborers CBA by subcontracting fireproofing work to a non-Laborers subcontractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Tutor Perini has not articulated an explicit, well defined public policy that directly contravenes any of the arbitrator's determinations\n   in the Award.

Therefore, Laborers' request for an extension to file a motion for attorneys' fees is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Court acknowledges the position in which Tutor Perini found itself when faced with a choice between two potentially irreconcilable collective bargaining agreements with competing unions regarding fireproofing support work. However, as the general contractor, Tutor Perini is not the entity responsible for making decisions regarding contested work assignments-that responsibility falls upon the subcontractors Tutor Perini hires. As long as Tutor Perini complies with the rest of the provisions of its collective bargaining agreements with the unions, Tutor Perini is protected from any jurisdictional disputes at the employee level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Despite being insulated from jurisdictional disputes as the general contractor, Tutor Perini brought the instant dilemma upon itself by hiring SDI, a Carpenters-only subcontractor, instead of KHS &amp; S, a Carpenters-and-Laborers subcontractor, in violation of its subcontracting obligations to Laborers under the Laborers CBA. Tutor Perini knew that, based on its subcontracting obligations to both unions, Tutor Perini would be exposed to a grievance from Laborers any time it hired a non-Laborers subcontractor for fireproofing. Now, Tutor Perini must bear the costs of its decision. In this case, the only issue before the Court was to determine whether the arbitrator's Award finding that Tutor Perini committed a subcontracting violation should be upheld. As set forth above, the Court resolves that question in the affirmative, particularly in light of the highly deferential standard of review applicable to arbitral awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Tutor Perini's concern about overlapping claims to fireproofing support work between its agreements with Laborers and Carpenters was not Tutor Perini's responsibility as the general contractor and is simply not at issue before the Court. Tutor Perini was not allowed to disregard the subcontracting provision in the Laborers CBA based on its erroneous interpretation of a prior \u00a7 10(k) determination by the Board as holding that the Carpenters CBA covers fireproofing support work at the exclusion of the Laborers CBA. While the Court believes there may be merit to Tutor Perini's concern that a jurisdictional dispute exists between the Laborers CBA and the Carpenters CBA regarding fireproofing support work, that question is not germane to the Court's responsibility to confirm or vacate the arbitrator's Award resolving Laborers' subcontracting grievance. If Tutor Perini's motivation behind these proceedings is for a final resolution regarding which union should have jurisdiction over fireproofing support work moving forward, Tutor Perini will need to pursue closure on the jurisdictional question another day; until then, Tutor Perini may remain liable for violations of its subcontracting duties by failing to hire a fireproofing subcontractor that is a signatory with both Carpenters and Laborers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons articulated above, the Court finds that the Award does\n   not conflict with any prior \u00a7 10(k) determinations made by the Board, and the Award must be upheld and confirmed.

There is no evidence in the record that would allow the Court to determine whether it would be feasible or practicable for Tutor Perini to accept separate bids for fireproofing work and fireproofing support work; the Court's explanation here merely illustrates the nature of the bids Tutor Perini actually received for fireproofing work in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    At the hearing on the parties' motions to confirm or vacate the Award, the Court requested supplemental briefing on the issue of the arbitrator's authority to decide his own jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 24.

III \u00a7 A (the Short-Form Agreement requiring arbitration of all grievances or disputes between signatories, including jurisdictional disputes). When Tutor Perini responded to Laborers' demand letter and characterized the subcontracting dispute as a jurisdictional claim to the same work between Laborers and Carpenters, Dkt. 21 Ex. 2, nothing prevented Laborers from agreeing to arbitrate that jurisdictional claim with Carpenters directly. Nevertheless, Laborers was not required to arbitrate that question voluntarily in order to resolve Tutor Perini's subcontracting violation, and Laborers chose not to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Once the jurisdictional dispute is conclusively resolved, either by the unions themselves or by the Board in a \u00a7 10(k) proceeding, Tutor Perini would have clarity as to which collective bargaining agreement covers fireproofing support work over the other, where both agreements overlap. For instance, a broad determination by the Board regarding which union has jurisdiction over fireproofing support work would protect Tutor Perini from liability for subcontracting grievances; if the union that lost before the Board sought to enforce an arbitration award for a subcontracting grievance by claiming that the work was covered by the losing union's collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator's award in that union's favor may be invalidated under the supremacy doctrine as directly conflicting with the Board's \u00a7 10(k) determination. Moreover, Tutor Perini could bring a charge before the Board for the union's pursuit of arbitration over a conflicting subcontracting grievance, and if the Board agreed with Tutor Perini and found that the union committed an unfair labor practice, the Board in its \u00a7 10(k) determination could enjoin the union from pursuing any concurrent arbitration proceedings inconsistent with the Board's jurisdictional mandate.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     SDI III\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20N.L.R.B.%201921\">\n     357 N.L.R.B. at 1925\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (requiring union to cease and desist from efforts to enforce arbitration awards that conflict with prior Board determinations).
