Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sherry Lynn Johnston's elderly mother, Willie Jo Mills, died in a nursing home. Johnston alleges that Mills received improper and negligent care that led to her death. Johnston asserted a long list of claims against a number of defendants, all of whom she alleged played some role in hastening or causing Mills's death. The defendants moved to dismiss and, based on those motions, the court dismissed each defendant except for David Dexel and Judge Christine Butts. Johnston's only remaining claims are fiduciary-duty breach against Dexel and \"gross neglect,\" TEX. EST. CODE \u00a7 1201.003, against Judge Butts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dexel and Judge Butts have each moved for summary judgment. Dexel argues that he did not have a fiduciary relationship with Johnston; that Johnston lacks capacity to assert Mills's survival claims under Texas law; and that Johnston has not submitted or identified evidence showing that Dexel breached any fiduciary duty he owed to Johnston or Mills. Judge Butts argues that Johnston lacks capacity to sue under Texas Estates Code \u00a7 1201.003 and that Johnston has not submitted or identified evidence supporting an inference that Judge Butts acted with gross neglect in failing to reasonably perform her duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Johnston responded that: she has capacity to assert Mills's survival claims against Dexel because the estate administration has been closed; Mills and Dexel were in a fiduciary relationship; and Dexel violated fiduciary duties owed to Mills. As to Judge Butts, Johnston argued that: the Texas Estates Code, \u00a7 1201.003, provides a cause of action to any person who is \"damaged\" by a probate judge's gross neglect, and that the evidence submitted with her second\n   amended complaint supports an inference that Judge Butts did act with gross neglect. Judge Butts and Dexel both replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court ordered briefing on whether the case should be remanded given that all Johnston's federal-law claims have been dismissed. Dexel and Judge Butts opposed remand, but Johnston endorsed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on a careful review of the second amended complaint, the court's prior rulings, the motions, the responses, the replies, the supplemental briefing, the record evidence, and the applicable law, summary judgment is granted for Judge Butts. The court finds that the statutory and common-law factors favor remanding the remainder of the action to the 253rd Judicial District Court of Liberty County, Texas. The reasons are explained in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1999, Mills had a stroke that paralyzed the right side of her body, leaving her unable to work. Mills had another stroke in 2007, which severely impaired her motor abilities and left her in need of fulltime living assistance. In 2008 and 2009, four doctors separately examined Mills and found that she had moderate to severe dementia, concluding that she could not make reasonable decisions or care for herself. (Docket Entry No. 10-12 at 25-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2008, Johnston and her sister, Cindy Pierce, sued their brother, Larry Mills, for converting Mills's property and financial assets. A court investigator's June 2008 report found that Johnston was Mills's preferred guardian. A year later, the presiding probate judge appointed Howard Reiner as Mills's attorney ad litem and David Dexel as temporary guardian of the person and estate. Johnston, Pierce, and Larry Mills signed a family settlement agreement. As part of that agreement, the probate judge appointed Dexel as Mills's guardian of the person on a continuing basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dexel hired Ginger Lott and GSL Care Management, LLC to manage Mills's care. Between 2009 and 2012, Johnston frequently visited Mills at Silverado, the nursing home where Mills resided. In 2012, Silverado changed management, and Johnston perceived a decline in the quality of Mills's care. Beginning in 2012 and into 2013, Johnston complained to Dexel about her mother's care. Mills was hospitalized several times with urinary tract infections. Johnston complained that the infections resulted from poor medical care, but Dexel did not move Mills to a different nursing home. The relationship between Johnston and Dexel deteriorated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2013, Dexel moved Mills to a section of Silverado that provided high-level care. According to the second amended complaint, this section's residents had behavioral issues and were aggressive toward Mills. That month, Johnston's protests about how Silverado was treating Mills led it to ban Johnston from the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June 2013, Mills fell out of her wheelchair, breaking several bones in her right leg. Dexel discontinued Mills's physical therapy during her recuperation. Johnston alleges that this made Mills's muscle problems worse. That same month, Dexel allegedly made an \"illegal,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   , oral motion\"-that he filed in writing in the public records of the probate court three days later-to have Clarinda Comstock appointed as Mills's guardian ad litem. (Docket Entry No. 38 at 23 ). Judge Butts, the presiding probate judge, granted the motion, instructing Comstock to investigate Mills's condition and treatment and to report her findings to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mills continued to deteriorate. By September 2013, she could no longer hold a\n   cup or fork, had lost 30 to 40 pounds, and suffered from recurring urinary tract infections. Johnston continued to demand that Dexel move Mills to a different nursing home and threatened to ask the court to remove Dexel as Mills's guardian. In response, Dexel filed an application to resign and to have the court appoint a successor guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 13, 2013, Dexel notified the interested parties-including Johnston-of a hearing set for September 24, 2013. On September 16, 2013, Comstock filed a report about Mills's condition and treatment, finding that \"Ms. Mills has had good care and has enjoyed living at Silverado Kingwood since moving there in 2009, and she has become close to many of the staff members and other residents.\" (Docket Entry No. 10-12 at 1). Comstock concluded that moving Mills \"would be very difficult at the current stage of life of this very fragile woman.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But at that time, Silverado had \"made the decision that Ms. Mills may not remain in their facility due to the on-going disruptions caused by Ms. Johnston's behavior when visiting Ms. Mills and by postings made online.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Because of Mills's eviction and Dexel's resignation, Comstock recommended that the court \"immediately\" appoint \"a successor third-party guardian\" to \"locate an appropriate residential facility for Ms. Mills to ensure her safety and well being,\" considering \"as much as possible her medical, social[,] and emotional needs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Johnston alleges that on September 17-one week before the probate-court hearing date-Dexel, Lott, Comstock, and Judge Butts had an \"illegal,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   meeting,\" during which Judge Butts accepted Dexel's resignation and appointed Lott as Mills's successor guardian. (Docket Entry No. 38 at 31 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2013, Lott moved Mills from Silverado to the Hampton Nursing Home. In December 2013, Pierce filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order, alleging that Lott was neglecting Mills's care and that she needed to be immediately removed from the guardian position. (Docket Entry Nos. 10-13-10-14). Less than two weeks later, Judge Butts held a hearing at which Johnston and Pierce testified as to Mills's care, and the parties presented argument. (Docket Entry No. 10-15). The court found no basis to immediately remove Lott, but directed the parties to submit a docket-control order to try the issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126, 138, 151-53). During the hearing, Johnston, Pierce, and Lott reached an agreement that Johnston and Pierce would receive regular updates on Mills's care and that Johnston's visitation rights would be reinstated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Johnston alleges that, in March 2014, Mills's doctor advised Lott that Mills needed to see a cardiologist and an endocrinologist, but Lott failed to set up the appointments. The following month, April 2014, Johnston sent Lott a text message stating that Mills \"was delirious and unresponsive with pus in her catheter\" and needed to go to the emergency room immediately. (Docket Entry No. 38 at 36-37 ). Lott did not respond to Johnston's text. Johnston called 911 and paramedics arrived in an ambulance. Lott allegedly told the Hampton's personnel to send the paramedics away and called a separate ambulance. Although Lott was the only person with legal authority to sign Mills into the hospital, Lott allegedly never went to the hospital, leaving Mills to sign herself in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In late April, Pierce filed a second emergency application for a temporary restraining order against Lott which, similar to the first emergency application, alleged that Lott was neglecting Mills's care. (Docket\n   Entry No. 10-16). Sherrie Fox, Judge Butt's guardianship coordinator, informed Johnston's and Pierce's counsel that the \"court will not be scheduling a hearing on the [second emergency application]\" because the \"court does not see an emergency and the case will be tried within two weeks.\" (Docket Entry No. 38-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 27, 2014, while the guardianship dispute remained ongoing, Mills died. Johnston alleges that she died of starvation after Lott ordered the nursing home staff to withhold food and give Mills nothing but prunes, water, and thickened water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Johnston sued in the 253rd Judicial District Court of Liberty County, Texas, in September 2016. The defendants removed to federal court, Johnston filed an amended complaint, and the defendants moved to dismiss. (Docket Entry Nos. 1, 10, 17, 20, 21, 24). In August 2017, the court issued a Memorandum and Opinion granting in part the defendants' motions to dismiss and granting Johnston leave to file a second amended complaint as to some of the claims. (Docket Entry No. 32 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Johnston filed a second amended complaint; the defendants moved to dismiss; Johnston responded; the defendants replied; and Johnston sought leave to file a third amended complaint. (Docket Entry Nos. 38, 43, 45, 46, 47, 49, 52, 53, 56, 57-59, 61). In May 2018, the court issued a Memorandum and Opinion denying Johnston leave to amend and granting the defendants' motions to dismiss in part. (Docket Entry No. 67 ). The court granted Comstock's and Harris County's motions to dismiss, granted Dexel's motion to dismiss in part, and denied Judge Butts's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). These Memoranda and Opinions dismissed the federal-law claims, with prejudice. Two claims remained: a breach of fiduciary duty claim against Dexel, and a gross neglect claim against Judge Butts under Texas Estates Code \u00a7 1201.003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 13-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dexel and Judge Butts have each moved for summary judgment. (Docket Entry Nos. 78-79). Dexel argued that he had no fiduciary relationship with Johnston and that, even if he did, he had not breached one. (Docket Entry No. 79 at 9-11 ). Dexel contended that Johnston lacked the capacity to assert claims based on his fiduciary relationship with Mills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Assuming that Johnston could assert the claims, Dexel argued that she did not raise a genuine factual dispute material to finding no breach of any fiduciary duty to Mills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). According to Dexel, claim preclusion bars Johnston's claims because the probate court approved Dexel's actions and fee applications, and Johnston had an opportunity to contest them but did not do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Butts argued that Johnston lacked the capacity to sue her under Texas Estates Code \u00a7 1201.003 because she was not Mills's estate administrator. (Docket Entry No. 78 at 7-8 ). Even assuming that Johnston could sue, Judge Butts contended that Johnston had not submitted or identified evidence supporting an inference that Judge Butts acted with gross neglect in failing to perform her statutory duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Johnston responded that she had the capacity to sue Dexel because Mills's estate administration had closed in June 2015; that the documents submitted with her second amended complaint and Dexel's motion for summary judgment show a genuine factual dispute material to whether Dexel violated a fiduciary duty he owed to Mills; and that claim preclusion does not bar her claims. (Docket Entry No. 88 at 1-14 ). Johnston argues that there is a genuine factual dispute material to determining whether Judge Butts acted with gross neglect because she declined to hold hearings\n   on Lott's guardianship or on Mills's medical condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Johnston submitted a probate-court order that dropped Mills's estate administration from the court's \"active docket\" in June 2015, along with Dexel's final report and application to be discharged as guardian filed with the probate court, Judge Butts's approval of Dexel's final report, and a $ 100 bond Lott posted. (Docket Entry Nos. 88-2-88-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dexel and Judge Butts each replied. Dexel maintained that Johnston lacked the capacity to assert Mills's survival claims because she was not the estate executor, and because claim preclusion barred her challenge to Dexel's actions and fees. (Docket Entry No. 92 at 3 ). Dexel argued that Johnston's response referred to documents in the record without articulating how those documents supported an inference that he breached a fiduciary duty owed to either Johnston or Mills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Judge Butts argued that Johnston had not identified evidence supporting an inference that Judge Butts acted with gross neglect in declining to hold emergency hearings on Johnston's motions for a temporary restraining order in probate court. (Docket Entry No. 91 at 2 ). Judge Butts pointed out that she had held a hearing on the matters raised in Johnston's restraining-order applications, requested supplementary reports from Comstock, and set a docket-control order to try whether Lott should be removed as Mills's guardian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This court ordered supplemental briefing on whether the action should be remanded to state court. The court noted that Dexel's claim-preclusion defense raised an unsettled Texas-law question about the status of an \"interested person\" in Texas probate court. (Docket Entry No. 93 at 5-6 (quoting TEX. EST. CODE \u00a7 1002.018 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dexel, Judge Butts, and Johnston each briefed the remand issue. Dexel contended that the court should not remand because: the parties have sunk substantial time and expense into the litigation; the court is familiar with the facts and arguments; Johnston has not submitted or identified evidence that Dexel breached a fiduciary duty; and Johnston has asserted a survival claim, which only Mills's estate administrator may do under Texas law. (Docket Entry No. 95 at 2-5 ). Judge Butts also asked the court not to remand, pointing out that this litigation had consumed substantial time and expense, and contending that Johnston lacks the capacity to sue and has not identified evidence supporting an inference that Judge Butts acted with gross neglect. (Docket Entry No. 94 at 2-3 ). Johnston responded that the court should remand the case because \"there are important, difficult Texas law questions upon which the Texas Courts have not spoken that are issues which impact the ultimate resolution of this case.\" ( Docket Entry No. 96 at 1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The parties' arguments and responses are examined below in light of the record and the applicable legal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Supplemental Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A federal court that has original jurisdiction may exercise \"supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action\" that \"they form part of the same case or controversy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Counsel for the parties appeared for scheduling conferences, and the court entered docket-control orders after each conference. Trial was set for February 2019, but that time has come and gone.

And it seems like, you know, it's only recently after May 16 that things have really, you know, taken a turn for the worse. And so, hopefully, you know, we can, number one, my apology for not having a hearing when we appointed Ms. Lott, you know, just-that's our fault; it's not your fault; it's not your attorney's fault; it's not [Dexel's or Lott's] fault; it's our fault. You know, we should have, perhaps, thought it through a little bit better. But we were facing a woman that we felt like was being evicted from Silverado and had no placement, and she was losing her guardian. So, we considered that an emergency. And perhaps we should have been more open about the appointment of Ms. Lott.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Now I'm not saying that's what the statute requires, but I think that would have been the more human[e] and reasonable thing to do, and I'm sorry that we didn't do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131). Judge Butts later reiterated that she had the authority to appoint Lott as guardian without notice or a hearing, but that it was not \"the right thing to do,\" in hindsight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In September 2014, Judge Butts was confronted with Mills's fragile condition and her eviction from Silverado. Dexel had submitted his resignation, and Silverado refused to allow Johnston on its premises. Comstock had recommended that Judge Butts immediately appoint a third-party guardian to locate a new residence for Mills and to move her from Silverado. Judge Butts summarized the situation: \"I saw a family in disharmony. I saw a woman being evicted, and I saw an emergency need for placement. And I was told that this woman would probably not survive the transfer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Under these circumstances, Judge Butts found the necessity to name a new guardian, and named Lott, reasoning that Lott had experience managing Mills's care and was familiar with her family. Judge Butts's decision was a reasonable one, and she had ample authority to make it. The record\n   does not support an inference that Judge Butts acted with gross neglect in failing to perform her duties as to Lott's appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Johnston's remaining allegations relate to Pierce's emergency applications. On December 6, 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pierce filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order against Lott, alleging that Mills \"was just released from the hospital and her health is on an urgent,\n   <em>\n    steep decline\n   </em>\n   in sharp contrast to the health she enjoyed when her daughter, Sherry Johnston[,] was permitted to visit her and care for her daily.\" (Docket Entry No. 10-14 at 5 (emphasis in original) ). Pierce alleged that Mills's deterioration resulted from Lott's disregard for her well-being. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10). Through the temporary restraining order, Pierce sought reinstatement of Johnston's visitation rights and to have Lott removed as guardian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41). To support the temporary restraining order, Pierce submitted her affidavit and an affidavit from Johnston. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On December 16, Judge Butts held a live status conference, at which the parties and Judge Butts discussed Mills's well-being and the allegations against Lott. (Docket Entry No. 10-15). The conference was on the record. Judge Butts told the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   For me, the question to answer today is, is Ms. Mills okay? If she's okay, i[f] no immediate action is required, then you guys can move forward with any action to remove Ms. Lott that you wish, but that will have to be done in a formal process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   If Ms. Mills is not okay, if it requires immediate action on my part, then I'll need to decide what action to take. And, so that's really the focus, you know-that's the focus that I concluded ... would be appropriate for our status conference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). Judge Butts summarized Pierce's position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [T]his emergency is because Ms. Mills is not coherent or she's not as coherent as she used to be. She's sad and depressed. She's got skin tears on her arms and legs; her foot is broken, and the doctor has said it's not worth setting. She had-and they haven't gotten a second opinion on that; that she has bed sores ; she's suffering from pneumonia ; and she has scratches on her arms and she's lost weight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40). Judge Butts asked if there were other safety or health conditions, and Pierce's counsel stated that Mills is \"taking insufficient fluids and foods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41). Judge Butts then permitted counsel to examine and cross-examine Pierce and Johnston as to their allegations regarding Mills's condition and care. After hearing the testimony and arguments, Judge Butts concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Okay. Well, as we all know, we're not here for the TRO. I mean, we're here, really, essentially, to determine whether or not the guardian has neglected or cruelly treated the Ward. That's really the only authority that I have to remove her at this moment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   And I have to say, based upon the evidence that you guys have presented, I don't see that there's an emergency situation number one; and number two, I don't find that the guardian has neglected or cruelly treated the Ward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The point about visitation, though, I think is something that needs to be addressed. And you guys are free to present the case as you wish, but I will tell you, at this moment, I'm just not-I don't see that we're in an emergency\n   situation that would necessitate the immediate removal of Ms. Lott based upon the allegation that she's neglected or cruelly treated the Ward. And so-but you guys are welcome to put on whatever testimony or evidence you wish....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   I haven't heard any evidence as to neglect. I mean, it sounds like Ms. Mills has sitters with her, and at least one of the sitters, Nicole, is suitable. And that was the testimony of Ms. Pierce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   And Raylene, apparently, is more interested in watching game shows. So, that may be something that needs to be addressed, but it doesn't constitute neglect, necessarily. And she may have hit her head on the wheelchair, and that's unfortunate. And I completely-you know, if it were my mother, I would be, perhaps, doing the same thing that you guys are doing. I don't want you to think that I don't sympathize with your position-it's just that I only have so much-at this point, I can only remove her if I find that she's neglected her or cruelly treated your mother, and I just don't see evidence of that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court addressed Johnston's visitation rights and the appropriate communications among Lott, Pierce, and Johnston. Lott agreed to permit Johnston to visit Mills once a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134). Lott also agreed to email Johnston and Pierce \"if there's any major changes or even minor changes in [Mills's] condition\" and to \"every month, send them an email, just a status, even if nothing's changed\" in Mills's care and condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   At the conference's close, the court and parties agreed to submit a proposed docket-control order to resolve Pierce's request to remove Lott as guardian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153). On January 31, 2014, the parties submitted an agreed docket-control order, stating that the parties would have a joint pretrial conference on May 9, 2014, and would try the issues related to Lott's guardianship on May 19. (Agreed Order,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Willie Jo Mills\n   </em>\n   , No. 380624 (Prob. Ct. No. 4, Harris Cty., Tex., Jan. 31, 2014) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On April 28, 2014, Pierce filed a second emergency application for a temporary restraining order against Lott, again asking the court to remove Lott as guardian because of alleged acts or omissions relating to Mills's care. (Docket Entry No. 10-17). The allegations as to Lott's neglect of Mills were similar to the first emergency application. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 10-14 at 8-10; Docket Entry No. 10-17 at 15-18). On May 5, Judge Butts's guardianship coordinator emailed Pierce's counsel, stating that the court \"will not be scheduling a hearing on the [second emergency application]\" because the \"court does not see an emergency and the case will be tried within two weeks.\" (Docket Entry No. 10-20). Johnston alleges that Judge Butts's decision not to hold a hearing on the second emergency application supports finding an inference of gross neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Judge Butts did not act unreasonably, let alone with gross neglect, by declining to immediately hold a hearing on the second emergency motion in April 2014. In December 2013, Judge Butts had heard extensive evidence and each parties' arguments on Lott's alleged neglect. The second emergency application raised very similar arguments and allegations. The case was then set to be fully tried in less than two weeks. The probate courts, like other trial courts, \"have inherent authority\n   to manage their dockets.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mesa Petroleum Partners, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655462\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/538/153/#p159\">\n    538 S.W.3d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2017, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The record shows that Judge Butts was conscientious toward Mills's well-being; appointed Comstock to investigate the allegations of neglect; gave weight to Comstock's recommendations; heard evidence on Lott's care; responded to the parties' disputes about visitation, communication, and Mills's condition; and set a schedule to fully litigate and resolve the issues raised by Pierce's emergency applications. Based on the record, the court has not found, nor has Johnston identified, evidence supporting any inference that Judge Butts acted with gross neglect in performing her duties. Summary judgment is granted for Judge Butts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Claim Against Dexel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Unlike the claim against Judge Butts, the claim against Dexel raises unsettled issues of Texas law. Johnston has asserted a fiduciary-duty claim against Dexel, alleging that Dexel breached a fiduciary duty to Mills by \" 'slipping' Lott into his guardian position\" and \"billing and receiving attorney's fees at $ 300 per hour in many instances instead of billing at a guardians rate of $ 100 per hour.\" (Docket Entry No. 38 at 4, 19 ). Dexel has responded that Johnston lacks capacity to assert this fiduciary-duty claim; claim preclusion bars Johnston from bringing the claim; and Johnston has failed to identify evidence supporting any inference of a fiduciary-duty breach. (Docket Entry Nos. 79, 92). In requesting briefs on the jurisdiction question, the court explained some of the difficult and unresolved Texas-law questions presented by the claim-preclusion defense. (Docket Entry No. 93 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The court begins by addressing the capacity issue, finding factual disputes material to determining Johnston's capacity to assert Mills's fiduciary-duty claim. The preclusion issue is next addressed. The court then examines whether, assuming that claim preclusion does not bar Johnston's claim, Johnston has submitted or identified evidence showing a factual dispute material to determining whether Dexel violated a fiduciary duty. The court finds that Johnston has identified evidence showing a genuine factual dispute. Because the unresolved Texas-law questions cannot be avoided, the court finds that the statutory and common-law factors support remanding what is left of the action to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Order stated that Mills's estate was dropped from the court's active docket, but not that the estate was closed or dismissed. Removing a case from the active docket, without more, suggests that the case could be reinstated to that docket. The Order came soon after the court had approved the estate inventory, after which actions could not be taken in the probate court unless specifically authorized by the Texas Estates Code. When the Order issued, the probate court docket contained no indication that Larry Mills had paid all the estate claims or distributed the estate assets, both prerequisites for closing an estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

If the administration was not closed, Johnston would not have the capacity\n   to do so.

Dexel argues that claim preclusion bars these claims because Johnston was able to oppose Lott's appointment as guardian and Dexel's fee requests during the probate proceedings, and Johnston could have appealed the probate court's decisions on them, but chose not to do so. Johnston responds that Dexel did not timely serve her with his final report or his application to resign, and that she had no opportunity to oppose either Lott's appointment or Dexel's resignation.

Dexel and Johnston were involved in the guardianship proceeding before Judge Butts in the Harris County Probate Court. Under Texas law, Johnston was an \"interested person\" in that proceeding. TEX.

During the probate proceedings, Johnston did not oppose Lott's guardian application or challenge Dexel's fee motions, and she did not assert a fiduciary-duty claim as to either.

Is an interested person a \"party\" in a guardianship or estate administration proceeding for claim-preclusion purposes?

Neither the Texas Supreme Court nor the intermediate Texas appellate courts have addressed or answered these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The Texas Estates Code defines an interested person as \"an heir, devisee, spouse, creditor, or any other having a property right in or claim against an estate being administered\" and any person \"interested in the welfare of an incapacitated person.\" TEX.

(Docket Entry No. 10-7). The record shows that Dexel submitted applications for guardian fees and expenses, along with billing statements, to the probate court for approval. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry Nos. 38-5, 79-14). For part of Dexel's time as guardian, the billing statements show that Dexel charged Mills at either an attorney's rate, $ 300 per hour, or at a legal-assistant rate, $ 100 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dexel did not start billing a guardian rate, distinct from the attorney and legal-assistant rates, until January 31, 2011, when he filed an amended application for guardian's fees and expenses that had a handwritten column for guardian hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17). In the billing statement for June 21, 2011, to July 28, 2011, Dexel did not include the column for guardian hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The billing statements show that Dexel charged an attorney hourly rate for non-legal services that appear related to his guardian role. For example, Dexel requested his attorney's rate for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Discussion with Chris Holland about private physical therapist and options; scheduled conference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Visit with Ward at care home; reviewed her preference on care taker; reviewed with Ward her 867 Trust statement; discussed assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Discussion with daughter on Christmas gifts to family; received email list; telephone call from Deborah Mills on beer issue; telephone call to care home on beer issue and new shower chair; letter to trust authorizing gifts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Telephone calls to Silverado and SCS &amp; Associates; letter regarding alcoholic beverages to all and family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Long discussion with Sherry Johnston.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Telephone call from GSL Care Management to inform Guardian that blood transfusion will not be performed as Ward's hemoglobin levels are higher; they have been giving her fluids which helped her condition, however, the doctor wants to keep her overnight and to check her levels in the morning; family members have arrived; sitter will remain with Ward overnight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Prepared Guardian's Annual Report on Location, Condition and Well-Being of Ward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 38-5 at 3-4, 20-21). Dexel often charged his attorney rate to arrange payments to and from Mills's trust, a service which does not appear legal in nature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). While the probate court approved Dexel's fee requests, that approval, absent claim preclusion, would not alleviate Dexel from his fiduciary responsibilities to Mills or resolve whether he met them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Dexel denies that the billing statements show a violation of his fiduciary duties, pointing to the probate court's approvals of his fee applications as evidence. Based on this record, the court finds that there are factual disputes material to determining whether Dexel billed Mills's estate at his attorney rate for non-legal, guardian services. Because the court has found at least one factual dispute material to deciding if Dexel breached a fiduciary duty owing to Mills, summary judgment cannot be granted for Dexel on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Dexel's claim-preclusion defense cannot be avoided. The defense presents unsettled Texas-law questions that touch on family relationships, estate management, the Texas probate system, and the care of some of the most vulnerable members of our community. They are questions that the Texas courts are better positioned to answer. Because Johnston's federal-law\n   claims have been dismissed, and the one remaining claim presents unsettled Texas-law questions, the court remands that issue, the only remaining claim in this action, to the 253rd Judicial District Court for Liberty County, Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Judge Butts's motion for summary judgment is granted. (Docket Entry No. 78 ).
