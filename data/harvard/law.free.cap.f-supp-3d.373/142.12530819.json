Brown, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Policy and Coordination in State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. According to Brown, the existence or nonexistence of records relating to Plaintiff's request is a fact exempted from disclosure by Exemption 1 because that fact \"is currently and properly classified under Section 1.4(c) of\" Executive Order 13526, which pertains to intelligence activities, intelligence sources and methods, and cryptology. ECF No. 8-1 \u00b6 7. Moreover, \"[a]cknowledging the existence or nonexistence of responsive records would disclose information that ... is currently and properly classified\" under Section 1.2(a)(3) of that same Executive Order, \"because it could reasonably be expected to reveal information about\" those same topics \"that would cause identifiable and describable damage to the national security.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1469833,3636301\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/689/1100/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Brown explains in detail why this is so. In general, State considers \"requests for classified information made by senior policy makers ... highly sensitive and protected\" because they can reveal insights into the policymaker's areas of interest, into deliberations within the Intelligence Community and with the policymaker, and into knowledge gaps within the U.S. government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Moreover, in this specific case, the records concern a \"highly sensitive issue of clear counterintelligence interest,\" which \"would reveal information that would allow U.S. adversaries to draw sensitive inferences about U.S. government awareness, or lack of awareness, about activities of counterintelligence concern, and therefore cause damage to national security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Specifically, acknowledgement of the existence or nonexistence of the information requested would \"reveal sensitive information concerning what a senior U.S. policy maker might or might not have known at a particular point in time about U.S. counterintelligence information and efforts related to Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For example, Brown explains, if State were to acknowledge that it had no responsive records, \"a hostile foreign government might surmise that the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was unwitting of any interference in the relevant timeframe and from that draw inferences about her access to intelligence or the availability of relevant intelligence - information we would want to protect for counterintelligence purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. But on the other hand, if State were to acknowledge that it possessed responsive records, \"this could alert a hostile foreign government that its activities had been detected and/or to the time frame within which that detection occurred, as well as to information about the Ambassador's access to intelligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And \"[t]his would be true even if we were to withhold the documents under a FOIA exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Brown also points out that unless State relied on a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response here, multiple FOIA requests aimed at different senior government officials could end up allowing \"an adversary to map out which of these government officials were or were not involved in relevant counterintelligence efforts based on which officials had responsive records. In other words, a U.S. adversary could potentially piece together key classified information about how the United States government conducts counterintelligence efforts based on responses to FOIA requests like this one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. This is, as State argues, a version of the \"mosaic\" theory, which courts have long upheld as a basis for nondisclosure in the national security context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CIA v. Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    471 U.S. 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, Brown also notes that if State acknowledged whether responsive records exist and argued that any such records should be withheld under a FOIA exemption, doing so could \"reveal classified information regarding intelligence sources and methods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. For example, any request directed to, or response received from, a particular Intelligence Community component that collects a particular kind of intelligence \"could itself reveal details about the sources and methods of intelligence collection that were used, or not used, to obtain\" responsive information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court finds that State's justification for its invocation of Exemption 1 is plausible and logical. Therefore, its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   , 473 F.3d at 375.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exemption 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   State also argues that it properly withheld the existence or nonexistence of responsive records under Exemption 3. That exemption permits an agency to withhold records that are \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,\" provided that the statute either \"requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or ... establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). To determine whether Exemption 3 has been properly invoked, courts ask: (1) whether the statute in question is a statute of exemption; and, if so, (2) whether the information at issue satisfies the criteria in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    471 U.S. at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the Director of National Intelligence has, under his authority in Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1), \"ordered the heads of Intelligence Community elements, including the Secretary of State, to '[p]rotect national intelligence and intelligence sources, methods and activities from unauthorized disclosure.' \" ECF No. 8-1 \u00b6 17 (quoting Intelligence Community Directive 700, at 3\n   (June 7, 2012),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD_700.pdf).

For those same reasons, the Court agrees that State's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is justified on that basis as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff concedes that State's \"brief meets all the standard criteria for establishing a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   defense ... In any normal case, the government's brief and declaration would likely be sufficient to obtain judgment in its favor.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 4. It makes two main arguments in response, but neither has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, Plaintiff claims that because \"the U.N. Ambassador does not have a known intelligence function,\" \"State has not met the preliminary burden applicable somewhat uniquely to this case to show that the specific alleged counter-espionage activities of the former U.N. Ambassador would be considered ordinary government intelligence activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509196,387478\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/144/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is all wrong. Nothing about the merits of State's claimed exemptions turns on whether the U.N. Ambassador has a \"known intelligence function.\" And the Court has no authority to place a \"preliminary burden\" on State-let alone one \"unique to this case\"-to show that the activities that may have been undertaken by the U.N. Ambassador here were \"ordinary intelligence activity.\" It suffices to say that nothing about Plaintiff's assertions undermines the Court's conclusion that State has plausibly and logically justified its assertion of Exemption 1 to cover the U.N. Ambassador's requests for intelligence about this sensitive counterintelligence matter directed to \"any Intelligence Community member agency,\" as well as communications about those requests. In reaching this determination, the Court has no basis-as implicitly urged by Plaintiff-to question the reasons this Cabinet-level official at State may have had to request this intelligence, if indeed she did so. And neither do Plaintiff's assertions affect the Court's conclusion that State has properly invoked Exemption 3, because the information at issue manifestly \"relates to intelligence sources and methods,\"\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or \"can reasonably be expected to lead to unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods,\"\n   <em>\n    Halperin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509196,387478\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/144/\">\n    629 F.2d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Halperin\n   </em>\n   , No. 77-1859 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that certain media reports undermine State's claims of Exemptions 1 and 3. Plaintiff notes that \"[e]veryone knows about the Russian election investigation,\" and identifies a report that \"[a] sitting Congressman has confirmed the former U.N. Ambassador was involved in unmasking requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. But these reports do not cast doubt on State's asserted reasons why a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is necessary to protect\n   sensitive intelligence interests or harm to the national security. Nor do they necessitate any response from State, since doing so would reveal they type of information its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   claim is intended to forestall. And finally, to the extent that Plaintiff asserts that State has somehow waived its right to claim these exemptions because of these media reports, an agency may only waive its FOIA rights though \" 'official and documented' disclosure\" of the information at issue.\n   <em>\n    Frugone v.
