Also\n   before the Court are motions to dismiss filed by Defendant Ken Paxton, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the State of Texas (\"Texas\" or the \"State\"), (Dkt. 55), Defendants the Board of Regents of the University of Houston System and the Board of Regents of the Texas A &amp; M University System (the \"Boards\" or the \"Universities\"), (Dkt. 24), Defendants the Trustees of the Klein Independent School District and the Trustees of the Lewisville Independent School District (the \"Trustees\" or the \"School Districts\"), (Dkts. 43, 44), and responsive briefing, (Dkts. 38, 45, 49, 51, 60, 61, 63). Having considered the parties' arguments, the evidence, and relevant law, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and deny Defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about whether Texas may prohibit boycotting the State of Israel as a condition of public employment. Plaintiffs in this case are all participants or supporters of the \"BDS\" movement. The BDS movement-referring to boycotts, divestment, and sanctions-arose in response to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory and its treatment of Palestinian citizens and refugees. (Abbas Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 16-18; Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 6). Modeled after the South African anti-apartheid movement, the BDS movement seeks to pressure the Israeli government to end its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and Golan Heights, end discrimination against Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, permit Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, and otherwise comply with international law. (Pluecker Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 14-1, at 10; Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 6). The BDS movement claims to be nonviolent and opposed to all forms of discrimination, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. (Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 7, 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Congress, however, has declared that it \"opposes politically motivated actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel, such as boycotts of, divestment from or sanctions against Israel.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204452\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Twenty-five states have enacted legislation or issued executive orders restricting boycotts of Israel, (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 3), and several more have introduced legislation to that effect, (Abbas Decl., Dkt. 8-4, at 12-14). In every state to consider such legislation, the proposed measures have passed by considerable margins. (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2017, Texas joined those states opposing the BDS movement when it enacted House Bill 89, codified at Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 2270.001\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"H.B. 89\"). Texas emphasizes that H.B. 89 was \"widely supported\" and \"passed unanimously in the House, and 26-5 in the Senate.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 1; Texas Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 55, at 1). As a result of the State's disapproval of the BDS movement, Plaintiffs allege that they have lost the benefit of public employment with the State of Texas, or fear losing such employment, and that H.B. 89 prohibits them from exercising their First Amendment right to boycott the State of Israel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. House Bill 89\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   H.B. 89 prohibits state entities from contracting with companies that \"boycott Israel.\" It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A governmental entity may not enter into a contract with a company for goods or services unless the contract contains a written verification from the company that it:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) does not boycott Israel; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 2270.002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The term \"boycott Israel\" is defined to mean \"refusing to deal with, terminating\n   business activities with, or otherwise taking any action that is intended to penalize, inflict harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israel or in an Israeli-controlled territory.\" Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The term \"company\" includes \"a for-profit sole proprietorship, organization, association, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or any limited liability company, including a wholly owned subsidiary, majority-owned subsidiary, parent company or affiliate of those entities or business associations that exist to make a profit.\" Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is indisputable that H.B. 89 targets participation in BDS campaigns. Both Representative Phil King, the bill's sponsor, and Governor Gregg Abbott have referred to H.B. 89 as the \"anti-BDS bill.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 16-19). Representative King has described the BDS movement as \"economic warfare\" and stated that H.B. 89 reflects Texas's disapproval of the movement because \"[t]he BDS movement is directed at harming and destroying Israel, pure and simple.\" (Abbas Decl., Dkt. 8-4, at 56). Upon signing the bill, Governor Abbott proclaimed that \"[a]nti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate [boycott] actions against an important ally.\" (Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 20). Similarly, King stated that \"[t]he bill sends a strong message that Texas stands with its friends,\" and Abbott responded to a news report about this litigation by tweeting \"Texas stands with Israel. Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, 26). When asked by a media outlet what motivated him to introduce H.B. 89, King provided four reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   First, as a Christian, my religious heritage is intrinsically linked to Israel and to the Jewish people. Second, as an American, our national security is dependent in great part on a strong Israel, often our only friend in the Middle East. Third, as a Texas legislator, our state has a substantial Jewish population and this issue is important to them. Texans have historical ties and do a lot of business with Israel. Fourth, it's just the right thing to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Abbas Decl., Dkt. 8-4, at 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Boycotts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs in this consolidated action are five sole proprietors who allege that H.B. 89 violates their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Because the nature of Plaintiffs' boycotts is relevant to this dispute, they are described in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    1. Bahia Amawi\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff Amawi is a speech pathologist. (Amawi Decl., Dkt. 8-3, \u00b6 1). She is a United States citizen and Muslim of Palestinian origin, has family members living in Palestine, and claims that she has \"seen and experienced the brutality of the Israeli government against Palestinians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). She testifies that the Israeli government cuts off main roads for Palestinians but not Israelis in the West Bank, imposes \"curfews that last for weeks\" despite the need to obtain groceries or health treatments, closes schools, subjects Palestinians to constant searches, and takes Palestinian children into custody during the night. (Hr'g Tr., Dkt. 81, at 15:3-19). Amawi claims to participate in the BDS movement because she \"advocate[s] for Palestinian human rights and justice,\" and to that end, \"support[s] peaceful efforts to impose economic pressure on Israel, with the goal of making Israel recognize Palestinians' dignity and human rights.\" (Amawi Decl., Dkt. 8-3, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Amawi asserts that she \"frequently make[s] economic decisions on the basis of [her] support for Palestine and [her] ethical objections to Israel's mistreatment\n   of Palestinians,\" including buying Palestinian olive oil and refusing to buy the Sabra brand of hummus because of the company's connections to Israel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For nine years, Amawi has contracted with the Pflugerville Independent School District (\"PISD\") to provide speech therapy and early childhood evaluations for three-to five-year-old children in the school district. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). She refused to sign an addendum in her renewal contract with PISD for the 2018-19 school year, however, because the addendum required her to certify that she does not boycott Israel and will not boycott Israel during the term of her employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4, 5, 7). Amawi contacted PISD regarding the addendum before refusing to sign it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Initially, PISD informed Amawi that it thought she could strike out the \"No Boycott of Israel\" paragraph and initial it, but later confirmed that \"agreeing to [the] Paragraph ... was mandatory to receive payment for [her] services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). Amawi refused to sign the contract because she believed that the \"No Boycott of Israel\" paragraph \"violate[d] [her] First Amendment right to advocate for human rights in Palestine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). She was therefore forced to terminate her contractual relationship with the school district. (Amawi Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6 4). PISD has stipulated that it will offer Amawi another contract to provide speech pathology service, one not containing the no-boycott certification paragraph, if this Court invalidates or enjoins H.B. 89. (Not. Cond. Stip., Dkt. 18, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2. John Pluecker\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff Pluecker is a freelance writer, artist, interpreter, and translator. (Pluecker Decl., Dkt. 14-6, \u00b6 1). As an interpreter and writer, Pluecker volunteers his time and talent to civil rights and immigrant rights organizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Through his involvement in the art community and through civil rights advocacy, he has developed friendships with Palestinian artists and political activists and learned about the conflict between Palestine and Israel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Pluecker has become an \"active supporter of Palestinian rights and liberation,\" and he expresses this support by supporting Palestinian art exhibits and presentations and by participating in BDS campaigns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). Pluecker claims to participate in BDS campaigns with the goal of \"promot[ing] justice and effectuat[ing] human rights in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). Specifically, he boycotts Sabra products due to the company's support for the Israel Defense Forces (\"IDF\"), which he considers \"a particularly controversial section of the Israeli military.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the past few years, Pluecker has contracted with the University of Houston. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). In March 2018, a representative for the Blaffer Art Museum at the University of Houston offered him a contract to translate an art essay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10). Pluecker began work on his translation before reviewing or signing the contract due to his prior relationship with the University. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After reviewing the contract, Pluecker crossed out the \"No Boycott of Israel\" provision before submitting it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). The representative informed Pluecker that he would not be paid for his translation unless he certified that he did not boycott Israel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Pluecker did not sign the contract because he \"did not want to forfeit [his] participation in a BDS campaign against Sabra and [his] support of pro-Palestinian presentations and art exhibits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Nor did he want \"to disavow [his] right to participate in BDS boycott campaigns in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pluecker was offered another contract with the University of Houston in September 2018, this time by a faculty member to be a guest speaker for a class of college\n   students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Pluecker emailed the University of Houston to inform them that he would not sign the contract because \"it includes language that requires me to affirm that I am opposed to the boycott of the State of Israel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). The University denied him the contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    3. Zachary Abdelhadi\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff Abdelhadi is a sophomore at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. (Abdelhadi Decl., Dkt. 14-3, \u00b6 3). He is Palestinian-American; his father is from Palestine, and his mother was born in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). He is an active participant in the BDS movement because he \"agree[s] with their efforts to seek an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian homelands, equal rights for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the right of return for Palestinians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As part of his participation in the BDS movement, Abdelhadi claims to boycott only those Israeli companies he views as \"supporting Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, those that support Israeli policies that oppress Palestinian people, [and] those supporting the Israel Defense Forces.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). He therefore avoids purchasing PepsiCo, Hewlett Packard (\"HP\"), and Strauss Group products, and avoids using booking services such as VRBO that list vacation rental homes in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Abdelhadi participated in his high school's debate program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). After graduation, his former debate teacher offered him the opportunity to judge debate tournaments for Lewisville Independent School District (\"LISD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). He sent Abdelhadi a \"Lewisville ISD School Contractor/Consultant contract for speech and debate judging\" in September 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). The contract contained a \"Not [sic] Boycott Israel\" clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Abdelhadi refused to sign the contract because doing so would \"violate [his] political beliefs,\" \"force [him] to discontinue [his] current and future participation in BDS campaigns,\" and \"would be a public declaration on a position that is contrary to [his] political beliefs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Consequently, Abdelhadi was unable to judge the debate tournaments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). Because he \"anticipated judging about 15 debate tournaments a year for LISD,\" Abdelhadi testifies that he has \"already lost income amounting to over three semesters' worth of textbooks, several vehicle payments, or several months of rent in San Marcos.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    4. Obinna Dennar\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff Dennar is a graduate student at Rice University. (Dennar Decl., Dkt. 14-4, \u00b6 3). He actively participates in BDS campaigns by \"boycott[ing] consumer products offered by businesses supporting Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories or that, directly or indirectly, economically benefit the Israeli government, including Sabra and L'Oreal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). He does this in protest of what he believes to be \"Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands, illegal settlements constructed on internationally recognized Palestinian territory, and violation of the human rights of Palestinians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dennar testifies, however, that he would not boycott Israeli companies supporting \"the plight of the Palestinian people,\" and he would not boycott \"an American company solely because its owner was of Israeli origin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition to his BDS activities, Dennar is a member of the National Students for Justice in Palestine, and its Houston chapter. Through these organizations, Dennar participates in \"educational presentations, college tabling, and ... meetings relating to Palestinian justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Since 2015, Dennar has contracted with public school districts to judge about ten debate tournaments per year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). In 2017, he contacted the debate coordinator\n   for Klein High School to serve as a judge in an upcoming debate tournament. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). Like Pluecker, Dennar provided his services before reviewing and signing the contract he was offered because he assumed it would be similar to the ones he had signed before. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Upon reviewing the contract, however, Dennar discovered that it included a clause requiring him to certify that he did not boycott Israel and would not boycott Israel for the duration of the contract agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Dennar states that he \"was required to sign the boycott form in order to be paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He did not sign the contract because he was currently engaged in a boycott of Israel and did not want to disavow his boycott. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). Dennar was not paid for his work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because he understands that all Texas public high schools are required to include the \"No Boycott of Israel\" certification in their contracts, Dennar testifies that he has been forced to forgo all contract work as a debate tournament judge at public high schools in the state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). He believes that signing the certifications would require him \"to forfeit [his] BDS-related activities, including [his] past and present affiliations with pro-Palestine organizations\" that \"engage in BDS campaigns\" because associating with those groups \"could be seen as dealing with or taking any action 'intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations' with Israel,\" in contravention of H.B. 89. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    5. George Hale\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff Hale is a radio reporter for KETR, the NPR station for northeast Texas, which is licensed to Texas A &amp; M University-Commerce (\"TAMUC\"). (Hale Decl., Dkt. 14-5, \u00b6 3). Hale joined KETR after spending nearly eight years reporting on the Israel-Palestine conflict for various news agencies, including overseas from Israel, the Palestinian territories, Egypt, and Jordan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Hale also lived with Palestinians in Bethlehem from September 2008 to May 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During that time, \"[d]espite ... liv[ing] within the internationally recognized Palestinian territory,\" Hale testifies that he \"had to go through checkpoints and roadblocks operated by Israeli security forces\" whenever he entered or left Bethlehem, \"was subjected to numerous strip searches and prolonged questioning about [his] work,\" and \"was exposed to tear gas in [his] apartment and car from Israeli forces on a regular basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). Based upon these \"dehumanizing\" experiences, Hale considers himself \"politically aligned with the Palestinian people,\" and he \"support[s] their struggle for liberation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hale \"previously boycotted consumer goods offered by businesses supporting Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). He boycotted products produced by Ahava, a popular Israeli Dead Sea cosmetics company, \"because some of its operations are conducted in the West Bank.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also boycotted HP products due to the company's \"role in the ID system that Israel uses to control the movement of Palestinians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Hale boycotted these companies \"to protest both the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the settlements, which [he] believe[s] violate the human rights of Palestinians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Hale is not currently active in BDS campaigns, however. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). He testifies that the reason for this is that he \"was forced to sign a No Boycott of Israel certification\" as a condition of his employment with KETR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). In February 2018, TAMUC contracted with Hale to provide KETR segments of the \"Buried\" podcast series, of which Hale is the host and lead reporter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11). The contract contained the \"No Boycott of Israel\" certification\n   clause, which Hale \"did not approve\" of, but which he signed because he \"was committed to the ongoing investigative project\" of the podcast and \"did not feel that [he] could quit midway through the work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). Hale's discomfort from signing the contract grew in the following months, and when his contract was up for renewal, he attempted to sign it under protest because he felt \"that the anti-BDS clause ... violated [his] rights to free speech and free association.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-16). Hale made a notation in the renewal contract indicating his disapproval of the \"No Boycott of Israel\" clause, but when a copy of the contract was sent to TAMUC's Assistant Director of Procurement Services, the Assistant Director rejected the notation and stated that Hale \"can sign a clean copy or he won't work. We are not forcing him to sign under duress or protest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, 28). \"Faced with the prospect of losing [his] job,\" Hale felt he \"had no choice but to sign the contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Now, in addition to \"discontinu[ing] his boycott,\" Hale is \"unsure whether [he] could even\n   <em>\n    decline\n   </em>\n   to purchase\" the products he previously boycotted because \"refusing to purchase Ahava or HP products ... could be interpreted by others as violating the [No Boycott of Israel] certification\" he has given.

With respect to the injury-in-fact requirement, all five Plaintiffs allege that the inclusion of the no-boycott clauses in their contracts has chilled their First Amendment right to free expression.

In the State's view, the statute applies only to acts taken by government contractors in their \"company\" capacities. (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 9-10). According to the State, because Plaintiffs' boycott activities were taken in their \"personal\" capacities, they were \"entirely divorced from the content of the contracts they signed with the State as sole proprietors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Plaintiffs read H.B. 89 differently; they argue that H.B. 89 applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   boycotting activity undertaken by companies during the contract period regardless of whether the boycotts are related to the content of the contract. (Amawi Reply Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 39, at 13-14; Pluecker Reply Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 40, at 9-10). In other words, Plaintiffs read H.B. 89 to reach the acts of contracting companies, not merely \"company\" acts. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue that as sole proprietors, there is no legal distinction between their \"company\" acts and \"personal\" acts because under Texas law, a sole proprietor has no legal existence apart from his sole proprietorship.

By its plain terms, the statute affects\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   actions taken by a company contracting with the State. It requires contractors to certify that they \"(1) do not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.\" Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 2270.002. The terms do not distinguish between \"company\" and \"non-company\" acts. However characterized, Plaintiffs' boycott activities fall within the scope of H.B. 89's terms because they are actions taken by companies (here, sole proprietors) contracting with the State. Indeed, several state actors have already interpreted H.B. 89 to apply to Plaintiffs' boycott activities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amawi Decl., Dkt. 8-3, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Pluecker Decl., Dkt. 14-6, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Hale Decl., Dkt. 14-5, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' injuries are fairly traceable to H.B. 89 because the no-boycott clause in their contracts applies to the boycott activities of companies, like Plaintiffs, contracting with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Texas contends, however, that the Court must follow its reading of H.B. 89 because it is \"bound to apply\" an interpretation\n   that saves a statute from unconstitutionality \"if there is any constitutional dubiety.\" (Texas Resp.

Texas's interpretation of the statute is not reasonable. It argues that H.B. 89 only applies to \"company\" acts, by which it means \"work-related decisions\" tied to \"the content of the contracts ... signed with the State.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 9). H.B. 89 requires a company contracting with the State of Texas to certify that it both \"(1)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   not boycott Israel; and (2)\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.\" Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 2270.002 (emphases added). Any \"work-related decisions\" tied to \"the content of the contracts ... signed with the State\" are necessarily made after the contracts have been signed. All these decisions are therefore subject to the second certification requirement that a company \"will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.\" To avoid redundancy, the first certification requirement-that a company \"does not boycott Israel\"-must be construed to apply to actions taken by a company\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   it contracts with the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Adjustments of City of San Antonio v.

Because the statute reaches such decisions, its scope is necessarily broader than company acts taken in the course of contract work with the State. Accordingly, because the plain text of H.B. 89 is clear and is not susceptible to Texas's construction, the Court will not \"rewrite\" it to conform to constitutional requirements.\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

Because the individual members of the Boards are state officials, the Pluecker Plaintiffs argue that the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to sovereign immunity applies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). The Universities do not contest that sovereign immunity does not extend to the individual members of the Boards; rather, they argue that the Pluecker Plaintiffs sued the Boards as\n   <em>\n    entities\n   </em>\n   because the Pluecker Plaintiffs identified them using the singular pronoun \"its\" in their complaint.

The official title of the individual members of the Boards is a collective one: the \"Board of Regents.\" The singular pronoun \"its\" is the grammatically correct pronoun to use with respect to the antecedent, \"Board of Regents.\" The Court therefore construes the Pluecker Plaintiffs' complaint to name the individual members of the Boards as defendants by designating them by their official title.

(LISD Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 43, at 10; KISD Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 44, at 9).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The gravamen of this argument is that Plaintiffs' injuries stem from \"the Act passed by the Texas Legislature, not from any decisions made by the trustees.\" (Reply School Dist. Ds.' Mots. Dismiss, Dkt. 51, at 3). As repeatedly emphasized by counsel for the School Districts, the Trustees \"never adopted\" the policies mandated in H.B. 89-though counsel also admitted that the \"school districts are going to follow the law that's established, whether they like it or not.\" (Hr'g Tr., Dkt. 81, at 52:13-14, 57:19-58:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Pluecker Plaintiffs contend that they have plausibly alleged a causal connection between the Trustees and their injuries. They argue that Abdelhadi and Dennar were injured by the inclusion of no-boycott certifications in the contracts they were offered by LISD and KISD, respectively, and that the Trustees of LISD and KISD \"have the exclusive power and duty to govern and oversee the management of the public schools\" in their districts, including \"the authority to enter into contracts and delegate that contractual authority.\" (Resp. School Dist. Ds.' Mots. Dismiss, Dkt. 49, at 12). Accordingly, the harm alleged-chilled speech-is traceable to the Trustees' conduct: the inclusion of the no-boycott certification in the School Districts' contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court agrees. It is immaterial that the genesis of Plaintiffs' injuries is a statute passed by the Texas Legislature. Abdelhadi and Dennar allege they suffered harm because the no-boycott certification\n   required by that statute appeared in contracts with LISD and KISD, thus \"forc[ing] [them] to choose between judging debate tournaments and exercising their political expression.\" (Resp. School Dist. Ds.' Mots. Dismiss, Dkt. 49, at 12). And they allege that the Trustees are responsible for including the certification clause in their contracts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782863\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/593/#p597\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It is also immaterial that the Trustees \"never adopted\" H.B. 89's no-boycott certification requirement.

Counsel for the School Districts explained that \"local\" policies-those deliberated and agreed upon by the Trustees-are \"adopted,\" whereas \"legal\" policies-those externally established by statute and case law and provided to the Trustees by a third-party subscription-like service-are not \"adopted\"; the School Districts must simply \"liv[e] under\" them. (Hr'g Tr., Dkt. 81, at 57:19-58:8). Be that as it may, Plaintiffs have pleaded that the School Districts included the no-boycott certification clauses in the contracts they provided to Abdelhadi and Dennar, and the Trustees have authority over those contracts. What matters is whether the Trustees are applying the no-boycott certification requirement to the Plaintiffs; it does not matter whether their hands were tied in doing so. The application of the no-boycott requirement is what allegedly caused Plaintiffs' injuries, and this conduct is fairly traceable to the Trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief against the School Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that it has subject matter jurisdiction over all of Plaintiffs' claims as to all Defendants.

The Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Briggs\n   </em>\n   addressed a First Amendment challenge to regulations under the Export Administration Act preventing companies from responding to questionnaires sent by \"Arab countries ... engaged in a long-standing trade boycott of Israel.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57562\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/915/\">\n    728 F.2d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Briggs\n   </em>\n   were not involved in a boycott at all; rather, they were seeking to speak directly by answering the questionnaires sent to them. The Seventh Circuit found that because this speech was \"motivated by economics\" and self-interest in maintaining \"advantageous commercial relationships,\" it was \"commercial speech\" entitled to lesser protection (but protection nonetheless) under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57562\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/915/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57562\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/915/\">\n    at 917-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Briggs\n   </em>\n   did not involve a law allegedly infringing the right to boycott, and the speech allegedly infringed was not political speech. Texas does not argue that Plaintiffs' BDS boycotts are \"commercial speech\" or that they are motivated by economic self-interest. Its reliance on\n   <em>\n    Briggs\n   </em>\n   is therefore misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, Texas argues that even under\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' boycotts are not protected speech. Texas reads\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   to hold that First Amendment protection extends only to boycotts that \"vindicate a constitutional right.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 18).\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   did not so limit its reach. Nowhere does the Court suggest that the vindication of a constitutional right is a necessary condition of bringing a boycott within the ambit of First Amendment protection. Indeed, such a requirement would contradict the Supreme Court's recognition that \"constitutional protection does not turn upon 'the truth, popularity, or social utility of the ideas and beliefs which are offered.' \"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

Texas also contends that\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because it \"does not address boycotts directed at a foreign nation.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 17). This distinction makes no difference. There is no authority to support the notion that speech must be concerned with domestic affairs to enjoy constitutional protection; indeed, the Supreme\n   Court has held just the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boos v.

Only two years ago, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory as \"a flagrant violation under international law\"-the United States abstained from voting on this resolution. (U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, Dkt. 8-4, at 29; Index of U.N. action on Israel/Palestine, Dkt. 8-4, at 32). Texas has included in its briefing an appendix listing twenty-five states that have adopted prohibitions on boycotts against Israel since 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Texas Resp. Mots.

Indeed, Texas claims that its interest in passing H.B. 89 is to combat \"status-based discrimination\" and \"invidious discrimination based on historically protected characteristics.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 19, 25). But the text of the statute does not refer to \"national origin,\" \"nationality,\" or some such characteristic. It refers, instead, to the nation of Israel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As a result, the statute is underinclusive. A company wishing to boycott an Israeli person on the basis of national origin is free to do so as long as the Israeli person is anywhere in the world outside Israel or its controlled territories. Likewise, a company may boycott any entity of Israeli nation origin-and on that basis-so long as the entity is not \"doing business\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   Israel or an Israeli-controlled territory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563831\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/557/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). \"Such '[u]nderinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Inst.

The statute's plain text makes its purpose obvious: to prevent expressive conduct critical of the\n   <em>\n    nation\n   </em>\n   of Israel, not discriminatory conduct on the basis of Israeli\n   <em>\n    national origin.\n   </em>\n   Texas points to no authority indicating that such a purpose is a legitimate or compelling aim of government\n   justifying the restriction of First Amendment freedoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by the legislative history of H.B. 89 and statements made by Representative King-H.B. 89's sponsor-and Governor Abbott regarding the statute. Texas cites to the legislative history of the statute to aver that its purpose in enacting it was to \"prevent taxpayer resources from supporting businesses which work to isolate Israel from global trade\n   <em>\n    because Israel is a key ally and trading partner of the United States and Texas.\n   </em>\n   \" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 4 (citing House Comm. on State Affairs, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B. 89, 85th Leg., R.S. (2017); Senate Comm. on Bus. &amp; Commerce, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B. 89, 85th Leg., R.S. (2017) ) (cleaned up) (emphasis added) ). King and Abbott have each referred to H.B. 89 as the \"anti-BDS bill,\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 16-19), and King describes the BDS movement as \"economic warfare\" that \"is not something most Texans approve of when it's aimed against a friend of Texas,\" (Abbas Decl., Dkt. 8-4, at 56). King reiterates that the nation of Israel is a \"friend\" of Texas when he states that H.B. 89 \"sends a strong message that Texas stands with its friends.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although King does state that \"[w]e will not tolerate national-origin discrimination against Israel,\" it is clear he is referring to the nation of Israel, not the characteristic of Israeli national origin, in this statement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 23 (\"We will not tolerate national-origin discrimination against Israel or use our taxpayer's dollars to support those who wish to inflict economic harm against our fourth[-]largest trading partner.\") ). Governor Abbott also indicates that the purpose of H.B. 89 is not to combat national origin discrimination against Israeli persons or businesses, but to \"send[ ] a strong message\" that Texas sides with the State of Israel in the contentious public debate surrounding Israeli-Palestinian relations. He stated when signing H.B. 89 into law that \"[a]nti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate [boycott] actions against an important ally.\" (Clay Decl., Dkt. 14-2, at 20). And after news media began reporting about this lawsuit, he tweeted, \"Texas stands with Israel. Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Texas's briefing in opposition to Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction further emphasizes that the motivating force behind H.B 89 is hostility toward boycott actions against a foreign-nation \"ally,\" not an interest in preventing discrimination against Israeli persons or entities on the basis of national origin. Texas describes H.B. 89 as an \"anti-discrimination law that provides economic protection to a vital Texas ally and her citizens.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 12). He describes Israel as \"one of the few democracies in the Middle East and an ally of the United States and this State\" and asserts that the BDS movement \"is an attempt to injure an American ally and citizens of our ally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 25). And he states that Texas \"has deeply rooted interests in promoting its relationship with an important ally and preventing national origin discrimination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   It is abundantly clear from all of these sources-the statute's plain text, its legislative history, statements made about the statute, and even Texas's defense of it-that H.B. 89 restricts boycotts of Israel in order to restrict \"particular speech because of the ... message expressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2231. H.B. 89 is a content-based restriction because it singles out speech about Israel, and it is a viewpoint-based restriction because it targets only \"anti-BDS\" speech. It makes this viewpoint restriction because Texas has taken sides in the robust public debate on\n   Israeli-Palestinian relations. \"Especially where ... the legislature's suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended.\"\n   <em>\n    R.A.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    505 U.S. at 430-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank of Boston v.

Taken together with the statute's conspicuous underinclusiveness, it is equally clear that H.B. 89 was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   enacted to prevent discrimination on the immutable characteristic of national origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The third compelling interest purportedly advanced by H.B. 89 is \"align[ing] commerce in Texas with the State's policy objectives and values\"-here, \"prevent[ing] commerce within Texas from being used as an economic weapon against Israel\" because it is \"one of the few democracies in the Middle East and an ally of the United States and this State.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 20). This goal does not run afoul of the First Amendment, Texas says, because \"the First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Airbnb, Inc., v.

But H.B. 89 does not incidentally burden speech; it does so directly. It singles out particular speech (boycotts of Israel) because of the message conveyed: an \"inten[t] to penalize, inflict harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel\" or persons or entities doing business inside it or its territories. Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001. Texas's cited case, moreover, recognizes that the incidental burden doctrine does not protect laws which directly target speech, particularly for disfavored treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Airbnb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271835\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/1066/#p1076\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1076 ;\n   <em>\n    Sorrell\n   </em>\n   , 564 U.S. at 567,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450498,5923853\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/552/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court therefore finds that Texas has failed to identify a compelling state interest justifying H.B. 89's burden on protected speech. \"In fact the only interest distinctly served by the content [and viewpoint] limitation is that of displaying [Texas's] special hostility toward the particular biases thus singled out.

H.B. 89 is Not Sufficiently Tailored\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Because H.B. 89 is not justified by any compelling state interest, no amount of narrowing application will preserve it from constitutional attack. But even if Texas's stated interests were the actual interests advanced by the statute-and even if they were compelling-the Court finds that H.B. 89 still sweeps too broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   With respect to Texas's argument that H.B. 89 \"align[s] commerce in Texas with the State's policy objectives and values,\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 20), the Supreme Court has made clear that \"[w]hile States have broad power to regulate economic activity,\" there is not \"a comparable right to prohibit peaceful political [boycott] activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

H.B. 89 mandates a complete prohibition of all politically-motivated boycotts of Israel\n   by the comprehensive list of companies it covers during the full terms of their contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2270.002, 808.001. Texas's power to \"align commerce\" with its \"policy objectives and values\" does not justify such a sweeping restriction on peaceful, lawful speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Similarly, H.B. 89 is insufficiently tailored to serve Texas's purported anti-discrimination interest. Plaintiffs all allege that they participate or desire to participate in BDS boycotts in order to protest the Israeli government's policies and actions with respect to the Palestinian people. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part I(B),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). Nowhere do they suggest that their boycotts are motivated by the desire to discriminate on the basis of national origin; rather they boycott companies\n   <em>\n    regardless\n   </em>\n   of national origin. Plaintiff Dennar, for example, states that he would not boycott a company merely because its owner is of Israeli origin, (Dennar Decl., Dkt. 14-4, \u00b6 5), and Plaintiff Abdelhadi states that he boycotts only those companies \"supporting Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, those that support Israeli policies that oppress Palestinian people, or those supporting the Israel Defense Forces\"-including non-Israeli companies like PepsiCo and HP, (Abdelhadi Decl., Dkt. 14-1, \u00b6 7). Accordingly, H.B. 89's prohibition on boycotts of Israel suppresses speech bearing no relation to discrimination on the basis of national origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   To reiterate, because H.B. 89 is not supported by a permissible aim of government, no amount of narrowing its application will cure its constitutional infirmity. Nevertheless, even if Texas's purported interests were the actual interests advanced by the statute, and even if they were compelling, the Court finds that H.B. 89 is overbroad in its restriction of protected speech. For this independent reason, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that H.B. 89 is an unconstitutional content-and viewpoint-based restriction on speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

First, they argue that the catch-all provision in the statute's definition of \"boycott\" makes unclear what activities Texas intends to prohibit. (Amawi Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 8-2, at 16-17; Pluecker Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 14-1, at 36). The statute defines \"boycott Israel\" to include \"\n   <em>\n    otherwise taking any action\n   </em>\n   that is intended to penalize, inflict harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israel or in an Israeli-controlled territory.\" Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue that this provision easily applies to political speech intending to persuade others to economically boycott or otherwise \"penalize\" Israel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amawi Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 8-2, at 17; Pluecker Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 14-1, at 37). For example, donating to a Palestinian organization, purchasing art at a Gaza liberation fair, donating to an organization like Jewish Voice for Peace that organizes BDS campaigns, or picketing outside Best Buy to urge shoppers not to buy HP products because of the company's relationship with the IDF-all these activities may be seen as \"taking any action that is intended to penalize, inflict harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel,\" though none would typically be considered a \"boycott.\" (Pluecker Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 14-1, at 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The State does not respond to this argument in its response to Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction. At best, in a footnote, it offers a clarifying construction when it argues that H.B. 89 does not address pure speech because the catch-all provision must be read in light of the two terms that precede it in the statute's definition of boycott. Those terms are (1) \"refusing to deal with\" and (2) \"terminating business relationships with\" Israel. (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 16 n.5 (quoting Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001 ) ). Texas asserts that these terms refer to \"conduct alone,\" so the statute must be understood as applying only to \"economic conduct, not speech.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But this is a false dichotomy. As explained in detail in Part III(B)(1)(i),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , economic conduct such as \"refusing to deal\" may also be inherently\n   <em>\n    expressive\n   </em>\n   conduct.\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in any event, Texas's construction of the statute considers the term \"any action\" out of context; it completely ignores the purposive language immediately following that term-\"intended to penalize, inflict harm on, or limit commercial relations\"-that identifies it as targeting conduct\n   <em>\n    because of its message.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that H.B. 89's vagueness problem is exacerbated by its carve-out provision. (Pluecker Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 14-1, at 37). Texas does not consider a refusal to transact with Israel \"for ordinary business purposes\" to be a \"boycott\" under H.B. 89. Tex. Gov. Code \u00a7 808.001. Plaintiffs assert that the term \"ordinary business purpose\" is not defined by H.B. 89 or in Texas case law. (Pluecker Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 14-1, at 38). Texas responds to this argument in another footnote. It argues that because \" 'ordinary business purpose' has a corollary in federal\n   bankruptcy law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2),\" it \"can be understood to refer to actions that a company would take in the course of its business in the absence of any intention not to deal with a company merely because that company is based in Israel.\" (Texas Resp. Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 23 n.7). This construction is wholly unsupported by the bankruptcy law Texas cites; that law does not itself supply any definition for \"ordinary business purpose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in any event, Texas's definition appears to simply define \"ordinary business purpose\" in the negative as any purpose that is not \"because [a] company is based in Israel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   This ineffectual clarification of H.B. 89's carve-out provision only serves to highlight the vagueness of its catch-all provision. A contractor need not boycott a company \"based in Israel\" in order to \"boycott Israel.\" Plaintiffs' boycotts of HP, for instance, are actions taken to \"boycott Israel\" under the statute because they are intended to \"penalize, inflict harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel\"-despite the fact that HP is not \"based in Israel.\" Because HP is not based in Israel, boycotts of it are taken \"in the absence of any intention not to deal with a company merely because that company is based in Israel.\" Such boycotts therefore fit into both the statute's definition for \"boycott Israel\" and its exception. Texas's interpretation of H.B. 89 thus makes it even more ambiguous than its plain text suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Furthermore, it is unclear to the Court how a contractor can ensure its actions comply with H.B. 89's no-boycott certification requirement after entering into a contract with the State. As Hale testifies: \"I am unsure now whether I could even\n   <em>\n    decline\n   </em>\n   to purchase [Ahava or HP products] if given the option, or if, by signing the [no-boycott] certification, it could be argued that I am now obliged to make such a purchase unless I can justify not doing so for business purposes.\" (Hale Decl., Dkt. 14-5, \u00b6 20) (original emphasis). His uncertainty is well-taken. Upon visiting Hale's office, would a state official tasked with enforcing H.B. 89 conclude that Hale is violating the terms of his contract if there are no HP computers in the office, in light of the fact that Hale previously refused to buy HP products as part of a BDS boycott? Must Hale's default action be to purchase HP products to ensure that he is not found liable for breaching his no-boycott certification? The statute offers no guidance to those who must enforce it or those who must comply with its dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that H.B. 89 does not give a person of ordinary intelligence a \"reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited\" with the \"greater degree of specificity\" required by the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 551 ;\n   <em>\n    Goguen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178884\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/566/#p573\">\n    415 U.S. at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178884\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/566/#p573\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mots. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 25, at 25). The Court has found, however, that H.B. 89 was not enacted for a legitimate purpose. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III(B)(1)(ii)(a),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, the State \"can never have a legitimate interest in administering [a regulation] in a way that violates federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v.

On the other hand, Plaintiffs have shown that they will likely succeed on the merits of each of their claims that H.B. 89 facially violates their First Amendment rights and the rights of all government contractors covered by the statute. Accordingly, this\n   factor also weighs in favor of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Plaintiffs have demonstrated (1) that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claims, (2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , 555 U.S. at 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Universities' 12(b)(6) Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Universities argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted because (1) Pluecker and Hale \"contract[ed] with the University of Houston and Texas A &amp; M University-Commerce [ (\"TAMUC\") ], respectively, rather than with UH System or Texas A &amp; M System\"; (2) \"the contracts at issue would not have needed approval from the board of regents of either system\"; and (3) \"Plaintiffs cannot show that the University Defendants are 'liable for the misconduct alleged.' \" (Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 24, at 5-6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). The Court rejects each argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   First, the Universities argue that Pluecker contracted with the University of Houston, not the University of Houston System, and that Hale contracted with TAMUC, not the Texas A &amp; M University System. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). These entities, the Universities aver, are distinct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs respond that this is a distinction without a difference. They sued the Board of Regents of the University of Houston System in the name of the University of Houston, and the Board of Regents of the Texas A &amp; M University System in the name of TAMUC. (Pluecker Compl., 1:18-CV-1100-RP, Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22). Plaintiffs allege that under the Texas Education Code, \"the organization and control of the University of Houston is vested in the Board of Regents of the University of Houston System.\" (Resp. Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 6 (citing Tex. Educ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 111.11, 111.20(c) ); Pluecker Compl., 1:18-CV-1100-RP, Dkt. 1, \u00b6 19). Likewise, \"[t]he Texas Education Code also provides that [TAMUC] is a component of The Texas A &amp; M University System and is under the management and control of the Board of Regents\n   of The Texas A &amp; M University System.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Tex. Educ. Code \u00a7 87.551 ); Pluecker Compl., 1:18-CV-1100-RP, Dkt. 1, \u00b6 22). The Universities do not contest these facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 45, at 2-3). The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Boards are \"ultimately responsible for the contracting practices and policies of the Universities\" with which Pluecker and Hale negotiated. (Resp. Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 7). Accordingly, Plaintiffs do not fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted merely because the University of Houston and TAMUC are formally distinct entities from the University of Houston System and the Texas A &amp; M University System, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Second, the Universities claim that the Boards would not have needed to approve Pluecker's or Hale's contracts because they delegated the authority to execute those contracts. (Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 24, at 6). Plaintiffs argue, however, that the Boards \"oversee, manage, and control\" the University of Houston and TAMUC \"and have general contracting power on behalf of those Universities.\" (Resp. Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 6; Pluecker Compl., 1:18-CV-1100-RP, Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22 (citing Tex. Educ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 85.18, 85.22, 87.551, 111.11, 111.33, 111.34, 111.35 ) ). This general contracting power includes the power to set the rules for delegating the authority to negotiate, approve, and execute contracts. (Resp. Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 6-7 (citing Tex. Educ. Code. \u00a7\u00a7 85.21, 111.34 ) ). Again, the Universities do not dispute these alleged facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 45, at 2-3). The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Boards remain \"ultimately responsible for the contracting practices and policies of the Universities with which Plaintiffs Pluecker and Hale negotiated, notwithstanding any delegation of authority\" and regardless of their \"personal involvement\" in negotiating those contracts. (Resp. Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 7). Accordingly, Plaintiffs do not fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted merely because the Boards delegated the authority to negotiate and execute Pluecker's and Hale's contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Finally, the Universities argue that because they are obligated to comply with H.B. 89, they are \"improper parties to a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the law itself.\" (Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 24, at 7). The Universities cite no authority for this argument. Plaintiffs maintain that their suit against the Universities is proper; they have brought a \u00a7 1983 claim against them under the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to sovereign immunity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908).

Their contention is simply that they are not liable for this violation because they must comply with Texas's law. (Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 24, at 7). Plaintiffs allege\n   that by relying on H.B. 89 to deny Pluecker and Hale state contracts, the Universities have enforced the statute against them and are thus liable under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   for the constitutional injuries resulting from that enforcement. (Resp. Univ. Ds.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 8). The Court agrees. Applying H.B. 89's no-boycott certification requirement to Plaintiffs through their contracts constitutes enforcing that requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052705\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/115/#p125\">\n    627 F.3d at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2010) (state actors' reliance on abortion statute to deny liability protection qualifies as enforcement for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   liability). And it does not matter that the Universities were obligated to apply H.B. 89 to Plaintiffs' contracts. The Universities fail to cite any authority supporting their claim that because they must follow Texas law, they are not liable for resulting violations of federal law. Such a requirement does not appear in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Air Evac EMS, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LISD Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 43, at 15-17; KISD Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 44, at 14-17). Plaintiffs counter that they have pleaded all three required elements of municipal liability: (1) that the Trustees are final policymakers for their school districts, (2) that the requirement that contractors do not and will not boycott Israel is an officially promulgated policy of the Trustees, and (3) that this policy is the moving force of the constitutional violation suffered by Abdelhadi and Dennar. (Resp. School Dist. Ds.' Mots. Dismiss, Dkt. 49, at 14-18). Accordingly, they believe they have sufficiently stated a claim for municipal liability under \u00a7 1983. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   First, Plaintiffs have pleaded, and the School Districts agree, that the Trustees are the final policymakers for their school districts.

Whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded the second and third elements-official policy and moving force-is disputed. The School Districts' argument that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead these elements is based on the fact that the Texas Legislature, not the Trustees, enacted H.B. 89. This distinction does not matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 requires plaintiffs to identify an official policy that is the moving force of their injuries in order to distinguish unconstitutional conduct marked by the municipality's imprimatur from isolated unconstitutional actions by municipal employees.\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p578\">\n    237 F.3d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The Court reiterates that this case is about whether Texas may prohibit boycotting the State of Israel as a condition of public employment. It is not about the merits of the significant and contentious public debate surrounding the relationship between Israel and Palestine. In coming to its conclusions, the Court is guided by first principles. \"At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for him or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence. Our political system and cultural life rest upon this ideal.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner Broad. Sys. v.

Twenty five states have enacted similar legislation or issued executive orders restricting boycotts of Israel, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3), and Congress has declared its opposition to the BDS movement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204452\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
