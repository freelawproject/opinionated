(ECF No. 37.) In this lawsuit, Preston asserts that FedEx terminated his employment because he is white,\n   because he is male, and in retaliation for reporting this alleged discrimination within the company. (Amended Complaint, ECF No. 16 at \u00b6 1.) FedEx argues that it discharged Preston because he cursed while speaking with a security guard and because he pulled over a FedEx tractor-trailer on public roads. (Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 323, 325\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) For the reasons set forth below, the Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Preston was hired by FedEx as a Senior Safety Specialist on December 1, 2004. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 591.) As a Senior Safety Specialist, Preston was responsible for enforcing FedEx safety rules. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1293.) On November 8, 2012, Preston received a warning letter for \"disruptive behavior\" in connection with a confrontation with a coworker. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2211 ; Dep. of Ronnie White, ECF No. 46-5 at 1828-33 ; Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1321-22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Warning letters are formal disciplinary statements by FedEx that may accompany a suspension or termination. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1312-13 ; Acceptable Conduct, ECF No. 37-9 at 510 (\"Warning Letters serve as a notification of behavioral deficiency.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, Irene Parker, an African-American woman, became Preston's manager. (Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-3 at 1071 ; Affidavit of Irene Parker, ECF No. 37-10 at 524.) Parker in turn reported to senior manager Keither Toperzer. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1289, 1311-12.) When deposed, Parker testified that she supervised the day-to-day activities of safety specialists and had the discretion to impose discipline. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1297-98 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2212.) Eight security specialists, including Preston, reported to Irene Parker between her promotion to manager in 2013 and Preston's termination in November 2015. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 591-92 ; Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1301.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    i. The October 2015 Warning Letter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 16, 2015, Preston had to drive from the FedEx central hub to his office to collect documents for a meeting later that night. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 598 ; Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-2 at 809.) There was no company car available for Preston, so he rode as a passenger with fellow Security Specialist Laura Jewell. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 598 ; Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-2 at 808.) Preston stated that he was \"very anxious\" because he only had about ten minutes to get to his meeting. (Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-2 at 808.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jewell pulled up to the security gate, which was manned by security officer Keva Banks, to leave the FedEx hub. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 598, 602.) Feeling agitated because of a delay at the gate, Preston said something to the effect of, \"Come on. We've got shit to do. The badge is going to scan the same.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 598 ; Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-2 at 812 (stating \"I don't remember exact words that I said, but it sounds like me... So I would not dispute it.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   No. 45-2 at 812 (responding affirmatively when asked \"you were agitated because you had to get your stuff and make it back for a meeting with a senior manager; you were running late?\").) Parker investigated this incident, collected a statement by Jewell, interviewed Banks, and had a conversation with Preston. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 602 ; Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1466-72 ; Report of Irene Parker, ECF No. 46-7.) Parker discussed her investigation with Toperzer, Human Resources advisor Greg Richards, and Managing Director Thomas Lopez, who all concurred with the decision to discipline Preston for his behavior. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 602 ; Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2214 ; Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1327-28 ; 1332 (testifying that she submits draft warning letters to Human Resources and to her senior manager before she issues them); Richards-Lopez-Parker Emails, ECF No. 46-6 at 1946-47\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 5, 2015, Parker issued Preston a warning letter, which imposed a two-day suspension without pay. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2214-15 ; Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 616 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   October 5 Warning Letter, ECF No. 45-5 at 1238.) The warning letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   You displayed disrespect towards another employee by using profane language in your interaction with her. Specifically your profanity was directed towards [s]ecurity personnel during the execution of her duties. The investigation revealed, as corroborated by a witness, that you did initiate this misconduct. This conduct is similar to past behaviors for which you received disciplinary actions. Upon completion of our investigation, it was determined that your conduct was in violation of the Acceptable Conduct Policy, P2-5[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (October 5 Warning Letter, ECF No. 45-5 at 1238.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 7, 2015, Preston appealed the warning letter and the two-day suspension using FedEx's Guaranteed Fair Treatment Procedure (\"GFTP\"). (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 616.) At the end of the appeal process, management's decision was upheld. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 616-17, 619.) On October 8, 2015, Preston filed an internal complaint (referred to by the parties as an \"internal EEO\" or an \"IEEO\") with FedEx alleging that he was discriminated against by Parker because of his race, age and sex. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2216 ; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Requests for Admissions, ECF No. 45-1 at 646 ; Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-2 at 820-22.) During a conference call on October 13, 2015, Parker was told that Preston had filed this internal complaint against her. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    ii. The November 2015 Warning Letter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the early morning hours of November 11, 2015, Preston saw a FedEx 18-wheel\n   truck run a stop sign on Republican Drive in Memphis, Tennessee. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 621 ; Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2222.) Preston blew his horn, flashed his lights, and pulled the truck over. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 629-30 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Edwin Preston, ECF No. 45-2 at 844-45.) Preston issued a Safety Observation Warning to the truck driver, Samuel Williams. (Preston-McLeod-Richards Email, ECF No. 48-11 at 2180.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 12, 2015, FedEx suspended Preston with pay pending an investigation into a potential violation of FedEx policy in connection with the stop of Williams's truck. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 631.) Toperzer and Parker conducted that investigation. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1584 (\"I only conducted part of the investigation and when I turned it over to Keith Toperzer and he did his portion of it\").) During a meeting on November 19, 2015, Parker and Toperzer informed Preston that FedEx would terminate him. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 633.) During that meeting, Preston was given a warning letter and termination notice signed by Parker. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 633 ; Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1587.) The Warning Letter and termination notice stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 11, 2015, near the Memphis Hub and public roadways of Republican, Democrat and Tchulahoma, you committed an unsafe act while on duty in a Company vehicle. Specifically, your actions in the pursuing and stopping a FedEx Express Tractor Trailer on a major public roadway caused an unsafe situation, potentially impacted service to our customers, and initiated a confrontation with a driver during the course of his route. You previously had been directed not to block a vehicle in the process of investigating a possible safety violation. Upon completion of our investigation, it was determined that your conduct was in violation of the Acceptable Conduct Policy (P2-5), a copy of which is attached for your review. As a result of your behavior, this Warning Letter is being issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A review of your disciplinary history indicates that you have received three Warning letters within the past five years for similar misconduct:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

(Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2229 ; Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 633.) Management's decision was upheld. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 633.) Preston's position was filled by an African-American male. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2213.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Preston alleged race and sex discrimination in connection with his October and November suspensions in a Charge of Discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (\"EEOC\") on November 13, 2015. ( Charge of Discrimination, ECF No. 1-1 at 24.) On November 19, 2015, Preston filed an amended\n   charge, claiming that he was discharged in retaliation for filing a previous internal complaint and for filing his initial EEOC Charge. (Amended Charge of Discrimination, ECF No. 1-1 at 26.) Preston received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC on September 7, 2017. ( Dismissal and Notice of Rights, ECF No. 16-2 at 122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Preston filed this lawsuit on December 5, 2017 and filed an amended complaint on January 11, 2018.

(Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 328.) FedEx also claims that Preston cannot point to similarly-situated minority or women employees who were treated more favorably than he was.

(Pl.'s Resp. Opp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 44 at 569.) The Sixth Circuit has held that showing that the decisionmaker in question is a racial minority or a woman is \"sufficient\" to satisfy the background circumstances requirement.\n   <em>\n    Zambetti v.

FedEx contends that the Court should reject this interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   , because the African-American decisionmaker in that case \"had consistently promoted other African American employees over white employees; and... made the promotional decision while disregarding the recommendation of a selection committee.\" (Mem.

First, the Sixth Circuit itself has stated that \"Sixth Circuit precedent suggests, in the context of reverse discrimination claims, that the mere fact that an adverse employment decision was made by a member of a racial minority is sufficient to establish the first prong of the prima facie case.\"\n   <em>\n    Arendale v.

Second, FedEx's interpretation that\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   holds that one must show consistent promotion of racial minority employees over white employees would suggest that the Court should combine the background circumstances and similarly-situated\n   comparator requirements; such an understanding would collapse a four-part test into a three-part test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Treadwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479934\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/447/676/#p679\">\n    447 F. App'x 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 (6th Cir. 2011). Third, the Sixth Circuit has also noted that \"the 'background circumstances' prong, only required of 'reverse discrimination' plaintiffs, may impermissibly impose a heightened pleading standard on majority victims of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381089\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/249/#p257\">\n    314 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This suggests that the Court should adopt a permissive understanding of the \"background circumstances\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381089\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/249/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fourth, the Sixth Circuit found that the selection committee in\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   relied on by FedEx could not be relied on in reaching a decision.\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381089\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/249/#p257\">\n    314 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We agree with the district court that how frequently Chief Harris disregarded the [Selection Advisory Committee]'s recommendation is meaningless without knowing how many times the committee recommended someone with less seniority.\") The selection committee in\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   was only relevant (if at all) in that, by disregarding it, the police chief made clear that the promotion decision at issue was his alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381089\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/249/#p257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   This leads to FedEx's next argument that Preston cannot show sufficient background circumstances. FedEx claims that\n   <em>\n    Zambetti\n   </em>\n   simply does not apply, because the decisions to discipline and terminate Preston were made collectively with Toperzer and Richards, two white men. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 331-32.) FedEx argues, in other words, that even if the decisionmaker's minority status is sufficient to show background circumstances, Parker was not the only decisionmaker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

Mar. 24, 2010) (holding that a plaintiff cannot demonstrate \"background circumstances\" solely through the minority status of a manager if the decision was made by multiple managers, including managers of plaintiff's race).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   FedEx's argument fails at this stage because there is a genuine dispute as to the involvement of Toperzer and Richards in the decision to discipline and discharge Preston. Preston argues that Parker was the \"driving force\" behind FedEx's decisions, and heavily influenced the disclosure and interpretation of facts to higher-ups, including Toperzer and Richards. (Pl.'s Resp. Opp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 44 at 5170.) Parker testified that she never instituted discipline \"without getting the input from HR,\" but answered affirmatively when asked \"it's up to you whether you issue the warning letter, correct?\" (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF no. 45-9 at 1327-28.) Although Parker also testified that \"if my HR says to put it in or not to put in, I'm going to go along with whatever that HR, direction that HR gives me,\" her statement may reasonably suggest that Parker defers to human resources on the wording of warning letters, but not necessarily the decision to issue them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1329.) As stated above, the parties do not dispute the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \u2022 \"Parker states the day-to-day supervision of specialists, including discipline, is left to her discretion.\" (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add.

Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2214.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   \u2022 \"Parker discussed the investigation... with her senior manager (Keith Toperzer, a white male) and human resources advisor (Greg Richards, a white male), both of whom\n   agreed that discipline was warranted.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 602.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \u2022 \"On October 5, 2015, Parker issued Preston a Warning Letter with 2-day suspension without pay.\" (Def.'s Resp.

Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 616.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to Preston, these facts would support a reasonable inference that Parker had the power to discipline her employees, which she exercised by suspending Preston for his interaction with Banks. While Toperzer and Richards \"agreed\" with Parker's decision, that does not necessarily mean that they influenced or critically evaluated it. A jury could reasonably conclude that the decision to suspend Preston in October 2015 was made by Parker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Drawing all reasonable inferences in Preston's favor, Parker might have also made the determination to issue the third and final warning letter and to terminate Preston. Although Parker denies having written the termination letter, she admits to having signed it. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 633 ; Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1587.) The parties do not dispute that Parker \"did most of the talking\" during Preston's termination meeting. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2227.) As stated above, there is evidence that Parker made the decision to issue warning letters. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF no. 45-9 at 1327-28.) Despite Parker's denial of authorship, a jury may reasonably conclude based on this evidence that Parker made the decision to terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Under Sixth Circuit law, the identity of the decisionmaker is sufficient to satisfy background circumstances in a reverse discrimination case.\n   <em>\n    Arendale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552853\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/587/#p603\">\n    519 F.3d at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Parker, an African-American woman, may have decided to issue the two warning letters at issue in this case.

(Pl.'s Resp. Opp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 44 at 572.) Parker testified that Chatman made \"inappropriate comments\" to Safety Specialist Marlene Douglas based on Douglas's Jamaican ancestry. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1426-27 ; Dep. of M.A. Winn, ECF No. 45-4 at 1219-20 (answering that Marlene Douglas cried at a meeting involving Chatman's statements about Douglas's Jamaican ancestry).) Parker testified that no\n   investigation took place because Douglas chose \"not to proceed\", but also stated that a human resources manager personally heard these disparaging comments. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1427-28.) When viewed in the light most favorable to Preston, Douglas's choice not to proceed with an internal complaint is irrelevant, because the personal presence of a human resources professional gave FedEx sufficient evidence to discipline Chatman. Preston's statement to a security officer, while impolite, may not necessarily have been an angry or harassing remark, especially because casual profanity was common at FedEx. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2215-16.) A reasonable jury could find Preston's single use of profanity less egregious than Chatman's comments about national origin. Such a finding would support a prima facie showing of discrimination on the basis of race and sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   There is also a genuine dispute as to whether Preston was similarly situated to Safety Specialist M.A. Winn, an African-American man. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 591-92.) There is evidence that Winn sometimes referred to Marlene Douglas as \"Marley.\" (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1341.) Irene Parker testified that she warned Winn to stop using this nickname, but only because it was not Marlene Douglas's name. (Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1342-43.) A reasonable jury may conclude that this nickname is a reference to Bob Marley, a Jamaican singer-songwriter, and another joke about Douglas's heritage. There is no evidence that Parker issued a warning letter to Winn for these comments, even though Parker testified that Douglas did not like the nickname. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Irene Parker, ECF No. 45-9 at 1341 (discussing her decision to issue an OLCC to Winn but not a more severe warning letter);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Requests for Admissions, ECF No. 45-1 at 646 (admitting that \"Defendant does not regard [an OLCC] as disciplinary in nature\").) A reasonable jury may conclude that Parker's actions represent willful ignorance of an offensive joke about national origin that is worse than Preston's interaction with Banks. When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Preston, Winn engaged in similar conduct and was not disciplined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   A jury may reasonably find that Winn was also similarly situated to Preston in pursuing a FedEx vehicle on public roads. Winn stated that he pursued and stopped a FedEx tractor-trailer truck after he saw it run a stop sign on Republican Drive. (Dep. of M.A. Winn, ECF No. 45-4 at 1205-1206.) FedEx does not point to evidence that suggests it has disciplined or warned Winn since learning of the stop, nor has the Court found such evidence upon a review of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pharos Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3624074\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/535/522/#p523\">\n    535 F.

Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 334.) First FedEx claims that, even though Winn pursued the truck on public streets, he \"did not bring the [truck] to [a] stop on city streets.\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 334.) The Court finds that this caveat is not relevant, because the dangerous part of both behaviors appears to be the pursuit on public roads, not the stop itself.\n   <em>\n    Ercegovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11704114\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/154/344/#p352\">\n    154 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, FedEx claims that the situations are different, because \"[t]he first FedEx learned of this behavior was at Winn's deposition, which took place on September 25, 2018.\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 334.) FedEx provides no citation to the record in support of this\n   contention, nor does this statement appear in either parties' statements of material fact. (Mem. Supp. Mot.

Winn testified that he did not report the encounter to his superiors, but FedEx has pointed to no evidence that could prove that FedEx never learned of the Winn's pursuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pharos Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3624074\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/535/522/#p523\">\n    535 F.

Preston has directed the Court to sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on the first prong of a prima facie case of retaliatory termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court next considers whether there is a genuine dispute as to the second prong, whether FedEx knew about Preston's complaint. The parties do not dispute that, \"On October 13, 2015, Preston, Parker, Toperzer, Lopez, and Richards took part in a GFTP telephonic conference regarding the October 5 Warning Letter. On this call, Preston stated he filed an [internal\n   discrimination complaint] against Parker and therefore objected to her continued participation on the call.\" (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2217.) The parties also do not dispute that \"Parker was told about the EEO before the teleconference call on October 13.\" (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2217-18.) By October 13, 2015, Parker knew of Preston's internal discrimination complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Preston therefore survives summary judgment on the second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   FedEx does not dispute that termination is an adverse employment action, so the Court turns to the fourth element, causal connection. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 328.) In some circumstances, temporal proximity alone may be sufficient to support an inference of a causal connection in a Title VII retaliation case.\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v. City of Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11186852\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/559/#p563\">\n    229 F.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 567 (6th Cir. 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Shefferly v.

In this case, Preston was terminated a little over a month and a half after he made his internal complaint, and about a month after Parker was told about the complaint in a conference call. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Material Facts, ECF No. 44-2 at 633 ; Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2216-18.) Parker personally knew about the internal complaint. (Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Add. Material Facts, ECF No. 53 at 2217-18.) The Court finds that this undisputed personal knowledge and the brief timeframe together create a genuine dispute as to whether there was a causal connection between Preston's internal complaint and his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, FedEx states that it terminated Preston \"for an egregious violation of policy that put himself, the public, and the company at risk.\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 322.) Preston's termination letter states, \"The Acceptable Conduct Policy (P2-5) provides that recurrent patterns of misconduct cannot be tolerated. Therefore, your employment is terminated effective today.\" (Termination Letter, ECF No. 48-3 at 2105 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FedEx Acceptable Conduct Manual, ECF No. 37-9 at 510-11 (\"Based on the severity of the occurrence an employee may be terminated with less than three notifications of deficiency within a 12-month period.\").) The Acceptable Conduct Policy further states, \"Recurrent patterns of misconduct cannot be tolerated. Normally, a recurrent pattern of misconduct consists of at least two occurrences of\n   the same or similar conduct in the past 5 years.\" (FedEx Acceptable Conduct Manual, ECF No. 37-9 at 510.) To summarize, FedEx states two different but related reasons for Preston's termination: that he committed an \"egregious violation of policy\" that posed a safety risk, and that he displayed a \"recurrent pattern of misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    i. There is a genuine dispute as to whether Preston committed an \"egregious violation\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Preston directs the Court to sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether FedEx's terminated him for a safety violation. As stated above, Winn pursued and stopped a FedEx tractor-trailer after he saw it run a stop sign on Republican Drive. (Dep. of M.A. Winn, ECF No. 45-4 at 1205-1296.) Winn also testified that he believed performing the pursuit and stop was a part of his job duties. (Dep. of M.A. Winn, ECF No. 45-4 at 1207 (answering \"yes\" when asked, \"did you believe that that was part of your job duties?\").) A jury might reasonably conclude that, if Winn believed that pursuit of a vehicle was part of the safety specialist's duties, then such an action was not egregious enough to warrant termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   As stated above, FedEx claims that Winn's behavior is less serious because, even though Winn pursued the truck on public streets, he \"did not bring the [truck] to stop on city streets.\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 37-1 at 334.) A jury may reasonably conclude that the pursuit on public roads is far more dangerous than the stop. Winn's testimony that he believed pursuit on public roads was part of the safety specialist's job duties and the lack of any evidence suggesting that FedEx has warned Winn since learning of the pursuit, each create a genuine dispute as to whether FedEx genuinely believed that such a pursuit was a sufficiently \"egregious violation of policy\" to warrant termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <em>\n    ii. There is a genuine dispute as to whether the October 2012 letter and the October 2015 letter are sufficient to explain FedEx's behavior\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Preston also points to sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether FedEx terminated him because he displayed a \"recurrent pattern of misconduct.\" When viewed in the light most favorable to Preston, the termination letter only cursorily mentions these two letters, and instead focuses on the stop of the FedEx truck. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Warning Letter/Termination, ECF No. 48-3 at 2106.) A jury may reasonably interpret the termination letter to conclude that these two letters, alone, did not actually motivate FedEx. Additionally, a jury may reasonably infer that the two letters alone do not fully explain FedEx's actions, because FedEx did not terminate Preston until his warning letter for the truck stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    iii. There is a genuine dispute as to whether the three letters together constitute \"same or similar\" conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   There is also a genuine dispute as to whether the use of all three letters for a \"recurrent pattern\" termination is pretextual. A jury may reasonably conclude that Preston's interaction with a security officer in 2015 and his disagreement with a coworker in 2012 is not the \"same or similar\" to performing an unauthorized pursuit of a vehicle on public roads. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Ronnie White, ECF No. 46-5 at 1830 (stating that the 2012 warning letter was not issued for an unsafe act).) The jury may further reasonably conclude that these earlier interpersonal conflicts are so unlike an unauthorized traffic stop that FedEx must not have actually believed that the three letters formed a \"recurrent pattern.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that there is a genuine dispute as to whether Preston was terminated because of his race, his sex, or his protected activity under Title VII. The Court further finds that there is a genuine dispute as to whether FedEx's offered reasons for Preston's termination are pretextual. The Motion for Summary Judgment is therefore DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , this 11th day of April, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    References to page numbers in docket entries are to CM/ECF PageID numbers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    It does not appear that the 2012 warning letter itself is in the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    FedEx includes this document in its blanket objection that certain exhibits \"contain inadmissible speculation, hearsay and conclusory statements.\" (Reply Supp. Mot.
