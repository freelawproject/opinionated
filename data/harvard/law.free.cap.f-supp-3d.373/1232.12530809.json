Tribal sovereign immunity protects ANTHC from suit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Indian tribes have long been recognized as possessing the common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   This tribal immunity extends to tribal governing bodies and to tribal agencies or entities which act as an \"arm of the tribe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tribal sovereign immunity may extend to an organization created by more than one tribe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ANTHC is a statewide Alaska Native tribal health consortium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was established pursuant to Section 325 of Public Law 105-83 with the purpose of \"entering into self-determination and self-governance agreements with the Indian Health Service [ (\"IHS\") ] to operate and manage health services\" for the benefit of Alaska Native tribes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also a Co-Signer of the Alaska Tribal Health Compact (\"ATHC\"), which authorizes tribes and tribal health organizations to operate health and health-related\n   programs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   ANTHC has funding agreements with the IHS, and provides \"a wide range of medical health, community health and other services\" for Alaska Natives that were formerly provided by the IHS's Alaska Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   ANTHC is controlled by a 15-member Board of Directors comprised of Alaska Native representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Twelve directors are selected by the twelve regional Alaska Native tribal health consortia, which are \"comprised of, and controlled by, the federally-recognized Alaska Native tribes from their respective regions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   One director is appointed by the Metlakatla Indian Community, a federally recognized Alaska Native tribe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final two directors are elected by Alaska Native tribes that are not affiliated with a regional health consortium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has considered whether a particular entity constitutes an \"arm of a tribe\" that is entitled to tribal sovereign immunity on several occasions. In\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Gold Country Casino\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit considered whether a casino that was owned and operated by the federally recognized Tyme Maidu Tribe was entitled to tribal sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Circuit Court noted that the Casino's creation \"was dependent upon [tribal and state] government approval\" as required pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further noted that one of the purposes of IGRA is to ensure \"that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation,\" and that the interstate gaming compact that created the casino provided that it would \"enable the Tribe to develop self-sufficiency, promote tribal economic development, and generate jobs and revenues to support the Tribe's government and governmental services and programs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of \"the purposes for which the Tribe founded this Casino and the Tribe's ownership and control of its operations,\" the Circuit Court concluded that the casino \"functions as an arm of the Tribe ... [and] accordingly enjoys the Tribe's immunity from suit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In conducting its analysis of sovereign immunity, the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   court relied in part on\n   <em>\n    Marceau v. Blackfeet Housing Authority.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Marceau\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit considered whether the Blackfeet Housing Authority (\"BHA\") was entitled to sovereign immunity. The BHA was established by the Blackfeet Tribe as required by Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BHA's enabling ordinance charged it with \"[a]lleviating the acute shortage of decent, safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income\" and \"[r]emedying unsafe and [u]nsanitary\n   housing conditions that are injurious to the public health, safety and morals.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   HUD granted the BHA authorization and funding that was used to build homes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noting that tribal sovereign immunity \"extends to agencies and subdivisions of the tribe,\" the Circuit Court concluded that \"the Blackfeet Tribe's sovereign immunity extends to the Blackfeet Housing Authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    White v. University of California\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit identified five factors that courts should consider when determining whether an entity is entitled to tribal sovereign immunity: \"(1) the method of creation of the economic entities; (2) their purpose; (3) their structure, ownership, and management, including the amount of control the tribe has over the entities; (4) the tribe's intent with respect to the sharing of its sovereign immunity; and (5) the financial relationship between the tribe and the entities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit Court considered whether the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee (\"KCRC\") constituted an \"arm\" of the member tribes of the Kumeyaay Nation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   The KCRC was formed pursuant to resolutions by the twelve Kumeyaay Nation members tribes to address \"concerns over the repatriation efforts, or lack thereof, under [the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act (\"NAGPRA\") ] in San Diego.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the five factors described above, the Circuit Court concluded that the KCRC was an \"arm of the tribe\" that was entitled to sovereign immunity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he Repatriation Committee was created by resolution of each of the Tribes, with its power derived directly from the Tribes' sovereign authority. The Repatriation Committee is comprised solely of tribal members, who act on its behalf. KCRC tribal representatives are appointed by each tribe. The process by which the Repatriation Committee designates the particular tribe to receive remains under NAGPRA is defined and accepted by the Tribes. The Repatriation Committee is funded exclusively by the Tribes. As the district court noted, the whole purpose of the Repatriation Committee, to recover remains and educate the public, is \"core to the notion of sovereignty.\" Indeed, \"preservation of tribal cultural autonomy [and] preservation of tribal self-determination,\" are some of the central policies underlying the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity. Given these undisputed facts, the district court properly concluded that the Repatriation Committee was an \"arm of the tribe\" for sovereign immunity purposes ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   These cases suggest that ANTHC is an arm of Alaska's tribes that is entitled to sovereign immunity. Like the casino examined in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , ANTHC's creation was authorized pursuant to a federal law intended to promote tribal self-sufficiency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   And like the BHA, ANTHC receives federal funding to conduct activities that benefit tribe members. The factors identified in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   also indicate that ANTHC is entitled to sovereign immunity. ANTHC was formed by Alaska Native tribes. By \"entering into self-determination and self-governance agreements\" with the IHS, ANTHC provides and manages health services that benefit members of Alaska Native tribes. The structure of ANTHC's board places control over the ANTHC's ownership and management in representatives of the Alaska Native tribes. Like the KCRC, ANTHC's purpose - entering into \"self-determination and self-governance agreements\" - is \"core to the notion of sovereignty.\" Finally, ANTHC receives federal funding to carry out governmental functions critical to Alaska Native tribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In her opposition, Ms. Barron contends that the Fourth Circuit has rejected the contention \"that Alaska Native Corporations have sovereign immunity such as to avoid \u00a7 1981 claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case she cites for this proposition is distinguishable, however. In\n   <em>\n    Aleman v. Chugach Support Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit concluded that Chugach Support Services, Inc. (\"Chugach\") was not entitled to sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike ANTHC, the entity examined in\n   <em>\n    Aleman\n   </em>\n   was a for-profit Alaska Native Corporation created pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (\"ANCSA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Alaska Native Corporations are owned and managed by Alaska Natives, they are distinct legal entities from Alaska Native tribes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Aleman\n   </em>\n   court recognized, the question whether sovereign immunity shields a tribe from liability is distinct from the question whether \"ownership of ... corporations by Alaska Natives and their devisees, or any other attribute, entitles [those corporations] to immunity from suits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike an Alaska Native Corporation, ANTHC is an entity created and controlled by Alaska Native tribes that promotes tribal self-determination and fulfills governmental functions. Accordingly, it constitutes an arm of the Alaska Native tribes that is entitled to sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. ANTHC's tribal sovereign immunity is a bar to \u00a7 1981 liability.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Suits against Indian tribes and entities that constitute an \"arm of a tribe\" are barred by sovereign immunity, \"absent a clear waiver ... or congressional abrogation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"There is a strong presumption against waiver of tribal sovereign immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Waiver of sovereign immunity may not be implied and must be expressed unequivocally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, congressional abrogation of sovereign immunity may not\n   be implied and must be \"unequivocally expressed\" in \"explicit legislation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, Ms. Barron's suit alleges disparate treatment and retaliation on the basis of race in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no indication that ANTHC has waived its immunity for such a claim. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether Congress has abrogated tribal sovereign immunity as to \u00a7 1981 claims. While the Ninth Circuit has not addressed this question, other circuits have concluded that tribal sovereign immunity is a bar to \u00a7 1981 liability. In\n   <em>\n    Yashenko v. Harrah's NC Casino Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit concluded without elaboration that the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians enjoyed sovereign immunity from a \u00a7 1981 suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Aleman\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed that it had \"recognized Indian tribal immunity as a bar to Section 1981 liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Alabama Intertribal Council Title IV J.T.P.A.\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \"nothing in \u00a7 1981 supports the proposition that Congress intended to abrogate tribes' immunity and permit private parties to bring employment discrimination claims against them for intramural tribal employment decisions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ninth Circuit cases addressing statutory abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity provide additional guidance. In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit Court held that NAGPRA did not abrogate tribal sovereign immunity, even though its enforcement clause grants district courts \"jurisdiction over any action brought by any person alleging a violation of [NAGPRA].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Circuit Court noted that the clause \"does not contain any language expressly abrogating tribal sovereign immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reaching this conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court relied in part on\n   <em>\n    Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court indicated that a statutory provision conferring on federal courts \"jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person\" did not abrogate tribal sovereign immunity with respect to a suit to secure enforcement of Title I the Indian Civil Rights Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Wright\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded that tribal immunity was not abrogated by federal antitrust laws that referred to states, foreign nations, and \"corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of any State, or the laws of any foreign country.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, in\n   <em>\n    Krystal v. Navajo Nation\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that the Bankruptcy Code abrogated tribal sovereign immunity with respect to an adversary action under the Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Circuit Court noted that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) expressly abrogated the sovereignty of all \"governmental units,\" and that a separate provision defining \"governmental units\" established that all \"foreign or domestic governments\" are considered governmental units for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   These cases suggest that Congress has not abrogated tribes' sovereign immunity from \u00a7 1981 liability. Unlike the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 1981 does not include language clearly expressing an intent to abrogate the sovereign immunity of all governmental units, including Indian tribes. Rather, the statute's articulation of rights applicable to \"[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States\" is similar to the statutory language examined in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martinez.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Congress has not \"unequivocally expressed\" an intent to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity in \"explicit legislation.\" Because ANTHC is entitled to sovereign immunity, and because immunity from \u00a7 1981 claims has not been waived by the tribe or abrogated by Congress, ANTHC is immune from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In light of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that ANTHC's Motion to Dismiss at Docket 9 is GRANTED.
