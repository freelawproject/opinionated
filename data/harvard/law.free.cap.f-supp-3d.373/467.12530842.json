Local Law 146\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This case arises out of the City's efforts to regulate home-sharing platforms and the market for peer-to-peer apartment rentals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2010, the New York State Legislature enacted a law prohibiting the rental of most apartments for a period of fewer than 30 days in \"Class A\" multiple dwellings-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , buildings occupied for permanent residence purposes by three of more families living independently-unless a permanent resident remains on the premises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Multiple%20Dwelling%20Law%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). The law's stated purpose is to regulate the adverse effects of short-term rentals in residential buildings. These include \"overcrowding of multiple dwelling rooms, inadequate provision for light and air, and insufficient protection against the defective provision for escape from fire, and improper sanitation of multiple dwellings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Multiple%20Dwelling%20Law%20%C2%A7%204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.

The City views these regulations as necessary on the grounds that short-term rentals (1) pose health and safety risks to permanent residents and guests; (2) reduce the availability of permanent housing; (3) drive up rents; and (4) adversely impact the character of residential neighborhoods. Klossner Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3 n.1, 9, 12, 22, 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In July 2018, in an effort to crack down on short-term rentals that violate the Multiple Dwelling Laws and related regulations, the City Council's Committee on Housing &amp; Buildings proposed the legislation that would become the Ordinance. The report accompanying the proposed legislation stated that the Ordinance would \"further address the adverse effect[s], well-documented by a number of reports issued and studies conducted by both governmental and non-governmental organizations, resulting from conversion of permanent housing to rentals under 30 days.\" Klossner Decl. Ex. G (\"Committee Report\") at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 18, 2018, the City Council unanimously approved the proposed legislation. On August 6, 2018, the Mayor signed it into law.

They depict the Ordinance as the product of a concerted lobbying effort by rival industries aimed at hobbling home-sharing platforms' ability to do business in New York City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Airbnb Br. at 6-9. Specifically, they assert that the hotel industry pursued a national lobbying campaign with the goal of impairing home-sharing platforms' ability to compete with traditional hotels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Quinn Decl. Ex. C (April 16, 2017 Article) at 1 (reporting that presentation minutes for a hotel industry conference stated that a hotel lobbying group was pursuing a \"multipronged, national campaign approach at the local, state and federal government\" to promote regulations to limit Airbnb's ability to do business). Plaintiffs further assert that the hotel industry has worked with City regulators to target illegal rental listings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Quinn Decl. Ex. T (July 12, 2017 Article), at 4 (reporting that hotel industry funds private investigators who alert City regulators to potentially illegal listings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Airbnb and HomeAway make four arguments as to why the Ordinance is unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the platforms argue, the Ordinance is facially invalid under the Fourth Amendment. Largely relying on\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v. Patel\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), they argue that the Ordinance unconstitutionally compels them to turn over information in which they have a protected Fourth\n   Amendment interest without any opportunity for pre-compliance review before a neutral decision-maker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, for similar reasons, the platforms argue, the Ordinance violates Article I, Section 12 of the New York Constitution, which, like the Fourth Amendment, guarantees the right to be free from unreasonable searches, seizures, and interceptions. N.Y. Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, the platforms argue, the Ordinance conflicts with, and so is preempted by, the SCA. Under the SCA, \"a provider of remote computing services or electronic communication services to the public shall not knowingly divulge a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such service ... to any governmental entity\" unless the user consents or other legal process is observed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), (c)(1) ; 2703(c). Airbnb and HomeAway argue that the Ordinance conflicts with that provision because it requires booking services to divulge information about customers without a subpoena or other legal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the platforms argue, the Ordinance violates their First Amendment rights because it compels them to communicate to platform users a message that they do not wish to speak: that users must consent to the production to OSE of their personal data, and that use of the platform will constitute consent to that disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to the remaining preliminary injunction factors, Airbnb and HomeAway argue that, without such relief, they will suffer irreparable harm and that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in their favor. They argue primarily that the Ordinance will cause ongoing violations of their constitutional rights. They also argue that it will force them to incur heavy compliance costs and/or civil fines for noncompliance. In contrast, they argue, a preliminary injunction will not prejudice the City, because, while the Ordinance's legality is litigated on a full record, the City can continue to investigate violations of the Multiple Dwelling Laws using conventional information-gathering tools such as targeted subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The October 5, 2018 Hearing on the Motions for Preliminary Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On October 5, 2018, the Court held a hearing to discuss issues raised by the preliminary injunction motions. The hearing covered several topics relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stay of discovery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : The Court had ordered the parties, before the conference, to confer regarding a discovery schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32.

Does the Fourth Amendment Apply to the Ordinance?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Airbnb and HomeAway's challenge to the Ordinance requires the Court to apply the Fourth Amendment to a novel form of state action: a municipal ordinance that requires each participant in an e-commerce industry to produce to a regulator, each month, a large subset of its user database. The Ordinance realistically could arise only in a world of cyber-stored data, in which e-commerce companies maintain vast electronic databases as to their users, from which they can, if compelled, regularly reproduce voluminous stored data for regulators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Specifically, the Ordinance compels each home-sharing platform operating in New York City every month to produce to regulator OSE a transaction report that effectively will replicate much of the platform's user database for all New York City rentals. The City Council did not specify how the platform is to make this production: whether by imaging for OSE the affected portions of its database, or by extracting responsive data and populating an OSE-prepared form with it, or by some other means.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the data that the platforms must produce is specified. For each short-term rental, each \"booking service\" must report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (1) the physical address of the rental;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (2) the full legal name, physical address, phone number, and email address of the host and the URL and individualized name and number of the host as used on the platform;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (3) the individualized name and number and the URL of each advertisement or listing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (4) a statement by the service as to whether the short-term rental transaction involved rental of the entirety of a dwelling unit or part of that unit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (5) the total number of days that the dwelling unit or part thereof was rented as a short-term rental through the booking platform;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (6) the total amount of fees received by such booking service for the short-term rental; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (7) the total amount of rent received by the service and transmitted to the host, the account name and account number (or consistently anonymized identifier for the account number) used by the host.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Ordinance's obligation to produce this data applies to all \"booking services\" and is of indefinite duration. The Ordinance does not restrict OSE's use of the booking service's data or OSE's ability to share it with criminal enforcement and other governmental authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   A threshold issue-which the parties' briefs largely gloss over-is whether the Fourth Amendment applies at all to the Ordinance. The Ordinance differs in two major respects from a paradigmatic search or seizure by law enforcement. First, it does not contemplate physical entry by a state actor onto the premises of the home-sharing platform. The platform instead, like the recipient of a regulatory subpoena, is ordered to furnish data to the OSE or\n   face financial penalties for failing to do so. Second, the Ordinance is not the act of an executive branch actor. It is an act of municipal legislation that compels the production of data to an executive branch regulator. Insofar as the paradigmatic Fourth Amendment search \"implies a quest by an officer of the law,\"\n   <em>\n    Hale v.

In light of\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , the platforms' facial challenge to the Ordinance here under the Fourth Amendment may similarly proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The City makes two separate arguments-specific to these plaintiffs-why Airbnb and HomeAway do not have, or once had but have relinquished, Fourth Amendment interests in the records covered by the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   First, it argues that the home-sharing platforms do not have a protected privacy interest in the data sought by the Ordinance, because this data largely relates to users of the platforms, not the platforms themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That argument is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   . The data sought there by the municipal regulation-including guests' names and addresses, and details about guests' vehicles-also largely originated\n   with guests, not the hotel operators. But the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   implicitly recognized-and the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   decision of the Ninth Circuit, which the Supreme Court affirmed, explicitly held-that the records at issue were ones in which the\n   <em>\n    hotel owners\n   </em>\n   had a reasonable expectation of privacy. As the Ninth Circuit put the point in explaining why the Fourth Amendment protects a hotel from unreasonable seizures of records that it prepares and maintains as to its guests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The business records covered by [the challenged ordinance] are the hotel's private property, and the hotel therefore has both a possessory and an ownership interest in the records. By virtue of those property-based interests, the hotel has the right to exclude others from prying into the contents of its records, which is also the source of its expectation of privacy in the records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Patel v.

Like a hotel, a home-sharing platform has at least two very good reasons to keep host and guest information private, whether as to these users' identities, contact information, usage patterns, and payment practices. One is competitive: Keeping such data confidential keeps such information from rivals (whether competing platforms or hotels) who might exploit it. The other involves customer relations: Keeping such data private assuredly promotes better relations with, and retention of, a platform's users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For these reasons, as the Ninth Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , customer-facing businesses, including in hospitality industries, \"do not ordinarily disclose, and are not expected to disclose ... commercially sensitive information\" such as \"customer lists,\" other customer-specific data, and \"pricing practices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1062 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    387 U.S. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The businessman, like the occupant of a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official entries upon his private commercial property.\");\n   <em>\n    Hale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"345076\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/201/43/#p76\">\n    201 U.S. at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"345076\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/201/43/#p76\">\n    26 S.Ct. 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , where the hotels were held to have a Fourth Amendment interest in the records of their guests, this Court holds that platforms have privacy interests in their user-related records that \"are more than sufficient to trigger Fourth Amendment protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1062.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Second, the City argues, even if the Ordinance effects a seizure of material otherwise protected by the Fourth Amendment, Airbnb and HomeAway have forfeited the right to claim a privacy interest in these records. They have done so, the City argues, in two ways. First, by policy, each platform has alerted users that if it is required or permitted to do so by law, it may disclose customer information to regulators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Airbnb Privacy Policy \u00a7 3.5; HomeAway Privacy Policy at 3. Second, when confronted with subpoenas for such data from OSE, the platforms historically have complied, and, either promptly or eventually, have \"disclose[d] their customers' personal information to third-parties, including governmental entities, based on\n   their consumers' consent.\" City Opp. Br. at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive. To the extent the City relies on policies of Airbnb and HomeAway that alert users that the platforms may be obliged to disclose user data to regulators, these bear on whether\n   <em>\n    users\n   </em>\n   of the platforms, having relinquished data to third party repositories such as Airbnb or HomeAway, may claim a reasonable expectation of privacy as against the platforms' disclosure of such data in response to lawful process.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2216 (\"We have previously held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties. That remains true even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ). But that quotidian notification to customers does not deprive the\n   <em>\n    platforms\n   </em>\n   of the right to claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in their business records chronicling their dealings with customers. It certainly does not disable the platforms from claiming that a search or seizure was unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   To the extent the City relies on the platforms' past compliance with subpoenas, the record reflects that such subpoenas to date have been limited in number and targeted in scope. The City has not identified any instance in which Airbnb or HomeAway, when not subject to compulsion by legal process, has voluntarily disclosed user data such as that covered by the Ordinance. The platforms' compliance with valid subpoenas did not relinquish, as against any future demand for user-related records, their Fourth Amendment interest in such materials. It did not relinquish the platforms' right to challenge the far more sweeping monthly seizures the Ordinance compels. Much as compliance with one subpoena does not preclude an entity from challenging a later subpoena, so, too, each platform retains the right to challenge under the Fourth Amendment the new Ordinance compelling the monthly surrender of vastly larger amounts of user data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court, finally, considers an argument the City disclaimed at the October 5 hearing, Hr'g Tr. at 67, but which it had earlier appeared to embrace.

And, the Court noted, precompliance review can be made available by means other than administrative subpoenas. \"[W]hatever the precise form, the availability of precompliance review alters the dynamic between the officer and the hotel to be searched, and reduces the risk that officers will use these administrative searches as a pretext to harass business owners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2454.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Court now evaluates, in light of these two lines of Fourth Amendment authority, the reasonableness of New York City's Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Two features of the Ordinance mitigate the official intrusion on the platforms' privacy and security interests. First, unlike the administrative inspection schemes at issue in cases like\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , the Ordinance does not entail the on-site presence of state officers or any physical entry into the quarters of the booking services subject to it. The Ordinance operates more like the agency subpoenas at issue in\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma Press, Morton Salt\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    McLane Co.\n   </em>\n   , and discussed in\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , in that it obliges booking services to produce records to an agency. Second, the Ordinance does not appear to give OSE discretion as to the information that the booking service is required to produce. Instead, the Ordinance prescribes that data, with commendable precision. Other potential infirmities aside, the Ordinance thus does not implicate one animating concern of the Fourth Amendment: \"random or arbitrary acts of government agents,\"\n   <em>\n    Skinner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p619\">\n    489 U.S. at 621-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p619\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , searching a business or residence unguided by \"specific neutral criteria,\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , 436 U.S. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p311\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In these respects, the Ordinance impinges on the protected Fourth Amendments of subject entities less than the Los Angeles ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , which obliged hotels to make their guest records available on demand to police for on-site review.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On the other hand, the scale of the production that the Ordinance compels each booking service to make is breathtaking. Each month, the Ordinance appropriates from every participant in the burgeoning home-sharing industry what is effectively a wholesale replica of that booking service's database as to New York City users. The information called\n   for appears to capture virtually all monthly information the service receives from each user.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had it been in effect in 2016, the Ordinance thus would have compelled Airbnb to produce user data as to each of the more than 700,000 bookings executed that year over Airbnb's platform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Airbnb Economic Report at 32. The Ordinance does not have a temporal sunset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In its sweep, the Ordinance dwarfs that of the Los Angeles ordinance at issue in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   . The universality of the Ordinance's monthly production demand (covering all short-term rentals in New York City), the sheer volume of guest records implicated, and the Ordinance's infinite time horizon all disfavor the Ordinance when evaluated for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Indeed, the Ordinance is the antithesis of a targeted administrative subpoena for business records. Under the line of cases reviewed above, to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, such a subpoena must have a limited scope, a relevant purpose, and specificity in its demands. These familiar conditions present \"rather minimal limitations on administrative action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , 387 U.S. at 544-45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But these limitations protect important constitutional interests in liberty and privacy. The requirement that an agency subpoena be targeted in these ways and not an invitation to a fishing expedition-that the agency \"delimit the confines of a search by designating the needed documents in a formal subpoena,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   -respects the Fourth Amendment interests of the subject entity. It enables a reviewing court to determine whether \"compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   By all appearances, however, the Ordinance is devoid of any tailoring. On the contrary, it appears to be the functional equivalent of a legislative edict mandating that OSE issue an identical subpoena to every covered booking service operating in New York City, every month starting in February 2019 and extending into perpetuity, calling for production of the prescribed data as to all New York City users. In contrast to a tailored subpoena, the Ordinance applies across-the-board to all short-term listings in New York City. It does so regardless whether there is any factual basis whatsoever to suspect that any particular listing, or user, or building, or complex, at issue is in violation of the Multiple Dwelling Laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The City's justification for the Ordinance's sweeping scope is that such a law would facilitate OSE's enforcement efforts. The City so explained at the October 5 hearing. Hr'g Tr. at 45. By giving OSE access, in substance if not form, to the listings databases of Airbnb, HomeAway, and other home-sharing platforms, the Ordinance would expedite OSE's mission of identifying listings that violate the Multiple Dwelling Laws. The Ordinance would spare OSE the need to build cases through conventional investigative means. Instead of developing leads as to illegal rentals (e.g., from neighbors, coop and condo boards, or other complainants) and then following up-including by issuing subpoenas to home-sharing platforms targeted to suspect listings-the OSE could henceforth search the platforms' electronic user records for unlawful or apparently unlawful listings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   At least on its record developed to date, the City's justification is less than convincing. OSE is able to document, in its history, issuing a combined 15 targeted subpoenas\n   to Airbnb and HomeAway. This limited track record hardly suggests that compliance with the historical Fourth Amendment standards governing administrative subpoenas, including tailoring, is impractical or destined to be ineffectual. The City's showing to date has not justified its bid, in the context of information demands to home-sharing platforms, to dispense with these familiar standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the Supreme Court, in fact, has repeatedly disdained justifications like that offered by the City. As the Court has repeatedly emphasized, while the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness command must adapt to changing times and technology, the test of reasonableness is not whether an investigative practice maximizes law enforcement efficacy. Other factors, including the extent of the intrusion on protected privacy interests, weigh heavily, often decisively, in the balance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2218 (invalidating, as inconsistent with the \"constraints of the Fourth Amendment,\" warrantless subpoenas for cell-site records, despite the capacity of such \"near perfect surveillance\" records to help police build cases);\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting government's defense of municipal ordinance that efficacy of law enforcement operations would be undermined were ordinance invalidated);\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    565 U.S. at 415-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the placement of a GPS tracking device on a vehicle was an unconstitutional search, notwithstanding that GPS devices provided law enforcement a \"cheap\" means to develop records \"and efficiently mine them for information\");\n   <em>\n    Gant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p338\">\n    556 U.S. at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p338\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment.\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Mincey v.

Some relate to historically heavily regulated industries.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , p. 485,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But, as\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   teaches, the hospitality (and, by extension, the home-sharing) industries do not qualify as such.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2454-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Others involve idiosyncratic \"special needs\" such as the drug-testing and school-search precedents.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , p. 491,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But OSE's probe into violations by hosts of the Multiple Dwelling Laws does not implicate the exigencies (such as the risk that evidence will disappear if not promptly seized) on which these decisions have relied in upholding searches despite the lack of individualized suspicion. OSE has not argued that the records covered by the Ordinance are apt otherwise to disappear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Ordinance thus presents, at a minimum, substantial questions as to whether its compelled monthly production of the entirety of booking services' New York\n   City user records is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Fourth Amendment requirement that there be some form of pre-compliance review exists to ensure that a neutral decisionmaker has evaluated questions such as this. From the perspective of a booking service, each monthly production obligation under the Ordinance may be likened to an administrative subpoena from OSE demanding the same materials. Under the lines of Fourth Amendment case law reviewed above, were Airbnb, HomeAway, or a like platform to receive such a subpoena, the platform would be entitled to litigate the legality of the subpoena before its enforcement in court. Airbnb in fact has litigated OSE's past subpoenas in this fashion. And for the reasons above, a platform challenging a demand that it produce a full set of its New York City user records for a given month would have, at a minimum, a substantial argument under the Fourth Amendment that the required production was unreasonable. The City, however, denied at the October 5 hearing that pre-compliance review is required of the monthly provision of data that the Ordinance compels. Hr'g Tr. 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (agreeing that \"month-in and month-out, every booking service that's covered simply has to turn over the pool of data described by the law without any intervening judge or magistrate passing judgment on it\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The City is wrong. As reflected in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , both lines of pertinent Fourth Amendment case authority-that involving agency subpoenas and that involving administrative inspections-have emphasized the need for some form of pre-compliance review.\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   's review of this authority, in fact, was the basis of its pronouncement that \"the subject of the search must be afforded an opportunity to obtain precompliance review before a neutral decisionmaker.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The City has not pointed to any provision that puts in place or identifies a mechanism for pre-compliance review. The Ordinance does not provide for a neutral forum before which a booking service could argue, before a monthly production deadline, that the demand for user data was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment (e.g., because of its scale or lack of tailoring). Nor does the Ordinance provide for a neutral forum before which a booking service could challenge a penalty for noncompliance imposed by OSE on the grounds that, as in\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   , the underlying demand for user records had violated the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   And as the colloquy at the\n   October 5 hearing demonstrated, these penalties, of up to $ 1,500 per listing, could prove punishing, if not an existential threat, to a booking service. That is so whether a \"listing\" is defined to refer to each offer of a premises for rental or to refer, in the aggregate, to all offers for that premises each month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 18-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The City has alternatively argued that, if pre-compliance review is required, the Court's evaluation of the Ordinance in this litigation would qualify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   City Opp. Br. at 17. But any such review by the Court could assess only whether the Ordinance, on its face, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. This Court's facial assessment in this litigation would not give a particular booking service a forum to challenge any particular application of the Ordinance. Even if the Ordinance were upheld facially, each booking service would have a right to challenge the Ordinance's application to it, in general and monthly, on the grounds that circumstances particular to it (e.g., disproportion between the scope of the production obligation and the suspected violations associated with that service) made the obligation and associated penalties unreasonable. The Ordinance, however, like the ordinance invalidated facially in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   for this failing, fails to provide a neutral forum in which a booking service could bring such a challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In any event, even if this Court's pre-effective-date assessment of the reasonableness of the Ordinance qualified as constitutionally adequate pre-compliance review, that assessment, albeit on the limited record developed to date, would not assist the City's cause. On the contrary, the Court's present assessment is that it is likely that the Ordinance's categorical demand that all booking services make sweeping monthly data productions would be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court largely bases this preliminary judgment on the considerations addressed above: most notably, the scale of the user data compelled to be produced, as measured against the precedents that require that the demands of subpoenas and regulatory searches and seizures be reasonably tailored and that reject governmental attempts to dispense with tailoring in the generalized interest of investigative efficacy. If each monthly demand is viewed as the functional equivalent of an OSE subpoena to each booking service, as the Court regards as appropriate, the expansive user records required be produced cannot be credibly described as \"limited in scope.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , 387 U.S. at 544,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ordinance's intrusion on protected Fourth Amendment interests is all the greater because (1) the user data in question is commercially sensitive and subject to potential disclosure; and (2) the Ordinance's requirement for monthly productions of such data is perpetual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   An historical perspective underscores this overreach. An attempt by a municipality in an era before electronic data storage to compel an entire industry monthly to copy and produce its records as to all local customers would have been unthinkable under the Fourth Amendment. It would have been out of bounds on the grounds of\n   excessive burden alone. The more ready ability of a modern company whose business is accomplished through cyber communications to comply with such a demand lessens the burden objection. But this should not obscure the extent to which the Ordinance departs from Fourth Amendment standards. A ruling upholding the Ordinance as reasonable would invite municipalities to make similar demands on e-commerce companies, whether by legislation or subpoena, for the routinized production to investigative agencies of broad-ranging records as to all users or customers. It would invite such productions so as to permit regulators to troll these records for potential violations of law, even as to customers as to which there had been no basis theretofore to suspect any violation of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Existing Fourth Amendment law does not afford a charter for such a wholesale regulatory appropriation of a company's user database. And the implications of upholding the Ordinance give pause, as just a few hypotheticals illustrate. By the City's logic, a City Council presumably could also compel (1) all online auction services monthly to produce all records of sales by New York City residents, on the premise that such records could assist in finding sellers who evaded capital gain taxes on sales of collectibles; (2) all medical providers monthly to produce all patient records for care rendered in New York City, on the premise that such records could assist in finding instances in which users engaged in up-coding and other health-care fraud; and (3) all credit card companies monthly to produce all records of expenditures in New York restaurants, on the premise that such records could assist in identifying instances in which commercial income was not reported to tax authorities. Although the Court does not resolve hypotheticals, these scenarios, and many others that the Ordinance readily conjures, underscore the potential far-reaching implications of the City's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On the record at hand, the Court therefore finds it likely that Airbnb and HomeAway will succeed in invalidating the Ordinance as unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. That is because (1) the Ordinance lacks a mechanism for pre-compliance review by a neutral of its monthly command that booking services produce their New York City user records; and (2) even if this facial injunctive action were treated as pre-compliance review, the City has not justified its sweeping capture of constitutionally protected records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Stored Communications Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court turns now to plaintiffs' argument that they are likely to prevail because the Ordinance conflicts with, and is preempted by, the Stored Communications Act. Although this argument is colorable, the Court is not prepared to conclude that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their merits of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The SCA is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (the \"ECPA\"), which Congress passed in 1986 to \"update and clarify the Federal privacy protections and standards in light of dramatic changes in new computer and telecommunications technologies.\" S.

The Ordinance at issue here, unlike the laws at issue in\n   <em>\n    Telecommunications Regulatory\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Homeaway.com\n   </em>\n   , provides that booking services must obtain \"from each host ... lawful consent\" to provide the information covered under the statute. N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 26-2102(b). The Ordinance does not specify the form such consent must take, but it does provide that consent may include \"advising or providing notice to a user of the booking service that new or continuing use of such booking service as a host constitutes consent to such disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308241\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/60/#p61\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that the Ordinance's consent provision is unavailing under the SCA because the Ordinance does not provide for\n   <em>\n    valid\n   </em>\n   consent. Instead, it forces plaintiffs to require that all users consent to the disclosure of their information as a condition of using plaintiffs' websites.

As the City notes, plaintiffs have not pled facts supporting their claim that hosts would feel coerced to consent to the disclosure of the information covered by the Ordinance. On the contrary, both\n   Airbnb and HomeAway\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   condition use of their services on hosts accepting privacy policies that, among other things, notify hosts that the information they provide may be disclosed to governmental authorities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Airbnb Privacy Policy \u00a7 3.5. (\"Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may disclose your information, including personal information, to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary ... to comply with our legal obligations ....\"); HomeAway Privacy Policy at 3 (\"We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, or where we are permitted (or believe in good faith that we are required) to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a request by a law enforcement or governmental authority ....\"). Hosts are required to accept these terms as a condition of using either company's services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countryman Decl. \u00b6 5; Furlong Decl. \u00b6 13. Plaintiffs presumably do not mean to suggest that their own terms and conditions are invalid because users are coerced to accede to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In light of the clear languages of these privacy policies, plaintiffs' terms of service appear themselves to establish effective user consent to the possibility that information will be disclosed to governmental entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Yahoo Mail Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4208386\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1016/#p1029\">\n    7 F.Supp.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1029 (N.D.

First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs challenge the Ordinance on First Amendment grounds. They argue that the Ordinance unconstitutionally requires them to adopt and communicate a message that they would not choose to communicate absent government coercion: that hosts must consent to the disclosure of their personal data to the City and that use of the platform constitutes consent\n   to such a disclosure. Airbnb Br. at 28-29. In making this claim, plaintiffs note that the disclosure will be to an agency, OSE, that, in plaintiffs' view, is \"widely known for targeting hosts.\" Airbnb Br. at 28-29. As HomeAway therefore puts the point, it (and Airbnb) \"do[ ] not want to use [their] speech to serve as the City's enforcement arm.\" HomeAway Br. at 20. Plaintiffs further argue that the Ordinance regulates the content of speech, and the City therefore bears the burden of showing that the Ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests. The City, for its part, argues that the Ordinance does not implicate the First Amendment, both because plaintiffs' existing privacy policies already contain language that satisfy the Ordinance's consent provision so as to make any additional message unnecessary, and because the Ordinance regulates conduct, not speech. City Opp. Br. at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The Court elects not to address the First Amendment question at length here. Having concluded that Airbnb and HomeAway are likely to prevail on their Fourth Amendment challenge to the Ordinance, it is not necessary to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   For avoidance of doubt, the Court is not, at this juncture, inclined to regard the First Amendment claim as likely to prevail. In particular, the presence in each plaintiff's current privacy policies of substantially comparable disclosures raises a question of whether the City would require anything further from Airbnb and HomeAway to conclude that each was in compliance with the Ordinance. If the City regarded plaintiffs' present policies as conveying the required message, a question for Airbnb and HomeAway would then be whether, in order to claim that the Ordinance compels unwanted speech, they are proposing to abandon the existing disclosures that the City contends satisfy the Ordinance's directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

If the Ordinance is permitted to take effect, plaintiffs therefore will likely be subjected to violations of their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, each time the Ordinance obliges them to produce user records, an obligation that, under the Ordinance, commences in February 2019. The constitutional violation would recur each month given the continuing-monthly-obligation to produce such records that the Ordinance imposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardy v.

Because the threatened, continuous violation of a constitutional right constitutes irreparable harm for purposes of a preliminary injunction motion, plaintiffs have carried their burden of showing that they likely will suffer irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Plaintiffs separately argue that they will suffer irreparable harm if they are compelled to turn over their private business records as to their users, because the confidentiality of those records will be irreversibly lost even if plaintiffs ultimately prevail on the merits of their claim. The disclosure of private, confidential information \"is the quintessential type of irreparable harm that cannot be compensated or undone by money damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Hirschfeld v. Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"167431\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/193/175/#p187\">\n    193 F.R.D. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Here, the risk of disclosure is imminent; if the Ordinance goes into effect, plaintiffs will be compelled to turn over a voluminous amount of information in which they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, or face hefty fines. The threat to plaintiffs' privacy interests is higher here because, on the record at hand, the Ordinance does not appear to place meaningful limits on the City's ability to disseminate the information it collects, either to other government offices or to the public at large. The Ordinance provides that information collected under it \"shall be available for public review only to the extent required by federal, state and local law.\" N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 26-2105. The City admits that, under this provision, information covered by the Ordinance would be subject to public disclosure under the FOIL. Hr'g Tr. at 33. While the city asserts that it would endeavor to withhold the most sensitive information it collects (for instance, the names and addresses of hosts), there is no guarantee that this would stand in the event that a litigated action were brought against one or more of plaintiffs' hosts that drew upon the data produced. Further, the City acknowledges that other information produced by plaintiffs could be made available to the public, including the total amount of fees plaintiffs collect per listing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. By these means, competitors-whether rival home-sharing platforms or members of the hotel industry-could gain sensitive information about the workings of plaintiffs' businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   These constitutional and commercial harms, the Court concludes, could not readily be remedied. Accordingly, plaintiffs have met the irreparable injury requirement for preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Balance of Hardships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In considering whether to preliminarily enjoin the Ordinance, the Court also \"must balance the hardships between the plaintiff and defendant and issue the injunction only if the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Salinger v. Colting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683667\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/68/#p80\">\n    607 F.3d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80 (2d Cir. 2010). The Court concludes that the balance of equities\n   strongly favors preserving the status quo and preliminarily enjoining the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As explained above, denial of a preliminary injunction likely would result in the continuous violation of plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. Plaintiffs' privacy interests in the information covered by the Ordinance would be irretrievably lost; and, once plaintiffs' user records were disseminated to OSE, there would be a material possibility that plaintiffs' competitors could gain access to at least some of this sensitive business information, including via FOIL requests. Production of the covered material may also impose significant compliance costs (if plaintiffs complied with the Ordinance) or civil penalties (if they did not). Finally, production by plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   of user records to OSE, as required, would present at least some risk of alienating plaintiffs' users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The City, in contrast, faces only slight hardships if enforcement of the Ordinance is preliminarily enjoined while this case is adjudicated to completion. Were the City to prevail on the merits, a preliminary injunction would only temporarily delay enforcement of the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   To be sure, the City has a legitimate interest, during this period, in enforcing laws such as the Multiple Dwelling Laws to the extent breached by participants in the home-sharing market. But the City's regulator responsible for enforcing these laws, OSE, already possesses other tools to gather evidence of violations of these laws. These including the power to issue targeted subpoenas to plaintiffs and others. It can use these tools to safeguard its interests while this litigation is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The record to date reflects that the City has made only modest use of these tools. As to subpoenas, relative to the scale of violations of the Multiple Dwelling Laws that the City represents have occurred and are occurring, the City has issued a combined 15 targeted subpoenas-10 to Airbnb and five to HomeAway. If enforcement in this area is indeed a City priority, the City is at liberty to devote enhanced personnel and investigative resources to this problem, including by issuing more subpoenas to home-sharing platforms as to users or venues where OSE has a basis to believe there have been violations of law. In any event, to the extent that OSE's interest in maximizing the efficiency of its investigations would be advanced by enforcement of the Ordinance rather than using presently available investigative techniques, that does not outweigh the harms to plaintiffs. Where there is \"a conflict between the state's financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial constitutional harm to plaintiffs on the other ... the balance of hardships tips decidedly in plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"638750\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/748/804/#p806\">\n    748 F.2d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Accordingly, the balance of equities strongly favors granting plaintiffs' their requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Finally, the issuance of a preliminary injunction serves the public interest. The Court has found that Airbnb and HomeAway are likely to succeed on their claim that the Ordinance violates the Fourth Amendment. Enjoining an unconstitutional regulatory scheme \"serves the public interest ... because the Government does not have an interest in the unconstitutional enforcement of a law.\"\n   <em>\n    Amarin Pharma., Inc. v.

But, as noted, the issuance of a preliminary injunction ought not to significantly impair the City's ability to safeguard those interests during the pendency of this litigation, as the City retains its existing investigative tools such as subpoenas, and is at liberty to enhance the resources dedicated to this area if it determines that such serves the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Overall Assessment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   For the reasons reviewed above, the Court holds that each factor relevant to the preliminary injunction inquiry favors granting the requested relief.

Next Steps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   This matter will now proceed expeditiously to discovery.
